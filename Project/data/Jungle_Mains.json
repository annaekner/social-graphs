That chat is unchecked and you can type anything and nothing will ever happen. \n\nUnless someone takes a screenshot and sends a report to riot.

But once you start seriously playing soloQ it's hard to keep a 'clean' profile and I rarely get feedback these days.\n\nAlso one other thing to note: If you request your profile data thru riot support, you can get the number of times you got reported and what for so Baus can probably find the amount of times he got reported if he wishes.",

This usually ends up with Bauss beating the enemy team with a large sack of gold, but it is not foolproof.\n\nHe makes up for it with his pressure based playstyle. If the enemy team leaves him alone, he is at their nexus by 25. As such, they need someone to match him. And most of the time they need 2, since Sion scales so hard with CS (which he will legit die to ensure 10 cs/min) he can hit 4-5k hp in 20 minutes. This means that the game can say he is 3-4k gold ahead, but in reality, he has gotten another 1.6k hp from his passive alone. So if the strat is done right, it doesn\u2019t matter if he gave those 7 kills early. The enemy players who benefited (Top and Jung) will have to waste their time fighting someone who still has more stats than them, so the rest of the team only has to deal with the other 3 players. \n\nNow, this is a frustrating thing to play with and against. People hate feeling helpless and this playstyle can make both his enemies and allies feel this way. His teammates will get frustrated if the 7/0 Darius decides he doesn\u2019t wanna match the Sion (which is a bad idea since he is the only one who can) and joins a teamfight to quadra Bauss\u2019 team. And remember when I say that EVERYONE has main character syndrome? Even if Bauss gets 3 turrets and an inhib with that decision, his team will still get annoyed.\n\nNot to mention that Bauss is successful since he pilots this well. His macro and tbh his micro a d use of FoW makes him very good. He got rank 1 in Korea for a reason and even after Riot nerfed his strats, he still gets Challenger every year. It\u2019s just that he has copycats. Like all those fanboys who see Keria and Guma using Kalista support without knowing why, Sions that cannot manage his macro decisions or even get 10 cs/min are just straight inting it trying to copy him.",

Don't get me wrong, it's creative and it's abusing a poorly implemented system and that's awesome (except for when it's lane swaps or funnel strategies or mages in the jungle (xd League players are dumb)) - but it's not *always* the best thing to do when he does it. You do realise there's been times where he has  35-45% winrates over hundreds of games, right? As I said in my original comment, when he tries, he's really good... But it's pretty evident he just for-funs it for stream(or whatever else) a lot and that's probably not okay in a ranked competitive setting. There's reasons why his accounts have been banned before and I am pretty sure if he didn't have an audience he wouldn't have been unbanned as Riot don't tend to look at context and even if they did, I think they would still deem it as problematic (a lot of the time).

You can play for fun as there's nothing wrong with that, but do it in the gamemodes that are there to cater to more casual play so that you're not taking away from the experience of others. The questions I raise to people who say this is that if you don't get fun out of trying hard/improving/learning/etc(you know... what it actually means to be fulfilled within a competitive game), why are you playing a competitive game at all? Why not play something that caters to what you want or at least in gamemodes there for it? Why do you have to take it to a place where you begin to harm others with it (or in this case, defend those that are?)\n\nNow what Baus does is creative and abusing a poorly implemented system. It's awesome, creativity should be rewarded and when he is trying he makes it really effective. The problem, however, is that a lot of the time he doesn't try that hard and is just for-funning for his stream or whatever else, which as said before, is ruining the experiences of others because it's a competitive setting, which is probably not okay to do. If you think it's okay to do, that's fine, but it makes you a bit of a dick IMO.",

For me, I think positives outweigh the negatives because this is going to happen to a limited few amount of people in the grand scheme of things, whereas exclusively manual ban control would slow things down and essentially make flaming and swearing basically allowed for everyone practically.

This would let you kill all 3 together in about 5 seconds. \n\nSecondly, and more important, while adcs get tons of damage buff and still cry, people in this sub settle for \"buffs\" like this or aoe smite for little monsters. \n\nBuff jungle exp, revert smite damage nerf, make kill timers longer so we can punish, and remove those bs grubs that are basically just laners buff and give us back the old herald that actually did tower damage and we could take plates with.",

The both of us switches and verses, taking turns with each others vision, objectives, and teammates.  When I track them, knowing that they could be anywhere... that when I walk into that bush, they could be immediately be in my bussy... it's an exhilarating feeling.  \n\nWe speak in the language of decision making and combat efficacy, in pathing and patience... I hope my words reach them.  I hope they can see me for who I am.  I hope that out of the 9 other players on the rift, they are the ones that **get** me.  I hope I see them again one day.  I hope they remember the orgasm I gave them (or at least tried to).  I hope these things build new neural pathways so that the next time they see me, they will know that ecstasy is waiting for them in the enemy jungle.",

Prior to this incident I've only ever gotten AFK warnings because of d/c instances. Never in ranked, always in unranked.\n\nPlaying UNRANKED draft pick with two friends, I swapped roles with my jungle duo since he wanted to mid. I took smite but my mobalytics updated my spells, thinking I was mid, so no smite. I didn't realize until I couldn't buy jungle item. Sucks. I tried farming anyways but kept dying. I told team I wanted to ff at 15. 4th guy was a chill guy from my last game so he was fine with surrender, but my adc was SO UPSET and took my mistake personally I guess. Whatever.\n\nHe reports me and I get a 14 day ban??????? I message Riot because I've never had such a penalty before for such a honest mistake. \n\nRiot Support then tells me it's because my honest mistake cost my team LP,  that the ban is justified???? I was playing normal draft pick??? Support corrects themself AFTER I pointed out their mistake, by saying 'sorry I meant MMR, not LP, but the consequence is the same' , LIKE SERIOUSLY??? \n\nAm I crazy?? Mmr loss is THAT serious??? Casual draft pick is really that deep???? Especially because this is my first offense like this for anything, I'm so baffled. I've played both casual and competitive for Valorant and Overwatch, and I've never come across a steep penalty like this, especially over something so innocently dumb of me like me not noticing mobalytics changed my spells in a casual game.\n\nIs Riot Support really this brutal, or did I get unlucky?",

Draven. \nWho is the support duo with? Me, the jungler. \nWhat does draven do? Takes it out on me and greifs me all game. He spams the chat with offensive shit all game long, post game I say 'draven has small syndrome and wasn't showed enough affection as a child' and I get 14 days. He got absolutely nothing.\n\nIn case number 1 support ticket told me that we all get frustrated sometimes with team mates but leaving the game is not the answer, I should take my breaks to reset my mental after the game has finished. Omega fucking lul.\n\nIn case number 2 I was told that they would look into the draven but not remove my suspension and gave me some absolute wall of text on the things I can do in game if a team mate is negatively impacting my 'fun'.\n\nMy girlfriend got a two week ban for literally typing in chat 'dude it's 8am why are you so mad' when two people on her team were arguing and spamming racial slurs at each other. Basically got told to deal with it in a really sarcastic and creepy response from the riot employee handling the ticket, like the dude was borerline the 'omg you're a girl that games' copypasta.\n\nThing is, in high elo, you meet a lot of the same players again and again and again, sometimes you find them in a good mood and say 'remember this time or that time? Did you get a ban for that?' it's always 'no lmfao'.\n\nThese guys in control of the ticket system just enjoy the power and enjoy saying no, they let the power and dynamic of control come way before any sense of the word logic.\n\nAnd while like in most games the major outlier is not in fact the game but more so the players that play it, riot play no part in making the game a better place either. They do nothing to reassure their playerbase, there's no justice or understanding its just a stupid fucked up system that becomes even more fucked up when neckbeards get given the power to say yes and no to people.",

So to get that every single game and see no instant feedback reports is backwards enough as it is but then for the one time you bite back you get 14 days or something without question and without reason and the people who have the power to listen and understand the situation just basically say 'sucks for you but I'm not gonna do anything here' just makes you think, whats the point..\n\nIt's partly the reason I quit.\n\nI played since season 2, I loved the tribunal system, i spent a long time using it and was always fair in which way I decided, tried to look at both sides of the coin and take whatever people added into consideration and I can safely say without doubt that every single decision I made on that could be perfectly understood to whoever was on either end of the outcome, riot removed that for their new season and I get it, people did exploit the tribunal system for rewards but the people who actually used it correctly probably made league a better place for it, I'm not asking for it back, league is too toxic for a system like that now but this new system is most certainly not making league a better place when people are leaving the game every single day because of toxicity, to protect their mental, because the game is emotionally and mentally taxing, because the direction doesn't make sense anymore and finally because like in most game these days the players wallet is valued more than the player.\n\nI hope you can get a resolution to your issue, I wouldn't personally bank on it but even coming from someone like me, I played from season 2, a lot of the things in my life I hold dearest I found from that game, I met my girlfriend on league, the woman I'll marry and have children with, most of my friends are from league, i owe a lot to it, but the fact I had to leave it and the reasons I left it for is actually quite sad.\n\nEspecially when it really looks like it's not something that will be changing anytime soon and at least once or twice a week I come across posts on Reddit that show it's getting progressively worse.",

I can't believe I didn't notice... \n\nWhen I first started playing for like 2 months in 2020 I physically wrote down the runes for the 3 champs I played lol, but I should dedicate to have a few memorized for sure. It's tougher now to pick who to focus on though because I fill like 90% of the time now when I play unranked since I have unlocked a lot more champs I want to try and can't decide haha\n\nI think it's cool when Youtubers have the extensive knowledge of how runes/items work, so if the character gets nerfed/buffed, they just automatically know what would work best with the champ tweaks. It'd be cool to have that knowledge someday. Guess I know how to consume league for the next 2 weeks without playing :')\n\nTime to get rid of the mobalytics crutch then, thanks for the encouragement!",

Hearing that as a new and interested player is so crushing to hear, but I'm not gonna contest reality and experience. Overwatch is a tragic story now, but I'm grateful to have experienced the \"blissful\" period before it got bad, then worse, then down from there... It sucked to have my love for Overwatch become more and more disillusioned over the years because of my resentment of Blizzard, and I feel like that is only a smaller scale example of what so many people, like you, have experienced with League. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had to look up the tribunal system lol but yeah that's crazy- to think a system like that ever existed and, though not perfect because trolls are an ancient race, had some optimistic potential. It truly sucks that it becomes harder and harder to have something nice and just let it stay that way because, yes, wallets are what matters and the only people who don't get crushed by toxicity are the ones dishing it out..\n\nMy perspective on the support system and system overall has changed and broadened so much just because I made this post, it's crazy. I really thought I had a chance with my support ticket lol.. I really understand now that new players sign up for League, despite the huge notoriety, with the binding contract of \"fuck around enough and find out\".",

(Which most will not do till maybe even Diamond)\n\nDekar and a few other smaller streamers are actually under the belief that Jg is the easiest role to rank up on for these reasons.\nOne of their reasonings for this is how Pro laners can swap to Jg with great success (Ambition, Hai, Bwipo to name a few), but it doesn\u2019t go the other way around.\nSo I would honestly say more junglers are actually just worse fundamentally at the game, compared to their laner counterparts at any given rank, due to the role not requiring you to learn as many of the small details of the game.\n\nBut as your your rank, whatever makes you happy my dude \ud83e\udee1\nI have a friend who has played League longer than me who hasn\u2019t peaked past Bronze 2, and still regularly gets put back in Iron (even after the rank change).",

The games I won I was dominant in, kda of 5-8, games I lost I was still positive KDA, high KP, and still over my tier's cs rate.\n\nLP distribution is a mystery to me as well. I don't want to rub it in your face but for comparison, I get 35-40LP and lose 14-20LP. Climbing is very easy at the moment, I just don't feel like playing that much. However, I exclusively play against people 1,5 tiers above me, which is weird as well.\n\nPeople say it's some secret MMR matching (or not) your rank having the impact on gains but still I find it ridiculous. Even in most extreme cases of \"boosted\" people, it shouldn't be more than +25/-25 LP, it's discouraging.\n\nI hope the new split brings some sort of reset and your LP gains fix. It annoys me so much, how big of a factor luck has in this game, like how are you supposed to climb if one loss negates two wins.",

Flattening the curve means climbing will me more linear and progression more visible which also help retain players so it's in their best interest. I am sure they realized this would also inflate ranks and they were likely happy with this too for the reasons you mentioned, but I'd like to believe this wasn't the major reason as to why they added emerald.

It inflated a lot of people but it also separated a lot of people out that didn't really belong in s2/s3 by keeping them there. That + natural variance in elo range basically means unless you're steadily 500 or so elo above last split - you probably didn't improve. \n\nAll that is to say - visual rank and mmr being disconnected + the tiers themselves lead to a crazy toxic experience before even accounting for these changes. I think the rank system is responsible for most of the toxicity in league - the rest is probably an even share between late stage capitalism and young players.",

People who were top 20 to 30% were Gold 1 to Gold 3, and most people intuitively, or as a result of others perceptions pushed on them, see Gold as \"average\" but by definition they were clearly above average players. Now those same players are platinum and may be considered above average, even though their ladder position hasn't changed.\n\nSo although people now think they have improved when they haven't, what they have gained is a new appreciation for the level they were already at.\n\nGold IV is now around 50%, meaning if you hit gold, you are an average player, and as you climb gold you become slightly better than average until you surpass that clearly when you hit Plat IV at around 30%.\n\nAlso I saw your video featured on the BBC, super motivational stuff dude!",

That to fix Packman would be to rebuild it and they already did that, it's called Vanguard. Hell, they said as much in the post.

An aditional explanation was added in the subheader of the 2024 graph, but with the information of the 2020 graph cheater would in most definitions incluede bots.\n\nEdit 2: I went through the data. It sugests that the first graph does not contain botts as OP sugested. On the other hand OP did not show the cheaters per game and division graphs, that shows that the percentage of cheaters in GM rarely drops below 5%. (And that is the detection with a beaten cheat detection system.)  \nI have seen bot's play. GM might be a rather small part of the game, but in high Elo scripters seem to be a significant problem. There has been a time when more than 10% of Master+ games had at least 1 cheater in them.",

But people called me crazy when i said the acc levelling bots would be replaced by thrid world country 'employees'... So glad you can actually talk about this on this sub, /leagueoflegends and /summonerschool instaban you.\n\nAnyone that thinks the bot issue will be solved by Vanguard is just a naive nortAmerican / westEuropean, if you think you can't get close to free labour from thirld world country teenagers with no real job contract you clearly never lived in one of said countries...\n\nAlso anyone that thinks that BattleEye and the like are even close to Vanguard regarding how invaside they are just because both are labeled as 'kernel-level', you have NO idea about how your computer works aside from maybe 3 LTT videos, do everyone a favor and shut up. Being invasive is not only a problem if Riot want to acces you data which seems to be what everyone believes is the main problem, it compromises your computer stability, and it's not like we are talking about a company that is known for making stable and troughly tested software... Also they are under the influece of the worlds 2 most invasive governments AND they already had hackers wandering around their servers MULTIPLE times in the past, so you are basically giving away your privacy to 4 potentially malicious actors and the stability of your computer handed off to the same company that can't make a launcher that doesn't shit itself every 2 weeks. ((( Like seriously HOW have yall already fogotten about Valorant blue screening your computer for TWO WHOLE YEARS without a single acknoledgement from Riot and when they decided to fix it they were like ''uhmm oopsiee, yeah it was us, sry for bricking your pc'')))\n\nAnyone that actually wants to cheat will just do it on macOs because guess what, Vanguard will not get implemented there, and sure, macOs offers A LOT more tools to check for system integrity/security but League uses a total of ZERO of them, you can just boot up a monterey vm and launch league no questions asked, you could do anything your hearth pleases outside the vm and the game would have no idea.. I don't think they are THAT stupid though, so if bots end up being a real problem and not a fabricated excuse i can see them just killing LoL on Mac in the near future.\n\nThis could be avoided by allowing community servers or an 'unsafe' playing mode but whatever, i guess i clearly am the conspiranoic one and there is no real reason behind all this 'coincidences' LMAO...\n\nThread muted preemptively as i can already feel all the fake challengers claiming their losses on cheaters (spoiler alert, they are bronze and they lost because of a smurf playing on their little cousins account, statistically there sould be \\~30 people who are actually on challenger on this sub)\n\nEdit: HOWW TF is everyone else sooo fucking biased?!! like yall are basicallly saying: \"yeah if you wanna play football(soccer) you need to amputate your arm to make sure you don't make an illegal movement but don't worry there are like a million other amputees in the country and their life is only marginally worse so don't worry, it's industry standard\"\n\nAlso the data in the post implies that they are already able to detect bots & cheaters, so why not ban them? only one of the graphs says it's based on reports, the other ones just basically either make up the data or recorgnize that they are already able to tag the botting accs and decide to not do anything about it... HW bans and IP bans don't require Vanguard. Also the whole thing just IGNORES the fact that there is a whole server (and the best one at that) which requires a literal ID to register to the game, and they somehow decide to show ABSOLUTELY ZERO comparisons on how Korea has (or should have) lower scripter % as a single band should be a lifetime one, even better than hardware or ip which can be replaced..\n\nAlso just make TFT a standalone game bruuh let me have AT LEAST ONE THING without having to run Vanguard.\n\nAlso funny how many people that 'simply don't care' get so riled up about people that do care, if you don't care just go your way... This is relevant to the game and everyone who plays it, just imagine seeing a post about a certain champ you don't play, would you go to the replies and type 'hmm i don't careee just play yhe other ones'? xddddd\n\nThe only justification for this you see is 'every other game does it' and honestly i just can't wrap my head around how you don't understand how that is (a) simply not true & (b) not a real reason to do it.",

Especialyl when talking about Riot, who is known for their buggy code.\n\n4. People underestimate how easy it is to create and how big of an impact some malicious program can have. For reference, please look at wannacry and xz, which is super recent.\n\n5. Kernel level means having more power than you have on your machine. Your OS, and subsequently vanguard, can make more changes on your PC than you can. Its hard to grasp, but its true. If you arent technical, you dont understand the \"kernel\" term. Its fine, but dont talk to others about it, cause you are spreading false info.\n\n6. The fact that people are outraged about it doesnt mean that they wont quit when time comes. We are trying to change the situation and educate people for similar future dramas.\n\n7. Statistics can be tricky. If you havent taken, lets say, a college degree related to math, dont assume that you know math. Watching yt videos doesnt make your opinion on serious matters more valid.

Vanguard had the power to literally see that you are using an account you haven\u2019t leveled yourself and you have other accounts on this same computer you regularly use. If we now add their improved ranking system Smurfs should either be sorted to their rank in less than 10 games or they will ban that account quickly if it is used to act like an asshole. They can even apply chat ban + honor drop to their main account / all accounts that share the same hardware id. And just to point it out before someone tries to make an argument, Korea uses your id tied to your account, so there is no reason to use hardware id that\u2019s tied to a gaming cafe",

With Vanguard comming in, botted accounts will still be there, but in a much much lower supply so it's gonna be more expensive to get back in the game. That's one thing. Another one is cheating will be more difficult as they will need more expensive equipment in order to bypass Vanguard.    \nThe fight against cheaters never ends and you can never have 0% cheaters.

The problem is that once the mmr settles not even 40 consecutive wins can fix it. And the current solution is a lot of soft resets, so by the time your mmr starts to visibly impact your climb they just reset it a bit. This means that it\u2019s always to some extent over boosting fresh accounts and then holding back old ones, just less noticeably. I believe it is still easier to just buy a new account and outclimb your main in a couple of weeks and that\u2019s the reason for the huge amount of smurfs.

All of this because it launched when you launched the game, not the system so it didn't prevent anything. That's why in their blog they mention that it would be difficult to have an on and off switch for it.

When i get cheated on, the user is allowed to cheat for a couple more games, mess with 10's of peoples ranks, and when you tell Riot about it, they are like \"Whoopsie better luck next time\". Faceit takes matters in their own hands and gives you back your elo. If they make a bad AC, more games will have cheaters, more elo will be returned, and their playerbase, which includes the whole of pro league, will look for alternatives. Saying faceit is a tournament service indicates to me that you dont know what faceit it but anyway. Faceit is established and their position isnt contested for a reason, they do their thing GOOD. Point is? They will do whatever they can to make their AC work, and be sure that no exploits are made, because they rely on that once specific service to make profit. Riot has tons of games, a tv series, music. If their AC is shit, i can still watch their movies, play the rest of their games etc.\n\n> Valo has 1% cheaters\n\nDebatable.

There're so many way you can cheat it's ridiculous and actual hack developers will find a way, that is true. The main thing it stops is convenience and ease of access. If you get banned for scripting right now, it takes you less than 5 minutes to hop back in on a new account that you bought for under \u00a35. With Vanguard, most likely most botting programs used to create new accounts will get caught, reducing the supply of fresh lvl 30 accounts, increasing the price (not immediately but definitely after a month). Secondly, even if they find a way to bypass Vanguard to bot more accounts, the time and cost it took to do that will be probably higher and some developers will simply quit, once again, rasing the price of the account because of supply shortage and time/cost investment.    \nExactly the same thing will happen to cheaters. It will create bigger problems for developers to create cheats with potentially higher costs. Not too mention that if they get manually banned, they will need to change the setup or get a new account which could lead to another expense they don't want to have.    \nEdit: Regarding Valorant and cheaters, me and my friends played plenty of competitive games of Valorant around plat recently and we maybe had 1, maybe 2 people that we dodgy so I have no idea where the assuption of 'Valorant is full of cheaters' is from.

I seem to have made the mistake since it was announced that outside China, Tencent has no influence on league and lets riot decide on everything (but i swear I read somewhere that Riot are back in control fully, again, my bad). So far, it has been that way and I see no reason as to why Tencent would meddle since everything is going good for now. As for Faceit, I know what it is and what it's used for, I mentioned tournaments because that's what it's used a lot for. Casuals don't go searching for stuff like that and the majority of the player base is casual. They just boot up the game and click \"play\", however Riot should do something about returning elo 100%, even shitty ubisoft implemented that for Rainbow six, if a player gets banned, elo gain/loss from matched that account played in is reverted as if the game never happened. As for the reason Cheaters aren't banned instantly on detection is very simple.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cADaFm\\_\\_ApQ](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cADaFm__ApQ)\n\n[https://youtu.be/2YUmMFwSXpU?si=OIolmLqYx-XYUrzd](https://youtu.be/2YUmMFwSXpU?si=OIolmLqYx-XYUrzd)\n\nI doubt you have more knowledge on the subject matter than this dude.

What it will stop is some people who might try how cheats are like for 1 or 2 games but these people are even a smaller population (their blog post counts botters as script for statistics manipulation so the actual scripters are less than that and the people that installs cheats just to see how it is like are even less than that). Also they said there isn't many Linux users left so we won't take them into account but it would be really good if they could show us the average daily users on Linux monthly for the last year and we would see a trend of player count going down after Riot announcing vanguard in League and fucking with League on Linux systems.\n Also almost all of the cheats that can bypass League's current anti-cheat boil down to scripts and as I said it's not a big problem until high elos (as in it doesn't appear in games a considerable amount) and usually what high elo players do when they are suspicious of someone scripting is throw their spells behind the enemy so the script makes them run into their team (enemy team for the scripter). I don't say this to say that they can easily deal with scripts but it makes it easier to see if there is a scripter for a human reviewing the game. So the script problem could easily be solved (at least in high elos) by community reviewing the games with potential scripters (the system will tell who in the game was reported as a scripter) and if you don't trust lower elo players to differentiate a scripter from a good player then make it so only people above a certain rank can watch games and vote.\n\n10% percent of master elo matches mean nothing compared to 10% of gold or silver as the elo goes higher than the average the amount of matches made goes almost exponentially lower.

China, Russia, middle East countries etc, have less transparency than democratic ones have. And even democratic ones, have scandals announced every now and then. Do you think its that hard for China to apply pressure to tencent to provide them with more data, or to implant spyware etc? Its not a given that it will happen.

They just combined two statistics into one to make it easier to read, potentially.     \nThirdly, Linux is problem for any Anti cheat developer. Yes, they could have showed how many people did actually play before the news of Vanguard coming in but don't make it sound how massive of a playerbase Linux had for League because it probably still was in 0.000000001% of the playerbase.     \nWith community detected scripters, I can agree on that. Overwatch like in CSGO but for League could be a great implementation to help the devs catch scripters but if they trust their anticheat and then manual review the reported players then there's no need for Overwatch.     \nWith the statistics, bare in mind that 10% is 10%, no matter how you look at it. The only difference is the actual number of scripters but percentage is the same either way. Imagine you're a proplayer, you are training as you meant to do but every 10 games on average you have a scripter. And if Vanguard doesn't get implemented, let's say that it increases to 1 in 5 games. Sometimes it's not about the current value and how that's a problem. Sometimes it's just seeing a trend that it continues to increase and putting a stop to it before it goes too far and potentially loses you money or reputation because you neglected it for so long.",

If you make a bad game less people with play and less people will sell skins. Their goal is engagement, huge data breaches don't help engagement. \n\n>continue playing the game even if they get spied on.\n\nSure but most players aren't addicted. There's definitely a lot of people who will play this game no matter what, and a lot of people who, if a vanguard breach did happen would probably keep playing. But it's bad for their company. Tencent shares would probably be affected if vanguard fucked up 2 of the biggest multiplayer games in the world currently. \n\n>Tik tok spies on us\n\nDubious evidence of that\n\n>people still use it cause its addicting\n\nMost of the people who use tiktok don't believe it's spying on you any more than other social media.

I don't have any data on Linux players obviously but when it came to that part of the blog it felt like Riot was misleading people.\n I wasn't talking about a foolproof anti-cheat but more about how it's a cat and mouse game and after somewhere the cheaters will cheat but the cost for the innocent players will start to increase the cost I am talking about is things like issues Valorant players faced (fans not working, blue screen) and Vanguard becoming a necessity also makes bad actors focus more on exploiting Vanguard (more people having Vanguard downloaded). So, what I mean is League players installing Vanguard will increase cheating on Valorant and the bad actors exploiting Vanguard to gain access to other people's computers.

We also know it affects performance. For some people it even changed their computer's fan speeds, leading to overheating and blue screens. So, at the very least, you get a slower computer *at all times* just because you want to play League/Valorant *sometimes*. Seems fair?\n\nAnd that's not even touching on the fact the majority of the playerbase isn't Masters+ to be affected by the issue they're trying to fix.\n\nPlus Riot doesn't have a good track record of security. League source code was leaked. What if the same happens to Vanguard, which leaks to some exploit being found? All players would be at risk as soon as they boot up their computers, because Vanguard starts with Windows.\n\nAnd these are just the things I can come up with in a few minutes of thinking. I'm sure there are other concerns about Vanguard.\n\nEdit: sorry if it comes across as aggressive, that wasn't my intention, but I have some strong feelings towards these shady practices",

Then randomly starts playing Janna and goes 14-4, climbing all the way to Masters like he payed for someone to boost his account. He mained Senna with a 46% WR, didn't play a lot of games total, and randomly spikes Master. Just not a normal arc for even extremely talented players. Let alone someone who has been stuck diamond their entire life and plays only around 50 games a season.....\n\nKeep in mind he played ADC and Jungle in previous seasons. He just started playing support last season in Solo Queue... definitely something off here. You don't just go from playing Nocturne for 2-3 seasons straight to winning almost 80% of your games on Janna. There is no correlation in the skills required to play those champs. Top it off with the fact last year you received pretty horrible LP +/- splits that they literally had to fix -- it makes no sense how he was able to reach Masters without someone adjusting his account MMR, especially considering it's history.

They are clowns and at this point any high elo player that played the game for more than 8 years can do a better job. \n\nSome examples from last patch alone:\n\n1. Obviously maoki, every sane person will know he is op because he has too much cc and his point and click w let him cc chain you with all his skills. Also e can be quite too strong to control the lane bushes. The obvious nerf is cd on w and e. But riot nerf his q damage by 5% and lower his r cc duration by a 0.2 seconds which is basically nothing.\n\n2. Ksante being omega tanky while having crazy damage and cc chain you during ult. Obvious nerf is to make him less tanky and more oppretunity to break free from his combo. Riot instead gave him like 30% more damage reduction or  whatever and made him slower a bit. \n\n3. Lulu is a handless champ that is being abused by every boosters duo with kog and twitch. Riot buff her by crazy amounts for no reason. Tell me the last game you played vs a lulu with kog or twitch and you won. It's one of the most disgusting op handless strategies in the game and it did not need a buff.\n\n4. Ad tf being omega broken, idk how the buffs even went in, but a patch later they nerfed his ap ratios lol. Such clowns.\n\nThere are a ton more like asol q stack that got hot fixed (why pve even exist?). Smolder getting 225 stacks at 20 mins. Trundle was so op for so long and the only change they did to him was listed under qol but was q range buff, which is a buff. \n\nI can go for days. Bottom line is this entire team needs to be ashamed of themselves and replaced. Starting with phreak. Don't get me started on what he did to jungle I swear.",

Seraphine is in the same situation, just with lower play rate, because Seraphine. They can neither buff nor nerf Seraphine, but they also need to do both per their own framework.

Just because this position is a scapegoat doesnt mean he is in fact doing a good job.\n\nThe game is unbalanced since it exists, and every time they add something new they cant do it right. To me it looks like riot doesnt hire for qualification. It took him more than 2 months to finaly realize how broken support is when it was completely obvious to me on day 1, Not to mention that they were working on it even prior to the release of the new season, so might as well add several more months to notice obvious flaws. If i was in charge there, this mess woudnt have made it to live like this.  They also still didnt fix jungle, its incredibly weak. ALso toplane is still the most broken lane which they still havent noticed. Also Janna is still manace, boots of swiftness are broken, they nerfed lethal tempo recently and didnt give any compensation  for their users. I agree that this rune was broken, it should have been nerfed years ago and thats when i would have done it, but them doing it now just proves their incompetence.  The item changes also made no sense, if they wanted to remove the mythik, which i never wanted to have in the first place, all they had to do was keep the myhthic item the same, remove the mythic effect and maybe slightly adjust them, but now we had this chaos with ap items, the ap items are still not satisfying, tank items, especially mr items are still too broken, crit adcs are still not present and crit itself has always been a problem. Also mercury boots have been problematic, they are too good for their price. The Champions were all \"balanced\" around the Items of the previous season, they just changed and threw in new items for no real reason and let this chaos happen. That is incompetence. and several champions need heavy adjustments. toplane has too much true damage , toplane exp needs to get nerfed, There is way too much Hp in the game, and void grubs are annoying as well. When they get a shield. you cant really tell how much you need to damage them for your smite to finish them. God, and im only scraping the surface of the beginning of this season. There are still so many problems with matchmaking and smurfing. Ghost as summonerspell as well as cleanse have always been too good. \n\nBut i can tell you those problems would have been fixed by me before this season would have even started, thats the difference between incompetent trash and a person who is actually playing the game. \n\nAnd yes, playing Support lulu or Yuumi and sitting in the backline is NOT playing the game. Thats what Riot August thought and said during his stream. And you have someone delusional like him balancing the game too.",

In the old days, a lot of Maokai's power-budget went to his ultimate; A huge AoE, persistent  \"team mitigation buff\"/nuke/thorns-ish type ability. It was insanely strong even with minimal coordination while also having low CD. The mitigation worked for nearly everything (20% less total dmg I think?)  and there was no real counter-play other than just don't fight near Maokai. However, at least his ult was a fkking skillshot and could be avoided.\n\nThey gave him a new, much weaker ult but jacked up the power of his normal skills, failing to recognize that his normal skills are *functionally impossible to counter* (W bypasses grounded/Q is hard to miss but very low CD anyway/E forces you to take the hit with only dashes getting you away, etc.).  WTF were they thinking? we all told rito this would happen many years ago and I'm surprised it took this long.",

The punishment was later rescinded when I went to the official forums and laid it all out for everyone to see. Of course they deleted my thread at first but I kept coming back because I was right.\n\nI was the most reported player on NA server, by a factor of about x8 compared to the #2 most reported (Riot Jozreal told me this directly). I am annoying, in nearly every match even, however I do not violate the rules so I'd pass disciplinary review without punishment till someone nuked my account without cause.

If you don't remember old LoL, jg and support were walking sightstones with very little gold income and therefore were extremely unpopular, support especially hence why they were usually relegated to the 5th pick. One way jg gained popularity was to give them carry potential, an example being Feral Flare. Granted, it was unhealthy for the game but it proved popularity directly correlated with carry potential - no surprise. It's why ADC's still have the playerbase they have now, they still are the best carry (rarely outscaled by other) late game, and that feeling you can't really get playing other roles. It's perfectly fair to feel ADCs are weak right now in solo queue because of its fragile nature. However, the problem with this is if you buff ADCs and nerf support impact, it may have multiple consequeces. Marksmen might migrate to solo lanes, solo lanes might start going enchanter or support playstyles, or the most obvious: support popularity goes down. The question for Riot is this: Do you want support to lose popularity and therefore lead to more autofills (and frustrated adcs) / longer queue times or have an unhappy adc playerbase? Riot seems to prefer the latter. Whatever the choice is, it's free for you to criticize but you have to understand they have their reasons for their decisions and most importantly, it is unfair to pinpoint all the blame to Phreak.",

League is not like old league anymore, every role has damage. Which leaves adc with not much.. unless you play off role picks such as seraphine or senna because atleast u have util for team now.  And I honestly disagree with you saying adcs have carry potential, no matter how fed an adc is they are still one shot able and most other roles can get on top of them extremely easily with the amount of mobility kits there are in the game. Of course adc isn\u2019t unplayable and it\u2019s definitely still a fun role but it is considered the weakest atm at least from what I\u2019ve seen from every single content creator/ ex pro/high mmr player I\u2019ve seen talk about it.\n\nAlso defensive items suck dick on adc and also ruin dmg output, like maw is nothing special and GA is a deadass scam compared to zhonyas, look at crit adc wr too btw.",

I feel like crit needs buffs and support needs nerfs, they get gold far too easily and their items are cheap. \n\nThe only main issue for balancing of course is adcs going mid/top as that\u2019s horrible for the game and you hate to see it, of course it does go both ways with mages being played in the adc role and support role as well.\n\nWhat was phreaks excuse for that again?

I haven't played on pbe, but from what I've seen, I'm pretty sure river is wide enough to make it so the current thin wall jg entrance spot doesn't cover the other side of the river. Plus, there's tons of set up for ganks in midlane, and new angles have opened up\n\nWhat they've done in botlane is straight up evil, but botlane is currently the most important lane, so it makes sense. \n\nI mean, the only lane I see as a lot less gankable is toplane, midlane can still be ganked comfortably, you just won't be able to oogabooga walk into lane without any setup and get mid's flash regardless",

Ganking isn't objectively better overall, they are objectively better in a game WITHOUT communication.\n\nThere's a lot of ways to impact the map and guarantee pressure, information and resources to your team without ganking, that's why skirmish Junglers are so strong on pro-play, they can impact team fight, get pressure and some have a decent gank.\n\nI agree on what you're saying in the current state of the game you're right, but that being the only viable strategy is lame the game NEEDS more variety and ways to play, for that we need COMMUNICATION.",

That's still very true\n\nobjectively wrong, jungle is the most rewarding role for 99% of the playerbase that's below gm, gm+ is where jungle becomes weaker, in low elo jungle is the best role by far and being good at jungle will take you way farther than being good at other roles besides support.\n\n>you'll still blamed by your top laner and their duo\n\nthis one alone proves that you're low elo, the fact that you even mentioned a duo. also, how is getting blamed equivalent to not being rewarding? easier climb is the reward you get for getting good at jungle, no other role is nearly as good at carrying pre gm as jungle is.\n\n>And you still have to put in the most effort to learn your role?\n\nthat's somewhat true, but its overexaggerated, jungle is not that much harder, its hard for newbies to the game but if you're not a newbie then learning jungle isnt gonna take you eons.\n\n>There's a reason why it has the least queues worldwide and why 9 time out of 10 if you get auto filled, you're in jungle. \n\nno, there's a reason adc and support are autofill protected and not jungle, at least that's the case on euw and eune, before pets were added I'd get autofilled to jungle no matter which role i picked (which i didnt a lot considering i myself main jungle), but after pets i got autofilled from jungle to other roles constantly, now its more balanced, I usually get autofilled to adc on side accs and sup on main.\n\n>looking to pick arguments about a videogame with people\n\nbraindead take, im not looking to argue, i just shit on idiots for being idiots, but you're gonna talk like \"big one in the conversation\" while still being the kid that's crying about the strongest role in their elo getting nerfed.\n\nspoiler alert, if you're anywhere below masters, jungle nerfs wont affect you, nor the map changes, you guys cant even play jungle properly enough, these nerfs arent the reason you're 52% winrate silver 2",

            "text": "I originally made this post in a comment response but I'm just going to post it as a thread for everyone because I find it therapeutic and there's some useful information.\n\n\"Why does my jungle only gank after im gone or dead instead of when I ping\"\n\n\nLaners get gold and exp that walks to them in a straight line. By manipulating your wave and being careful with your trades, you can always guarantee you get exp at a bare minimum and a portion of your gold.\n\nJunglers conversely have to path around the map to their camps and sink time into getting their gold and exp, albeit less than laners. A full clear is something like 524g on the first clear, then 344g every clear when blue/red are down. (5min respawn) This doesnt count jungle treats which are 20g for every 1 minute of game time if you cash them in. So assuming you clear camps on cooldown every 2min 15s you get 384g on a normal clear, and 564g on a clear you get both of your buff camps.\n\nLaners by comparison get 562.5g for the same level of time investment assuming you CS perfectly.  I also rounded this number down, but the difference between a wave at 1:30 and 15min is 22g, it increases slowly per wave. Average gold per wave starts at 125g.\n\nExperience wise a solo laner with no one soaking exp, just standing there in range of the minions will hit level 6 in 9 waves around the 6 minute mark.\n\nConversely a jungler will have to clear their jungle 3 times while timing the camp cooldowns to get it by 7 minutes unless they soak exp from other sources, which is HEAVILY reduced until 20 minutes. 70% before sharing reduced by 7% every 2 minutes. By design they will always be underleveled without extra exp from many successful solo ganks or hard optmization.\n\nNow here's the kicker. All that extra bullshit above needed to get compareable gold/Exp to laners, and you can straight up lose half of it or all of it because you died or stopped to gank a lane or fucked up your clear sequence, got counterjungled because you walked on a ward, or your Yasuo decided he deserved your raptors/krugs more than you did.\n\nSo when you die while your jungler is halfway into a clear or want him to stop his sequence because \"lol theyre SO LOW its SO FREE\" and then he comes and it doesnt work out. Hes losing much more than you are, his whole world is dictated by a strict fucking mathematical clusterfuck of optmization that doesnt even involve ganking your lane. So the best thing you can do is the smallest amount of planning and make the gank as high a success rate as possible or fight during the 30 second window when clear is done so its not cucking his whole game.\n\nWhen you die, you miss a couple waves and another one will always be waiting for you. When jungle dies, Udyr takes all his fucking camps and now team is spam pinging dragon up in 20 seconds with no vision while hes 2 levels down because he decided to sacrifice his paycheck for you to miss your binding on the \"ITS SO FREE, GUARANTEED IF YOU COME\" while you're 60 mana 20% health under turret while your laners are 100% with all their cooldowns up\n",

If I path from one side to another they are nicely lined up for a relatively low time-investment and a very high success-chance.\n\nThe success-chance of a gank dramatically reduces the further away the gank is from my current location. Simply because the current situation is likely not the same when I eventually get there.\n\nSo while the reward for a successful gank is pretty decent, it is something with a high time-investment and uncertainty.\n\nIf I'm done with all my camps I have a timing-window in which ganks become the best thing I can do for a short while despite the long travel time and high uncertainty.\n\nIf the situation on the lane looks good for a gank I'll go for it then. But once I have shown myself it must succeed quickly.\nIf it doesn't succeed immediately, I can't stay there to try again. The reason for that is that by showing myself I have given the enemy jungler the information where I am. That information he can use to punish me. For example he can path to my respawning camps before I can or start an objective on the other side of the map since he knows I won't be there to contest it. Or do a gank with a much higher success-chance on the other side since he knows I can't be there to counter-gank it.\n\nAnother thing that I often see pinged is objectives the enemy currently is likely doing while there is absolutely no prio or vision for us.\nI'm like: Yeah, I too think they're doing it. They can because they have worked for it and gotten prio on both adjacent lanes while their jungler was pathing there.\nLike what is the expectation? Do they want me to try and steal it 1v3?",

As a disclaimer this is on my alt in a silver 1 game, my main is currently in emerald and I've taken it as high as D2 last season, so obviously your mileage may vary and I'm an experienced Eve player. Still, this Teemo was extremely aggressive and tried to zone me off the wave, poke me under turret, and push out as many plates as he could despite my commitment to non violence. He even killed me a couple of times.\n\nAll I did this game was last hit what he'd allow me,  clear waves that hit my turret, missing plenty. In exchange I stayed in EXP range and tried to die as little as possible. I received exactly 2 ganks, one of which was just my brand walking up to the middle of lane, missing pillar of flame and taking half the wave before giving a thumbs up and recalling under my turret. Eventually my turret died, I backed up to farm under T2 and continued to soak EXP and clear safely. Here's the results:\n\n>At 10 minutes I was down 32CS\n\n>At 15 minutes I was down 46CS\n\n>At 20 minutes I was down 59CS\n\n>At 25 minutes? 45CS\n\n>At 29 minutes just before the game ended, I was only down 27CS\n\nGuess how much gold me and Teemo made in the end?\n\nTeemo 400GPM 11,701g\n\nEvelynn 392GPM 11,477g\n\nI did next to nothing that game but push turrets and CS when I could and equalized my opponent. Just by being a little bitch and not stressing over last hits. In the end I missed maybe a wave and a half's worth of gold and would have continued trending upward had the game gone on longer.\n\nTLDR don't let keeping up with CS god rule your mind and bait you into dying as a laner. Instead let the EXP god rule you instead. Gold is temporary, levels are forever.",

Either power farm and objective clear and ignore your lanes and carry later. Or sack your farm to get a lane ahead WHEN the time is right.\n\n\nE.g. Once instance I traded a kill for a kill when I got ganked. Totally hadn't warded good enough to avoid a gank so no blame for jungler but their jungler freezed the wave for the enemy top at his tower.\n\nI said to my duo hey i need your help to unfreeze this as I think I may die. He was on gromp by top and I even said you don't have to come into the lane. I also don't mind if you take the farm but I feel like their jungler is still here and wants to rekill me as soon as I try and break the freeze. He said wait let me farm my camps and proceeded to full clear his jungle. I sat in the Bush getting exp but no farm for 2 waves and then lo and behold I got ganked. \n\nMy jungler said to me 'why didn't you play safe'.\n\nI couldn't have been any safer other than not be in lane. No exp and no farm = out of the game.\n\nMy jjngler could have given me 10 seconds of his time and still full cleared and everything would have been fine but he didn't understand lanes at all because he just plays jungle so never has to manage minions. (That's why I practice lane).\n\nHe can't understand why laners ever extend and can't understand freezing or how to stabilise a losing lane or extend a winning lane. He shows up after a full clear and forces a gank that can work in Silver but otherwise doesn't. Doesn't pay attention to summoners and doesn't know where the enemy team is.

                    "body": "OP this is a great post. Thanks. I wish there was some sort of regular tutorials like this on the lol client for low elo players to read (most probably wouldn't read it, but some would). \n\nI think the problem is this changes a lot with patches and the latency to catch up with new meta is lower as you go lower elo. \n\nI am a jungle OTP since season 3 been Diamond for 3 seasons. However my MMR has varied from Platinum to high diamond and there's a lot I notice: in lower elo laners takes jungle camps a lot (Plat) whereas in Diamond in just doesn't happen. \n\nAlso OP there's something super important you could add to your post in an edit: kills experience scale with level. At early level clearing camps gives much more than kills... Whereas later in the game kills become more rewarding. As a jungler it is optimal to clear as fast as you can until ~ level 10, only wasting time with ganks if it is really worth it (getting a kill + turret plates + deny enemy cs + good wave state or shutdown etc or in your path). Otherwise you probably lose more by ganking than if you continued farming your camps optimally. Above level 10 it is okay to group with your team to get kills and siege turrets etc. \n\nThat's the current state of the game. In other patch kills may be more rewarding early and camps less, encouraging early ganks, but that's not the case at the moment. \n\nLow elo players just don't commit in game knowledge and meta to care about this, all they want is kill (ASAP) and think jungler should perma camp them. In low elo jungle is a horrible experience you get spam pinged by all laners and flamed constantly. In higher elo laners will check if their jungle is csing well and controlling objective and punishing enemy jungler if they are camped etc. \n\nAnyway great post OP it's nice to actually see the numbers and the logic. I think you could edit the post with numbers about kill gold and experience with levels, and explain things like when an early kill in worth it (tempo to control an objective such as drake or voidlings or getting turret plates / denying cs).",

                    "body": "Laners see jungle as a PvE game with no opponent. No responsibility besides ganking and last hitting objectives. I've absolutely limit tested 30 minutes straight of farming and doing nothing at all to see where it gets me, and the answer is an L because kills/turrets/minions quickly outscale the reliable gold as the game goes on. So to optimize you want to be killing all of your camps, then using the brief window before they respawn to make a play that gets your more gold or an objective, or donate your time to fixing someone's mistake. The only exceptions to this rule are when you're between one camp or another, if someone is local to you and you can get nearly guaranteed gold/exp killing someone. Ex: Enemy mid is 40% health beside your turret, your laner has CC and all of your cooldowns are up to go step on him. Plays like that are a big gain and should be attractive for a jungler. If I pocket 300-400g and go right back to my camps, I'm now ahead, can clear slightly faster on my next back, and thus have a bigger window to do something. Maybe I can kill the laner at 60% health next time, stacking the advantages on jungle like this makes the game easier for everyone.\n\nThe other case where you could consider interrupting your camp sequencing, is when there is a disgustingly large bounty at stake. Like if bot has been feeding hard, and you've sequenced all the way to level 6, but say you've killed krugs and are now on raptors, the enemy Ashe has a 1k shutdown and is pushing up to the allied turret while your laners are screaming. If you can assess the situation and know you have the damage/CC in combination with your allies to shut that down and run away with the gold, that's like 3 full clears. Tremendously worth and will speed up the following clears etc etc. But you have to be able to pull it off, and you have to get the kill.  I guess even half the bounty if you're sharing with one person isn't bad either. But split between 3 people is just a regular kill and not as big of a payoff since you lose time on your sequence. \n\n  \nTLDR only gank when it'll make you more money than your clear will, and when the gank won't fail.",

Obviously that's not happening if wave is about to crash. \n\nOn the other side, if wave is in front of turret and not crashing, I expect you to follow up for the 3 minions you're going to lose, because you're getting those back in the time your opponent is dead. It's also why when shoving into turret after a gank, if I got the kill I'll try not to last hit and set them up, but if they got the kill, fuck em I'm getting my payment for a job well done.",

But there are situations where that can become impossible due to a lot of early feeding or bad lane states, like having bot or top repeatedly pushed out or dead each time she would arrive. \n\nI had a comp the other day that involved a Zac, Garen, Zeri, I think Yuumi? And some fairly careful long range midlaner. All of my ganks options were terrible, and the enemy zac got himself and others ahead early, so it was a lot of farming and hoping someone would fuck up in a skirmish and overcommit so i could claim their shutdown. From a laner's perspective they're just going to assume I'm too dumb or selfish to gank while trying not to make a bad situation worse.\n\nThere was another where a Master Yi snowballed off our top Irelia who ran it down 7 times in the first 10 minutes making sure he got all of them. By 15 minutes he extended that lead to 13 kills, while im chasing him around trying to get a charm off as he Q's someone only to have his target die before its even finished and hes already running out of range. Then im left to look dumb for the next 12 seconds waiting on the cooldown, because bursting him when he can meditate will get me killed as well. \n\nIts tough to make the game changing plays when behind alone while youre stuck playing catch-up.

An Amp Tome gives 20AP or 16 damage to that ability. Given that's her main poke/clear tool, and 400g is getting you 1/3 of the damage you would have gotten for a level, it reasons to say you should care a lot about levels. \n\nAlso since I'm sure someone will point it out if I don't, obviously looking at one ability in a vacuum when there is a whole kit of ratios to think about is silly. Lux's full kit burst is 285%, more if you add extra passive procs, but that's 57 damage for the 400g for the whole kit's worth of abilities you won't even be using on CD, when standing in range and being alive will get you 50 for free.",

So next time I show up top side to make a 80% play he ignores me or afk farms to troll.\n\nIf jungle has to put up with shit like that I\u2019d rather be a fed solo laner than can 1v1 half the roster instead of a 5-0 jungler than can get jungle camped and diffed by an inting 2-8 Renekton who probably still out levels me and can out dps my fed jungler.",

Everyone just uses jungle as a get out of jail free card for mistakes, often that mistake is fighting/pushing without vision on enemy jungler or lack of respect/knowledge of the lane you're fighting, or sometimes outright getting outplayed because the other guy just did it better. When a lane gets bad enough, usually 2 kills deep or a huge exp deficit depending on the matchup, the jungler may well be the only way to fix it, and people lash out. BUT IT WAS STILL THEIR MISTAKE that led to this situation. And the lack of understanding of jungle's own issues like getting invaded or forced off camps when the top or midlaner decides to give up CS to go fuck with him. \n\nMy point with all of this is, if you are a laner. And you fuck up, get ganked, get unlucky, get outplayed, whatever. That's completely fine. You can get help, but you need to be capable of receiving help and planning when you're going to receive it, to give the best conditions for the jungler to fix it so that it doesn't come at a cost of bringing him behind too. Should be lifting up each other, not dragging one person down so another can move up. It's a wonder why people are so vindictive toward each other given each side's conditions.",

                    "body": "I do, though I would add current item completion to my statement. Since CS count isn't really going to account for total gold gained from ganks/shutdowns. The best metric is Gold per minute when the game is over, but you can't see that without addons. I look at my own CS out of habit so I can compare it to the best players on my team and theirs to judge how well my clears have been going overall. Like if I'm at 100CS at 10 minutes, I'm doing exceptionally well in farming, and likely caught some waves/invaded to get there. \n\nAnother thing I look at every game, is completion time for my first item. Back when Mythics were in the game, Protobelt was 3200g and a consistent rush item on Eve. After hundreds of clears I noticed the absolute latest I ever had it completed was 13 minutes, usually while doing really suboptimal or having a bad game. Anything later than only happened with copious mistakes and fuckups where I was playing really badly. So that became the baseline, while having a really lucky/snowbally game had me done mythic around 9 minutes. So anything before 13 minutes was an advantage, and the earlier that was, the bigger the advantage. With mythics gone and first item prices being adjusted you have to do a little more guesswork or keep track of how long 3200g took, but with Lichbane (3100g) being my new first item I'd probably say by 12:30 is probably a good baseline. \n\nAbout the dragon thing, winrate does go up considerably with first drag. But if I had to guess on the reasoning behind it, it's that it meant the winning team was either already winning, and just aced and took the drag, and that people get demoralized and FF more often when they see the enemy team get soul. There's also the fact that a full 4 drag sweep  by 24 minutes means Elder is next. If they were in a position to sweep by 24 minutes then they were already winning, same as how Mejai's Soulstealer shows a high winrate since the users are also winning if they're buying it. \n\nThe actual biggest measure of winning more often in my opinion is Turrets>Level>Gold\n\nA team with 6 turrets killed naturally has a lot of gold and wide open lanes they can farm, while opponents have way less safety and have to hang back by their inhibitors or risk being caught out. They also have a much farther walk when having to go defend a splitpush if a fight breaks out in the center. \n\nThere's also a lesser known buff that has a big impact on winning games called 'Minion Pushing'. Where the more total turrets a team has killed, and the higher the team's average level, the bigger the buff gets, adding up to 60% more damage to minions and 10 Flat damage reduction, ensuring they always beat the enemy minions overall. The cap is reached with all turrets dead up to the Nexus, and a 3 level average advantage for your team. This stacks with the damage buff to siege minions when you have Baron.\n\nBut yeah, the less turrets they have and levels you have, the harder your team is to kill and the easier it is to farm or take objectives, which just snowballs out of control. It's still possible to lose games by being arrogant and not respecting your enemy, dying 1v5 over and over, feeding bounties etc. But a smart team should win with a good advantage just by deathballing with better base+item stats.",

But I'm also not going to sacrifice myself over and over with the intention that the team will carry me, as that rarely works out in my favor since I have little or no control over them.   \nI could die for Draven 5 times and make him 10/0, and he can go on to int his bounty, die 3 more times then spam FF and tell me the game is over and we're jungle gapped. I don't like relying on other people's mental and stability to get me the win, if it comes at the cost of crippling myself. I'd rather just play consistently for myself and use that influence to make his life easier and thus enable more cash outs longterm.",

In a perfect world I could donate power to my team's best carries, like Kayle, Katarina, Draven etc, and just let them do their job and carry me like they're supposed to. But while that works well on paper, the reality is that I have no control over them, their gameplay is volatile, and I have to assess each person's gameplay and skill level individually per game. I've had games where I put my botlane into an enormous advantage, like a 12/0 ADC. You'd think with a huge item lead they would go on to play careful, push their advantage and overwhelm their opponent, but instead they overpush, take bad fights, try to 1v5, and by the end of the game that 12/0 is now 12/12. \n\nI can't count on randoms I just met to preserve their leads or play well consistently. In fact when it comes to giving someone a lead, I actually feel more confident when it's a tank who gets ahead, because the extra stats they buy are all defensive and they have more time to clue in and back off before they die. They won't carry, but they'll last longer than the ADC/Midlaner with an ego thinking 500AP/AD will help them live through a malphite Yasuo R combo.\n\nBy focusing on yourself, barring you're playing a champ that either kills quickly, or pushes turrets quickly, you have a much bigger influence on the game. So I can understand if you're viewing this through a lense of say, Rammus, or Ivern who are playing a more supportive role and can't do those things as easily on their own. It's the same reason that when I play support, even though I really enjoy playing Nami or Soraka and watching healthbars go up, I'm better off playing Lux and snowballing myself to take people off the map. It removes an element of randomness.\n\n>Giving first tower\n\nI'd treat this situation like a gank, if it's possible to save the tower for the next minute, and guard it long enough for people to defend it, and its not a long walk away, I'd do it. But towers dropping pre 14 minutes are usually the result of laning mistakes, It's likely I'll get first tower myself before that happens.",

So I cleared my raptors, enjoying every last auto attack. I left the camp satisfied, but realized I had left one small raptor and spent 20 seconds of tempo walking back from my blue side to go grab it. Then, my entire team started pinging me, as my mid died, and the enemy jungler secured dragon and dived bot. I continued my full clear after muting my team and saying \u201cgg, 3 losing lanes, ff15, useless pigs\u201d. Little do they know, I cleared my raptors.

Next following season I hit 80. Challenter as adc. Its perfect to know when to go in as adc and to track all cooldowns thrown out in teamfights and you cant do that unless you have the feeling of every champion. So lets say its not good in short time, but long time point of view its best way to become good well rounded player to switch champs around.",

Lillia is a top tier AP jungle and Aurora seems like she is a different version of Lillia, in the sense that they both start kinda weak but excel in team fighting. Slippery and tough to lock down, Lillia move speed v.s Auroras multiple hops and stealth. Lillia ganks pre 6 and pre 1st item aren\u2019t the best, id wager this also describes Aurora. She probably also has enough aoe to quickly and healthily take grubs solo too.\n\nShe can be good for the same reason Lillia has been as S tier jungle and remains strong despite nerfs. Id play her the same way, just take some safe full clears and get to 6 and 1st item asap. The great thing with AP junglers that excel in team fights is that they can still be very effective team fights even when behind.",

Almost any champ with dueling potential can do it even Warwick or vi. \n\nYou want to start off on red buff no matter what side you get because red is the buff that is stronger when dueling or fighting. You do a 3 camp into invade when you know the enemy jungler is doing a traditional full clear to topside. I like it best from bot side red start, as it allows me to take my red with a leash then quickly rotate to krugs and raptors. After those three camps you just cut across into your blue side and walk through river into the enemy red side without getting spotted from the enemy jungler who is probably doing their raptors as you try to sneak by hugging that left wall. Unless they are a super fast clearring champion like hecarim or karthus you will meet them at red as they start it. Most low elo even up to plat and emerald won\u2019t check that bush at thier red right away. I usually wait and let them take damage until they decide to walk in bush to check or the buff gets low enough to just walk at them and kill them. You don\u2019t want to attack the buff at all unless you are ready for an instant smite. If you attack the buff the agro will be placed on you and you will take damage from the red monster which can actually dictate the way a duel turns out. Let them continue to take agro from the buff and just attack the enemy jungler. I usually wait until 800 - 900 hp on the red buff to start walking at the enemy jungler. \n\nAfter getting the kill and taking the buff you can instantly recall to get your powerspike. When you come back go to clearing your blue side into a bot side clear as your lvl 2 raptors will respawn right after wolves are done on that rotation. Clear to krugs and get lvl 5 into a bot gank or mid gank or dragon because the enemy jungler will be too busy trying to catch-up by doing a second clear towards topside. Free LP if this early game plan works.",

Almost no champion in the game is OP enough to just win any duel vs any champ regardless of situation. So even if you counter a champ you still have to play it right in order to pull off a kill and steal, and also vice versa. So it\u2019s important to follow the steps like not take agro and so on. As long as you don\u2019t take agro in most instances almost any champ can win a duel. Exceptions are things like Warwick who has a heal and fear, nocturne with spell shield and fear, but even then as long as they use those abilities on the red you should have a green light.

I make it my mission to not let the enemy laners breath. I will usually do red into ganks+invade or Blue gromp into ganks+invade. The ganks are really easy lv 1-5 and enemy jungler is quite low usually before first clear. I will take risks by going the long way around the map to avoid vision just to keep kill tempo. Usually by the time enemy jungler has cleared to second buff I have 2 kills theyre low enough to invade,  steal red and kill them. I go down in exp almost every game but it doesnt matter. If i have items I can pretty much oneshot tanks that are 3-4 levels up. Jungle catch up exp means I can just do a clear and be same level while down as much as 60 cs. Also ganking first and giving lanes advantage can easily win the game in first 2 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I start red I will walk straight to bot and instantly gank(need support to have cc and ignite) for a free kill. Then if I rush to blast cone to wolves camp the enemy jungler is still on it and low. Ill smite steal the wolves to deny lv 3 and kill them. In the time they have done 2 camps I have done 2 camps, killed their bot lane and invaded to kill them so they are out of tempo and behind preventing them from ganking as much early. Once enemy jungler is behind in exp its very hard to gank unless they have gold for damage items. A lv 4 lee sin with no gold cant really walk into a lane with a lv 6 mord, renekton etc.\n\nObviously it can go wrong spectacularly but its feast or famine and more often than not its feast. I have a clip actually which I might edit and add to this.\n\nEdit: I added a video example of the pathing.",

Honestly how the fuck can you jungle this season anyways when Riot Phreak, the head of balance, literally nerfed Jungle to Oblivion, as HE BELIEVED the role was OP. Whelp, now new jungle sucks ass, the jungle player has to have a team that rotates to invades and objectives, and jungle can't safely farm or take objectives alone anymore. The new map makes it damn near impossible to gank anything without getting spotted on wards. Every jungle game is now just a team diff.\n\nProbably a good thing you got banned. This game has gone to shit because the balance team is fucking sucking at their jobs. They nerf jungle continuously, but take 6 months to nerf kaisa to where she's finally not picked/banned, only for us to now have to deal with constantly roaming supports, mid and top being 4 levels ahead of jungle/bot late game, and we get to deal with the new pick/bans: Twisted Fate and Moakai, who they can't fix after 3 patches in a row. \n\nRiot had made their own game suck.",

Proper coordination and communication is vital in any team game but especially one like this where five people have very set roles with individualized objectives that are very easy to get lost in and miss the bigger picture of a situation.\n\nJungler is ahead and knows enemy jungle is on the other side of the map. Pings to take grubs. From his perspective, completely reasonable. Top lane pings danger, three times no less. Wow, he must not be aware of how free this is, oh well I don't need him. Suddenly a 2-0 Darius level 6 comes down and eats you alive because the wordless cacophany of pings often gets reduced to \"Wow this player is angry\" Instead of \"Hey this darius is kicking my ass and shoved me if he walks down I can't follow\"\n\nThe situation would've been diffused by some sort of voice com system or even typing but because of the reasons you gave, most people have chat off at this point. Now everyone is more toxic because of it, oh and guess what, the jungler is dead so now he has 10 seconds to type whatever vile shit he wishes to his \"Blind top laner\" Who made a reasonable decision that throwing 3 waves just to show up to a darius about to get 5 bleed and double dunk you both wasn't the right one.\n\nWhy does Riot want to act like 4Kidz dubs in the early 2000's? I have a mute button, if someone starts screaming I will use it. The benefits far outweigh the costs and it would utterly destroy a lot of hindsight is 20/20 moments and make people realize \"Hey maybe this play wasn't the best option. Maybe we shouldn't all be mid as a melee heavy team into xerath and velkoz and take a fight after getting poked down half our bars\"",

I just hate how Riot believes that \"Toxicity\" Is the main thing ruining the game when it's probably lowest on the list of maybe ten things. So much is done to make sure people are scared of talking in a team game and it's probably taken its toll on the skill growth of everyone. My friends and I genuinely play better in Clash because we're in call. The games feel more real. You get one pick and someone says \"Hey we can baron off that\" And like a unit we all immediately move to take it.\n\n I dare you to try that in a ranked game. Actually don't because you can ping it five times and your adc will still farm, your top will still split and that pick you just got will mean nothing. Maybe this is just my own personal gripe with how laners love to take absurd risks early game but don't make any moves late even when it's obvious, but the lack of Riot's willingness to just let people sort out their own social experience in a multiplayer game is just weird to me and it genuinely disheartens me that an entire generation of gamers is just accepting it as a norm to be dealt with. Shrug your shoulders and keep  your mouth shut as the 0-3 bot lane shoves into a now fed Draven Naut lane when you're nowhere near them.",
