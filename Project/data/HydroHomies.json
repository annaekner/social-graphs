The actual amount of sodium in blood is same but the concentration decreases because it is diluted with water. Remember concentration of solution= solute/solvent. Here solute concentration i.e. sodium remains same but solvent i.e. water increases leading to apparent decrease in conc. of sodium in blood\n\nNow by applying basic rules of diffusion and osmosis, the solvent will move from high conc. to low conc. i.e. water will move from blood where there is more water to cells in the brain where there is less water thus leading to swelling of brain tissue.",

So she threw a gender reveal party where she had a frosted cake and cut it open to reveal the kid's gender (at the time). She did this to tell people what gender the baby is, and to celebrate having a pregnancy that finally survived. Now she regrets is because her child is non binary, and because of idiots like these people\n\nEdit: correction, as others have stated below, the woman's child isn't nonbinary. Her daughter identifies as she/her and is just a tomboy. But the mom still regrets doing a gender reveal party because of the destruction being caused by high profile idiots (not that it's the mom's fault for the destruction).",

You're making life harder for the LGBTQ community because it's dumb fucking takes like this that annoy people.\n\nEDIT to answer the coward that gave a shit reply and blocked me:\n> Nice source, if you actually read it you\u2019d realize gender dysphoria \u2260 gender noncomforming. Which is more common than 0.01%.\n\nLet's say it's 1%, it's still a small enough anomaly for you to stfu about gatekeeping a normal conversation between adults about their children.\n\n> It\u2019s weird to have a whole party on baby genitals, as the whole point is to impose expectations on a child, which isn\u2019t the point of having a child. Throwing a tacky party where they reveal light blue or light pink isn\u2019t \u201chaving n normal conversations about having sons/daighters\u201d.\n\nNo one said it is. Asking a person if they had a son or a daughter is a normal conversation, learn how to fucking read.\n\n> Not to mention that intersex is just as common as red hair or \u201cgingers\u201d.\n\nWho gives a fuck? Nobody is gatekeeping anyone from talking about the child's hair color, are they?\n\n> So no, this 0.01% \u201canomaly\u201d you speak of is incorrect.\n\nIt could be 10%, doesn't matter.\n\n> And you don\u2019t get to speak for the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nI don't, I speak for the common people who find these strawman arguments and gatekeeping bullshit annoying af. Asking a person if they had a boy or a girl is not weird behaviour, only YOU think it's about genitals, so GTFO with that shit.",

It stays cleaner because you never need to put your lips on it. And biggest of all you can smell grime in those bottles so incredibly clearly because nothing else is ever in that bottle then water. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a sports bottle I (although I really shouldn\u2019t) can go over a month without needing to wash my bottle.

It might after 1000 uses.\n\nThe water bottles use a gasket for sealing instead of the threads. Water/moisture will always get behind the gasket. Mold will always grow. Normal cleaning (without removing the gasket) will clean some, but probably not all of it. How long it takes before it gets to a level that makes you ill is the question.\n\nFun fact, if you look at the inside of a plastic bottle cap, the threads usually have a break in them. That's to vent the pressure when you unscrew the cap without the cap flying off and hitting someone in the eye. So it breaks the seal but the cap is still held on by the threads so it can't shoot off.",

Doctors did a bunch of tests to figure out why and eventually did an ultrasound of the gland and discovered a *massive* salivary stone had completely blocked off the salivary ducts on that side. They had to do a minor surgery to remove it as it was far too large to pass naturally, and even after I had intense pain and swelling. Doctors insisted that the swelling would go down as I recovered from COVID and all I needed was time. 2 weeks passed, my COVID was gone and the swelling hasn't gotten any better, so I went to the hospital and while I was waiting to be seen there was a sudden pain and then a bit of relief, followed by another huge surge of pain and then instant relief......and a mouthful of pus. Spit it into an emesis bag and found 3 more pretty large salivary stones. Instantly felt perfectly fine, and the swelling in my neck and jaw was completely gone. After checking me out and doing a few more scans to make sure there was nothing left, the doc just kind of shrugged and said \"idk what to say other than that COVID is nuts and has a lot of weird effects on the body\", like making us less receptive to absorbing nutrient and minerals, which can lead to buildup in strange place. It also results in a fair bit of dehydration, which also lends toward the formation of salivary stones.  \n\n\nThe last thing the doctor said to me was something I don't think I'll ever forget, and the possibility haunts my nightmares still. \"Be thankful it was a *salivary* stone. Other stones the body can produce are far less forgiving.\"",

To harvest it, and then ship it to another location is wasteful and burns up a lot of energy that could go to something useful.

Eventually, unless it calved at the distal end of a deep, deep fjord, that ice will make its way down into the Atlantic and melt anyway, so I see no real issue with it. So long as the company isn't harvesting ice straight from the glaciers or overharvesting icebergs, it's fine.\n\nThe environmental impact of shipping that ice halfway around the world is another matter, however, and ultimately I would personally call this a ridiculous commodity for the ultra-wealthy to sound cool.

Prehistoric diseases are a thing, but in permafrost (soil layers in the Arctic frozen year-round), where ancient infected tissues can be preserved. Not really a concern with glacier ice.\n\nFar as I see it, speaking as a white American, if Inuit folks want to sell ice from Greenland to people with too much money and make some cash that's for them to decide. I've done a little reading on living in Greenland and money can certainly be tight. It's still largely a subsistence culture, and their primary means of acquiring money (selling seal skins) was internationally banned by a PETA campaign decades ago, so if this can supplement income, good for them, although they largely live without a need for money anyway. Maybe I'm spouting dated info though, so if anyone knows better please correct me.",

Burning waste can put a lot of smoke and unhealthy particles into the air for a pretty vast swath, and is pretty hard to control. If the Canadian citizens and/or government (idk which) decided that the burning was a net negative due to the air quality affects it had on its citizens, it would make perfect sense, logistically, for them to outsource it to someone who doesn't have that problem. And let's be real, the air quality surrounding Detroit hasn't been good for decades. \n\n\nThat being said, it sucks that they are burning fossil fuels to transport waste elsewhere for incineration, as that lessens the positives of incineration in the first place. Still green, mind you, just less so. \n\n\nHumans have created a global system that runs on waste and doesn't care about pollution. If we want things to get better, we need to find a cheap (so it's enticing) way to replace the current system with a green one. Raging and flailing against the people who are doing the best they can within the current system is pointless and only serves to make the people busting their asses to be both green and play by the current rules tired of getting yelled at anyway.....so they just stop being green at all. The pollution friendly system people don't yell at them, so they just end up defaulting to the side of least effort and resistance.",

You can't just take the industry away without finding suitable replacements for those jobs. And those in turn need to factor in the needs of individual workers who will need to seek a job after.\n\nThis is definitely a dumb solution, but it's really not a clean cut issue and you're just pulling the rug out from underneath people's feet if you just focus on how green a job is alone. There NEEDS to be thought put into our attempts to make the world a greener place, or else you'll also end up with a lot of people who are very negatively impacted by your changes.\n\nwe shouldn't ignore the human aspect just to fast track making things green. especially when making things does require time, patience, and a lot of both big and small changes.",

Specifically, it was a post celebrating an 11 month old drinking water.\n\n\nI\u2019m a primary care physician who treats both adults and children of all ages.  I want to give this community credit for encouraging water consumption, since adults and kids who drink water in preference to other drinks (including milk and juice) have lower rates of obesity, diabetes, and a number of other health conditions.\n\n\nThat said, as a US-based physician, I *strongly* encourage parents to look up the actual guidelines for hydration in children before giving their infant a bottle of water:\n\n\nhttps://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/recommended-drinks-for-young-children-ages-0-5.aspx\n\n\n*TL;DR: There\u2019s basically two drinks you should never give a young infant: free water and cow\u2019s milk.*\n\n\nInfants are not small adults.  Their kidneys are immature and have difficulty filtering free water, which can lead to extreme electrolyte imbalances\u2014namely hyponatremia\u2014which can cause seizures, irreversible brain swelling, and death.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breast milk or a standardized formula exclusively for the first 6 months.  After six months, parents *can* introduce 4-8 oz of water max daily, but this should be done in consultation with the child\u2019s pediatrician.  Personally, I don\u2019t recommend starting water until 12 months just for a margin of safety.\n\n\nAnd in regard to cow\u2019s milk\u2026the high levels of calcium in it competes with iron for absorption\u2026so infants less than 12 months can become *profoundly* anemic if started before 12 months.\n\n\nOverall, this seems like a great community!  Keep hydrated!  However, please use caution when giving water to your youngest homies.  There will be plenty of time for them to join your Hydro Crew when they begin running everywhere.",

I looked through Nature and Google Scholar for recent studies and it seems to still be an ongoing debate, but most of the ones I saw showed some evidence for breast milk being good for Cognitive development. However, a common note was whether there was a confounding factor of the type of environment to prefer breastfeeding being better for Cognitive development e.g. breastfeeding mothers may have the belief that breastfeeding is good for Cognitive development and have other, more influential ways of helping their child's brain development. More unsavory claims were that breastfeeding mothers simply have higher IQ, which seems dubious. \n\nTl;Dr either breastfeeding is better for babies brains or it isn't and playing Pascal's Wager with a baby's future seems stupid.",

Like, a law that says food made for others' consumption (like a restaurant or school hot lunch) must be made in a kitchen with certain certification, but then people who are trying to feed the homeless run afoul of that law.\n\nSo, there's a law that forbids selling \"potable\" water after its expiration date. The water may be past the date where the bottler can assure that there's no \"plasticy taste,\" and there may be no bad taste, but whatever tests they run to come up with the expiration date or \"best used by\" date can't assure that the water is still perfect. So, they can't sell it to you for you to drink, or for your dog to drink despite him drinking out of a muddy puddle.",

Most distilled water is fine because it's distilled from a non-pure source, so it still would typically contain trace impurities that would help your body with absorbing it. But, you are right about it leeching minerals from your teeth, and from your bones if you drink a lot of it. In fact, a lot of bottled water is actually pure enough to leech minerals from your teeth. It's nowhere near as bad as the decay you'll get from sodas, which are acidic, but ask your dentist and they'll tell you that tap water is much better for your teeth than bottled water (mostly due to fluoride content).\n\nBut if you were to, say, try and distill the water you'll get from these bottles, which are already quite pure despite the leeched chemicals, you'd end up with ultra pure water, which I would highly recommend not drinking unless you were to dissolve in some electrolytes, which would make it not only taste better, they'd allow your body to absorb it better. In addition to leeching minerals, pure water causes issues with cellular osmosis and can damage and destroy cells. If you drank enough it could even give you diarrhea or cause vomiting.\n\nIf you want to know more, Google what happens if you drink ultra pure water, the science is actually quite interesting.\n\nTldr; drinking water distilled from a normal source such as tap or well water isn't significantly harmful due to trace impurities that come through with the water. Don't ever distill purified water though, you might end up with water that is pure enough to be harmful.",

                    "body": "Whoa, chill please, this isn't a personal attack, we're all hydro homies here; I'm not trying to insult you or distilled water. I also never made any comments debating whether you get minerals from other sources or whether it tastes better or worse. I personally agree that distilled water tastes good. But the question is whether drinking distilled water is bad for your teeth and bones, and the science is quite clear on that.\n\nWater is indeed a strong solvent, and that becomes more pronounced as its purity increases. As I mentioned earlier, pure water can disrupt cell membranes due to osmosis, though this typically only becomes an issue if you drink large amounts of ultra-pure water at once, which could lead to an electrolyte imbalance. However, when it comes to your teeth, the effect of pure water is more direct. Distilled water lacks the minerals that tap water has, particularly fluoride, which is beneficial for dental health. Over time, drinking only distilled water could slightly increase the risk of demineralization of teeth, though it's less harmful than acidic drinks like soda.\n\nI noticed that your response seemed to suggest that I was arguing that distilled water would ruin your health or that you must rely solely on water for your minerals, but that's not what I'm saying. While it's true that you get minerals from other sources, water also plays a role, especially in maintaining dental health. Tap water, particularly fluoridated water, helps to remineralize teeth, which distilled water does not do. This isn't an attack on the taste of distilled water but a reflection of the broader scientific consensus.\n\nThe question of whether distilled water will harm your bones is a bit more complex. While distilled water theoretically could have a slight effect on mineral balance if consumed exclusively, the body regulates bone health through mechanisms far more robust than just the type of water you drink. Most of the minerals you need for bone health come from your diet, not water. However, drinking pure water with meals might affect nutrient absorption slightly, but this effect is generally minimal unless you're consuming large quantities of ultra-pure water.\n\nRegarding what municipal water leaves behind after boiling, I'm sure you're aware that those solids are minerals, many of which are beneficial in small amounts. Bottled water, particularly that labeled as \"purified\" or \"distilled,\" is already very pure and free of many contaminants. Further distillation might make it marginally purer, but that level of purity isn't necessary for drinking, and as we've discussed, it might actually be less beneficial than mineralized water, especially for your teeth.\n\nI also want to touch on the idea that distilled water is the \"best\" water simply because it's the most pure. While purity is certainly important in many contexts, it's not the only factor that determines whether water is ideal for daily hydration. This is where the argument falls into an \"appeal to purity\" (heh, purity) fallacy, assuming that more pure automatically means better. In reality, water with trace minerals can actually be more beneficial for our health, and depending on the minerals in question may actually taste even better (for example, coca cola makes their water extra pure, then actually adds minerals back for taste).\n\nSo, while distilled water isn't dangerous in normal amounts, it's not necessarily the \"best\" option for daily hydration, especially considering the potential impacts on dental health. If you enjoy the taste, that's great\u2014but to say that it's not bad for you would be incorrect when science would recommend consuming it with other sources of minerals or occasional consumption of mineralized water.",

At around 6 months, babies can have small amounts of water, but this should not replace milk feeds. Up to 1 year of age, babies\u2019 primary nutrition should be from breast milk or formula.\n\n2. Caregivers can introduce water into the baby\u2019s diet with meals at about 6 months of age.\n\nSounds to me like water is not necessary, it\u2019s optional, which contradicts what you said. There\u2019s no \u201csupposed to\u201d or \u201cnot supposed to\u201d as long as a baby is still getting milk or formula and is not exceeding the daily limit of water intake. Instead it seems to me like it\u2019s just a matter of \u201cyou can introduce it to them if you want\u201d.",

We send you a prepaid shipping label, you ship us the cans. \n\nWe'd have the lab run testing for **metals & minerals, VOCs** and **HPC** (a way to measure microbial activity). Those are the most likely contaminants in such a can that are worth testing for. But this is seriously just our best guess; we don't test 70 year old water cans every day. :-) \n\nWe'll cover all the costs and release the full lab report here for all to see when it's ready. \n\nHow's that?   \n\n\nShoot me a PM and we'll handle the rest if you're up for it.",
