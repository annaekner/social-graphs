Yet almost every man in this subreddit ignores that purpose and will only speak to other users if they\u2019re girls they can try and flirt with. People who do this - what exactly is your thought process? Almost every single chat request I send to other guys looking to chat and kill some time gets declined because they see I\u2019m a guy too. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re shopping around for, get the hell out of here and into the NSFW subreddits already, jfc, not everyone is looking for that kinda action and you\u2019re just ruining the spaces meant to separate the platonic chats from the non-platonic ones.\n\nI\u2019m not even asking for DMs here, I just needed to vocalize my frustration \n\n/rant",

These men are most often teenage to middle-aged citizens that streak romanticizing because of the impersonation of it through media influence. Due to the factors of the worlds \u201cterms\u201d by society and social media, society has shifted to be more about guys paired up with a bunch of cute girls. Other guys always feel more confident and trigger these guys on here when paired they are jealously showing off their group of cute girls, but since that is just an impression of what the guys are having in their \u201creality boxes,\u201d they have never actually socialized to real girls and instead use the tactic to do it online, thinking that it will be more comfortable for the female system. So who are these guys exactly? - Simple, they are guys who don\u2019t socialize in the standard society and instead decide to take their own path in romanticizing scenarios to take them into real life by trying to overconfidence themselves. Simply put, this subreddit is mostly corrupted because of this fact and the impact it has on the thought of when actual guys want real friends but instead get the impersonation of what these other guys are doing. To the guys sending uncensored pics thinking that it\u2019ll fill your \u201creality box\u201d with your imaginary scenarios and thinking it\u2019ll turn into a porn video that you scroll through as your social media, good luck with that as you\u2019re corrupting the other guys who actually want friends.",

Similarly, you need to find a lot of people who interest you and send them chat invitations and only 1% of them will go along with you. \n\n+ it is easier to approach women online than to approach them irl and that is what a lot of men do nowadays, and you can blame the online dating culture for it",

This woman is giving you what male friends can't emotionally and she gets that from other women already. \n\nWhat are you giving her that a female friend can't give her? Physical protection against other men? Knowledge on mechanics and other household/labor jobs? Knowledge on how to deal with other men? Knowledge on how to increase her income in a patriarchy? This is why women don't like male \"friends\". It's never \"fair\" on the woman's side, so women are now saying no.",

I got this idea from reading an interview of Yoko Kanno, the composer for a lot of songs from shows like Cowboy Bebop and Wolf's Rain, wherein she mentioned collaborating with a Rudy Van Gelder for the soundtrack to Cowboy Bebop. I searched his name on a YouTube Music client I downloaded from GitHub that allows you to download songs, to see what musicians he worked with and listen to them. I found a good handful of great jazz music, including one album that I like a ton called, \"Free for All\" by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, it's a great album by some genuinely talented musicians. I recommend the album \"Africa\" by Pharoah Sanders, he and his band play with genuine soul.",

Not saying anything is wrong with any kind of body type at all, but some men have it so twisted on what the majority of women actually want and refuse to listen when women talk about it.\n\nThey prob ought stop taking advice from podcasts run by painfully single and awful men...\n\nAustin powers isn't going to be my cup... personally the right blend of intelligence, wit, humour and sincerity are always something I'll sip from eagerly!",

A producer actually creates the music. Guess what, pop celebrities don't make their own music (not always the case), they get a big industry producer to collaborate with.",

It\u2019s Reddit. And people on the internet will be people on the internet.\n\nI know there\u2019s the question, well, where should we send underage users then? It sucks, but my answer would be they shouldn\u2019t be on here at all intermingling in the same spaces as adults. I know they get lonely too and school can be hell for some kids the way school is sometimes, but as sketchy as the internet can be this isn\u2019t the solution. \n\nAnd it puts the person you DM in a VERY uncomfortable position to even get a DM from a minor at all.\n\nI really really say to make these subs 18+. Those are just my two cents. Because some teens don\u2019t understand clearly that it\u2019s not appropriate or safe to be reaching out to adults.",

Look out for those who may not know the difference, but there are a small percentage who can. Though I agree with option C, that would be best. Even Roblox implicated that recently. B is situational and can not be guessed of a person's true intentions so that is hard to say if they are bad one way or the other. A could also be true for anyone new to the internet, but I digress. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy thought process is they SHOULD lock reddit and other sites behind a form of ID. IF you have a school ID or some other personal ID, then they place you in either an underage or overage browser setting based on that. Not sure how they'd do it. Maybe IDs? Maybe implants into the body for ID purposes, eye scans and finger prints? All of the above required? Hard to say, but I think a little separation could be good.   \n\n\nWhile I, again, acknowledge that some teens can be responsible and smart it's hard to differentiate and treat the smart ones smart when there's no guarantee or assurance of who is what specifically. Can you trust someone is smart? About as much as you can that they're actually 13 or 40 or whatever age. It's too confusing.

And I am awkward non-Chad.  \n\nWhenever ever people find a way to find real interactions, eventually bots, simps, and cam girls find it just ruin it.  \n\nOne bit of advice is don't stress about the flakes.  In my experience most people are flakes. I think in the pre-internet days this worked as a social strategy because people had very legitimate excuses for explaining why they ghosted you (\"Oh, I was plowing the fields the last two months\").  So no one had to actively reject anyone and no one felt rejected because you knew people had good reason to not chat with you.  But in the internet age when communicating is costless it feels like active rejection, but it doesn't feel that way to the people doing it.",

I made it clear when making the post that the intentions would be to make a friend, not anything sexual, because there is dating for that.\n\nI posted on this subreddit and I got responses from different kind of people, both male and female. Most of the chats with the males were pretty boring imho and it wasn't lasting long before they completely forgot to respond.\n\nBut there was this one female who trusted in me and wanted to chat more. I simply asked: \"Is it possible to talk somewhere else? I don't like reddit chat as I don't really look here often\".\n\nWhich could be deemed as suspicious, but I want to be clear that there are many ways to connect to each other, I said I have everything from Snapchat to discord, to telegram and so on, whichever she prefers.\n\nWe both agreed on Snapchat and started talking there, get to know each other.\n\nWhy do I remember the exact days? Because from the very beginning we started talking, sending each other snaps and we now have 649 days streak.\n\nThis is a person who I now consider to be a very dear friend of mine, we plan to meet soon even though we live in different parts of the world, but we also made it clear that we both are very good friends and that it should stay that way. \n\nWhy am I telling this? Because I don't think this subreddit is doomed. I think there are beautiful people out there wanting to meet other good people - as long as both of them knows what the intention is from the beginning.\n\nI as a man, believe that we men should make the intentions clear in the beginning, whatever happens on the way, thats up to both parties to decide.\n\nI am glad I made this post 649 days ago, otherwise I wouldn't have been talking to her to this day.\n\nI am thinking about it on a weekly basis, that I'm grateful.\n\nI hope this gives some people out there hope for this subreddit.",

I think the only time it\u2019s appropriate for an adult on these type of subs to reach out is when it\u2019s posts of somebody in crisis/talking about self harm or any of that. And even then, I think it\u2019s more appropriate to reach out and give resources like hotlines or trained chat agents who can guide them along to make sure they stay safe. I see so many kids posting that they are fine with any ages but it just hurts me to see cause I know that unfortunately 9 times out of 10 and adult trying to be \u201cfriends\u201d with a kid is usually for some predatory. But again, I can only speak to my experiences online as a minor and now as a young adult. So renewing my faith in humanity tho to see other adults make posts like this and try to maintain the safety and well-being of people who otherwise can\u2019t take care of themselves.",

I enjoy chatting about random topics, binge-watching shows, and just vibing with like-minded people. I\u2019m not here for drama or anything, just looking to have some cool, genuine conversations and make some lasting friendships.\n\nBut recently, I've noticed a frustrating trend\u2014girls posting about wanting friendships or deeper connections, only for the conversation to quickly pivot into promoting their OnlyFans. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I respect the hustle and everyone\u2019s got their thing, but it\u2019s a bit disappointing when you think you\u2019re building a real friendship, and it turns into a sales pitch.\n\nIt\u2019s all good if you\u2019re upfront about it, but pretending to be interested in a connection only to sell something feels like false advertising. Anyone else experiencing this, or am I just really unlucky?\n\n\n",

Sure that are some chill and cool guys I've met on this subreddit but most of them are preverts but my last post was the worst when I removed my requirements ( I know dumb move) I got men who are 53 messaging me like what the hell do you think a 53 year old should have any business with an 18 year old I mean he isn't breaking the law anything but still very creepy. And besides the old men I got 100 requests when I made my previous post I always try to talk to everybody cause I promised I will respond but it is much.  especially when a lot of them are getting pissy at me for taking 7 business days to respond. And it feels like they are exploiting the fact that I have no irl friends that's why I keep getting requests. Which is disgusting that men are willing to take advantage of a girl in a desperate situation I know for a fact that if I was a guy then no one will care about me.\n\n\nEdit: I'm not answering anymore requests so shut up ",

Or in school (Im working on a masters degree) strike up a conversation with many of the young brilliant women that surround me and enjoy that just to hear how the world will be shaping up next.

Please don't come looking for love- I didn't. 4 years ago I posted in the wake of my brother's death just looking to talk and connect with people. And this person messaged me very distraught about his own situation and we just talked and talked (via the reddit chat bc I didn't have discord yet- crazy, I know).\n\nWe blabbed for hours and hours and I was like hey I live in Austin, where are you? I mean, this is an international sub. He could've been ANYWHERE. But he was in Austin too. Wild. Let's go get coffee!\n\nFour years ago. Four of the loveliest, most exciting, heartfelt, fun-filled years. Lots of ups and downs with covid and then the epic ice storm. But we pulled through, all the stronger for it. And honestly I think our strength lies in that very first reddit conversation because we were so open and vulnerable. So, don't give up folks. Your friend is out there and you have to keep trying, keep posting, keep replying. And it sucks sometimes to be open when other people aren't ready for that. Or worse, they want to go right into NSFW waters. Friends don't do that!\n\nSo that's our story and I wanted to share. To keep your hopes alive! If you're feeling down and need a friend, I'm happy to msg. But if I'm not your cup of tea- please keep on, and find your good friend. Don't give up!",

Eventually the chats I had fell away. Busy lives, differing interests, not in the same place in life, etc. Except my now-husband. We still talk about meeting here and the ridiculous odds of even being in the same city. We have no other interests that would've aligned and brought us together (Except maybe our love of pets). I'm into gardening, plant based eating, have a kid, and read read read. He's into gaming, loves meat eating, no kids, and prefers watching shows to reading. \n\nBut the inital connection over loss, and subsequent revealing of our true selves made us care so deeply for the other. We had daily check-ins to make sure the other was even eating. And doing normal self-care stuff. Brush your teeth today? True friendship things. \n\nOnce we established that we were caring individuals it was so easy to listen and ask loads of questions about online games I'd never heard of. (Eventually) screen-sharing so I could watch him play. And him being invested in the epic trilogies I was reading. Asking how the characters were progressing. Which was my fav, etc etc.\n\nSo, all that is to say is that I have no clue what the formula is for making lasting friendships here, except that you have to try.. and keep trying.",

For me I\u2019m the most comfortable in intimate relationships with women as well as platonic friendships with women. \n\nEven so, it\u2019s tough because in my experience women often assume men who are willing to be friends have ulterior motives (rightly so in many cases). Not only that, but my partner is not a fan of my having female friends, and past partners have been similar. \n\nI need deep, meaningful connections with people. Surface level stuff eventually bores me and I lose interest. If someone is keeping me at arms length because they\u2019re worried I have an agenda to get out of the friend zone and make a move, the friendship won\u2019t last. \n\nI completely understand why women do this, and how difficult it is to have male friends who are worth keeping around. Good luck and hope you find someone who exceeds your expectations!",

                    "body": "I've never had an interest in making things sexual toward a potential friend, I've always wanted to have a platonic friend of the opposite gender because I just get along with girls better. It doesn't make sense how someone could say some perverted depraved shit to some random person on the internet who is genuinely trying to make a connection. They take advantage of the fact that there is a slight opening due to serious and/or fleeting loneliness, then decide to shit all over the prospect of a true friend because anything that isnt overtly sexual is apparently not worth any time or effort? How do they exsist this way? Why are they doing this? Its basically harrassment. And any girl who posts to these types of subreddits asking for a friendship, they are always at risk of getting harassed each and every attempt at a friendship. Is it even worth the attempt at the end of the day if theres going to be a slew of creeps trying to bait you to give their fucked up world view a sliver of attention? \n\nIt really bums me out that there are so many weird guys. I've seen so many post about insurmountable creeps in these subreddits that I've just given up on even trying to find a friend of the opposite gender(or a friend of any gender for that matter) I just dont want to seem like a creep. I assume that once a girl posts to find friends, their dms are already flooded with perverts. Why would I want to pile on more distraction and confusion, to an already very sad scenario, even if my intention is good, I dont want to continue to add to the stress and nightmare of trying to find a friend on reddit. Also considering that a lot of people try to seem normal at first, then they betray your trust or try to coax you into something more sexual. It feels like as a male, if I end up talking to a girl, I'm just always on the chopping block, even if I'm not, it just feels that way to me. Everything I say is not trusted intill a lot of time has passed, in order to prove to them that I have no sexual intention or interest. And its exhausting to try to prove to someone that you arent a creep and that you could be trusted. When i just want to have a conversation, I'm just worried about how I'm perceived, and I'm tired of it. It makes me depressed and feel like I'm trapped trying to play this game. I have to make the best impression or I'm going to be seen as a weirdo. I just give up, no friendship is worth that amount of burden. It's better to me personally, to be alone and in pain, then have to be thrown around in every which direction by a bunch of random people who arent going to stick around and dont really care about you, just for a small chance that you receive one genuine friend. When there are so many untrustworthy people, I dont blame anyone for how they feel.\n\n It's not a safe place in this app especially it seems. You could find some gems but, I guess its up to you how much shit and harrassment you are willing to comb through to find someone even worth the effort.\n\nHope you find what you are looking for, sorry for the long doomed post but I just felt the need to say something.",

To boot, the opening conversations are ALWAYS platonic. Often, though, it slowly changes, and I swear I'm on the same wave-length as you - I'm pretty sure it's the women on this sub that turn everything romantic if not sexual, but I'm open to find out what I'm doing, besides initiating the DM, which I've already heard I'm not supposed to do, but anyway...

The purpose of making a friend is to find someone that you can trust and build a connection with, and someone who you haven't known for an hour starts asking for private information. Building strong and longlasting friendships takes time and effort please please please stop falling for it.\nSame goes for the creeps, and this is directed to you minors, don't trust anyone with your private information and don't share pics or anything about yourself. Specially if the person has an age that is way too different from yours. And as soon as they start acting suspicious block them and move on. I can't stress this enough and I have seen enough of this stuff happening here.",

I am bored these days.\" It always has the same punctuation and everything. There's another line about being a business major and managing a shop on the side. And of course, \"I don't care if our hobbies match, let's go ahead and have some fun!\" They really are very obvious. It actually gives me the creeps, just a little. Imagine being in a crowd of people and suddenly noticing 12 of them saying the exact same thing at the exact same time. Or meeting someone new, and then suddenly they're reciting the same sentences word for word. It's like a glitch in the matrix. That's how it feels to scroll through these subreddits when the wave of bots hits.",
