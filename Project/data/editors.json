            "text": "So some background -- I've literally been using Adobe Premiere since high school (I graduated in 2005). It enabled me to create some really artistic things over the years. Compared to AVID's workflow -- it was a dream for me. \n\nSomewhere along the line -- it started getting worse and worse. The constant crashes; weird quirks that had no logical explanation or origin; things like Auto-Save actually making the program crash and LOSE WORK; the constant updates for Creative Cloud App that break everything until you update it (and often break things even more once you do); the s\\*\\*\\*\\*y way Adobe treats its customers and their complaints about this dogs\\*\\*t software...you get the idea.\n\nRecently, it has literally ruined my life to the point where I had to switch to DaVinci Resolve. And wow -- am I glad I did. It feels like the day I switched from Adobe Audition to REAPER. Refreshing. Actually works. Doesn't make you want to smash your computer out of frustration. Much easier to use than Premiere.\n\nAs I'm finishing porting my project over to DaVinci -- Adobe starts yelling at me for having Creative Cloud installed on two computers. I'm licensed for up to two installs and this is the first time it has every done this. It's not the standard \"Oh you are logged in somewhere else so you have to log out.\" Just tells me I can't have more than one person using it. Adobe are scum and I'm so glad they are being sued by the government.\n\nThe cherry on top? Today, I was exporting from DaVinci and it was taking way longer than normal. Then -- I notice that every title is screwed up in the export. What do you think was causing it? Creative Cloud had updated itself overnight (I still have the license for a couple more weeks until it expires) and just uninstalled the font I was using. I literally hate Adobe more than any other company. It managed to screw up a project in a completely different system.\n\nSwitch to DaVinci. If you are even having a few of the issues I outlined -- it will get worse. DaVinci is so much better that I'm kicking myself for not switching earlier. Peace.",

I learned vectors in Aldus Freehand and moved to Illustrator on version 3.0. I have been using After Effects since the COSA days, Pagemaker since version 5, and InDesign since its inception. I used the old Premiere and the new Premiere. \n\nNone of these apps have been, at any time in their decade-spanning lifecycle, any more or less buggy than any other software I have used. \n\nThe only time I saw constant crashes was when people ran on systems that were either infected with malware or generally very unclean (lots of \"shareware\", system utilities, and other stuff that could interfere with the stability of a system). \n\nI use Photoshop about 7 hours a day. I switched from Premiere to FCPX because I like the workflow more (not because Premiere has anything wrong with it). \n\nI hate Adobe's tendency to prey on users and overcharge. I hate their subscription tactics. I hate that they are heartless. I hate that their products are do expensive. \n\nBut I have never experienced instability of my system due to Adobe software. Mac or Windows, it's been fairly reliable.",

As editors we should engage more with the forums, engineering teams, make groups to feedback and improve the software. \n\nCurrently working on a HUGE feature doc with 100s of hours of footage. There's been some issues but broadly it's been good times. Some errors we made setting up.

For those that have technical issues there are a lot of resources out there to help prevent/fix them, but like I said for me it works wonderfully. And clearly for others, it isn't stable enough for what they are using it for. The fusion page on DaVinci was just too much for my brain with its node based way of working. More like smoke or flame. And my earlier experiences trying out the edit page led me to believe it didn't have enough tools/ability to not have to learn the fusion page to accomplish what I needed.

But I read all these threads with Adobe rage (After Effects seems to take the most hits) and it hasn't happened to me (yet??)\n\nI'm in AE sometimes ten hours a day, PS, AI, Premiere - my main complaints with Adobe is Premiere really should be viewing and rendering much faster (the current generation of FCP is just so smoking fast), and AI is getting some serious bloat. But going from Intel to a Studio was the best After Effects upgrade I've ever seen; I wonder how much of this is a Mac vs. PC issue. I'd love to see some data on that. \n\nAgain, not wanting to get into *that* fight, but my tools just don't get in my way. And I'm full-time, editing, animation, VFX, motion graphics, maybe 1/3 of my work I actually shoot as well. I'm not doing anything special hardware-wise, plain old M2 studio (not an Ultra), the only thing I do differently than some users is *nothing* goes on my boot drive but OS, apps, email, personal docs. All of my cache/scratch/background tasks go to a dedicated NVME, my media's on an NVME RAID (which was like $300, no big deal). But I don't know any pro's that use their boot drives for media and project files. And I don't even own a laptop.\n\nI do use Resolve for interviews - color grading and audio sweetening, Fairlight is just the SHIT. It's like ProTools without sussing out their mess of in/out issues - really almost a direct knockoff of ProTools. But that's just exported as ProRes HQ and dumped into FCP. FCP is still the fastest editing experience I've ever had. \n\nI wouldn't have a business without Adobe - if I stopped taking external projects, I'd lose half my income. I feel for ya OP, I hope my luck holds out!",

Not joking.** Look into it and you'll see why some veteran cutters are switching.\n\n25+ year Emmy Award winning (non-humblebrag) Doc editor here. Mained Media Composer from the start of my career in 98. Grew into the occasional FCP 7 job back when it had massive inroads in the short form world. Once it changed to FCPX and the pro world dropped it completely I found my way to Premiere. Found it much easier to work with native media in Premiere but would still choose Avid for long form work due to its media management and collaborative workflow solutions. (As long as you took the time to render proxies.)\n\nDual used Media Composer and Premiere for the past decade, each have their strengths and weaknesses. Media composer is the devil I know and Avid is hysterically bad at keeping the codebase up with new OS and hardware releases. Adobe will have software available and tested for new updates almost immediately, but then Premiere will lose link to random pieces of media in your project after updating. That's a level of crazy making I have yet to match. \n\nA little over a year ago I stumbled on an article by a veteran editor explaining why he switched to FCPX and wasn't turning back. It was a great read and got me interested, so I downloaded the free trial and started playing around with FCPX. It's now my favorite NLE app by a mile. \n\nIn short, they changed how editing works in the timeline. You no longer need to spend half your time arming and disarming tracks,  lassoing odd chunks, or opening gaps to insert new work while dancing around sync issues... the \"trackless\" workflow and magnetic timeline are the evolution of editing. You'll hate it for a day or so until it clicks, then you'll never want to go back. Every other editing app feels like stepping back in time now. \n\nThere are still jobs that have to be Avid or Premiere based on client / shared workflow needs, and I still haven't tried cutting a multi-hour network doc in FCPX and I'm not sure how I would like it, but for short form work it's a dream. This last statement might hit home for some of you who have been at this for a while: FCPX made working in the timeline actually *fun* again. Fun. Imagine that! \n\nI'm babbling all of this because I'm so thankful to the guy who posted the article that intrigued me enough to try it out. If you're lucky enough to still have steady editing work, are Mac based and you can choose your editing platform, give FCPX a shot. You'll be surprised. (Just to say it, I'm not affiliated with apple or FCPX in any way other than being a user.) Worth mentioning that I bought a tutorial to learn the basics of FCPX and that was clutch. YouTubers can get you pretty far, but people who are experts at teaching make a big difference. Highly recommend RippleTrainings Final Cut Pro Core Training.\n\n  \nLast thought: OP, I can sense the unbridled rage in your post and want to share that I feel you. I've been there with Premiere a number of times, some of them cost me days of work and billable time. Their bugs cost me a good chunk of money. It's beyond crazy making. To stay current on hardware we can't stay stagnant on OS updates, which means not staying stagnant on software updates, which means rolling the dice on reliability.  Glad to hear you're in a happier place with Resolve. I still need to learn that one. It's just a matter of time until a project with its name on it comes calling. \n\nHere's the link to the site that hooked me: [https://nofilmschool.com/switched-final-cut-pro-x-after-25-years](https://nofilmschool.com/switched-final-cut-pro-x-after-25-years)\n\nCheers all, and stay positive out there. Hard to do while our industry is in semi-collapse, but things will eventually level out and we'll find a new normal. Until then, take care of your mental health as much as possible.  It's currently rough days, but good things are born from chaos. Man, this turned into work therapy for me. Sorry for the huge post.",

I also saw performance improvements when I set up everything optimally:\n\n* Premiere installed on fastest drive (same as OS)\n* Project files and media on a separate drive\n* Cache files on it's own drive\n\nMost of the Premiere issues I ever had stemmed from one of three root causes:\n\n1. Editing with VFR footage\n2. Editing with a highly compressed codec like H.264\n3. Corrupted cache files\n\nFor points 1 & 2, transcoding media is the best solution, and really doesn't slow down the workflow much. And for corrupted cache files, it's a simple fix by deleting the cache files from wherever they are stored.\n\nI also have a license for DaVinci Resolve Studio, and there are quite a few things I much prefer within Resolve. However there are also some wonky things that keep me from switching to it as my NLE of choice.\n\nI'm not a fan of the database structure for saving project files. You can literally delete entire projects and folders from the home screen of Resolve, and there are no confirmation prompts or safety checks to say \"Do you really want to delete these files?\" I accidentally discovered this by deleting a folder with all my work from this year in it, and although I restored the main database file, there are like 3-5 other smaller database files that all have to match. If one doesn't match, your projects don't appear in Resolve. This is a HUGE oversight in my opinion, especially not having any confirmation of a rather critical action.\n\nThe way Resolve caches is weird. In Premiere, even if I've bogged down my timeline with clips, effects, color adjustments, motion graphics, etc., I can render the timeline and then it plays back in real time. With Resolve, once my timeline gets a bit heavier than just clips, even after rendering it will still slow down and not play back in real time. I have no idea how to fix this and after researching it looks like there really isn't a fix at this time.\n\nLastly, Premiere is pretty easy to troubleshoot if there's an issue, as it throws an error code and will let you know what frame has an issue. It could be my lack of experience with Resolve, but I've never got a specific error  code. It just crashes or decides to stop working, and troubleshooting is more difficult.\n\nIf Resolve works better for you, great! Continue to use it and enjoy that Adobe subscription-free life. No NLE is perfect and each one will eventually have hiccups at some point. As for me, Premiere (23.0 and higher) is the most stable NLE on my M1 Mac Studio (compared to FCPX and Resolve.)",

On the Adobe website you can still find the original instructions on how to sync audio (using \u2018merge clips\u2019) from about 10/15 years ago. This method was slow and became infamous for causing all sorts of issues, so users found workarounds by using the multicam workflow to sync audio.\n\nTo this day, that shonky workaround with all of its flaws and compromises has become the recommended practice by Adobe. It blows my fucking mind that they haven\u2019t just fixed and improved on the original, much neater, much better (in theory) way of doing it.\n\nCompare that to Resolve (and Avid) where audio syncing by timecode is both instantaneous and flexible.

                    "body": "I'd say that the requirement to support a variety of hardware is a failing of the PC industry, not Adobe. Yes, I realize that I sound like an Adobe apologist. I assure you, I am not. I am just trying to make a point. \n\nWhen you require that software run smoothly on an unpredictable and constantly varying hardware mish-mash - well - it's just asking for trouble. (I won't go into detail about now crappy I think the Windows environment is). And most software companies (Adobe included) have performed admirably in the face of such adversity. I cannot imagine how daunting the task must be to \"support\" so many configurations.\n\nThat's not to say that PCs are bad. I get that the variety of options is exactly what makes the PC industry so amazing and powerful. But it is also inherently unstable. \n\nNo judgement. Not trying to be judgy here...\n\nThat's why I moved to Macs. One platform, one OS, one interface, and no danger of a gazillion drivers/RAM types/motherboards/BIOS configurations/peripherals. It just works (well, it works 99.99% of the time). Sure, I can't swap my RAM, but I bought an M1 Macbook Pro with 64GB RAM and it outperforms my Core i9 128GB RAM Widows 10 box (3080) in every workflow except 3D. One OS, one interface, and almost completely no crashes or instability. \n\nThere's something to be said for system stability. \n\nA lot of replies to my above comment lashed out at me saying that Adobe apps are unstable. I would argue my original point; they are as stable as any other package. It's the computer they are running on that makes the system unstable. It is far more likely that the system is causing the crashes, not one specific software package (that is on its 120th iteration from a large commercial vendor like Adobe who may not have a super quick bug-response time, but addresses stability issues because it affects their bottom line). \n\nI used Avid Media Composer when I worked at Intel (for a decade). We had a dedicated machine for it that was air-gapped from the network (because corporate or Windows updates would break Avid). It was powerful, but I found it to be awkward and way too much work. I never liked the interface and found it difficult to adopt. We had to sneaker-net (carry) assets from the graphics team on CDs/DVDs to the editing machine to add them to a timeline. It was miserable. But it was \"Pro\". \n\nI was the first to pioneer the use of FCP7 when it was released. I LOVED IT!!! Not just the cleanliness of the MacOS, but the ease of use, responsive updates, stability, and the fact that we could safely have Adobe's Creative Suite (CS2? CS3?) on the machine simultaneously. It sped up workflow and was a HUGE gain for the department - and for pennies on the dollar compared to our AVID contract. \n\nI'll never look back.",

I prefer mining great performances, creating emotional ups and downs, and restructuring scenes to find the best and most efficient way to generate some kind of emotional arc for the audience. I prefer clarity of story, continuity of shots, and concise scenes. I've spent my career focused on these elements, which is why from time to time I'm chosen to lead a team of editors, or sometimes I even get to be creative director/story producer.

I've spent 15 years dead set on being a narrative editor (which is what I call it to differentiate it from general editing). But, i was forced to open up my services in 2020 due to the dumpster fire that is the market, and i've changed my mind about this.\n\nMy take: you are right, but clients dont really care how you define \"editing\", they just want to be done with this video. Im there to help them get there. I dont do color, sound, graphics, design or VFX, but I understand the process, way better than my EP at least. And i've interacted with the people who do do those things. I could probably brief them on the project better than anyone... *I know enough to be helpful.*\n\nMy current answer for when a client starts asking for stuff that wasnt agreed upon is: sure, lets talk. It will probably take more time and/or more money. It might involve calling someone else with specific expertise. Im happy to recommend someone from my own network, help negotiate a price, do some coordinating and supervising - *for a price.*\n\nIf its not something big/specific enough to call an expert (meaning im doing it myself), its coming out of our agreed upon timeframe. That means less time editing, more time doing whatever it is they need. If that requires more time than we agreed upon, then lets negotiate what that extra fee is going to be.\n\nI do this only with stuff im comfortable in. Basically just postproduction.

But my bread and butter is editing and with those extra skills, I am able to stand out from the majority who only know editing. So should you learn motion graphics? Not really if you don't want to but having some knowledge of it helps your editing capabilities. I used to hate photoshop but forced myself to learn it since some jobs require retouching. I got pretty good eventually but it took time. So gradually learn motion graphics even if only the basic stuff. It'll pay off eventually.",

I will deliver, more than you expect and much less of what you do not want. If you demand more, then my invoice will be interesting, and my retirement sooner. \n\nI have my colourist craft. It took effort to learn it, to earn it! The biggest of all being, not allowing myself to be distracted by all of the other creative opportunities. You do not want my opinion on the cut, the audio, the pace, or the script, you want me to deliver tone, hue contrast and feel to match your intent -preferably not at odds with your DP\u2019s interpretation (that costs extra). The more I have to correct the less of what you want will be delivered. That is the way of it. \nAny editor can fiddle with the knobs, sliders and curves but just as I can mangle superb audio, they can mangle a good image by doing far too much fiddling in the wrong areas of the image. \n\nI will and can do almost anything is a range of disciplines that would baffle most corporate Human resource managers (and has). I could teach a master class on survival beyond the limits in several contexts of life illustrated by scars and history. Routinely surviving \u201cthe impossible\u201d to stand on the mountain to enjoy the view. \n\nBut I have no significant interest, inspiration, or motivation beyond my colour grading craft. If you want to employ someone like me to do a job that doesn\u2019t inspire, the results will be not especially inspiring, and the cost to your production value immeasurable. In the meantime, my survival is entirely sorted, I will not be going hungry, or homeless even if I have no paid work. I work because I choose to. If not I will continue playing with refining the grades on those pet projects I choose to keep me occupied. Maybe one of them is yours.  If so, be assured it\u2019s in good hands.",

But the SEO/Metrics stuff is just frustrating, because it feels so obviously like they're asking for too much.\n\nThing is, if someone is asking a *video editor* to manage the SEO/Metrics/Marketing stuff then you need to reframe it in your mind. They aren't asking if you are a SEO professional, but if you can do what they think of as SEO/Metrics stuff, which basically means help them know if their video is getting traction and make sure it goes to the right places.\n\nWhenever someone asks for some off-the-wall nonsense it's usually because they don't know what it is either. You can often bluff it back.\n\n\"Well, I know how to manage the SEO needs of a personal project, but for something like this for your company I'd need to be in contact with whoever manages your marketing front-end stuff.\" Which is true, you can't check the metrics if you don't have the dashboad or their account.\n\nI've had people ask for stuff that they profoundly wouldn't want done, but sometimes you can't convince them, especially if they know a lot less than you.

People are much more likely to post \"I lost everything my life sucks\" than \"things are pretty good right now, same old same old. i ate cereal this morning\". People post when they have an incentive to post, whether that be something positive or negative. And with the industry bleeding the way it is right now, it just causes us to have a very concentrated dose of editors who got shafted by the current state of things.\n\nLike yeah, we're not in a great spot right now, but that also depends a lot on what type of work you're doing exactly and where you're based. The industry isn't dying as a whole, it's just changing. The profession isn't going anywhere, and even narrative work will bounce back eventually and as long as you're willing to adapt and evolve with the profession, as well as maybe keep a backup plan in mind if you decide you don't want to deal with the stress and uncertainties anymore, you should be fine I think.\n\nOr maybe I'm just yapping and have no idea what I'm talking about idk, I'm 23 and I cannot be trusted with adult responsibilities.",

When I was your age, there was a writer\u2019s strike and financial crisis that caused the industry to come to a grinding halt. Sound familiar? It should, but the year was 2008 that time. It was tough finding a gig in the industry as a fresh-faced film grad with little real world experience, so I worked in insurance for the first 3 years after college. It felt horrible at the time, like I failed and my career was doomed before it started. I eventually found work in the industry when the economy rebounded and market forces in the field shifted for the better. I\u2019ve been laid off twice from jobs in the time since. Each time I just kept trudging ahead even if the future felt uncertain, the only reason being because I loved post and the craft. I couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything else but I\u2019d be lying if I said I did not want to give up in the face of such obstacles, every single time. \n\nToday, I\u2019m a staff editor at a large creative agency, but I still keep my reel up to date. My point is, market forces are always going to be variable. My advice is when times are good, you should be prepared for when they\u2019ll be bad; by the same token, when times are bad, you should stay prepared to seize any opportunities that may arise when times finally improve. I\u2019d also recommend abstaining from reading too much of the gloom online - you\u2019re already down about it, justifiably so, but there\u2019s no need to put yourself through more discouragement. If you love the craft, keep cutting, even if it\u2019s personal projects, online learning, or just for fun.",

I know a lot of older editors that aren't getting work at all and it's like the apocalypse for them. However, I've been with them for a good portion of their careers and know that they refused to learn any new skills, push past their comfort zone, and frankly never improved. So a decade later, those editors are obsolete. \n\nI'm 38 and started my career at 20, so 18 years in. I make anywhere from $95k - $150k per year. Working in Texas. I have a full-time job for a post house that does mostly TV ads and a lot of digital ads these days. Then, I supplement that by doing corporate stuff and a lot of education modules over the last few years because it pays well, theres seemingly infinite work and its super easy with low stress deadlines. From my perspective, the career is going just fine, and I'm still getting busier each year. The key is that the work has never stayed the same. If I had decided that I did this one thing, I'd be broke and probably working some retail job. \n\nMy advice for anyone just starting is keep learning and improving. Don't lock yourself in with software, style, work.",

I volunteered for some intern work at a sports academy with the idea that it would give projects to work on that I could then share to show case my abilities. \n\nAfter a few weeks of that I started doing paid work for various companies that sponsored the sport academy. Then a new sponsor came in that was also in talks with a production company that were starting a low budget tv show. Through networking I got friendly with the dop of the show and got a gig as an assistant editor. Later on I would go on full time with that production company shooting and editing.\n\nThe after a few years of that I decided that I needed to pivot and I started freelancing. Through networking again I got connected with a internal marketing manager at a pharmaceutical company. I understood what the opportunity meant as a way of earning good money so I bent over backwards to deliver a quality product. That was over 10 years ago. Some years I would get 1-2 months of work off them other years 4-6 months. \n\nI got connected with a few big agencies in Sydney that after only a few projects gave me 10-20+ new contacts. That lead to the two tv shows I now edit. \n\nWhenever I'm seeing a big gap in the calendar I simply start calling people out of the list of so many contacts that I have acquired over the years. I'm not calling to ask for work. I'm calling to genuinely connect and see how they are doing, chat about new trends and gear or to ask for a recommendation on something. There are lots of people in the industry and youre not relevant if your not constantly reminding people that you are there. And it works both ways. When I'm too busy I always have people that I have built a great working relationship, that I trust, that I can rely on.",

The experience and contacts they have don't go away just because the current environment is bad. It's still possible to stay in contact, do some sort of work, even if they have to produce it themselves, while they find alternative incomes to bridge this time frame. \n\nLosing one's home is a matter of financial strategy. If you live off what you make, you aren't prepared for the vagaries of the business, whether you own or not. I was counseled to have one year's expenses in the bank before I started freelancing. I didn't wait that long, but I have always maintained as much 'say no to bad jobs' money as I could, and it served me very well especially when the tide went out.  When I got aged out and eventually sold the home I raised my kids in, it made me a lot of money, and paid for exploring the choices available to me. \n\nIdentifying yourself by your employer, or your property, instead of your skills and your family is not conducive to a long arc of satisfaction nor peace of mind.  I am not suggesting these are trivial issues, but I am saying there is a constructive context in which to view current circumstances. Anyone who can figure out the complexities of constructing a documentary story from a bunch of random footage can construct a better narrative for themselves than this. \n\nI highly recommend looking at what is growing, how that sector uses moving pictures and tap that. THe money may not be as good, but it's an application of the editing skill. \n\nAmong the things I did when work was slow- bought and sold sports cars- LA has a crop cheap every fall and lots of people looking for convertibles in the spring.  I also taught a class at the SMCC extension on how to buy a reliable used car. I rented out rooms in my house. It goes on like that. I never stopped checking in with my directors and producers regularly.   \nYes it's hard. No it's not the end of their careers unless they decide to quit.",

Getting off it is a very easy task to improve your mental health and same goes for any other social media. \n\nSecondly you are going to suffer in life no matter what. The only difference between the ones that are content and those that are not is that the former choose something that they are going to suffer for something and over time all that voluntary suffering produces a career or business or home etc that has intense meaning and purpose.\n\nIf your suffering and not seeing any results you likely don't have clarity in your goals or maybe your just not cut out for it. If you can't make it work over months or years then it's likely your going to make it work. Brutal but true. \n\nI suffered a lot to get where I am. I had clear goals to achieve in my early career. I bent over backwards to please clients and had many all nighters to make things work. For 18 months I was terminally ill and had to try to salvage my entire life let alone my career. \n\nWhen things are slow share your work on social media. Reach out to people and tell them about what you do. Every single job on earth has a time when they make redundancies. Be better than the people who get made redundant.",

While I've been an editor for many years myself, I'm not in the motion picture industry, so there were two things I was wondering about.\n\n  \nWhat does that mean \"they cut it down by almost a full minute\". If they needed a shorter version of your work - wouldn't you be the best person to create that. Or was it planned and you shared your project files with them? How does stuff like that happen?\n\nSecond thing is kinda trivial, but I was wondering how it works with the rights and licensing of those clips for the Oscars? Your tribute video featured many popular films. Would the Oscars need to secure the rights for all of them before that then - or do the Oscars have some universal rights with the companies behind the big movies? Or is it something else entirely.\n\n  \nStill, pretty good work! I'm not super interested in stunts but that is a really cool video!",

This longer version has more and I was happy to see Zoe Bell in there (how she failed to make the broadcast cut is insane to me) but it\u2019s still like 80/20 compared to the male stunt performers featured. I know men have probably done a larger share of the stunts in the industry but they still seem over-represented here.

ALL cut-ins are built \"fat\" (so your limits were given to you with that minute overrun on purpose) for the rare occasion that segments run short. Most times (day before or the day of) a line producer will preview your piece and mark in cuts so your piece doesn't look \"butchered\". A luxury you want because I've been on shows where they just dump out mid-sentence to make time. While the segment is live ADs will have \"back-timed\" the whole show, the segment and the hard outs to cue talent. So the playback will either play the whole version or a cut version. This gives everyone else some timing options depending on what they think will run long later in the show. Congratulations, you made it to prime time - no small feat!",

I was asked to 'absolutely unequivocally feature Top Gun: Maverick' in some capacity, and I thought it was one of the more 'grounded' moments in the whole movie as it features the literal ground in it (and jets next to real people, one of which is a stunt double for Ed Harris). It's an unbelievably expensive and complicated shot that wouldn't have been possible without the stunt community.\n\nIt also plays long (which is rare in action stuff) allowing me to fade out nicely, and has a great sense of finality to it. \n\nAlso, the shot was achieved practically. While they definitely ***replaced*** the jet digitally, the plate and impact of the shot was all captured practically.

There were a few angles, so I spent a decent amount of time on those segments.\n\nI saw the dude a year later at an event. It was bizarre. It honestly shook me more than some actual celebrity sightings I've been privy to.",

One artist decided she wanted to rerecord her entire vocal take as well as all the lead guitar parts. Lead guitar was completely different from the filmed version and the vocals were no where near the live track in terms of sync. Deadline was looming and it took a full day to Frankenstein a cut back together that looked as good as possible sync wise. \nI was internally seething at everyone involved that knew better than to \u201cfix\u201d audio this way so close to broadcast. Anyway wrapped up around 11:30 that night and had to rush to the Kroger before midnight closing to get my dog some food. Standing in line with a huge bag of dog chow and who is right in front of me? Miss celebrity who I was fuming at all day for retracking an entire song. (Phrases here and there both musically and vocally are normal to fix and audio department lets us know what they\u2019ve messed with so we can address it in video. but not the whole friggin song) \nAnyway, I had the thousand mile stare from shifting frames all day, and my brain to mouth filter wasn\u2019t working well.

She was by herself, and I could see the flash of terror in her eyes before I realized how creepy that sounded. I quickly recovered and explained what I meant. She was cool about it.

Only edit to the beat of the music if you want to draw attention to the cut point. It\u2019s often best to sync action to music instead (more for sizzle / promo style editing).\n\n3. Let shots breathe. Hold shots for as long as you need to describe the shot in your head. For doc work, it is often best to cut long rather than short.\n\n4. Keep a bank of laughing/smiling moments when searching through interviews. These are great for injecting personality into an edit.\n\n5.

Often people will start a sentence one way and then half way through the sentence begin to say it another more concise, intentional and direct way.

It had originally come out last year to a limited audience and OnDemand, but there aren't a ton of eyes when there is not a lot of money behind the marketing. \n\nIt stars the late Angus Cloud who sadly passed last year. And the rest of our cast brought so much passion and dedication to their roles, well beyond what the late nights and limited catering deserved. \n\nI've never cut anything as personal and in the mud as this. We learned a ton and I hope our efforts are apparent on the screen. If you have a chance, give it a watch. I would LOVE to discuss anything about it!

I'm not here to blame the editing alone, because the acting was terrible, and the story was stupidly unbelievable even in such a short time. It opened decently, but as soon as you introduced the store characters it was over. The more the characters spoke the more the dialogue seemed like chat gpt wrote 5 stereotypes. Interracial pregnant couple, immigrant store owner, racist rich white guy. Add in the protagonist who's the least scary gangster you've ever seen, he acts like 1. 1/2 mile Eminem ...  I had to turn it off after they started dragging a dead cop around the store as a pregnant woman mopped blood ... Followed by 6 mm minutes of more terrible dialogue, who are you, what do you do for a living? And the guys brother shows up at midnight for a shift that he doesn't need to be there for \ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26 No one on the street heard gunfire? The cops never check in on an officer that's been unresponsive on break for an hour ? Or how many bullets does the kid have left in his 6 shooter after the gunfight ... He also never picks up the officer's weapon, it's right there for the black pianist to grab...\n\nRidiculous. All around.",

He had quit his job and was ready to make his first feature. \n\n\\- He decides in LATE October 2021 to instead try to make Your Lucky Day the feature which he had been writing over the last several years, never thinking it would be a real thing.\n\n\\- He got the casting agent from the film that fell apart to read the script. She liked it and came on board. She connected him with the cast he would eventually work with BUT they were only available before the end of the year. \n\n\\- So by Mid November he had scraped together some funds from family and friends and small investors to make it happen and fist day of shooting was Dec. 1st 2021\n\n\\- The schedule was 15 1/2 days, mostly nights and all cold and hard. Minimum of 7 pages a day. We were cruising. \n\n\\- Everyone brought their A game, the cast was amazing and were on board for the crazy schedule. The crew were all dedicated and sacrificed a lot to make it happen. \n\n\\- I should also note it was shot in East LA, by city of commerce at an old Weed warehouse. The directors brother and the production designer did the build out during November for what you see on screen. NONE of the store was a store before they shot this movie. \n\n\\- And once they wrapped we spent about the next 3 months really focussing on the edit and then had to break for other jobs and would intermittently come back to it and make changes until early 2023. The benefit of time allowing us to make it the best it could be. Not to mention the director did over 300 VFX shots himself of that time as well. All things you'd never see, extensions, paint outs, all the gunfire and blood, the train, the ferry.... too much. There were a couple other friend/vfx artists involved that really helped out but most of the work was on his back because of our small budget in post. \n\nSo thats basically the film in a nutshell... many more stories in between the lines but very glad people are watching it and engaging. The director and I have been working in advertising for about 10+ years and there is never any REAL engagement or conversation being had with the people watching the work. I'm glad we could rip the bandaid off and make this and now on to the next projects whatever they may be! \n\nCheers!",

And as editor I definitely played into moments and leaned into his filmmaking where I could, but I wasn't thinking too hard about any overt editing style.  \n\nOne overall theme we were keeping in mind was 90s action films like Die Hard. Violence and christmas are kinda hand in hand with our film as well. And then of course just keeping it moving. We knew a movie like this would be on borrowed time with an audience because of its fairly unknown cast and budget constraints so making sure that the pacing and scenes played as tight and with as much tension as possible was always important.

This was before season 2 of euphoria so there was a question on how he would do with a really limited and fast production schedule. That said we all recognized how special he was and it was clear very quickly he was the guy. And then Jessica Garza was another amazing find. And her performance speaks for itself.

You've been praised for it before, but, I'll echo it in. The editing. Flipping amazing!\n\nQuestion just popped in my head though. You don't have to answer\u2014did you go to school to learn how to edit or was this something you picked up/fell in love with and just got really good at it?\n\nI think for someone to be able to go to work and do a job that they love.

It had a bit of a budget Tarantino feel to it just couldn\u2019t deliver that hard on the twist. I feel as if it could have benefited if the story made more sense from the get go.

Haha \nThe feedback is more than welcome. \n\nIt's funny and not funny cause we are lucky for the sound to be even as good as it is. Lucky by way of the mixer Roland Vajs. We spend only two weeks with him mixing the entire film. And that is not enough time.\nI'm sure you can imagine. The only reason it's as good as it is now is because we were clear about what we wanted and Roland is as pro as it gets.\n\nAnd as for the Christmas baby. Trust me that wasn\u2019t by chance. \ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udffd",

We made peace with it all and are moving on to what ever we can do next, with all that we learned during the process. And a PERFECT film is a hard target, but doesn't stop us from trying. It seems like you're into filmmaking or maybe a filmmaker yourself. Put some of that story brain into your own script and if you have already send it to me! I'd love to read it. All we can do is make and keep moving. Gotta make that living too and hopefully no ONE project will be the aggregate of your career.",

I have no professional video editing experience but have access to Adobe products. \n\nAs it turns out, we were selected to win out of over 200 other submissions from across the world. Securing $50,000 for us to purchase a new van. What a way to end 2023. \n\nI feel like I still have much to learn.I love editing, even though it was tough to grasp at first. Premiere was daunting.

If you've already cut down your rough on the NLE, just export the QT and dump it in OPUS and 90% of the work is done. It spits it out, Meta tags, and will even write a headline based on the transcript it makes. Good luck. Hope that helps.",

There aren't tools that will \"auto edit.\"\n* I'm happy to explore any tools you like. I frequently search and actively stay up to date in communities like r/editors on Reddit.

It helps transcribe video, helps sync clips, attempts to streamline or automate a lot of sound and color editing, theres tools like Avid's Phrase Find.

If it produces 160 YT shorts, we have to pick the best ones.\n\nEveryone else would have access to the same AI, unless we can keep it to ourselves. I don't think we can keep it to ourselves for long in the thought experiment we are doing.\n\nThe internet would be *flooded* with crap YT shorts. This means the YT algorithm would begin selecting among all of that trash we dump onto the plate. It'll start rejecting more based on post rate, with a preference for channels which post less.\n\nThe crux is this: 80 YT shorts a week relies on a fundamental assumption that *more is good*. That is, the more you post, the higher your KPIs will be. My immediate intuition would be that this assumption is wrong. Any kind of recommender algorithm will track post cadence and use it. If your stuff gets rejected by viewers, it won't be shown to other viewers who fit the same profile. The only way to beat a recommender algorithm is to make stuff people like to view.",

This is possible, I\u2019ve been doing it for clients, and it can be incredibly lucrative but requires you to completely disregard the way true post-production works and rethink of yourself as a software enabled robot. Which I 1000% understand most people would not want to participate in. But there is a business need for it, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great use of human energy to mindlessly edit throwaway edits. So, I\u2019ve set about trying to solve it for my clients. \n\nI use tools like Airtable, zapier and frame.io and write automations for everything. \n\nIt starts with a longer \u201chero\u201d video that\u2019s edited traditionally and then you can cut it up and/resize it with software. \n\nSometimes we run an automation that makes a transcript, then sends transcript to chat gpt with a prompt to pull short highlights, then an editor uses that output and premiere transcription to relink. \n\nThis can also be used to generate blog articles, and twitter post images (which people also want)\n\nFor some clients we made custom descript templates, with backgrounds we made in after effects, then custom caption style. If we go to a conference we\u2019ll live edit snippets from feed with captions to post onto social minutes later. \n\nI have found that there is incredible money in operational excellency selling these content packages to B2B clients. It\u2019s tripled my income as a freelancer. But if I was an employee not paid for output\u2026 never would have set that system up for someone.",

The interface is browser based so it isn't the snappiest and scrolling on the timeline is cumbersome. AppSumo has a lifetime deal for.minvo for like 60 bucks. Minvo is the piece you're missing. You can get 80 clips out but some may be redundant. Another tool I use is AutoPod. It's a premiere extension that  takes horizontal video and auto reframes it to vertical. It still takes trimming and editing but these are two ways to maybe get close to that number.",

One of these new clients booked me on a flat project fee (my preferred method... if the fee is high. It's a slippery slope, but if you play it JUST right everyone is usually happy. You knock it out of the park quickly, you feel amazing you got paid a high hourly. Project drags on and on... well at least the fee is high and maybe you charge more next time or never work with that client again). However this new client's project fee was SUPER low. I took it on thinking this would be quick and easy project and maybe just a good way to start a recurring client relationship. And now we're in that not-good place of them asking for A LOT MORE than my highest paying clients. Graphics, endless revisions, meetings, etc. I should have set more boundaries when we made the deal -- you live and you learn. Just came here to vent. The lowest paying clients will always ask for the most. High paying clients asking for more shit.... well in the words of Don Draper \"that's what the money is for!\"",

Effectively, that turns you into a post producer, not an editor. \n\nIf you don't want to handle that, certainly don't try. And it takes a lot of experience to accurately quantify the risk and read the client correctly. \n\nBUT it can be extremely lucrative if you know what you are doing with it. So many clients would much rather not have the complexity OR take the risk. Let's say you are doing a monthly sales video for a large client, you are a really fast cutter, have their style down pat and 11 times a year it takes you 2 days, there's essentially one revision, it goes smoothly. But about once a year their CMO decides to get involved and blows up a video and it takes you a week. \n\nOne way to do it would be to just charge whatever time you have into it... but it essentially penalizes you for being fast, and the sales team doesn't know really how to budget that expense for the year. The other way to do it is to flat rate them at like 4x your day rate. You will be making double what you would have on 11 videos a year, and perhaps coming out a little behind on that 1 video a year, but that's why you charge what you charge on the other 11. \n\nThis sounds like what u/DD_Editor is doing with most of their work. This was just a play that didn't work out for them. Super frustrating, but that's the deal when working with flat rates. I think their point was more that low rate clients regardless of pay type can be the most pain in the ass. Which, ya know, preach.",

How did you get involved with this one? Your experience (with details!) might help some of these younger folks on how to get started. \n\nIt looks like a lower budget, but by all means not micro, feature.

If you are creative with your locations, you can pack a lot of value into a small budget.",

A few years ago my computer was becoming extremely slow, so \u201cI\u201d (lol) replaced the CD reader with a second memory disk/thing and the performance improved extremely. I\u2019m sorry if this is useless information and also sorry that I don\u2019t know the proper names for these things!\n\nI see on your post that I shouldn\u2019t upgrade to OSX 15 Sequoia. So my question is, should I have upgraded earlier to one of the versions after the one I have at the moment? Will my Mac become obsolete and will everything stop working soon? I\u2019m stressed!!

I think it'll be a decade before we see any real progress, and that assumes Microsoft and OpenAI don't completely screw it up and go proprietary. Knowing the history of Microsoft, I'm not holding my breath. This stuff isn't free, it takes massive datacenters to train and inference off of.\n\nFor every \"idiot\" that didn't learn new tools, I assure you there are 10 who did, and still failed. You should see what generative AI has been doing to code quality in the programming industry in general. It's quite alarming and points to greater issues that aren't being addressed with the technology.\n\nI've only seen software create more problems than it ever solved, been that way since the 90's when we started obsessing over \"better\" ways to solve problems with software.\n\nSit tight, focus on foundation, and don't give too much attention to fashion or fear. If you're good at your craft, generative AI is just another paintbrush to pull out in certain situations. If you depend solely on any one paintbrush, you will eventually be a dull artist.",

AI, especially generative AI, encompasses a broader scope. It's not just a new tool or piece of software but a technology capable of learning and creating across multiple domains. Its versatility allows it to impact nearly every creative field, not just by offering new tools but by introducing the ability to automate aspects of the creative process itself, potentially learning and adapting to create in ways that mirror human authenticity.\n2. People really seem to forget the decades upon decades upon decades of recorded history we have of how corporations and companies behave in a capitalistic society, of which we live. Profit maximization > ethics. So when something like this is introduced, what do you think the name of the game becomes? Because we're talking about profit margins that will make the industrial revolution look like peanuts.\n3. Why would a creative studio need 75 creatives in-house when they could have 25 utilizing AI creative apps? Why would a VFX house need to bring on hundreds of roto artists when they could bring on a much smaller team utilizing AI? I could keep going, but you get the idea. This is the whole idea of AI. Automate as much human work as possible because humans require salaries, 401ks, vacation time, time to eat, time to sleep, etc.\n\nYou're quite literally talking about the most lucrative notion in all of human history, for so many industries across the planet. There will be pain, there will be fun, there will be amazing things, there will be very scary things, but you can make no god damn mistake that the ability to pay for a roof over your head doing creative work is going to get a lot tighter because many employment opportunities will be shadowed out as AI is able to learn and automate more and more tasks people base their livelihoods off of.\n\nI really wish people would show a little more respect for the grand picture of what this technology aims to do, not just over the next 5-10 years, but the next 100 years.\n\nI don't think end times are around the corner, but this isn't like the invention of the camera or the unreal engine. This is something on another level, and while I think the technology itself is obviously incredible, I really think we're forgetting about the whole, \"how humans behave in a capitalistic society\" thing.\n\nAnd remember, we're just talking about gen AI. There will be so many other forms of AI than just generative. This is just a sliver of what's to come.",

But tbh, the idea of jobs as \u201cprompt writers\u201d is hilarious to me. ChatGPT can program itself through natural language already, soon they\u2019ll get past the stupid prompts that are needed for image generation. It\u2019ll be really simple sliders and adjustments that will be much more intuitive, just like effects and transitions have become drag and drop. \n\nThe writing (in the future) is on the wall that a huge swath of our jobs will disappear as we know them today. Whether that means every small business gets world class content from a single creator, or there\u2019s a race for the biggest, craziest content ever, there will still be jobs. But we\u2019ll look back on large production teams and laugh at how absurd it was they convinced us to work the hours and sit behind computers in dark rooms. \n\nSo there\u2019s always good and bad\u2026 but it\u2019s all hype for the next 5 years, and totally not ready.",

Artists that could paint by hand and do amazing canvas work did not consider this true art.  Well - where are these artists now (with rare exception).   Photography was difficult, and today, most people are more than happy with their iPhone photos.  Certainly, there was a huge corporate video business where a convention would take place at a resort hotel, and a huge video crew would show up to do that show  - and today, people whip out their iPhones, and shoot video, and some poor schmo back at corporate headquarters had to do something with that footage.  BUT THAT DOES NOT APPLY to the HUGE BUDGET high profile corporate videos that are done at BIG MONEY corporate conventions, where huge budgets (bigger than any major TV commerical) are spent.  \n\nI saw in one of the comebacks to my posts that the printing business was over and done.  Well, I have friends that are STILL in the printing business that are making a LOT of money, because they had the client base for direct advertising, and they STILL DO IT - (hard to believe) - but people STILL PAY FOR THIS CRAP - but it's not a wide spread market. \n\nDoesn't this apply to audio recording - anyone can use Logic or Garage Band to make music - and certainly most of the recording studios have disappeared, but there are STILL RECORDING STUDIOS- after all - Pro Tools - the #1 income source of AVID - is still making crazy money today.  So when we say \"the audio recording industry is dead\" - well, not it's not. \n\n  \nSame with Photography - anyone can use their iPhone to take great pictures (I do ) - but does a corporation, that needs photos of the coporate execs ?  Or high end models ?  They pay the BIG BUCKS for the guys that can do the high end work. \n\nI can only say one thing for sure, as I have been dealing with \"producers\" for my entire life. I don't care if Sora, or any program could do the most amazing things. When that producer, who is financed with tons of money, says into [https://open.ai](https://open.ai)  \"make me a hit action movie\" - that is NOT going to happen.  He will HIRE someone to do it.  And when Sora (or whatever) makes the movie , and Mr. Exec. says \"that is horrible, that is not what I was thinking of\" - well, then you have to go back and FIX IT - and that is what WE do for a living. \n\nBob",

There were definitely people back then who refused to get a portrait photograph because they thought it was \"anti-art\".  \n\n\nI'm not entirely against AI, but we should at least make fair comparisons. Thinking that \"true artist's\" careers won't be on the chopping block eventually if it becomes a suitable and cheaper alternative is a bit naive.

Generate AI got him 90% of the way there, but according to this fellow his employer could never get rid of him because it was inconceivable that AI would be able to get 100% there.

I just thought this is gonna be one of those and I cut my losses. I had a guy once that was requesting so many changes and each change was like can you move the subtitles a couple of frames this way and that way. We went through every subtitle line and with 100 percent precision it had to line up with the syllable. I said to the guy I said you know I don't think anyones ever going to notice this. And he sighed because his business partner was making him do it. So he's giving me all these change requests and he's sharing in my pain. We had a mutual understanding of it. He's like i'm really sorry about this but can we just move the word \"and\" just a frame earlier. For the 20th time or what ever lol. He's basically just trying to appease his OCD business partner who's going through it frame frame with a tooth comb. Ridiculous.",

No, they haven't justified monthly payments for an evolving app after that. Change has been very incremental and changes often adding no net gain, sometimes upgrading modules with inferior replacements.  Even going back to CS6, removing the playback shuttle tool was a bad idea, especially coupled with the option of choosing your transport tools added at the same time. You can't let the editor make the choice of what to devote the minuscule bit of gui real estate to? \"No. We're Adobe. We've made the choice. We're moving forward. Next Question!\"\n\nThen like PP22's redesign, changes over later releases really just affected the default steps they built into starting and exporting projects, were just a pia to editors who already had a good workflow or knew what they were doing.\n\nBad habit of shitting up the software trying to make it stupid-proof goes way way back. Replacing Audition with Soundbooth in pre-creative cloud Adobe Production Packages was emblematic.\n\n  \n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n  \nSo my opinion definitely doesn't match much r/premiere or r/premierepro attitudes, but is likely more relatable to r/editors , in that it's exactly because Premiere is reliable & quick that I find it indispensable right now.

Many of us didn\u2019t have mentors or *any* pathways to follow. The road to advancing had many gate keepers, and it was pretty expensive to be an editor once upon a time. Those factors created exclusivity. A lot has changed. \n\nThere\u2019s certainly a future for the art of video editing. It\u2019s just that the way these stories are told will be very different. Sometimes, when i think about my time in Los Angeles between 2000-2020, I\u2019m dumbstruck by the speed of technological growth.  The floodgate opened with more distribution outlets,  cheaper access to more powerful tools, and the once voracious appetite of digital platforms to fill space with anything for people to consume becoming standard.\n\n It\u2019s arguable that as movies and TV have moved from away from art, and into the realm of product and commodity, where we\u2019ve landed with AI and industry constriction was an inevitability.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying this as some sort of foo-foo indictment of commerce over artistry. Just a statement of fact. I think the tools are amazing. I only wished that the infrastructure supporting this industry that makes the wonderful things we watch had a pipeline that trickled down.  That didn\u2019t feel like a scam or house of cards at every new production. \n\nI\u2019m only sad that I never had a \u2018career\u2019.  I came into this industry in ignorance, and that\u2019s my own fault. I\u2019ve been reaching back and having 1 on 1 conversations with as many recent transplants as I can.  My old undergrad, isn\u2019t equipping these kids with the right tools to thrive.  Skill certainly matters in this town, but social matters a whole lot more. \n\nI was a nerd that kept my nose clean, stayed out of trouble, stayed ambitious, treated people kindly, payed it forward as often as I could, and really REALLY loved storytelling. The world changed and, unfortunately, i didn\u2019t change rapidly enough with it. That\u2019s on me. \n\nMy job is to make sure that isn\u2019t on the NEXT person.",

Many of us didn\u2019t have mentors or *any* pathways to follow. The road to advancing had many gate keepers, and it was pretty expensive to be an editor once upon a time. Those factors created exclusivity. A lot has changed. \n\nThere\u2019s certainly a future for the art of video editing. It\u2019s just that the way these stories are told will be very different. Sometimes, when i think about my time in Los Angeles between 2000-2020, I\u2019m dumbstruck by the speed of technological growth.  The floodgate opened with more distribution outlets,  cheaper access to more powerful tools, and the once voracious appetite of digital platforms to fill space with anything for people to consume becoming standard.\n\n It\u2019s arguable that as movies and TV have moved from away from art, and into the realm of product and commodity, where we\u2019ve landed with AI and industry constriction was an inevitability.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying this as some sort of foo-foo indictment of commerce over artistry. Just a statement of fact. I think the tools are amazing. I only wished that the infrastructure supporting this industry that makes the wonderful things we watch had a pipeline that trickled down.  That didn\u2019t feel like a scam or house of cards at every new production. \n\nI\u2019m only sad that I never had a \u2018career\u2019.  I came into this industry in ignorance, and that\u2019s my own fault. I\u2019ve been reaching back and having 1 on 1 conversations with as many recent transplants as I can.  My old undergrad, isn\u2019t equipping these kids with the right tools to thrive.  Skill certainly matters in this town, but social matters a whole lot more. \n\nI was a nerd that kept my nose clean, stayed out of trouble, stayed ambitious, treated people kindly, payed it forward as often as I could, and really REALLY loved storytelling. The world changed and, unfortunately, i didn\u2019t change rapidly enough with it. That\u2019s on me. \n\nMy job is to make sure that isn\u2019t on the NEXT person.",

So just as soon as you think \"Hey, watch the road, dummy... BANG, T-boned by a red-light runner.\n\nNext, in old-school film-only post production, you can often tell when a dissolve is about to take place because you can see the generation loss in the film grain at the match cut before the optical dissolve. Most visible on stuff originated on 16mm, or lower-budget 35.  Really telegraphs the upcoming dissolve. \n\nLast is the random isolated shot of some apparently minor piece of evidence or character action that will \"turn out\" to be key to the plot later on. Seen mostly in TV police procedurals. Around here, it elicits the cryptic comment, \"Well, that's not there for no reason...\" Lots of examples in the streamer \"Will Trent\".",

I don\u2019t know whether that points to the theatrical origins of film, or whether it\u2019s just a common way to shape a scene. In many cases, of course, doors can be phenomenally loaded symbols \u2013 of hidden secrets or paths disguised. I\u2019m no door-ist, but if there are too many scenes bookended by them, the editor\u2019s duty is to kick them down.*\n\n[Check out the rest of the interview here](https://www.provideocoalition.com/aotc-bladerunner-2049/)",
