Theres not a taste graph with pistachio being 1 and chocolate being 3. They're different, so one has to stop seeing it as like a linear 2D greyscale graph with \"thin\" on the \"winning\" end and thick on the \"losing\", when in fact it's like a crazy rainbow 4D matrix or something. \n\nAlso, a practical advice, just in case. My ex would always look at her arms independent of the rest of her body and would just literally compare them to others on thickness and nothing else. But the thing is, she was short and curvy and, visually speaking, her arms were literally perfect in terms of overall body composition. Like, it just wouldn't even make sense for her to have thin arms. It's like women getting ass transplants while having NO supporting legs or hips or thigs for the size they want. It doesn't work at all.\nSo, if you have that one body part that you just hate hate hate, remember to look at it in the context of your entire body. \n\nI know this is of little help, but it's the one thing I always wanted to somehow get through to her, because it was so obvious and yet she couldn't see it.",

One thing thats unifying though is that if someone can cum over and over, its not (just) because of the person doing stuff to them, its just something their body can do.\n\nThis post is fun cos there's a bunch of guys who i guess assume they're really good at sex when actually their partner is just extremely multiorgasmic.\n\nEvery time I see this going around there's tonnes of comments which are like \"women don't work that way\" or\" id be really exhausted\", or \"those aren't real orgasms then\" but, like, some people can just have like 60 orgasms a night it just depends on the person.

I was in excruciating pain for days and having the worst panic attack of my life. My panicking caused my heart rate and blood pressure to be dangerously high and I almost hemorrhaged, they had to load me up with drugs to calm me down, but the drugs and the epidural didn't stop the pain. I felt everything when I had my C-section, I mean it was obviously toned down like I know without all the drugs it would have hurt way more than it did, but it was still horrible. I felt them cutting into my stomach, moving my organs around. I was screaming and my son's dad was helping the nurses hold me down. Then I just passed out. \n\nI didn't get to see my son until hours later, and I didn't get to breast feed him for his first feeding, because they had to give him formula while I was still passed out. I tried breast feeding after that but we never got the hang of it, so that was depressing for me too. My son's birth was extremely traumatic and for a long time I had post partum depression because I was traumatized and upset that I couldn't look back on the birth of my son and be happy. Like, throughout my pregnancy I imagined the birth as this amazing experience, IDK I dunno how to explain it really. But I wanted to give birth naturally, not a C-section, I wanted to hold my son afterward and take cute pictures, IDK. It just wasn't how I wanted it to be and I felt robbed of that experience. \n\nThe c-section was rushed and I also feel like when they closed me back up they didn't do a good job and it made my stomach hideous. I also still feel the scar 19 years later. I love my son and I did a good job of building a good life for us despite being a traumatized homeless teenager at the time I got pregnant... But it was the scariest thing I've ever been through. And I think it might have something to do with the fact that I was never able to get pregnant again. When my son was 12 my husband and I started trying for another baby, but I only got pregnant twice, once I had a miscarriage and the second was ectopic and also almost killed me. So we stopped trying and I'm pretty sad that I never got to have a daughter. The ectopic one, if it had been a healthy normal pregnancy, the baby would've been born the same month as me, and I was excited to maybe have a little girl who is a Libra like me, since my son and husband are both Cancers, their birthdays are only a few days apart. \n\nSorry for trauma dumping I guess, but... That's my experience as a teen mother giving birth. It was traumatic.",

Having your hike disturbed by other people is almost always a downer.\n\nAlso, in 2019 there were zero bear attacks - but there was a murder of an AT hiker by a disturbed man on the trail. But also, statistically, that's always the case. More people die from homicide at the hands of a stranger in US national parks every year than from bears by a wide margin. More people die on major trails from murder by strangers than bears every year.\n\nBears are cool and should be in the woods. Other people are cool and should be in the woods. But if I had to choose one for my enjoyment it's the bear, and if I had to choose one for my safety - it's still the bear.\n\nI usually hike with a concealed pistol in the wilderness - but it isn't for the bears and wouldn't do shit against one if I needed it to.",

Chances are equal between sweet grandpa and escaped psycho.\n\nYou also have to balance the other side of the equation with the fact that getting eaten by the bear is not assumed, just an encounter. One can plan for bear encounters based on what is endemic to the region, and your chance of outwitting a bear is much higher. Man, and by extension men, as a whole are far more dangerous than bears by every possible factor except pure one on one physical power, and a male human is stronger than a woman statistically anyway.\n\nThere is also the psychological factor, in that a prepared person with the means to defend themselves would use that means on the bear, no question. However, if you encounter a man running in your direction in the woods - what if he is in a hurry? What if he is in fact no danger? Now you are a murderer for having shot him. There is a great deal of uncertainty, which makes it harder to deal with then meeting the bear, which is a predictable encounter.\n\nTherefore looking at the data and understanding the danger, a man would logically be more dangerous and uncertain. You have to add assumptions like \u201clocked in a room\u201d or \u201ccompletely unprepared\u201d for the male human to be less dangerous.\n\nAsking the question of yourself \u201cwhy would a woman even consider not wanting to encounter a man while alone\u201d is the point here, and I think you realize that, but I don\u2019t accept your earlier qualifiers at all in this context.",

I suppose I'm out of the loop. \n\nIt's definitely valid to say that there are some ways meeting a man in the woods or whatever could be worse than meeting a bear. It's clearly a pointed way of revealing the fear many women feel and the shitty state of the world and men. There is also a very different feeling to meeting a bear vs a man where one is a wild beast that can't be reasoned with, and the other is fully capable of reason but may choose to harm you anyway in a sadistic manner. \n\nThat being said, I think it's pretty clearly safer to meet a man than a bear in the woods. I don't know if that actually needs being said because I don't think that is quite the point of this discourse. While a man might have the possibility of resulting in the worst potential outcome, I'd think you would be much more likely to get the bad outcome with a bear to the point that it easily makes up for that.",

By your logic you could say violence is evenly distributed among the bears too, and with polar bears being a thing (a reasonable analaogue for Nature's escaped psycho), your bears liable to be at least a 400+ pound murder monster with a set of 5 3-inch knives in each hand\n\nThis whole thing is just women wanting to feel justified for their fear of men, and men wanting to feel justified for not being \"one of the bad ones\"\n\nBoth sides are justified. That's it. That's how we progress. We can work on both issues. Working on the women's issue helps alleviate (though will never eliminate) the men's issue, and vice versa. Both genders want what they are lacking. Women want safety, respect, and equal rights --- Men want love\n\nI'm a multiple SA victim and have been in relationships with two different narcissitic and likely sociopathic women. I do not have the ability to fully trust women (who I haven't known for a long time) any more and all my friends who are women hold a similar distrust toward men because at the very least they've dealt with straight up crude and disgusting sexual comments, or worse they've dealt with SA or rape. So like, from an emotional perspective I get it, but if statistitically we had women encountering bears at the rate that women encounter men on a daily basis, there would probably be a very different result from this hypothetical\n\nGod there is no like good conclusion from this discussion, the whole debacle is just the social media issue in a nutshell. That and the \"Better the devil you know, then the devil you don't\" idiom --- though I don't think most people answering this hypothetical is an expert enough on bears to justify their answer\n\nNot all men are predators, but yes all women have dealt with monstrous, predatory men\n\nAlso love how for the bear choosers the man is always a psycho killer/rapist and for the man choosers the bear is always like the bear from Cocaine Bear or The Revenant",

It doesn't matter how many there are, if we don't know who they are until they attack us. \n\nRead:\n\n[https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2023-11/gender-related-killings-of-women-and-girls-femicide-feminicide-global-estimates-2022-en.pdf](https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2023-11/gender-related-killings-of-women-and-girls-femicide-feminicide-global-estimates-2022-en.pdf)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_fatal\\_bear\\_attacks\\_in\\_North\\_America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_bear_attacks_in_North_America)\n\n[https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/homicide-leading-cause-of-death-for-pregnant-women-in-u-s/](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/homicide-leading-cause-of-death-for-pregnant-women-in-u-s/)\n\n[https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/crime/UN\\_BriefFem\\_251121.pdf](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/crime/UN_BriefFem_251121.pdf)\n\n[https://sanctuaryforfamilies.org/femicide-epidemic/](https://sanctuaryforfamilies.org/femicide-epidemic/)\n\n[https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvv.pdf](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvv.pdf)\n\nI've shown you the data behind my choice, now show me where 0.5% comes from. Some people like to consider themselves rational and knowledge driven till the information doesn't mesh with their personally held beliefs. Women have every reason to fear men more than bears.

After being assaulted, you would obviously feel hurt and lose trust of people, and that makes sense. And even aside from that one instance, there is a whole culture of men being pieces of shit. \n\nIt still feels like you are underrating the chance of an average bear trying to harm you and overrating the chance of an average man trying to harm you. A bear absolutely could kill you if you aren't antagonizing it, and why would you assume it's not hungry? Hoping it's not hungry is like a 50/50 gamble. Depending on what kind of bear it is, it could just kill you for fun as well. It sounds very flippant to just say, \"Bears are cool,\" like we're talking about a teddy bear.\n\nWhile you may feel unsafe in a secluded area with a man (and rightfully so), I don't buy that an average man in the woods is nearly as likely to try and assault you as a bear would be to attack. There are lots of shitty men, but the majority aren't assaulting women on sight. Every bear is a wild animal that will kill you if the conditions are right. \n\nSo again, I get it if you feel more unsafe with a man due to your personal experiences. The only reason I'm really arguing at all is because I would find it surprising to hear people who actually think a man is more likely to be dangerous than a bear in the woods.",

Look at it this way, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being really into Naruto, or dressing up like your favorite character, but there\u2019s a time and a place to do it, like a convention, or anime fan group meet up. What we are led to believe with this post is this person feels this is an appropriate thing to do at work. I\u2019m going to tell you, unless you work maybe at a store that sells anime stuff, or like you are having some kind of special dress up day event were this would make sense it\u2019s not appropriate, and starts to venture into neckbeard behavior. Then you look at the statement made where the persons like my coworkers don\u2019t understand, shows a further lack of self awareness that this individual lacks an understanding of how others might not find this appropriate in a work space. \n\nAnother way of looking at this would be if you worked in an office that usually business attire, and someone shows up in say a complete sports uniform to show their support and zeal for their favorite team, while no one at the business put it out there that it\u2019s \u201csports day\u201d or something like that, then this person gets all fart lordy that their coworkers just don\u2019t get it.. no, it\u2019s cause you are acting like a neckbeard and being unprofessional in a professional environment, not that you are really into xyz sports team.",

However, a woman's uterus could still be the culprit of this, just not in the way I originally described, but it's more common in women who have been pregnant, and Monroe had several miscarriages, so I still could be right that it's due to issues with her uterus, but I was wrong about a uterus leaning forward or backwards. Still...fucking neckbeards basing reality off of anime girls.",

Many of the bible passages are about victim blaming and I would never defend the binle itself, but this is saying the literal opposite. In the Bible it is said if you lead a child away from God that is like one of the worst sins you can do. It is saying that if you are doing that you may as well be tortured now because you aren't going to have a great time in the afterlife. \n\nIt's also important to note that before Jesus died on the cross it is believed basically everyone went to hell automatically since they didn't have his sacrifice to pay for their sins yet. It Is believed that the first thing Jesus did after dying on the cross was go into hell and get all the followers that were Christians and bring them out since he paid the price.  So when this comment was made those people were unironically going to hell and couldnt pray their way out of it. \n\nI could be wrong but this is how I was taught as a Baptist before I lost my faith.\n\nThere is a big difference between what the Bible says and what Christians do or believe. Like the Bible is pro abortion, rape, slavery, etc. But most Christians will pretend it's anti those things.",

But it's ok! She's kind and helpful so they soften up on her and the rapey hubby comes around to like her even if she's a used impure slut! In the end they have a huge beautiful wedding and they live happily ever after because he now loves her. \ud83e\udd70\n\nThis is awful \ud83e\udd22",

'If she was raped that must mean she was out by herself. She was out at night time? What was she doing? What must she have been wearing to provoke such uncontrollable lust of a man? How was she behaving?\" Rape victims aren't seen as victims, they're seem as \"bad women\".\n\nThese are the mantras that are collectively chanted. She's lost her honour, the family has lost it's honour. Best to keep things under wraps. Who will marry her now?

This movie is well remembered. It\u2019s about a woman who married into a rich family, where the maid is raped by her husbands brother. Her family tries to cover up his acts as she speaks out and eventually fights an uphill battle of social injustice against women. \n\nIn the same golden era of Bollywood, full of romance movies, movies like DDLJ ( \u201cthe\u201d Bollywood movie) have scenes of upholding a woman\u2019s honour and valuing love over intimacy. \n\nI mean this movie is problematic, but society didn\u2019t accept it and it never made a mark.

I think a difference can be that the word rape may be more taboo here perhaps? I'm not sure, but it just changes how people talk about it, they covet it more to let things slide",

But trying to understand the intricacies of why a pervasive systemic problems exists is usually not racists' strong suit. \n\nI'm not even Indian btw, but seeing the normalization of racism towards Indians increase exponentially in the past few years has been insane.

There are [a number of NGOs/NPO's](https://www.csrmandate.org/ngos-that-empower-women-in-india/#:~:text=Mitti%20Ke%20Rang%20%E2%80%94%20The%20main,and%20thus%20become%20self%2Dreliant), many centered around women's rights and empowerment, working really hard to fight for women's safety, and were involved in [the recent nation-wide protests](https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20240819-thousands-india-join-nationwide-protests-doctor-rape-murder-healthcare-workers-women) after the horrific Kolkata rape case.\n\nAs far as media, one need only look at [Pink (2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(2016_film)) a film specifically about sexual assault centered around 3 female roommates in Delhi and the trial that ensues both in the court of law and the court of public opinion, that was both critically and commercially successful (and arguably far more impactful than this dumb 90s movie nobody cares about) - it was one of the most popular movies of the year iirc. There are many other movies and television series that have been released in the last decade on similar topics.     \n\nDon't get me wrong, misogyny and sexual assault are massive issues that seem to have only gotten worse due to women now actually having more of a voice to report these crimes...BUT no culture or country is a monolith and I've noticed on reddit especially that, for example, while the headlines of the Kolkata case were in so many subs, hardly any of them followed up with the national protests that were largely women led. To reiterate, shedding a light on the work that is being done doesn't diminish the severity of the crimes or their frequency, but helps to boost these efforts and bring them to intl attention but I guess that's not as fun as JUST going hurr durr India bad.",

Not saying that hating on an entire group of people is right, just that the two things are separate. \n\nRace is just the package you inhabit and carries with that no behaviors, rituals, or personality traits. It indicates nothing about a person except, perhaps, their lineage. Racism is stupid because it\u2019s based on assigning imagined traits to the way that someone looks to decide that they aren\u2019t as \u201cgood\u201d as another\u2019s imagined traits based on the way that *they* look.\n\nA culture is different because it has actual normalized behaviors and rituals. It\u2019s easy to clash when two cultures have conflicting ideals. It\u2019s not based on nothing like racism is. You can have a culture that worships birds and another that hunts them for sport. There are plenty of people who dislike the US for its \u201cgun culture\u201d though I, among many other Americans, have never owned a gun. The same can be said for this situation. You can dislike the general perceived views and behaviors of a culture without assuming that every individual of that culture embodies them.",

Likely not, but recent media attention, efforts of the organizations mentioned and advocates alike, along with increasing rates of education, have led to more reporting overall. Things have changed, albeit slightly.

Being open and direct about problems that need to be solved, being scientifically minded, not expecting over the top service from minimum wage store employees, stuff like that. That doesn't keep me from admitting that there are also serious deficits within the German culture. The german culture is pretty conservative and hesitant to change things. There is definitely less openness to strangers than in most other cultures which can lead to a lot of loneliness on an individual level and racism on a societal level. Women while having made great strides in the last century still aren't paid equally and are doing more hours of unpaid labor in addition to their jobs. There are still cultural issues that lead to domestic violence and femicides. \n  \nIf we ignore those aspects of our culture or even fight against them being called out we are actively making our culture worse by strengthening its bad sides. Being proud of where you come from can become a very toxic thing if that means you begin to uncritically embrace all things about your culture whether they are beneficial or harmful. Being able to differentiate and being willing to see problems to work on improving them would be a genuine reason to be proud of oneself though.",

Misogyny happens everywhere, but there is a big difference in how women are treated in Norway vs in Egypt. This is not coincidence, it comes down to the cultures view of women and how they are seen by men.\n\nI totally understand being defensive. I\u2019m American, and we get a lot of shit and criticism for our culture. It can suck to hear people dump on it because I love my home and think it has lots of amazing qualities.  But some of the issues they point out are valid, so I will agree that we have a culture that encourages and propagates gun violence, and a motivation to change that aspect of my culture because I love my home and want it to thrive. \n\nBut culture is a broad thing, and that one aspect doesn\u2019t make the whole of my culture awful- just like it doesn\u2019t make yours. India has a rich and amazing history and culture, that you should be proud of.

The vice presidential candidate for a major political party just last week at a campaign rally told his voters it's just a \"fact of life\". It's disgusting, immoral, and reprehensible, and I hate the man and everything he stands for, but at this point he isn't wrong. \n\nShould it be changed? Absolutely. Will I vote to support someone who will actively inhibit the needed changes? No. But is he wrong? Not even a little bit. \n\nIt IS a part of American culture, because so many people on the ground level, even those who have lost family and friends to mass shootings, will still defend people's right to own a weapon that is more often than not used for murder.\n\nLoving your country doesn't mean shutting up and accepting a problem, hand-waving it away, or disregarding it. It means calling out the problem and forcing change to happen one way or another.\n\nThe USA has a gun problem. It's cultural.\n\nIndia has a rape problem. It's also cultural.\n\nThe question isn't if the problem exists, it's what will you do about it? Because if you're going to deflect and defend, you may as well help the next shooter pull the trigger, or in India's case, help restrain the rape victim for her attacker.",

She's only an antagonist, because Walt is the protagonist. It doesn't have to have anything to do with sex, but some people are wackos that actually think Walt is justified, even though he admitted his wrongdoing at the end. By the end, you should see that you were wrong to pull for him. \n\nPeople dislike Umbridge more, because she could be an actual person, as she mirrors real-life abusers. There's not really any agenda to her abuse, unlike Voldemort. She just likes it. It's much more worse is OotP, because Harry is used to being helpless to his abusers. He gets defensive and alienates himself from his loved ones. He's ashamed. In the end, he realizes that he needs them. That's what OotP is about. Harry is the phoenix. \n\nSome of these could be justifiable, but there's nothing inherently sexist about it.\n\nAlso, Jerry and Tweety are males and this is probably unserious. If they were all females, then maybe you could talk.",

Made me so mad when he got out of a business that usually kills you early and then jumps right back in just because those guys at the hardware store weren't gathering supplies the way he'd do it. Most people in that kind of racket either die early or end up on top but make so many enemies that they're stressed out and panicky the rest of their lives.

She is totally justified in how she is acting, but she was often a wet blanket on the interesting parts of the show. None of these characters are villains, but I noticed a lot of people in here are correctly pointing out that Skyler was in the right. I agree she was right, but I personally felt like she dragged the story down when she was on screen. Correct doesn\u2019t always translate to entertaining. But it makes sense as a reply to whether she is a villain (no) but I thought the point about interesting vs correct was worth mentioning.",

It's a clever movie and I agree dumb people will look up to him but it's not on the level of \"Wolf on Wall Street\".\n\nThe thing about that movie is that it's based on a real person and a biopic. That's where it gets all fucked up. Showing him partying, drugs, women etc, but not enough downsides. I was waiting for it all to come crashing down and see him rot in prison where the asshole gets what's coming to him, but it just never really does. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmfPT47awUg\n\nIt ends with him finally going to jail, but not really. He's playing tennis in a comfy jail and then the actual ending is him bragging to some crowd of jocks and is \"back in the game\". \n\nThe whole movie really did glorify his ass. \n\nAnother movie I really hate, in the same vein, as someone who spend 3 tours in Afghanistan and 1 in Iraq is American Sniper.\n\nPeople in my platoon read the book back when it came out in 2010 or so. He's a full blown racist and a pyschopath who competed for \"most kills\". Absolute disgusting human being. He bragged and lied about shooting people after hurricane Katrina. The book is his own words and it just shows what a piece of shit he really is. He's also said unhinged stuff on Twitter afterwards.\n\nSo when we read the book and heard there was going to be a movie we were all excited since we thought it would show the ugly side of war like The Platoon, The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse NOW did for Vietnam. It didn't. Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper white washed(or whatever it's called) the whole book. They took out the worst shit and tried to make him into some sort of tragic hero. Fucking disgusting. There are loads of good stories that came out of Afghanistan and Iraq that they could tell but they decided to make it about a literal war criminal. \n\nSame thing regarding Lone Survivor with that douchbag from Boston. It's a complete fabrication. There was no firefight, they just got ambushed and killed. The marines who checked the area afterwards found no trace at all of a firefight. Mark Lutrell didn't fire a single shot. The Afghans who took him in said there was no firefight either. The guy is just a straight up liar and people knew this, but they still decided to make a movie. He was on Joe Rogan podcast and it's so easy to tell he's lying about everything. During that podcast you could tell Joe felt he was full of shit. I've read that book too and everyone in the military knows it's just lies.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is... you gotta be real careful when taking real non-fictional stories and glorifying something, more than when you make it up yourself.",

While he never stopped seeing himself as the senior partner, there were multiple points in the story where I believe his affection was genuine, almost fatherly even. He killed Jane after a heartfelt conversation with her dad, and my read was that in his mind he did it to save Jesse from heroin as much as protecting himself. The reason he took Jesse quitting so badly was that he was the only real friend Walt had left. Todd was completely under his thumb, and was a serviceable (if untalented) lab assistant, but that was the one way he could never replace Jesse. Once Pinkman was gone Walt was truly alone.",

Ive been in customer service oriented position for 15 years , 7 of those years in finance the remainder in fast food and restaurant establishments. The best thing to do is to smile through it and keep it pushing. Thats the literal key to it all. Its not about your staff or whoever you think is in the wrong. Its that this dude genuinely found someone that also enjoyed something he liked and wanted to also let them know about it. You know the common ground of society. So while you keep fumbling about your mediocre job with an equally mediocre attitude, perhaps try not going about managing how you deem society should function like a little psychopath and show some compassion. Sure he isn\u2019t entitled to being flirted back with but no one not even OOP is saying that, he just found it rude how dismissive the cashier was.",

I think her first year she made 500 grand. But the most any one subscriber had ever gifted or tipped her was maybe, 500$ at a time. Large tips or gifts like this is not the common way to make a lot of money on Onlyfans. People make a lot of money on onlyfans by having a large amount of people pay a small amount of money on a recurring basis. That\u2019s why it\u2019s funny when men make fun of big creators who charge, like 3 dollars to subscribe. Might seem small, but when you have 50,000 people paying 3$ a month, it\u2019s not small anymore.",

Online these guys are also in a position to misrepresent themselves to impress the girl (not that she gives a fuck but he\u2019ll be convinced they have a special connection and that she sees him differently to all her other subs.)\n\nThey\u2019re spoon fed a fabricated persona by these woman and that impossibly \u201cperfect girlfriend,\u201d illusion is what they thirstily lap up. They also fill in a lot of the gaps in their mind with imaginary commonalities they must surely have with the model. In real life none of this would ever be possible so a real woman could never live up to their addictive fantasy. \n\nIn the end the person they have built up in their imagination is so outrageously beyond any sort of possible reality that they would likely be bitterly disappointed if they *did* meet them and start dating in real life. They imagine a girl who is doll-perfect *all* the time, who will listen to their problems all day and attend to their every need and whim. They don\u2019t have the emotional maturity to grasp that relationships go both ways and that no girl can be perfect *all the fucking time* and live only to worship her partner. \n\nThey are not obsessed with a person but their delusional *idea* of that person. It\u2019s the high fantasy they are gripped by. There\u2019s probably a similarity between these types and the guys who fall in love with body pillows with anime characters on them. Real people and real relationships scare them and they probably have a laundry list of perceived personal shortcomings (mentally and physically) so they fall in love with an illusion instead to stay within their comfort zone.",

They mentally fill in 90% of the gaps pertaining to your personality which you have never divulged online and end up building this impossibly perfect, ethereal woman in their heads with all these traits and factors in common with them that they couldn\u2019t possibly know exists. \n\nIn fairness, sometimes these guys simply see or work around a girl in real life, barely talk to her and do the very same but there is a little more room for their confusion in that instance (such as them misreading a barista being nice to them because it\u2019s her job!) When you are grey rocking and ignoring the fuck out of them online from day 1 and they *still* decide you\u2019re basically their girlfriend I think it goes from creepy and inappropriate to a demonstration of pretty severe and worrying mental instability. \n\nA part of me is very tempted to point this out to some of my worst offenders and highlight to them how cringeworthy and creepy it is but it\u2019s problematic because a) giving them any attention at all can worsen it and b) they can flip and start aggressively trolling you c) they are so self unaware and lonely it\u2019s actually a bit cruel and it\u2019s evident to me that several of my worst offenders are intellectually disabled d) public figures are held to such high standards that you may appear an asshole to your fans.",

You become re-sensitized once you refrain from it long enough. I used to watch stuff like this and ecchi a long time ago all day and it desensitized me to the point where i didnt think it was a big deal and even that itself is a slippery slope as alot of ppl who are emotionally apathetic to this issue typically enjoy it themselves or end up doing so. I stopped watching trash like that and it literally cleared up and now i notice it more and become rightfully offended.\n\nTo connect my question, can you control your desensitization to draw the line at stuff like rape or cp, and if so, why not draw it at sexualized minors to save yourself from being noseblind to this actual problem?",
