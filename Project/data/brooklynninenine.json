Holt was written with so much respect, but at the same time, he was written as just a \"regular\" guy. Like you said, he just so happened to be gay.\n\nI came up during the \"Glee\" era of television where being gay was often the focus of a character's personality, to that point that the representation no longer felt genuine. Capt. Holt's character was so different from what I was used to seeing. We have Andre to thank for the respectful and fantastic performance (and of course the writers for their genius writing).\n\nI will always be moved especially by the episode where Rosa comes out, and she and Holt hug. \"Every time someone steps up and says who they are, the world becomes a better, more interesting place.\" I'm sure Andre has inspired many people to say who they are, and for that, he himself has helped make the world an infinitely more interesting place. </3",

I don't think I've seen another character like him. \n\nThe early 00s or even the late 90s, it was very much \"we're here, we're queer, get used to it\". It was that fight to say we're not some dirty little secret to hide away as \"just roommates\" we are not going to \"keep things in the bedroom\" and then become straight passing in public. It needed strong personalities and flamboyancy to get the message out and to stand up. \n\nBut after that gays had equal rights (as far as I'm aware) but they were seen as this singular stereotype of the flamboyant limpwristed well dressed man. It felt very much like people was saying \"we've given you what you want now stop shoving it in our face and go back to behind close doors\" . There was no real gay protagonist on tv or film, they was always the side character, the fun best friend.\n\nThe way they portrayed Holt is like how most gay men are. He didn't fit the stereotype but he wasnt written to be against the stereotype either, he was just his own fully fleshed out character with his own personality. He also wasn't just a I'm gay but I'm going to act straight so people know I'm not one of the\" bad gays\". \n\nBeing gay was part of his backstory, he was open and honest and he fought to be who he is and to be out and he got so much shit for it and he still stood up openly and honestly. He is quite simply a role model for the lgbt of how to be honest and true to who you are and still be unapologetically yourself. And it really saddens me about Andre, as he done a remarkable job and played the character with such grace and respect for the community, he will be missed.",

The character Reacher is, is quite literally designed to be a teenager's dream of \"Peak Male Fitness\" and that's fine, but unfortunately Tom Cruise just doesn't deliver. \n\nStill I like the movies, but I chuckle at the thought what the scenes would of been like with Alan Ritchson, that bar fight would of been interesting, or when he tried blending in with the crowd at the bus stop, playing the game \"find the main character in the crowd\" there.",

He just happened to be smarter than he was insubordinate.\n\nHis arc over the entire show was growing up and becoming a better person. Jake had an absent father and a lot of his issues in life can be directly traced back to that. Nobody has ever been there for little Jake. Leaving the police for something that was bigger than the job was the final step of his growing up journey. Jake wanted to be the father that he deserved.",

They got to know each other, but obviously mafias are very cautious so they didn\u2019t let him in the group for a long time. For a while, they were just drinking buddies at the bar, while the mafias were secretly checking Jake out. For 4 months, they hang out together as friends. And finally, Jake\u2019s hard work paid off and he was finally a part of the group. So technically, he was only undercover in the group for only 2 months (60days) because the first 4 months, he was just a jobless guy who had nothing to do in the morning and who had drinks with the mafia occasionally.",

Also, this is set in a fictional Police Precinct that has time to put together heists annually for funsies. There are many things episode to episode that wouldn't be happening in real life. \n\nDoes the writing for her get weird later in the show when she's living in a different social strata from her friends and being a generally shitty person? Yes. Though I felt the writers were using the character as an allegory for some of the media personalities of the time/things that were wrong with social media etc. \n\nAll in all, Gina as a character has never stopped me wanting to revisit the show.",

Her character archetype has worked for me in other characters, just not her. I don't like her because her brand of comedy doesn't work for me, and that's fine.  \n\n\nHowever, I find her treatment of Terry especially distasteful.   \n\n\nB99 is a show that couldn't work in reality. Its cast would be locked up or sued before the first season ended. I agree that we like to watch sitcoms because of how it exaggerates reality, and allows us to set aside moral qualms.  \n\n\nBut, B99 is also a show that is, and continually attempts to be, political. Not only that, it's also incredibly liberal, with Moo Moo being the go to example. It's also unlike many shows of its genre, and plays with sitcom structure and tropes a lot. It weaves a lot of its messaging into the jokes (like Jake being an ally and a feminist), and so naturally many of its jokes wouldn't outright contradict things we know about the characters. (i.e Jake wouldn't make degrading jokes about Amy being a woman).   \n\n\nSo for Gina to be that contradiction, it really is unnerving. I actually preferred Gina when she had some heart to her, and in my opinion, it made her incredibly likeable, but those moments are very sparse.   \n\n\nFor god's sake, they made an episode about male-on-female SA, so it's inexcusable they let her behavior slide. The justification that it's just a sitcom and they do terrible things all the time becomes moot when you're making it into a hot button issue that an episode centers around. You didn't hear them joking in the last season about how black people are shoot on sight.  \n\n\nAnd just to add, Terry shouldn't have had to \"stop\" anything. Why does someone need power to instill common human decency? It's the exact same rhetoric in Moo Moo. Why should Terry be a police officer to stop injustice?  \n\n\nGina Linetti is a character that fulfills her role well, and the actress is incredible. Gina Linetti's harassment goes against the spirit of the show itself and will forever be a stain on an otherwise impressive performance.",

Tbh, I'm not a big fan of any of the shows you wrote except Scrubs, and even then I need to watch it with a big bucket of salt by my side, it's aged very poorly. I can still disconnect the funny from it, tho, I think Gina is legitimately the funniest character in the show especially when paired with Holt and Kevin but I can still say that she isn't a well written character (tho, that is very subjective, she is well written in the sense that she is funny).\n\nThat's why I talked about those big serious moments in the show, it isn't just trying to make people laugh, it takes stances in important issues and addresses them as they're a big thing in our day to day. HIMYM never does that, IASIP never does that (in fact, it does the opposite) and that's why I give them a pass. B99 doesn't, and having a character like Gina being praised in the show by the other characters that do become better feels jarring to me. I liked that they wrote her out of the show when they realised the character didn't fit anymore.\n\nBut, again, that's my opinion. We don't have to agree.",
