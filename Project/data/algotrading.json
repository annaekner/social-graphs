            "text": "I came across this trading strategy quite a while ago, and decided to revisit it and do some backtesting, with impressive results, so I wanted to share it and see if there's anything I missed or any improvements that can be made to it.\n\n**Concept:**\n\nStrategy concept is quite simple: If the day's close is near the bottom of the range, the next day is more likely to be an upwards move.\n\n**Setup steps are:**\n\nStep 1: Calculate the current day's range (Range = High - Low)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the \"close distance\", i.e. distance between the close and the low (Dist = Close - Low)\n\nStep 3: Convert the \"close distance\" from step 2 into a percentage (\\[Dist / Range\\] \\* 100)\n\nThis close distance percentage number tells you how near the close is to the bottom of the day's range.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo verify the concept, I ran a test in python on 20 years worth of S&P 500 data. I tested a range of distances between the close and the low and measured the probability of the next day being an upwards move.\n\nThis is the result. The x axis is the close distance percentage from 5 to 100%. The y axis is the win rate. The horizontal orange line is the benchmark \"buy and hold strategy\" and the light blue line is the strategy line.\n\n[Close distance VS win percentage](https://preview.redd.it/394y75l3amkd1.png?width=543&format=png&auto=webp&s=c67c39068dc188da0dc0d3d3929fb58b9af234ff)\n\nWhat this shows is that as the \"close distance percentage\" decreases, the win rate increases.\n\n**Backtest:**  \nI then took this further into an actual backtest, using the same 20 years of S&P500 data. To keep the backtest simple, I defined a threshold of 20% that the \"close distance\" has to be below. \n\n*EDITED 25/08: In addition to the signal above, the backtest checks that the day's range is greater than 10 points. This filters out the very small days where the close is near the low, but the range is so small that it doesn't constitute a proper \"dip\". I chose 10 as a quick filter, but going forward with this backtest, it would be more useful to calculate this value from the average range of the previous few days*\n\nIf both conditions are met, then that's a signal to go long so I buy at the close of that day and exit at the close of the next day. I also backtested a buy and hold strategy to compare against and these are the results:\n\n[Balance over time. Cyan is buy and hold, green is buy dips strategy](https://preview.redd.it/omf6eg77bmkd1.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c648497275a5a54ac6e33fbcc4438e7b899c6a2)\n\n[Benchmark vs strategy metrics.](https://preview.redd.it/lbr5paivamkd1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0eb01da5b52b71f49ae483aa980477b35213517)\n\nThe results are quite positive. Not only does the strategy beat buy and hold, it also comes out with a lower drawdown, protecting the capital better. It is also only in the market 19% of the time, so the money is available the rest of the time to be used on other strategies.\n\n**Overfitting**\n\nThere is always a risk of overfitting with this kind of backtest, so one additional step I took was to apply this same backtest across a few other indices. In total I ran this on the S&P, Dow Jones, Nasdaq composite, Russel and Nikkei. The results below show the comparison between the buy and hold (Blue) and the strategy (yellow), showing that the strategy outperformed in every test.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blqhj6fibmkd1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aa3e5cb3e6979e32b936b4a3b4ba6e01b3e1f71\n\n**Caveats**  \nWhile the results look promising, there are a few things to consider.\n\n1. Trading fees/commission/slippage not accounted for and likely to impact results\n2. Entries and exits are on the close. Realistically the trades would need to be entered a few minutes before the close, which may not always be possible and may affect the results\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nThis definitely seems to have potential so it's a strategy that I would be keen to test on live data with a demo account for a few months. This will give a much better idea of the performance and whether there is indeed an edge.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with a strategy like this or with buying dips in general?\n\n**More Info**\n\nThis post is long enough as it is, so for a more detailed explanation I have linked the code and a video below:\n\n**Code** is here on GitHub: [https://github.com/russs123/Buy-The-Dip/tree/main](https://github.com/russs123/Buy-The-Dip/tree/main)\n\n**Video** explaining the strategy, code and backtest here: [https://youtu.be/rhjf6PCtSWw](https://youtu.be/rhjf6PCtSWw)",

                    "body": "I see a few major issues.\n\n1. What isn't mentioned in the 'rules' above is the actual entry criteria being used in the backtest:\n\nprice\\['Long'\\] = np.logical\\_and((price.Pct < PCT\\_THRESH), (**price.Range > 10**))\n\nI checked, and with this criteria in place (range < 10) , there are over 100 fewer trades placed.    **This extra condition wasnt mentioned above.**\n\nThe issue with using a hardcoded number like '10', is that it biases the results for when the index was smaller.  It doesn't scale as the index grows, so while at the beginning of the dataset this will filter out a bunch of trades, as the index grows it will become increasingly uncommon for the range to ever be < 10.   You need a different way to calculate this filter, or explain why it's there in the first place, how it was arrived at.\n\n2)  The strategy purports to compare the performance of 'buy and hold' vs. 'selective buy and hold'.  That is, we want to test whether we can enhance our gains, and also reduce our risk, by finding a way to limit market exposure.  As such, it does not (to me) make sense to then calculate our gains in a compounding fashion, using something like  \nprice\\['Sys\\_Bal'\\] = (STARTING\\_BALANCE \\* price.Sys\\_Ret.**cumprod()**)\n\nBy doing this, you make an assumption that all gains are reinvested and compounded.  But this is not what we are trying to test.  We are trying to test whether or not we can beat the benchmark by selective participation.\n\nI think the combination of these 2 is skewing the results early on, and as the index grows it starts to fail.  Not saying it has no merit, but it needs refinement and retesting / redefinition to define exactly what it entails as a trading strategy.  My independent results used a simple calculation of rebuilding what the index value would be if we did not compound and did not use a range filter.  The results are not nearly as outrageously good as they appear to be from 2000 to 2020 using the method proposed.  OP, I will share my code with you, it is quite simple.  DM me.",

Once I finished the backtest, I noticed there were some trade signals being generated by days with a small range, meaning that even though the close was near the low, the day's range was so small that it wouldn't be considered much of a dip.\n\nSo to filter this out quickly I added the **price.Range > 10** condition. This wasn't intended to be part of the backtest, otherwise I would use a value that is based on previous x days average ranges as my minimum range threshold rather than a fixed value of 10. So this was a quick and hacky check that I then forgot to remove.\n\nFor reference, without that condition, the results of the backtest are actually much better:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/mPVECeW](https://imgur.com/a/mPVECeW)\n\nI'll edit the post, that's an annoying oversight but I don't think it invalidates the underlying logic of the backtest.\n\nRegarding point 2 - I think my approach is valid. The cumprod() is multiplying the returns for each day to give you the total return over time. The benchmark return is calculated with this method as 122.01%. In my data the close price on day 1 is 1455.22 and on the last day it is 3230.78, so if you use those numbers alone then you get ((3230.78-1455.22)/1455.22) \\* 100 = 122.01%, the same number.\n\nThe system return is set to 1 on days when there is no trade, so the cumprod() works the same way there, it multiplies the daily returns cumulatively, but on days when there is no trade, it multiplies the running total by 1, so nothing changes.\n\nI would prefer to do a backtest where returns are reinvested and the balance grows/declines over time because that's how I would be trading it, so I'd want to visualise it in the same way.",

The number one thing so far that has transformed my strategy development is creating my own **market and volatility regime filters**. I won't get into specifics, but in essence these filters segment the market into different \"regimes\", such as extreme bull, neutral, bear, high vol, medium vol, low vol, etc. \n\n**Example**:\n\nHere I've imported a simple intraday breakout strategy onto the ES that I originally developed on gold futures\n\n[As you can see, not the greatest system but it is profitable.](https://preview.redd.it/3yhtrov7brcd1.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f766551009350413b0f46d015f0b438618a5f4c)\n\n**Note: I did not change any settings so this is far from being the most \"optimized\" version.**\n\nNow, using my volatilty filter, I can see what it looks like only trading in certain regimes.\n\n**Example**:\n\nTrading only in **high volatility** conditions\n\n[From this, we can see that this system generally doesn't do well in high volatility conditions](https://preview.redd.it/dau0k109crcd1.png?width=1611&format=png&auto=webp&s=050428057fdf27dda31cb6b497ae526f4b027df5)\n\nTrading only in **medium volatility** conditions\n\n[Much better, but certainly not the greatest on its own](https://preview.redd.it/e59dw14icrcd1.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=19efdef346ef66ad2d9c6f59e48eecb4e36b5198)\n\nTrading only in **low volatility** conditions\n\n[Again, much better but not something I would trade on its own](https://preview.redd.it/84ov2bq1drcd1.png?width=1605&format=png&auto=webp&s=b29a0c30e081e0903cf0db1cab62fe1e2010b182)\n\nFrom this quick analysis, we can see that the system doesn't perform well in high volatility, so lets just not trade in those conditions. Doing so would look something like this.\n\n[By simply removing the ability for the system to trade in high volatility conditions, we've improved the net profit and the drawdown, making a better looking equity curve.](https://preview.redd.it/zypb0z3kdrcd1.png?width=1611&format=png&auto=webp&s=35af40bf729325928410610e5d80a5ee3d6ba47a)\n\nNow, diving into different **market regimes**, we can see that the strategy doesn't perform all that well in extreme bear or bull conditions.\n\n[Trading only in extreme bear conditions + not trading in high volatility](https://preview.redd.it/xord6azefrcd1.png?width=1599&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fd01acf20778470823951276683ca3935581866)\n\n[Trading only in extreme bull conditions + not trading in high volatility](https://preview.redd.it/ragfy5plfrcd1.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8619ea766624359e332141e04d2ecb5e8c8979c)\n\n**Note: Without adding in the volatility filter, the strategy does worse in these conditions, so it is not doing poorly just because it's not getting to trade in volatile conditions.**\n\nSo, by filtering out extreme bear market regimes, extreme bull market regimes, and high volatility regimes, we are left with an equity curve that looks like this.\n\n[A much better looking equity curve that produces much more profit and significantly reduces the drawdown.](https://preview.redd.it/pt6eludagrcd1.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaff473d98b208e2c469675e48d464a9e26353fc)\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nKeep in mind that I have not altered any values on anything here. The variables for the entry and exit are the exact same as what I had for my gold strategy (tweaking the values I can get slightly better results so this is certainly not overoptimized, and there is a large stable range for these values that produce similar profits and drawdowns). The variables for the regime filters have not changed, and I don't ever tweak them when using them on different markets or timeframes. \n\nThis was a more high level approach to filters. What I normally do is create a matrix in excel for each different permutation (ex. bull & low vol, bull & high vol, etc.) to further weed out unfavourable market conditions. Getting into the nitty gritty would hace created a very long post, hence why I went with a more high level approach as I believe it still gets the point across.\n\nFor those newer to algotrading, I hope this helps! And for those with more experience, what else have you found to be instrumental in your strategy development? Any breakthrough or \"aha\" discoveries?",

Instead, I started plotting everything visually and realized there was a ton of complexity that was being completely missed by the simple original metrics. \n\nMake graphs of everything and really study what's going on. I started implementing a practice where I would say \"no coding allowed for several days\" and during that time, I would \\*only\\* make visuals of the data (classic data inspection kind of stuff) and make notes/observations.\n\nPlotting not just strategy performance, but relationship of strategy to the underlying market, regime-based stuff like what OP suggested, volatility etc. just to try to understand my market from as many different angles as possible.

Range Trading\n\nNothing worked for more than 2 years. Why are reatil funds or hedge funds not trading just price action? Because it doesn\u2018t work\ud83d\udc80\n\nIf you really really wanna trade price action you MUST trade orderflow with futures on footprint charts. That\u2018s the only way to go with price action trading\ud83d\udcaf\n\nAlgo trading is on a different level:\n1. Algos execute without emotions\n2. Building an algo portfolio is key! You can trade several assets in several timeframes and diversify your portfolio.\n3. Proper Risk Management: With ML you can improve your risk management and your algos are becoming \u201eintelligent\u201c. They open the proper lot size according to the setup they wanna trade.\n4. An algo can process thousands of data every second. Can you too? No, obviously not. And with data I mean using tick charts, volume, volatility, orderbook, etc.\n\nThere is no reason why someone shouldn\u2018t get into algo trading\ud83d\ude0aStart and learn with python. If you can\u2018t code then check codecademy.com to learn python and using ML/AI. \n\nDON\u2018T start with PineScript or MQL5 because they are very limited. In addition, you write the code only for Tradingview and Metatrader5. With your python code you can just connect to the APIs and use the same code for different softwares.\n\nCheers buddy\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffc",

It\u2019s like the Silicon Valley of financial fantasies\u2014everyone\u2019s convinced their Python script will outsmart Goldman Sachs. The place where the phrase \u201ebacktest\u201c gets thrown around more than common sense, and everyone\u2019s a self-proclaimed expert until they\u2019re not.\n\nIt\u2019s hilarious how every other post is about someone\u2019s \u201erevolutionary\u201c trading bot that can predict market moves with stunning accuracy\u2014until it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s the land of Reddit where people think they can turn $1,000 into $1,000,000 by running some code they found on GitHub, all while ignoring the minor detail that if it were that easy, everyone would be doing it.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the endless debates about which programming language is superior for trading algorithms. Python vs. R, with Matlab thrown in for the old-school crowd. As if the language is going to make any difference when most of these bots are getting crushed by transaction fees and market slippage.\n\nThen there are the \u201egurus\u201c who show up with their 14-step programs to financial freedom, conveniently only asking for a small upfront fee\u2014or better yet, access to your account. Because who wouldn\u2019t trust a total stranger on Reddit with their life savings?\n\nIn summary, r/algotrading is like a digital wild west of wannabe traders, each one thinking they\u2019re the next big thing while mostly just contributing to the noise. But hey, at least it\u2019s entertaining!",

            "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI want to share with you some of the concepts behind the algorithmic trading setup I\u2019ve developed over the years, and take you through my journey up until today.\n\nFirst, a little about myself: I\u2019m 35 years old and have been working as a senior engineer in analytics and data for over 13 years, across various industries including banking, music, e-commerce, and more recently, a well-known web3 company.\n\nBefore getting into cryptocurrencies, I played semi-professional poker from 2008 to 2015, where I was known as a \u201creg-fish\u201d in cash games. For the poker enthusiasts, I had a win rate of around 3-4bb/100 from NL50 to NL200 over 500k hands, and I made about \u20ac90,000 in profits during that time \u2014 sounds like a lot but the hourly rate was something like 0.85\u20ac/h over all those years lol. Some of that money helped me pay my rent in Paris during 2 years and enjoy a few wild nights out. The rest went into crypto, which I discovered in October 2017.\n\nI first heard about Bitcoin through a poker forum in 2013, but I didn\u2019t act on it at the time, as I was deeply focused on poker. As my edge in poker started fading with the increasing availability of free resources and tutorials, I turned my attention to crypto. In October 2017, I finally took the plunge and bought my first Bitcoin and various altcoins, investing around \u20ac50k. Not long after, the crypto market surged, doubling my money in a matter of weeks.\n\nAround this time, friends introduced me to leveraged trading on platforms with high leverage, and as any gambler might, I got hooked. By December 2017, with Bitcoin nearing $18k, I had nearly $900k in my account\u2014$90k in spot and over $800k in perps. I felt invincible and was seriously questioning the need for my 9-to-6 job, thinking I had mastered the art of trading and desiring to live from it.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t meant to last. As the market crashed, I made reckless trades and lost more than $700k in a single night while out with friends. I\u2019ll never forget that night. I was eating raclette, a cheesy French dish, with friends, and while they all had fun, I barely managed to control my emotions, even though I successfuly stayed composed, almost as if I didn\u2019t fully believe what had just happened. It wasn\u2019t until I got home that the weight of the loss hit me. I had blown a crazy amount of money that could have bought me a nice apartment in Paris.\n\nThe aftermath was tough. I went through the motions of daily life, feeling so stupid, numb and disconnected, but thankfully, I still had some spot investments and was able to recover a portion of my losses.\n\nFast forward to 2019: with Bitcoin down to $3k, I cautiously re-entered the market with leverage, seeing it as an opportunity. This time, I was tried to be more serious about risk management, and I managed to turn $60k into $400k in a few months. Yet, overconfidence struck again and after a series of loss, I stopped the strict rule of risk management I used to do and tried to revenge trade with a crazy position ... which ended liquidated. I ended up losing everything during the market retrace in mid-2019. Luckily, I hadn\u2019t touched my initial investment of \u20ac50k and took a long vacation, leaving only $30k in stablecoins and 20k in alts, while watching Bitcoin climb to new highs.\n\nWhy was I able to manage my risk properly while playing poker and not while trading ? Perhaps the lack of knowledge and lack of edge ? The crazy amounts you can easily play for while risking to blow your account in a single click ? It was at this point that I decided to quit manual leverage trading and focus on building my own algorithmic trading system. Leveraging my background in data infrastructure, business analysis, and mostly through my poker experience. I dove into algo trading in late 2019, starting from scratch.\n\nYou might not know it, but poker is a valuable teacher for trading because both require a strong focus on finding an edge and managing risk effectively. In poker, you aim to make decisions based on probabilities, staying net positive over time, on thousands of hands played, by taking calculated risks and folding when the odds aren\u2019t in your favor. Similarly, in trading, success comes from identifying opportunities where you have an advantage and managing your exposure to minimize losses. Strict risk management, such as limiting the size of your trades, helps ensure long-term profitability by preventing emotional decisions from wiping out gains.\n\nIt was decided, I would now engage my time in creating a bot that will trade without any emotion, with a constant risk management and be fully statistically oriented. I decided to implement a strategy that needed to think in terms of \u201cnet positive expected value\u201d... (a term that I invite you to read about if you are not familiar with).\n\nIn order to do so, I had to gather the data, therefore I created this setup:\n\n* I purchased a VPS on OVH, for 100$/month,\n* I collected OHLCV data using python with CCXT on Bybit and Binance, on 1m, 15m, 1h, 1d and 1w timeframes. \u2014> this is the best free source library, I highly recommend it if you guys want to start your own bot\n* I created any indicator I could read on online trading classes using python libraries\n* I saved everything into a standard MySQL database with 3+ To data available\n* I normalized every indicators into percentiles, 1 would be the lowest 1% of the indicator value, 100 the highest %.\n* I created a script that will gather for each candle when it will exactly reach out +1%, +2%, +3%\u2026 -1%, -2%, -3%\u2026 and so on\u2026\n\n\u2026 This last point is very important as I wanted to run data analysis and see how a trade could be profitable, ie. be net value positive. As an example, collecting each time one candle would reach -X%/+X% has made really easy to do some analysis foreach indicator.\n\nLet's dive into two examples... I took two indicators: the RSI daily and the Standard Deviation daily, and over several years, I analyzed foreach 5-min candles if the price would reach first +5% rather than hitting -5%. If the win rate is above 50% is means this is a good setup for a long, if it's below, it's a good setup for a short. I have split the indicators in 10 deciles/groups to ease the analysis and readibility: \"1\" would contain the lowest values of the indicator, and \"10\" the highest.\n\nResults:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3nmlgf2ctkod1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b89710c62743517fc481e8cd08d6cabac42d16f\n\nFor the Standard Deviation, it seems that the lower is the indicator, the more likely we will hit +5% before -5%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7g4k2qldtkod1.png?width=399&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f030a1c5c128e4eeedb3b1f14ed0baeecbd4a10\n\nOn the other hand, for the RSI, it seems that the higher is the indicator, the more likely we will hit +5% before -5%.\n\nIn a nutshell, my algorithm will monitor those statistics foreach cryptocurrency, and on many indicators. In the two examples above, if the bot was analyzing those metrics and only using those two indicators, it will likely try to long if the RSI is high and the STD is low, whereas it would try to short if the RSI was low and STD was high.\n\nThis example above is just for a risk:reward=1, one of the core aspects of my approach is understanding breakeven win rates based on many risk-reward ratios. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the theoretical win rates you need to achieve for different risk-reward setups in order to break even (excluding fees):\n\n    \u2022Risk: 10, Reward: 1 \u2192 Breakeven win rate: 90%\n    \u2022Risk: 5, Reward: 1 \u2192 Breakeven win rate: 83%\n    \u2022Risk: 3, Reward: 1 \u2192 Breakeven win rate: 75%\n    \u2022Risk: 2, Reward: 1 \u2192 Breakeven win rate: 66%\n    \u2022Risk: 1, Reward: 1 \u2192 Breakeven win rate: 50%\n    \u2022Risk: 1, Reward: 2 \u2192 Breakeven win rate: 33%\n    \u2022Risk: 1, Reward: 3 \u2192 Breakeven win rate: 25%\n    \u2022Risk: 1, Reward: 5 \u2192 Breakeven win rate: 17%\n    \u2022Risk: 1, Reward: 10 \u2192 Breakeven win rate: 10%\n\nMy algorithm\u2019s goal is to consistently beat these breakeven win rates for any given risk-reward ratio that I trade while using technical indicators to run data analysis.\n\nNow that you know a bit more about risk rewards and breakeven win rates, it\u2019s important to talk about how many traders in the crypto space fake large win rates. A lot of the copy-trading bots on various platforms use strategies with skewed risk-reward ratios, often boasting win rates of 99%. However, these are highly misleading because their risk is often 100+ times the reward. A single market downturn (a \u201cblack swan\u201d event) can wipe out both the bot and its followers. Meanwhile, these traders make a lot of money in the short term while creating the illusion of success. I\u2019ve seen numerous bots following this dangerous model, especially on platforms that only show the percentage of winning trades, rather than the full picture. I would just recommend to stop trusting any bot that looks \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d \u2014 or any strategy that seems to consistently beat the market without any drawdown.\n\nAnyways\u2026 coming back to my bot development, interestingly, the losses I experienced over the years had a surprising benefit. They forced me to step back, focus on real-life happiness, and learn to be more patient and developing my very own system without feeling the absolute need to win right away. This shift in mindset helped me view trading as a hobby, not as a quick way to get rich. That change in perspective has been invaluable, and it made my approach to trading far more sustainable in the long run.\n\nIn 2022, with more free time at my previous job, I revisited my entire codebase and improved it significantly. My focus shifted mostly to trades with a 1:1 risk-to-reward ratio, and I built an algorithm that evaluated over 300 different indicators to find setups that offered a win rate above 50%. I was working on it days and nights with passion, and after countless iterations, I finally succeeded in creating a bot that trades autonomously with a solid risk management and a healthy return on investment. And only the fact that it was live and kind of performing was already enough for me, but luckily, it\u2019s even done better since it eventually reached the 1st place during few days versus hundreds of other traders on the platform I deployed it. Not gonna lie this was one of the best period of my \u201cprofessional\u201d life and best achievement I ever have done. As of today, the bot is trading 15 different cryptocurrencies with consistent results, it has been live since February on live data, and I just recently deployed it on another platform.\n\nI want to encourage you to trust yourself, work hard, and invest in your own knowledge. That\u2019s your greatest edge in trading. I\u2019ve learned the hard way to not let trading consume your life. It's easy to get caught up staring at charts all day, but in the long run, this can take a toll on both your mental and physical health. Taking breaks, focusing on real-life connections, and finding happiness outside of trading not only makes you healthier and happier, but it also improves your decision-making when you do trade. Stepping away from the charts can provide clarity and help you make more patient, rational decisions, leading to better results overall.\n\nIf I had to create a summary of this experience, here would be the main takeaways:\n\n* Trading success doesn\u2019t happen overnight, stick to your process, keep refining it, and trust that time will reward your hard work.\n* detach from emotions: whether you are winning or losing, stick to your plan, emotional trading is a sure way to blow up your account.\n* take lessons from different fields like poker, math, psychology or anything that helps you understand human behavior and market dynamics better.\n* before going live with any strategy, test it across different market conditions,thereis no substitute for data and preparation\n* step away when needed, whether in trading or life, knowing when to take a break is crucial. It\u2019ll save your mental health and probably save you a lot of money.\n* not entering a position is actually a form of trading: I felt too much the urge of trading 24/7 and took too many losses b y entering positions because I felt I had to, delete that from your trading and you will already be having an edge versus other trades\n* keep detailed records of your trades and analyze them regularly, this helps you spot patterns and continuously improve, having a lot of data will help you considerably.\n\nI hope that by sharing my journey, it gives you some insights and helps boost your own trading experience. No matter how many times you face losses or setbacks, always believe in yourself and your ability to learn and grow. The road to success isn\u2019t easy, but with hard work, patience, and a focus on continuous improvement, you can definitely make it. Keep pushing forward, trust your process, and never give up.",

Is your strategy performing the same way in trending markets rather than side ways?\n\n2 - If trending is the base of your strategy, have you back tested it in trending assets with less volatility but that you could eventually use more leverage per position as for example, S&P 500?\n\n3 - I didn't fully understand if you use machine learning or systematic programming?\n\n4 - In case you use machine learning, do you believe LSTM is the best for these types of predictions, or will you recommend something else?\n\n5 - As an informative thing, I have, in my mind, an idea that hasn't been fully developed yet, which basically is to normalize prices based on ATR, and don't use price at all, where I will predict movements in factors of ATR, so that it can work intraday on the different trading sessions: Asia, London, New York for Gold, do you think it is the right path or am I overcomplicating it? Basically, my idea is that a model may find more patterns when data is:\n\n+1.5ATR, -0.5ATR, 0.0ATR, etc. Where the number of columns of the model will be, let's say, the last 10 (ATR) prices on a given timeframe.\n\nThanks for your post.

So, you have a profitable system! I have no idea how to build a bot or anything like that (i've never studied it) but what i have done is taken an indicator (free) and tweaked that with risk management for it to yield 2% on my account value, a day. This has always been my goal! Making \u00a3100 ten times in a day sounds so simple, but how difficult it was!!!! It only happened when i began thinking about what i was thinking about, deeply and asking myself all of the hard pressing questions. Funnily enough, it was when i started studying Prince2 that i saw the value in checking my system for improvements! Hats off to you! I would buy your system just because of the back story!!",

I was not initially very aware of what it was as I did not really studied machine learning and was lazy to but fortunately, when chatGPT came it helped me a lot understanding the concepts and making it easier for me to know what was badly conceived in my infrastructure.\n\nActually percentiles are indeed too wide to use, and I'm more using them to normalize each indicator's scale. But  this scaling system has to be carefully thought and adapted, as an example I used to create percentiles on volatility in 2020 when bitcoin was hyper-volatile compared to now. Let's consider that  back then that outliers would be a -10% or  +10% price movement intra-day. My percentile scale from 1 to 100 from back then would scale 1 a price movement  under -10% and 100 a move over  +10%, but this is not existing  anymore on  Bitcoin since the market isn't as volatile as before. So  I had  to review my system because scales were skewed. \n\nI won't go too much into the details on how  I reviewed the scales though, that's part of the \"secret sauce\" ...",

However if the trend is bullish but we hit a resistance, it might take a swing short, and  vice versa if the trend was bearish, it  would try to long on a support. \n\n  \n2- Unfortunately no, I am sticking to crypto as I am not familiar with the world of US market, I did not know where to find granular OHLCV data in lower than 1D periods. So nope, never tried on SP500 or more traditional markets.\n\n  \n3-  I tried  to use machine learning but I did not successfully make it, instead I have a homemade composite scoring on my indicators, rating indicators positively (long) or negatively (short) and the \"magic formula\"  will trigger  a  long  or short signal depending on the expected net  values. It's a homemade kind of  reinforcement learning.\n\n4- I tried  neural networks and  other kind but never  successfully achieved anything, and also the big problem with machine learning models is that I do not understand them and  cannot  really master the  way to finetune parameters accurately. This is why  I do not use them. \n\n5- I'm not confident on the way Asia, London, NY ... sessions are  behaving  independently,  but yes, I can tell you that  you are on  something. Raw prices are generally bad to  be used as is, and ATR  is a really good indicator, at  least when it comes to crypto :)\n\nhope this helps!",

Only use perps if you know what you are doing and if you have a strategy. I paid it the high price back then and I regret it very much still today.\n\nNow if I had to start over by learning trading at first, I would read/watch every day nice content about trading, this is your best way to learn, to copy-cat someone's thinking process and to later apply it to your own graphs. I still do watch some good youtubers, not to copy their trades but to see how they trade, inspire myself with new techniques and new indicators. Obviously at the beginning you might fall for influencers or stupid traders promoting their channels with titles like \"HOW TO MAKE x10 EACH YEAR BY DAY TRADING\" - just ignore those guys and pick modest ones, that have a way of thinking that suits you, and watch them everyday and compare their results to the market. \n\nFinally, if I had to start over at building a bot from scractch again, I would pass a fair amount of time on my infrastructure, I'm not a developer and it took me a very long time to achieve something fast enough to rely my algorithmic trading system on. So I would definitely learn much more about programming skills. And then basic maths. You can watch the video \"The maths of winning in trading\" from the youtube channel \"the art of trading\", I recommend this video to anyone that would like to start to understand basic maths and how to think in terms of \"edge\" in order to create a winning system. \n\nIf you do not have any technical background, I prefer to be honest, it will be very difficult to build a bot from scratch. There some solutions like Pinescripts using tradingview, but I personally dislike it and I'm probably not the best to comment on it.\n\nHope this helps!",

Python is not over-complex and it's used by a lot of people so you might always find someone that created libraries, free to use. \n\nFor example, just by searching quickly right now, I found this library that provides technical indicators in python: [https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) \n\nNow, regarding the indicators, I have written this in another comment but  I only have 77 indicators, but they are constantly analyzed in different timeframes, so that's a bit more than 300 if you count them separately, haha!\n\nAlso, the most important  library I'm using is CCXT, it provided me a really easy way to use platform's API and collect OHLCV data as it provided a couple of examples. The documentation is clear, and I think that a lot of algo traders on crypto are using this library.\n\nNow for the most important thing to achieve: \n\n- Create a database, or any other sustainable system that will help you analysing data\n\n- Create your scripts to collect raw data (OHLCV) \n\n- Create your indicators in the desired timeframes you want to trade on. I do not suggest to trade under 15 minutes as it's very challenging to gather raw data, treat it and execute a trade accordingly to the open/close of the last bar you are  dealing with. The lower the timeframe, the harder\n\n- Think of a system and test it (you will need a backtesting system, create your own or use a library online) \n\n- Repeat the last step until you found what you needed :) \n\n  \nGood luck!",

If I did not have my professional life nearby, I would probably try to live from MTT at poker as I think this is where the level is the easiest to play (even though the variance can be crazy), and I would put a lot of effort developing my algotrading solution nearby.\nTLDR; if I could keep my actual job and had to choose between poker and algotrading back in 2019, I\u2019d choose algotrading as a side hobby. If I had to choose what I would like to live from without any professional revenue, I\u2019d do a mix: poker in MTT to grind some cash, then focusing on algotrading hopefully to find a good strategy. But focusing only on algotrading and hoping to generate revenues while having no other source of income nearby and having expanses at the same time would be insanely crazy \n(F*ck my tldr is actually super long\u2026)",

For example, RSI >= 9 and STD <= 2 are not happening this much because high RSI generally means the volatility is quite high. However if it does occur I still expect it to be a good setup, but perhaps not the best setup from the two indicators combined together. The main reason is because a single indicator tells you a story and provides you optimal setup for a good trend confirmation for example. Its telling you the beginning of one story that you are trying to guess, and the more you combine indicators, the more confirmations you\u2019ll generally get from various indicators which are lagging, thus you might be too late to the party to have the optimal setup and perhaps are a bit \u201coverfitting\u201d your actual result. It does not mean that you can\u2019t find good correlations between indicators, but it most certainly means that the best combinations of several indicators are not that trivial to find and need you to backtest a lot.\nNot sure if what I wrote makes sense lol, let me know and I\u2019ll try to be clearer",

Futures can move with a lot of momentum, but that's part of their appeal for a trader.\n\nI think way more people have blown their accounts recently from options than futures.

I'm passionate about poker since 15 years old and in 2019 when I started studying in class prepa to get into French engineering school I asked myself this questions. Should I try to go for a professional poker career? At the end, reading on forums I realized that the online level was increasing so fast. I also remember a thread a on french poker forum by batmax about the bots in poker especially in high variance and short deep formats like spin and go. So I realised that it was becoming so important to know how to code and that studying math and computer science will help me to have a more diversified background and thus choose later what I'll do. But same as you, I'm 100% that if I would have been 18 or early 20 around 2010 I would have go for a poker career either live or online. It seems like until 2016 there was a lot a lot a lot of easy money to do with poker.  At the end, I'm  graduating from a quantitative master degree, looking for a quant job, and I think I'll start poker again, has a hobby but seriously.

I won\u2019t have any financial freedom thanks to this platform, just a little bit more of compounding interests (if and only if the strategy is performing), as I already answered to another person. And why did I choose this platform and not something like Bybit where all copy traders are ? Because on Zignaly they do show unrealized pnl to subscribers which is the fairest data. I also think the z-score they provide can give information to users about which traders is likely to be better compared to another. I\u2019m also an active member on their community and I advised to review the z-score, which they will do in a matter of weeks if not days to extend it to 365 days versus 180 days. This will decrease my bot\u2019s visibility by a lot, but I genuinely don\u2019t care.\n\nIf I really wanted a cash grab copy trading system, I would just create a bot that trades with skewed win rates as explained in my thread.\n\nBut be my guest, come frequently on the platform to check out its performance. Or even go to my discord, every announcement I made can prove you that my real version went live in March.\n\nAnd to everyone else reading this: do not invest in my bot, I don\u2019t need it. If you really want to, wait for an additional 6 months from now to wait for extra confirmation and invest if you feel like the bot can be profitable. I don\u2019t need your money, I\u2019m doing just fine.\n\nBtw, I\u2019m curious, did you lose crazy amounts on following random traders to feel that embittered by someone sharing his experience ? Crazy to see some random dudes like you bashing people trying to share algotrading\u2019s data or thinking processes on an algotrading\u2019s forum.",

            "text": "I understand that I myself am a newb, but hopefully some newbier people can take some things away from this.\n\n  \n-Diversification is the most important critical factor(1)\n\n-Risk Management is the second(2)\n\n-Small Profits are profits(3)\n\n-ALWAYS forward test on a paper account(4)\n\n-Treat it like a hobby not a career(5)\n\n-Pattern Day Trading Protection is protection for firms, not for a small trader(6)\n\n-There is no way to get rich quick, patience is important(7)\n\n-Good strategies are great strategies (8)\n\n1. Having a losing position really sucks, but if you have 4 losing positions and 6 winning ones, then you have 2 winning positions, which is twice as good as 1 winning position.\n\n  \n2. Again a losing position is BAD, but is it worse to lose 50% of your portfolio on a bad trade, or 1%?\n\n3. Would you rather take a 0.5% gain? Or risk that 0.5% you gained for 0.25% more? Personally I'd rather just take the 0.5%. Those small in and out trades are awesome. I spent too long worrying about the buy and hold comparison. Does it profit? Then it's profits baby. Does it not perform a lot of trades? I'd hook it up to more tickers. \n\n4. In my earlier days, I found the Holy Grail! (aka repainting to hell), hooked it up to my account, went to work, and thought I'd come home to endless riches. Except I came home to a nuked account. Other times it had been bugged code not properly executing closes causing loss, stuff like that. \n\n5. This ties into #7 a bit, but I thought it was my immediate future, in 3 months me and my wife could retire on an island. When that (obviously) didn't happen, then came the depression. I thought my future was over. Now I have a more laissez-faire approach. \"Oh cool, that's neat\" type of beat, rather than staking my happiness on it. Mental health is going to be huge to your development. Take breaks, relax. \n\n6. Self explanatory, but the amount of times I've lost money when I couldn't close a position due to PDTP is absurd. Didn't want to, but wrote a check for this in my script. The law was passed to prevent GME type situations (look how well that worked) and to gatekeep small traders from becoming big ones. (Honestly not a tip for traders just wanted to rant about this.)\n\n7.  Okay maybe there is a way to get rich quick, but I certainly couldn't find it. Either way, investment firms cream at the idea of 0.5% gains a week, except there isn't the supply for them to make trades at that frequency with the capital they're working with. This is good for you, because it means you can. 0.5% a week consistently beats even the best index funds.\n\n8. Similar to 3 (and 5, and 7 I guess),  I spent too long looking for the Holy Grail. In reality all I needed was something that works consistently, and there is a massive catalog of that available already. I found a good strategy, tweaked it for 10 tickers, and enjoyed. Had I done that 2 years ago I'd be 2 years profitable instead of 1. \n\nMessy rambling, but hopefully some find it helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Also the coding bugs, was funny reading that part as I can relate to a simple mistake multiplying a loss many times over. I've got probably at least 20 sanity checks on my trades now. My account capital is probably %15 of my yearly income, but I would probably feel comfortable maybe at triple that now if I wanted. trades scale from a typical 2% to a pretty rare %10 based on market prediction for the day.",

Really interesting that you use fundamental analysis too. Do you use it just to validate a trade and use TA to confirm? I have no experience with FA and have always been interested.

            "text": "Hello, I'm testing another strategy - this time a reversal type of setup with minimal rules, making it easy to automate.\n\n**Concept:**\n\nStrategy concept is quite simple: If today\u2019s candle has a lower low AND and lower high than yesterday\u2019s candle, then it indicates market weakness. Doesn\u2019t matter if the candle itself is red or green (more on this later). If the next day breaks above this candle, then it may indicate a short or long term reversal.\n\n**Setup steps are:**\n\nStep 1: After the market has closed, check if today\u2019s candle had a lower low AND a lower high than yesterday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ac0jhgrn1tmd1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dff19fc34a77a1189f9888d1350de2f0dacc48b\n\nStep 2: Place BUY order at the high waiting for a reversal\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z1zgwfdo1tmd1.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=3397520ce8f9a0542c2b9f2fc6152ac123f554e9\n\nStep 3: If the next day triggers the buy order, then hold until the end of the day and exit at (or as close as possible to) the day\u2019s close.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6gkunyo1tmd1.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a93422ae7316808c4e80fdd9ac5c88da3fbe4be\n\n**Analysis**\n\nTo test this theory I ran a backtest in python over 20 years of S&P500 data, from 2000 to 2020. I also tested a buy and hold strategy to give me a benchmark to compare with. This is the resulting equity chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ej5nbklp1tmd1.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=6aef5fd2d49d96fe7c9704968999e58ca4967b9f\n\n**Results**\n\nGoing by the equity chart, the strategy seemed to perform really well, not only did it outperform buy and hold, it was also quite steady and consistent, but it was when I looked in detail at the metrics that the strategy really stood out - see table below.\n\n* The annualised return from this strategy was more than double that of buy and hold, but importantly, that was achieved with it only being in the market **15%** of the time! So the remaining 85% of the time, the money is free to be used on other strategies.\n* If I adjust the return based on the time in market (return / exposure), the strategy comes out miles ahead of buy and hold.\n* The drawdown is also much lower, so it protects the capital better and mentally is far easier to stomach.\n* Win rate and R:R are also better for the strategy vs buy and hold.\n* I wanted to pull together the key metrics (in my opinion), which are annual return, time in the market and drawdown, and I combined them into one metric called \u201cRBE / Drawdown\u201d. This gives me an overall \u201cscore\u201d for the strategy that I can directly compare with buy and hold.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3h157qq1tmd1.png?width=1683&format=png&auto=webp&s=20199c9b1b959ed11943984df3df14c7b2e8fa53\n\n**Improvements**\n\nThis gave me a solid start point, so then I tested two variations:\n\nVariation 1: \u201cDown reversal\u201d: Rules same as above, BUT the candle must be red. Reasoning for this is that it indicates even more significant market weakness.\n\nVariation 2: \u201cMomentum\u201d: Instead of looking for a lower low and lower high, I check for a higher low and higher high. Then enter at the break of that high. The reasoning here is to check whether this can be traded as a momentum breakout\n\nThe chart below shows the result of the updated test.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uac02nkr1tmd1.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca84df5268eded664125db9e4ee6ab3570bfe8c3\n\n**Results**\n\nAt first glance, it looks like not much has changed. The reversal strategy is still the best and the two new variations are good, not great. But again, the equity chart doesn\u2019t show the full picture. The table below shows the same set of metrics as before, but now it includes all 4 tested methods.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e3dqxy2s1tmd1.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f1fe9dd5f06fac5e4cd0e76579f3766a9b36d74\n\nGoing by the equity chart, the \u201cDown reversal\u201d strategy barely outperformed buy and hold, but the metrics show why. It was only in the market 9% of the time. It also had the lowest drawdown out of all of the tested methods. This strategy generates the fewest trade signals, but the ones that it does generate tend to be higher quality and more profitable. And when looking at the blended metric of \u201creturn by exposure/drawdown\u201d, this strategy outperforms the rest.\n\nEDIT: Added \"out of sample testing\" section below on 04/09:\n\n**Out of Sample Testing**\n\nAll of the results in the sections above were done on the \"in-sample\" data from 2000 to 2020. I then ran the test from 2020 to today to show the results of the \"out-of-sample\" test. Equity chart below\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m9m7hls3aumd1.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41f594fd35aca945c3180a7ee91fe1ed1d108bb\n\nThe equity chart only shows half the picture though, the metrics below show that the system performance has held on well, especially the drawdown, which has been minimal considering the market shocks over the last 4 years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlao1yibaumd1.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc066c8a925a437ee3f551e789aa4c0628bdaa5f\n\n**Overfitting**\n\nWhen testing on historic data, it is easy to introduce biases and fit the strategy to the data. These are some steps I took to limit this:\n\n* I kept the strategy rules very simple and minimal.\n* I also limited my data set up until 2020. This left me with 4.5 years worth of out of sample data. I ran my backtest on this out of sample dataset and got very similar results with \u201creversal\u201d and \u201cdown reversal\u201d continuing to outperform buy and hold when adjusted for the time in the market.\n* I tested the strategy on other indices to get a broader range of markets. The results were similar. Some better, some worse, but the general performance held up.\n\n**Caveats:**\n\nThe results look really good to me, but there are some things that I did not account for in the backtest:\n\n1. The test was done on the S&P 500 index, which can\u2019t be traded directly. There are many ways to trade it (ETF, Futures, CFD, etc.) each with their own pros/cons, therefore I did the test on the underlying index.\n2. Trading fees - these will vary depending on how the trader chooses to trade the S&P500 index (as mentioned in point 1). So i didn\u2019t model these and it\u2019s up to each trader to account for their own expected fees.\n3. Tax implications - These vary from country to country. Not considered in the backtest.\n4. Dividend payments from S&P500. Not considered in the backtest.\n5. And of course - historic results don\u2019t guarantee future returns :)\n\n**Code**\n\nThe code for this backtest can be found on my github: [https://github.com/russs123/reversal\\_strategy](https://github.com/russs123/reversal_strategy)\n\n**More info**\n\nThis post is even longer than my previous backtest posts, so for a more detailed explanation I have linked a vide below. In that video I explain the setup steps, show a few examples of trades, and explain my code. So if you want to find out more or learn how to tweak the parameters of the system to test other indices and other markets, then take a look at the video here:\n\n**Video:** [https://youtu.be/-FYu\\_1e\\_kIA](https://youtu.be/-FYu_1e_kIA)\n\nWhat do you all think about these results? Does anyone have experience trading a similar reversal strategy?\n\nLooking forward to some constructive discussions :)",

It might be interesting to combine multiple time frames to help with risk management. For example: instead of holding till EOD based on an entry, hold until there is a break in momentum or an opposite reversal on a shorter time frame. I could see this helping with the drawdown, although it could result in missing out on potential gains. Keep it pushing",

If I read your script correctly you are downloading the tickers from yfinance and without specific mention of IEOD, it downloads daily data since you used start and end date in date format and not in datetime format. And with IEOD it only fetches 3 months data.\n\nHow are you backtesting it with EOD data? With this, It will take the current day's high as a trigger when it crosses above the previous day's high, but then you want to close the position on the same day. It need IEOD data to backtest.   \nFor EOD data you have to write\n\n\"\"    \n(data.high.shift(1) < data.high.shift(2)) and (data.low.shift(1) < data.low.shift(2))\n\n\"\"\n\nthen\n\n\"\"\n\n high > high.shift(1)\n\n\"\"\n\n- that will satisfy your trigger and you will get entry on the next bar's open and then you can close on the day close not on day high, because trading live you never know when HOD gonna end up.",

Only thing I don't understand: your Buy&Hold shows a quite different %% than the market research shows: \"Based on historical data, the annualized return of the S&P 500 from 2000 to 2020 was approximately 5.9% \" versus your Buy&Hold of 4.07% Now that might look minor because it's about the B&H, but it makes me wonder what is different in the calculation method of how you calculate your results (because it might effect your strategy results also). If the explanation is in the not calculating for the dividends, that is something you need to make an assumption for in the B&H then, because it's a very substantial amount especially over such long time frame and especially with the re-investment of the dividends in buying more of the stock.\n\nAnother point: your tested time interval includes two of the three major economic crisis in the last 100 years ((2007/8 and COVID), plus the dot-com bubble pop. It might be interesting to see how your different strategies performed over these crisis years and outside these years. Only looking at such a long time frame, doesn't tell you all about the differencs in\"weather resistance\" of your strategies.\n\nBut again, good work!",

Removing compounding de-emphasizes the specific dates used to test the strategy.  \nAgain, this is simplified to test the signal/strategy. If your money is only in the market for a total of 3000 hours over 25 years, you can find something else to do with it for the other 216000 hours.\n\nThis trades SPY and runs from 1/3/2000 - 9/4/2024, which I think are the dates you used.\n\nColumn Explanations:  \nSTRATEGY GAIN: This is based on the \"Reversal\" strategy described by OP. BUY at yesterday's high and sell at close if the signal is given and it reaches yesterday's high at some point that day. This buys $10,000 worth of shares each time.  \nDAILY (HOLD): Every day, this buys $10,000 worth of shares at yesterday's close and sells them at today's close. It is effectively a daily, non-compounding measure of SPY gain/loss. It's in the market 100% of the time.  \nSPY NO SIGNAL: If there is no initial signal from the \"Reversal\" strategy, buys $10,000 worth of shares at yesterday's close and sells them at today's close. This is like a practicable inverse of the strategy.  \nSPY NO BUY: If the \"Reversal\" strategy does *not buy*, buys $10,000 worth of shares at yesterday's close and sells them at today's close. This is a non-practicable inverse of the strategy, because it incorporates foreknowledge of the high. These last two columns are here to reinforce that the trades made by the Reversal strategy tend to be better than those *not* made by the strategy.\n\n|SPY|STRATEGY GAIN|DAILY (HOLD)|SPY NO SIGNAL|SPY NO BUY|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Average Change|0.201%|0.036%|0.004%|-0.107%|\n|Number of BUYs|1016|6207|4022|5191|\n|Winning trades|619|3373|2175|2565|\n|Losing trades|390|2814|1833|2608|\n|Win %|60.93%|54.34%|54.08%|49.41%|\n\nAs I mentioned in an earlier comment, this is a proof of concept under ideal conditions.

I think the reason it outperforms buy and hold with that is simply the trade selection. Waiting for the previous day's high to be broken seems to result in a higher likelihood of a profitable trade. It also means on days when the market just continues going down all day, the strat sits on the sidelines hence the lower drawdowns.\n\nI think potentially using these setups to enter and then hold for a few days or setting exits based on some kind of R:R could be quite profitable, at least from the trades I looked at on the chart. I just didn't get round to testing the various take profit methods. It would open up more downside risk though and potentially higher drawdown if it ends up holding onto a losing trade for longer. So some kind of stop loss may be needed to cut losses quickly.\n\nThe backtest I presented is the v1.0 that can then be built out with different variations to see what works and what doesn't.",

It's possible that the exit conditions in this strategy are what is limiting the upside and why it doesn't perform as well in a bull run as buy and hold. Since I exit at the end of the daily candle, I can miss out on a nice upward run.\n\nSo an interesting change to the strategy could be to hold onto trades for a defined number of days instead of exiting on the same day. Or perhaps using an exit signal (like a reversal in the opposite direction) to get back out. The danger here is that it also increases the risk because you could hold a losing trade for longer.\n\nThere's definitely some improvements that could be made to the strategy, so what I've presented here can be taken and built out further.",

It was a bit of an afterthought so I didn't include it in the test but for comparison purposes I should have accounted for them. Something I'll look to include in future backtests.\n\nAlso an interesting point about splitting out the crisis and non crisis periods. I'm developing my \"metrics\" function with each backtest, so I've calculated a lot more info on the strategies on this backtest compared to my previous backtests. It should be possible to \"group\" the data into individual years or sets of multi-year periods and compare the performance across the different groups.\n\nAppreciate the suggestions, gives me some things to think about :)",

I think with expanding the rule (so not more rules) to e.g. the total move should be at least x% of the price before entering, you avoid a lot of whip saws that many strategies suffer from results wise.",

Now in terms of the OPEN price, you do not know what the OPEN is until after the fact, and because it's a buy stop order entry you will not have a live order in the order book until after the OPEN. You really need tick data or 1 minute data to backtest this idea. Attempting to enter at yesterday's HIGH price also has the same issue. I would bet money on your live trading results significantly underperforming backtest results, live trading might even possibly be breakeven or loss making.

The high of that signal candle becomes my target entry point.\n\nThe day after the signal candle is where my entry happens, so I am waiting for today's price to go above the **high** of yesterday's signal candle.\n\nFrom that, there are then two separate things happening in the backtest:\n\n1. I check if today's high at any point went above yesterday's high. If it did, then it means that the entry must have been triggered at some point during the day (unless there was a gap, that's handled separately - see below). It isn't important at what point during the day this happened, all that matters is that at some point, yesterday's high was broken and a trade entered.\n\n2. I then check today's close and compare it with the entry price at yesterday's high. The difference between the two is the profit or loss. So if the day's high triggers the signal but the price then goes back down and closes low then the strategy makes a loss. If today's close is above yesterday's high, then the strategy makes a profit.\n\n**Caveat about gaps**: If today gaps up above the high of the signal candle then that messes up the entry, so you can't enter at yesterday's high anymore and instead the entry is taken as the open of today's candle.",

Getting backtests to not overfit and be an accurate estimate of live trading is challenging.",

            "text": "I'm starting a weekly series documenting my journey to $6MM. Why that amount? Because then I can put the money into an index fund and live off a 4% withdrawal rate indefinitely. Maybe I'll stop trading. Maybe I'll go back to school. Maybe I'll start a business. I won't know until I get there.\n\nI use algorithms to manually trade on Thinkorswim (TOS), based on software I've written in Python, using the ThetaData API for historical data. My approach is basically to model price behavior based on the event(s) occurring on that day. I exclusively trade options on QQQ. My favorite strategy so far is the short iron condor (SIC), but I also sell covered calls (CC) on 500 shares I have set aside for a down payment on an apartment just to generate some additional income while I wait. My goal is to achieve a 6.8% daily ROI from 0DTE options. For the record, I calculate my defined-risk short ROI based on gross buying power (i.e. not including premium collected). Maybe I should calculate it based on value at risk?\n\nSo this week was a week of learning. I've been spending a few hours a day working on my software. This week's major development was the creation of an expected movement report that also calculates the profitability of entering various types of SIC at times throughout the day. I also have a program that optimizes the trade parameters of several strategies, such as long put, long call, and strangle. In this program, I've been selecting strategies based on risk-adjusted return on capital, which I document [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1bwtrlu/best_metric_for_comparing_strategies/). I'm in the process of testing how the software does with selecting based on Sharpe ratio.\n\nHere's my trading for the week:\n\nMonday: PCE was released the Friday before, but the ISM Manufacturing PMI came out on this day. I bought a ATM put as a test and took a $71 (66%) loss. I wasn't confident in the results of my program for this event, so I wasn't too surprised.\n\nTuesday: M3 survey full report and Non-FOMC fed speeches (which I don't have enough historical data for). I was going to test a straddle but completely forgot. I sold 5 CC and took a $71 (67%) loss.\n\nWednesday: ISM Services PMI. I don't have historical data for this event yet, so I sold 5 CC and made $157 (95%) profit.\n\nThursday: More non-FOMC fed speeches. I sold 5 CC and made $117 (94%) profit. I wish I had done a strangle though. There was a  $9 drop starting at 2 PM. Later this month, I will acquire more historical data, so I'll be prepared.\n\nFriday: Employment Situation Summary. I tested my program today. I opened with a strangle and closed when I hit my profit goal, determined by my program. I made $72 (27%) profit. About 30 minutes before market close, I sold 5 CC for $47 (86%) profit and sold a SIC for $51 (13%) profit.\n\nStarting cash: $4,163.63\n\nEnding cash: $4,480.22\n\nP/L: $316.59\n\nDaily ROI: 1.5%\n\nConclusion: I didn't hit my profit goals this week, because I was limiting my trading while testing out my software. If I had invested my full portfolio, I would have had a great week. I will continue testing my software for another week before scaling up. I will still do full portfolio SIC on slow days, however, as I'm already comfortable with that strategy. Thanks for listening.",

You will make mistakes, your system will face drawdowns, the market will change from its past behavior. You must expect all of this, or your disappointment will lead to poor decisions. \n\nI'm glad you're documenting this. I think you should spend more time working with historical data and finding a well-defined strategy that gives you an excellent backtest. That would be an interesting process to document and for us to read about. I would actually look forward to it. But in the meantime, nobody cares about your daily P/L.

This is largely due to the position sizes that you would need to trade with in order to achieve such a result.  Learn about risk of ruin and kelly criterion.  Even if you have a positive EV, if you size your positions too high you can *still* bust your account. \n\nInterestingly, your advice to \"protect your capital\" is precisely why 6.8% per day is fantastical.  Protecting capital means, among other things, sizing positions in a way that mitigates risk of ruin.  This necessarily reduces your return.  \n\nYou can't have your cake (keep your capital) and eat it too (get crazy high returns).",

            "text": "Launched my algo live exactly one year ago. In addition to a personal milestone, watching it run live has been a completely different experience than watching test results. Some valuable lessons are learned only from observing live behaviors.\n\nMy algo is 100% automated. It trades a group of major forex pairs. Long, short trades are symmetrical. \n\nThe most important lesson is that live trading gave me clues on what to improve. Live trading slows everything down compared to testing. I was forced to observe the process instead of focusing on the results during testing. The wild swing of EURJPY in June caused a large drawdown. When I saw how it happened, it led me to an improvement idea. Another EURJPY swing happened in December again. My algo not only survived, but also profited from it this time.\n\nI run my algo on different broker platforms. The results are tangibly different. I believe it has to do with spreads and fees and interest rates. It was hard to tell from testing.\n\nAlthough the overall results conformed to the tested and expected behaviors, it is still eye opening to see how the market behaves thanks to live trading slows everything down. Something expected to be rare is actually not so rare. It was amazing to see how the market can go from dead quiet to neck-breaking speed without warning. \n\nIn conclusion, without risking too much, it is worthwhile to run your algo live regardless profitable or not. It gives you improvement ideas, confidence and experience that you can't get otherwise.",

The game is entirely different once one or two trades are taking away a month of good trades.\n2. Analyze the actual trades the algo made and see if there's room for optimization, e.g. \"can you write a rule that would have stopped 2 losing trades at the cost of losing 1 profitable trade. Is it reasonable to expect this rule to work in the future?\"\n\nDefinitely left with a practical trial/error and \"better not perfect\" philosophy rather than \"find the right complex algorithm\" philosophy.",

However, there is a HUGE caveat that is essentially a deal breaker for any serious research work I do: I\u2019ve encountered multiple data accuracy issues in their stock data. These can range from duplicate entries in their flatfiles to incorrect stock splits data, which makes the entire adjusted OHLCV history for many tickers completely wrong. Data issues reported on their GitHub seem to stay open for months, if not longer. In my opinion, if you're looking for the highest quality data, there are better options at the moment, at least for stocks. Hopefully, they will work harder to rectify these issues in the future, as data quality is the most important factor for most users, because I think the infrastructure they have to serve the data is very user-friendly and I'd love to be able to trust their data more.  \nPersonally for the least amount of data issues I'd use Databento, or IQFeed, Barchart, or Quodd/Nanex for cheaper options but with a good track record of being very reliable.  \nAnother notable mention is financialmodelingprep, data seems of good quality and they offer a ton of fundamental endpoints, for the price I highly recommend trying it, there's tons of value.",

In particular, it can avoid the big drawdowns that buy and hold gives you.\n\nIf your interested for real, I'll post some backtests of my momentum and trend systems just let me know.\n\nAlso for longer timeframes, it doesn't have to be THAT long - I trade a weekly swing that buys on Monday sells on Friday which uses weekly bars. You can even day trade using daily bars (buy or short on open, sell with MOC order). Or you can do something in between.\n\nAlgo doesn't care about timeframe, but retail commission costs and slippage does.",

The most concerning thing to me that I've found so far is in the stock splits, which for a few stocks are not correct, and then the entire adjusted ohlcv aggregate is computed in the wrong way because of it. It's just a lot of data sanity checks and debugging that I have to do to make sure something isn't majorly off with historical candles, and you'd expect they would do it for you in the first place. I briefly looked at the dividend data and it looks like there might be some issues there too, although that's less important to me. I can't speak for their realtime offerings or for other products, they seem ok at first glance. Nobody is perfect, but I'm gonna try other options for historical data (did not find the same errors with the splits with FMP for instance)",

Not 100% accurate but good enough.\n\nTheoretically, that filling-in could introduce an unreliable piece of data once in a while if that was some enormous 1s bar that's missing... but that's quite rare. Usually any missing data is during electronic trading / slow hours.\n\nConvenience factor is nice too; can load up around 60-90 days or so of 1s data in one screen, enable the strategy, a few seconds later its done spitting out the the CSV file (doesn't only export what's visible). (Way better than what I used to do with manually exporting chart data from TradingView - only what fits on a screen - that took forever to get 1s data for a long time range and was very error-prone).\n\nMain limitation is I can't seem to get it to show me 1s data past about a year, which means my backtests are very limited. You might be able to see back a lot further if you were using, say, 1m bars.   \n  \n(If anyone knows where to find older 1s data, let me know pleeease!)",

                    "body": "Hey u/TPCharts, given the frequency of mismatch you\u2019ve described, it sounds to me that the issue you\u2019ve described is likely that there\u2019s some kind of continuous contract roll adjustment being applied on NT\u2019s data. We don\u2019t ever apply roll adjustments to our data.\n\nAnother type of issue that may arise is that we extract our data from MBO, which is technically more accurate treatment of book depth for signal calculation and leaves the implied depth calculation to the client side, whereas we find that NT (CQG?) uses MBP which includes the implied depth. This, however, only affects apparent book depth at top 2 levels and shouldn\u2019t affect trade prints that affect OHLCV.\n\nOne other type of mismatch you may come across, not present here, is that many vendors don\u2019t calculate the daily OHLCV from tick data, which differs from the official settlement OHLCV published by CME which has a manual element to it and differs from the pricing and volume on the tick data. We publish both, and the official settlement values are in the statistics schema instead of the OHLCV schema.\n\nOne last possibility I can think of is to check if NT prints their OHLCVs with highest bid or lowest ask when no trade occurs. Some feeds do that. We only use the trades strictly for consistency.\n\nOtherwise yes, our feed is just constructed from CME\u2019s raw multicast feed, which is the ultimate source of truth, and we publish the sequence number so you can see that we didn\u2019t lose any packets. You can further cross-check that our tick data and MBO data has consistency with our 1s OHLCVs.",

I didn\u2019t become rich but I got exposed to things I was not aware before. Indicators are just tools. Would a carpenter say that about a hammer.",

Tight sl, hold till close. Results in ~25% wr and an average rr of 6, (which makes sense since when you look at the average daily returns % for spy since 1979, ~2500 days/11,000 have exceeded +-0.8%).\nMaybe now you get it. \n\nGiven the inherent randomness and Brownian motion of price movement, trying to predict is fundamentally impossible. All these people here will never achieve long term profitability because they want to try control the outcome of their trade. They think if they just find that price prediction strategy can work through every market condition they\u2019ll become rich. Reality is, if you\u2019re not willing to lose, you\u2019ll never win, and they want strategies that win. If you want consistency, the only way for that to happen long term, is to not predict anything and to have tight risk management. Price prediction is an illusion. Aligning yourself with randomness isn\u2019t. Direct exposure to volatility via CFDs/future derivatives is the most efficient way. Options maybe a hand ful per year but that\u2019s it. (Options way have more complexity and factors that make the odds even worse for you, like the decay and expiration, gamma etc). They give roughly the same RRs anyway. \n\nEnd of the day if you don\u2019t have privileged info the market doesn\u2019t already have, you have nothing else to use aside from capture the asymmetric returns of equities via Volatility of the open (if day trading). Anything else is just a bad speculation based on no actual objective behaviour or analysis. (Unless you have intrinsic information that that market doesn\u2019t)\n\nThat\u2019s just my approach anyway, but it\u2019s centred on reality and observed statistical analysis. As the saying goes, everything works until it doesn\u2019t. This entire sub is delusion, just like all the other trading subs. They have no idea.

            "text": "I tested the \u201cDouble 7\u201d strategy popularised by Larry Connors in the book \u201cShort Term Trading Strategies That Work\u201d. It\u2019s a pretty simple strategy with very few rules.\n\n\n\n**Setup steps are:**\n\nEntry conditions:\n\n* Price closes above 200 day moving average\n* Price closes at a 7 day low\n\nIf the conditions are met, the strategy enters on the close. However for my backtest, I am entering at the open of the next day.\n\n* Exit if the price closes at a 7 day high\n\n\n\n**Backtest**\n\nTo test this out I ran a backtest in python over 34 years of S&P500 data, from 1990 to 2024. The equity curve is quite smooth and steadily increases over the duration of the backtest.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xe3yo23uijud1.png?width=2079&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d9a9f928470ab89f0edf477f2ab677116ce4006\n\n**Negatives**\n\nTo check for robustness, I tested a range of different look back periods from 2 to 10 and found that the annual return is relatively consistent but the drawdown varies a lot.\n\nI believe this was because it doesn\u2019t have a stop loss and when I tested it with 8 day periods instead of 7 days for entry and exit, it had a similar return but the drawdown was 2.5x as big. So it can get stuck in a losing trade for too long.\n\n**Variations**\n\nTo overcome this, I tested a few different exit strategies to see how they affect the results:\n\n* Add stop loss to exit trade if close is below 200 MA - This performed poorly compared to the original strategy\n* Exit at the end of the same day - This also performed poorly\n* Close above 5 day MA - This performed well and what\u2019s more, it was consistent across different lookback periods, unlike the original strategy rules.\n* Trailing stop - This was also good and performed similarly to the 5 MA close above.\n\nBased on the above. I selected the \u201cclose above 5 day MA\u201d as my exit strategy and this is the equity chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zftwwf0ijjud1.png?width=2079&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd8a6bd0090fdddf5e42937336bca3b293fe7318\n\n**Results**\n\nI used the modified strategy with the 5 MA close for the exit, while keeping the entry rules standard and this is the result compared to buy and hold. The annualised return wasn\u2019t as good as buy and hold, but the time in the market was only \\~18% so it\u2019s understandable that it can\u2019t generate as much. The drawdown was also pretty good.\n\nIt also has a decent winrate (74%) and relatively good R:R of 0.66.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/db36u7iwijud1.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=1680e9dc6205c7fd725da246baa3034f5b3245ac\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting strategy, which should be quite easy to trade/automate and even though the book was published many years ago, it seems to continue producing good results. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of trades though and as a result the annualised return isn\u2019t great and doesn\u2019t even beat buy and hold. But used in a basket of strategies, it may have potential. I didn\u2019t test on lower time frames, but that could be another way of generating more trading opportunities.\n\n**Caveats:**\n\nThere are some things I didn\u2019t consider with my backtest:\n\n1. The test was done on the S&P 500 index, which can\u2019t be traded directly. There are many ways to trade it (ETF, Futures, CFD, etc.) each with their own pros/cons, therefore I did the test on the underlying index.\n2. Trading fees - these will vary depending on how the trader chooses to trade the S&P500 index (as mentioned in point 1). So i didn\u2019t model these and it\u2019s up to each trader to account for their own expected fees.\n3. Tax implications - These vary from country to country. Not considered in the backtest.\n\n**Code**\n\nThe code for this backtest can be found on my github: [https://github.com/russs123/double7](https://github.com/russs123/double7)\n\n**Video:**\n\nI go into a lot more detail and explain the strategy, code and backtest in the video here: [https://youtu.be/g\\_hnIIWOtZo](https://youtu.be/g_hnIIWOtZo)\n\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this one?\n\nHas anyone traded or tested this strategy before?",

In response, I offered a free solution to download daily OHLC data directly from my website [Stocknear ](https://stocknear.com/home)\u2014no charge, just click \"export.\"\n\nSince then, several users asked for shorter time intervals like minute and hourly data. I\u2019ve now added these options, with 30-minute and 1-hour intervals available for the past 6 months. The 1-day interval still covers data from 2015 to today, and as promised, it remains free.\n\nTo protect the site from bots, smaller intervals are currently only available to pro members. However, the pro plan is just $1.99/month and provides access to a wide range of data.\n\nI hope this comes across as a way to give back to the community rather than an ad. If there\u2019s high demand for more historical data, I\u2019ll consider expanding it.\n\n\n\nBy the way, my project, [Stocknear](https://stocknear.com/home), is 100% open source. Feel free to support us by leaving a star on GitHub!\n\nWebsite: [https://stocknear.com](https://stocknear.com)  \nGitHub Repo: [https://github.com/stocknear](https://github.com/stocknear)\n\nPS: Mods, if this post violates any rules, I apologize and understand if it needs to be removed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hwyjy0ma2snd1.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=da58f0603b1f78a7897a5100a49c86c04c09d72b\n\n  \n",

            "text": "Hey guys,\n\nJust backtested an interesting mean reversion strategy, which achieved **2.11 Sharpe**, **13.0% annualized returns** over 25 years of backtest (vs. 9.2% Buy&Hold), and a maximum drawdown of **20.3%** (vs. 83% B&H). In 414 trades, the strategy yielded 0.79% return/trade on average, with a **win rate of 69%** and a profit factor of **1.98**.\n\nThe results are here:\n\n[Equity and drawdown curves for the strategy with original rules applied to QQQ with a dynamic stop](https://preview.redd.it/ptsjrshdpn1d1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=675b9a055c17ecb18d7a5b683e6e206732d4df8d)\n\n[Summary of the backtest statistics](https://preview.redd.it/ky1f3cagpn1d1.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=709b17b15f012f157bfc7e5d2afcff3abe8f0b9a)\n\n[Summary of the backtest trades](https://preview.redd.it/igfihwuipn1d1.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c8fcf360a4c29fec75465321041f0c3899650f6)\n\nThe original rules were clear:\n\n* Compute the\u00a0**rolling mean of High minus Low**\u00a0over the\u00a0**last 25 days**;\n* Compute the\u00a0**IBS indicator**: (Close - Low) / (High - Low);\n* Compute a\u00a0**lower band**\u00a0as the\u00a0**rolling High**\u00a0over the\u00a0**last 10 days**\u00a0minus 2.5 x the rolling mean of High mins Low (first bullet);\n* **Go long**\u00a0whenever\u00a0**SPY closes under the lower band**\u00a0(3rd bullet), and\u00a0**IBS is lower than 0.3**;\n* **Close the trade**\u00a0whenever the\u00a0**SPY close is higher than yesterday's high**.\n\nThe logic behind this trading strategy is that the market tends to bounce back once it drops too low from its recent highs.\n\nThe results shown above are from an improved strategy: better exit rule with dynamic stop losses. I created a full write-up with all its details [here](https://quantitativo.substack.com/p/a-mean-reversion-strategy-with-211).\n\nI'd love to hear what you guys think. Cheers!",

                    "body": "Forget about the results. The methodology is more important than the results and you didn't really describe it anywhere. It looks like you made the beginner's mistake of not using a tripartite chronological training/validation/test split of your data. You performed your parameter space exploration using something resembling grid search over the entire dataset which you also performed your backtest with, which is a big no-no. Performing curve fitting with the test dataset will consistently yield amazing **Sharpe ratios greater than 2.0**. Unfortunately they hold **no predictive power** and will fail the paper trading test.\n\nI suggest you throw out all your current parameters and change your methodology such that you at least have bipartite chronological split with the fitting using data from, say, 2000 - 2015 and then the test being performed with data from 2016 - now. Be aware that even such splits still invite curve fitting because people will keep on tweaking the algorithm to improve the results with the second dataset, which will diminish their predictive power. This is why a tripartite split generally yields algorithms with greater predictive power.\n\nAlso, I would like to point out that any approach based on just OHLC data is unlikely to beat the market nowadays. For low frequency systems you generally want fundamental analysis and sentiment analysis in addition to price data. For high frequency systems the most important thing might be order flow data.",

Run it through a tearsheet library like quantstats. \n\nIn your article, with the long/short version the max drawdown is reduced but if you use, say, 3x leverage but the total return is still less than the long only version. I think the long only version with 2x leverage would be best. Max drawdown would be the same as S&P 500 but the total return would be much higher. Gotta take taxes and margin interest into account though, I don't know the calculations for this off the top of my head. \n\nNice work and thanks for sharing.",

Also the stop loss of lower than 300-day mean must be very wide during bull market, would you consider some kind of trailing stop instead?\n\nModified exit rule would be something along the lines: \n\n- trailing stop as a  rolling mean of high minus low (1st bullet) - or a fraction of it\n\n- potentially (but not necessarily) take profit of rolling low plus 2.5x rolling mean of high minus low (3rd bullet) - to make it symmetrical with entry rule\n\n- scrap the original exit rules \n\n  \nIt would be useful to see what's your skewness (or best and worst trade, or  the number for overall best/worst trade ratio that's missing in your per-trade stats). Mean doesn't tell the whole story, it might be heavily skewed by outliers. We like when those outliers are positive but not otherwise.\n\nMy guess is that you have few very bad trades, but the best are much smaller (negative skew). Better stop-loss, not necessarily the one suggested above, might improve this.",

It works fine if you have the stomach to make the buys on these short term pull backs, that takes balls and I think most people could not do it (it is scary!). It is not really overfitted as anyone can verify by examining how the results change as the parameters vary within an obvious reasonable range. The issue for me is that you can have many years sub 10%, eg for these params here I get 1.8% return in 2023. Nobody would stick with that strategy in reality... you would always be thinking maybe it's been arbed and I need to turn off the strategy. Or years '16, '17, '18, '19 results of 4.8%, 8%, -17%, 7.8%. It's not enough... need to be aiming at things in the 15-20% CAGR range to make it worth the stress and time of running the strategy.

This is a critical topic... if you start thinking you must pay up to 37% in capital gains if you trade short-term (<1 year) vs. up to 20% long-term (>1 year), you might end up giving up and just buying a low-cost ETF and forgetting about it until retirement. If you are too much concerned about it (and I'm not saying you shouldn't be), maybe algorithmic trading is not for you, because it will certainly mean you have to pay much more taxes than just buy & hold.\n\nNow, having said that, I don't think simulating backtests with tax considerations is a good idea. Let me tell you why I think so:\n\n1. It's personal. Every person has a different tax bracket depending on his/her tax planning strategies. So, 2 different persons might execute the same strategy and get totally different results (i.e. one pays 10% taxes, and the other 37%). This by itself is a no-go for me, as it will make it harder to compare 2 different backtest results (you might end up comparing apples to oranges without knowing it).\n\n2. It's complex to implement. It's not that the US tax rules for short/long-term capital gains are too complex (there are countries with way more complex rules), but writing the code to compute taxes will indeed add complexity to the code base and make the runs slower.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

But say we can complement this strategy with 2-3 additional strategies with similar characteristics, so that we could double the exposure to say 30%: this means we would be able to double the annual returns, reaching over 25%.\n\nLooking at the strategy as is, standalone, I'd say it is good but not great yet.

                    "body": "A very interesting discussion. In my opinion, it would be \u201cthe easiest\u201d for you to develop EOD systems on portfolios in the US stock market, e.g. all stocks or a basket from the S&P 500. Not only one individual stock or so. A portfolio of about 100 stocks or more. In addition, you should be very intensively involved with the system development itself. There are many pitfalls here. Examples include survivorship bias, in sample/out of sample and robustness tests. You can make a lot of mistakes here if you don't know what you're doing and how to do it properly. However, I can reassure you. If you take enough time and deal intensively with the subject matter (the principles of successful system development), you will achieve your goal. There are also numerous good books on this subject (e.g. by Perry Kaufmann, Kevin Davey, Prent Penfold and many others). Martyn Tinsley also has some very good videos on system development on YouTube. In addition, you should not have exaggerated expectations. Consistently getting 100% with 10% max. DD from the market is an illusion. The Jim Simons mentioned above had a return of just nearly 40% (after costs) over many years. And he was one of the best. Or look at the performance of all the legends like Warren Buffet. They are all between 20-30% p.a. (ok, Buffet is not a system trader but he is a benchmark). As a private trader, however, you can definitely achieve a performance of > 30% p.a. with EOD systems on US equities (averaged over many years, i.e. there can be years with -5%, but also years with 100%). That is more than realistic. In addition, you should definitely aim to trade several systems at once (e.g. 5 or 6). This smoothes the equity curve and reduces your risk. Before I forget, you also need a good data provider. If the data doesn't fit, your system won't work in reality. That's it in a nutshell for now. Just write if anything is unclear or needs explaining. Please don't be annoyed if an answer takes a little longer, but I will reply in any case.",

If you're dealing with too much volatility, add a volatility filter. If you need to figure out the trend, add a trend filter. Same goes with momentum and everything else. Just think outside the box.

Algorithmic trading doesn\u2019t automatically mean day trading, high-frequency trading (HFT), etc.\n\nThe confusion, I believe, arises from institutional algo/HFT users trading based on order flow. To me, this isn\u2019t speculative risk-taking in the traditional sense; it\u2019s closer to front-running, as in most cases, the buyer/seller is already lined up before a trade is initiated.\n\nThis confusion then trickles down to private traders, who don\u2019t realise that these algos/HFT strategies aren\u2019t trading the market per se, but are trading their own customer order flow. Private individuals don\u2019t have customer order flow to trade against, so when they try to replicate these strategies, they fall flat. I\u2019m not very popular in r/futuresTrading because I\u2019m always reminding them that in decades of speaking with banks, clearing members, exchanges, etc., I have never come across a single long-term (5 years+) successful (100k+/yr) day trader\u2014none.\n\nI\u2019ve even seen people from banks who were considered rock stars crash and burn once they started trading at home. When you\u2019re outside that bubble of order flow and privileged information, it can be very humbling.\n\nBack to the topic, while stories of supercomputers and HF/microwave links might make great PhD white papers, for the average non-institutional trader, your chances of making money go up exponentially on higher timeframes. It\u2019s embarrassing, but the little old lady with a share certificate in IBM that she keeps in her sock drawer and checks once a year has a better chance of making money than most futures/FX day traders.\n\nIf you\u2019re a non-institutional trader, drop the obsession with day trading, and absolutely drop the obsession with HFT.",

So I had this ballooning position just opening and closing every minute during a volatile period. I ended up losing over 40k.\nThis is a relatively new system I've been running since December. Luckily, I was up 200k for the year until the loss. I was slightly on tilt the nextday, and upped my risk, which resulted in another 13k loss... I'm not on tilt anymore.\n\nAnyone else lose/win due to dumb coding errors?",

It shouldn't be doing that. So I moved a couple things around and stupidly pushed to production... It completely removed my safety, 12 trades just opening and closing within a matter of two seconds and left me with a big position in the wrong direction. \n\nLuckily it was on a forward testing account, I won't be making that mistake again.\n\nMy problem was that I was thinking the code was in seconds so I was multiplying by 60 and 5 to get five minutes. I took another look at the coding resources and it was in MILLISECONDS. Doi! So that was my original problem, everything fixed and the cool down has been reinserted in the correct place. \n\nThe worst thing for me is just creating an anomaly in my data, but that's ok, that's why we test.\n\nSince it was in a paper account though it was honestly hilarious hearing all of those orders go out. Sorry to hear that you actually suffered some damage from what happened with you. \n\n\nFor you, I'm not sure exactly what happened but I have two safeguards related to stop losses. I try to have a limit but I also have a contingency that says if the price is a certain amount PAST my stop limit then cancel the stop limit and place a stop market. That way even though it may be a little more painful I'm making sure that orders are closing out. That at least saved me with the position size being too big, but the loss was way bigger than it should've been.\n\nMaybe something to consider.",
