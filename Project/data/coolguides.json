Also, because we\u2019ve come this far, I intend on adding the Harry Potter franchise, the Jurassic park franchise, and a futuristic timeline. Still trying to work out a futuristic timeline where things don\u2019t contradict one another (for example I don\u2019t want to do the planet of the apes movies even tho I love them because that kinda eliminates the possibility of any future human stories) , but at the moment I\u2019m thinking of Avatar, The Hunger Games, and Dune, possibly finding a way to slip alien movies in there??? Any recs or ideas are welcome for this part or the list as a whole.",

[Yes, really.](https://starwarsfanworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWTG56LegendsV1.pdf)\n\n> For years, fans have been debating just how long ago \u201ca long time ago\u201d might be. Nevermind that it is all \u201cin a galaxy far, far away,\u201d fans still would like to think that there is some way to equate Star Wars dates to our own. Originally, George Lucas\u2019 first story synopsis for the saga set the tale in the 33rd century, which is in our far future. Given that the story was later changed to take place \u201ca long time ago,\u201d the original date must be thrown out.\n\n> Ever since then, we have simply been left with the belief that \u201ca long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\u201d is just a different way of saying \u201conce upon a time.\u201d For those who are curious, though, \nthere have been two stories printed (and two other roundabout attempts) that have managed to equate Star Wars dates to our own. They are, however, stories that are considered Infinities (N-Canon), rather than anything C-Canon (part of the Legends Continuity). For the sake of argument, though, here\u2019s the lowdown on both.\n\n> The first attempt at this kind of conversion came in a Star Wars and Indiana Jones crossover story in the Star Wars Tales anthology comic book series.\n\n> In Star Wars Tales #19 (and later, reprinted, in the Star Wars Fan Club Special 2008), there is a story called Into the Great Unknown. In the story, Han Solo and Chewbacca are aboard the Millennium Falcon, when they are attacked by Imperials. They are forced to leap to hyperspace blind and end up in our solar system, where they crash on Earth. Once there, Han is killed by Native Americans and the mourning Chewbacca is believed to be a sasquatch (perhaps the Sasquatch, AKA \u201cBigfoot\u201d). Over a century later, the wreckage of the Falcon and Han\u2019s remains are found by the intrepid American archaeologist Indiana Jones.\n\n> We can infer a few dates from this, if we are so inclined (and since I was bored when updating the timeline at some point, apparently I was so inclined, or this wouldn\u2019t be here, right?). We can infer all of the following:\n\n> First, Han makes mention of America\u2019s forest (probably in Humboldt County, California, or somewhere close) as looking like Endor, which puts the story firmly after Han\u2019s first encounter \nwith the forest moon in Return of the Jedi. Since the Empire seems to still be going after them, we can also assume that the story is set before the events of Vision of the Future, when the treaty with the Imperial Remnant is signed. Since Han also mentions that he always figured Chewie would be killed saving Han or his kids, we have to conclude that the tale takes place sometime between 9 (more likely 11) ABY and 19 ABY.\n\n> Second, the Indiana Jones portion of the tale, when he finds the wreckage, can also be dated. I had once believed that it must take place somewhere around 1935, due to the fact that Short \nRound, the little kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which takes place in 1935, is with him in this story but not in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1936). However, reader Avery Goodman \npointed out two things to me: first, Indy refers to Atlantis technology, placing this story after Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis; and, second, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis has \nbeen set as taking place in May 1939 by Indiana Jones: The Ultimate Guide. Thus, I am agreeing with Avery in placing Into the Unknown in 1939.\n\n> Third, the story tells us that the Indy segment is 126 years after the Han and Chewie segment.\n\n> So, if we assume a date of 1939 for the Indiana Jones segment, then the Star Wars segment takes place in 1813. If we then split the difference of the date for the Star Wars segment to be 15 \nABY (halfway between Empire\u2019s End and Vision of the Future), then A New Hope must take place (using how similar Earth and Star Wars years are in length) around 1798.\n\nSo Episode IV is after Pride and Prejudice, before Master and Commander. Star Wars Episode III takes place in 1770, probably before Portrait of a Lady on Fire.",

This contrasts with representative democracy, where decision-making power is delegated to elected officials.\n\nPower and decision-making is decentralized, avoiding concentration in the hands of a few. Local communities and workplaces manage their own affairs, but cooperate with others through federations.\n\nIt opposes all forms of unjust hierarchy and coercive authority, whether in the state, workplace, or other social institutions. Anarcho-syndicalism seeks to replace these structures with more egalitarian and cooperative ones.\n\nEmphasis is on solidarity and mutual aid among workers and communities. This principle promotes cooperation and support rather than competition and individualism.\n\nBenefits\n\nBy giving workers and communities control over their own lives, anarcho-syndicalism empowers individuals and promotes autonomy. People are more engaged and invested when they have a direct say in decisions that affect them.\n\nAnarcho-syndicalism aims to eliminate social and economic inequalities by removing hierarchical structures that concentrate power and wealth and promotes a more just and equitable society.\n\nDecentralized decision-making can be more responsive to local needs and conditions, leading to more effective and efficient solutions. Local knowledge and expertise are better utilized.\n\nIn a system where workers have control over their work and see the results of their labor directly benefiting their community, the alienation often experienced in capitalist systems is reduced.\n\nWith decisions driven by the needs and values of the community rather than profit, production can be more sustainable and ethically aligned with social and environmental goals.",

These areas saw extensive worker self-management, collectivization of agriculture, and communal living.\n   - **Outcome**: While the Spanish anarcho-syndicalist experiments were ultimately crushed by the combined forces of Franco's fascists, internal conflicts, and lack of sufficient external support, they provided a notable example of large-scale anarcho-syndicalist organization. The immediate downfall was largely due to external military defeat rather than inherent authoritarianism.\n\n2. **Makhnovist Movement (1917-1921)**:\n   - In Ukraine, Nestor Makhno led an anarchist movement that successfully resisted both White and Red armies during the Russian Civil War. The Makhnovists implemented principles of worker self-management and anti-authoritarianism in areas under their control.\n   - **Outcome**: The movement was eventually defeated by the Bolsheviks, leading to the imposition of authoritarian communist rule. The Makhnovists were not authoritarian themselves; rather, they were overwhelmed by the authoritarian forces they opposed.\n\n### Claim: \"The principles of anarcho-syndicalism are nonsense and lead to terrible outcomes.\"\n\n#### Addressing Principles and Outcomes:\n\n1. **Empowerment and Autonomy**:\n   - Historical experiments in anarcho-syndicalism, like those in Spain, demonstrated that workers could effectively manage industries and services. Factories, farms, and even entire regions were run democratically and efficiently by the workers themselves.\n   - **Evidence**: During the Spanish Revolution, industries such as transportation, healthcare, and education saw increased productivity and improved conditions when placed under worker control.\n\n2. **Equality and Justice**:\n   - Anarcho-syndicalism aims to reduce social and economic inequalities by dismantling hierarchical power structures. The Spanish Revolution saw significant strides in gender equality and workers' rights, which were advanced through the anarcho-syndicalist approach.\n   - **Evidence**: Women\u2019s liberation movements, such as Mujeres Libres in Spain, achieved notable successes in advocating for women's rights within the anarcho-syndicalist framework.\n\n3. **Sustainability and Ethical Production**:\n   - Anarcho-syndicalist principles align production with community needs rather than profit motives, which can lead to more sustainable and ethically driven practices.\n   - **Evidence**: In anarchist-controlled areas during the Spanish Civil War, agricultural collectivization led to more equitable distribution of resources and better living conditions for the rural population.\n\n### Claim: \"Anarcho-syndicalism is anti-liberalism, anti-rights, and anti the principles that cause everything good in society.\"\n\n#### Clarifying Misconceptions:\n\n1. **Liberalism and Rights**:\n   - Anarcho-syndicalism does critique certain aspects of liberalism, particularly its tendency to perpetuate economic inequalities and concentrate power. However, it shares core liberal values such as individual freedom, democracy, and equality.\n   - **Evidence**: Anarcho-syndicalists advocate for expanding rights to include economic and social dimensions, ensuring that freedom is not limited to political spheres but extends to all areas of life.\n\n2. **Societal Principles**:\n   - Anarcho-syndicalism builds on the idea of maximizing human freedom and minimizing coercion, principles that align with the core values of a free and just society.\n   - **Evidence**: Historical instances of anarcho-syndicalism, though often short-lived due to external pressures, have demonstrated the potential for creating societies based on cooperation, mutual aid, and democratic participation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile it is true that many anarcho-syndicalist experiments have been short-lived and faced significant challenges, often due to external opposition and the complexities of implementing such systems in a hostile world, the principles themselves aim at creating more just, equitable, and democratic societies. The historical examples of the Spanish Revolution and the Makhnovist Movement show both the potential and the challenges of anarcho-syndicalism. The critique that anarcho-syndicalism inevitably leads to authoritarianism does not hold when examining these movements in detail, as they were often defeated by external authoritarian forces rather than collapsing into authoritarianism themselves.",

I have a bit of a suspicion that you used an ai, but that doesn't matter, the point would be the debate of the ideas, regardless. \n\nYour start here with \"Claim: \"Anarcho-syndicalism leads to coalition with other anarchists and Marxists in revolution\"\n\nHowever this was not my claim. I was not claiming the ideology itself leads to people forming coalitions, I was claiming that people who identify as anarcho syndicalists are one of the many flavors of people who are anti liberal and anti capitalist and dabble in revolution. Only leftists care about the distinctions here, all I see are people with bad ideas wanting to destroy everything good in the world. The fact that they hate each other is of no more consequence to me than the beef between protestants and catholics.\n\nI neither care about the distinction between different brands of leftist ideologies, nor do I believe they are real in practice. In truth, I wasnt even critiquing anarcho syndicalism specifically, rather my point was that all revolutionary ideologies, including more right wing anarchist ideologies and other rando malcontents, advocate for, then leap in to participate in, the deconstruction of societies whenever possible. The fact that the have disagreements with each other just means even more fighting in the warlord stage post revolution, and which particular flavor or color of authoritarian with whatever nonsense ideology is completely uninteresting to me. \n\nIf you want my personal critique of anarcho syndicalism specifically, I will sum it up quickly. I dont care about hierarchies, and i dont care about inequality, and I like private property rights and civil rights. I believe what you believe is a fairy tale, and that in practice will only lead to death and collapse, and after, at best, a period of stable poverty, before being overthrown.",

                    "body": "Thank you for replying thoughtfully and respectfully, I appreciate that. I just want to expand on some of my ideas and lightly push back.\n\n\n**Coalition Building and Revolutionary Intent**:\n   - The critique asserts that people identifying as anarcho-syndicalists are part of a larger group of anti-liberal, anti-capitalist revolutionaries, and that these distinctions are irrelevant in practice because all such ideologies lead to destruction and authoritarianism.\n   - While it's true that various leftist ideologies often find common cause in opposing the current system, it is important to distinguish between them because their goals, methods, and outcomes can be significantly different. For instance, anarcho-syndicalism specifically seeks to avoid the authoritarian outcomes seen in other revolutions by promoting decentralized, direct democratic control and opposing coercive authority.\n\n**Revolutionary Outcomes**:\n   - The claim is that all revolutionary ideologies lead to chaos, authoritarianism, and societal collapse, regardless of their specific doctrines.\n   - Historical evidence shows mixed outcomes for revolutionary movements. While some have indeed led to authoritarian regimes (e.g., the Bolshevik Revolution), others have demonstrated that it is possible to organize society in more equitable and non-authoritarian ways, at least temporarily (e.g., the Spanish Revolution). It is not inevitable that revolutionary movements will always lead to negative outcomes; the context and the ideology\u2019s specific practices matter greatly.\n\nSpecific Critique of Anarcho-Syndicalism\n\n**Hierarchy and Inequality**:\n   - You state a lack of concern for hierarchies and inequalities, and a preference for private property rights and civil rights, believing anarcho-syndicalism is a \"fairy tale\" leading to collapse.\n   - Anarcho-syndicalism's critique of hierarchy and inequality is based on the idea that these structures inherently concentrate power and wealth in the hands of a few, leading to systemic injustices. By promoting decentralized, worker-controlled structures, anarcho-syndicalism aims to create a more just and equitable society where power is distributed more evenly and decisions are made democratically. Historical examples show that worker self-management can lead to improved working conditions, higher productivity, and greater satisfaction among workers.\n\n**Private Property and Civil Rights**:\n   - You appear to value private property rights and civil rights, and suggest that anarcho-syndicalism undermines these principles.\n   - Anarcho-syndicalism does not necessarily oppose private property in the form of personal belongings but rather the private ownership of the means of production, which it argues leads to exploitation and inequality. By advocating for collective ownership and control of workplaces, anarcho-syndicalism seeks to ensure that all individuals have access to the resources they need to live fulfilling lives. Additionally, anarcho-syndicalism emphasizes civil rights and freedoms, aiming to expand them to include economic and social dimensions, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to participate meaningfully in society.\n\n**Practical Viability**:\n   - You argue that anarcho-syndicalism is unrealistic and would lead to societal collapse.\n   - While the implementation of anarcho-syndicalism faces significant challenges, historical examples like the Spanish Revolution demonstrate that it is possible to organize society along these lines, at least on a local scale. The failures of such experiments were often due to external factors, such as military defeat, rather than inherent flaws in the ideology. Moreover, many of the principles of anarcho-syndicalism, such as worker self-management and direct democracy, have been successfully applied in various cooperative and community projects around the world, showing that these ideas can work in practice.\n\n\nWhile it is understandable that there are concerns about the practical implementation of anarcho-syndicalism and its potential outcomes, there are specific goals and principles that differentiate it from other revolutionary ideologies. Anarcho-syndicalism aims to create a more just, equitable, and democratic society by empowering individuals and communities, decentralizing power, and promoting cooperative and non-coercive forms of organization. Historical examples provide evidence that these principles can be successfully implemented, at least on a local scale, and that the challenges faced are often due to external pressures rather than inherent flaws in the ideology itself.",

The NRA\u2019s political action committees\u2019 spending in 2024 has yet to be tallied. Looking back to 2020 gives a better picture.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDuring the 2020 election cycle, the NRA\u2019s Political Victory Fund PAC spent a total of $22,739,548.77 supporting or opposing 123 candidates and the NRA\u2019s Victory Fund super PAC spent $19,588,964.06 on 24 candidates.\u201d\n\n42 million is a lot more than 6 million (and any other number on this list). We know these number trend upwards over time too, this number is likely even larger this election year. They just dodge accountability\u00a0long enough so that by the time we see how much they actually spent, the election has been decided for a while.\u00a0They ARE spending piles of money, even if you don\u2019t see it reported yet.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Regarding the below comment about members supporting the organization: \u00a0\u201cMembership dues totaling\u00a0\n$83,274,950 contributed the largest percentage (39.4%) of the NRA\u2019s total revenue of $211,332,026 in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available (as of January 2024). The next biggest sources were $71.8 million from private contributions and grants (34%), $21 million from advertising income (9.9%), $18.5 million from program fees (8.8%), and $10.9 million from royalties (5.2%).\u201d\n\nYou can read more here:\u00a0 https://amarkfoundation.org/reports/who-funds-the-nra/\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Many of those private organizations and grants are foreign oligarchs and their \u201ccharities\u201d or weapons manufacturers.

One bad evening, and suddenly you're blacking out in the ICU with a bunch of tubes in you.\n\nIt's really difficult to learn to identify and fight the self-destructive urge to isolate yourself, to just kind of do nothing and let everything passively slip away, or just to feel like you're wasting everybody's time and energy but make no mistake; you are in danger.\n\nThat self-destructive part of you might tell you that nobody would care if you reached out to them, or that you'd just be a burden to them and that they'd only pretend to care, but what is really happening is that you are depriving them of the understanding of you that they need in order to make an informed decision of how to treat you. You might think you fear that everyone secretly hates you, but I think that your self-destructive subconscious is really just afraid that they *don't*, because it wants you to goad yourself into being so emotionally overwhelmed that you'll be able to push yourself over the edge.\n\nThe reason I'm stressing this is because, when you're in this situation, even though you are actively in danger, the reason you *get* that drive to push yourself over the edge is because a part of you *still needs convincing*. \n\nIn my case, I think was just being choked by expectations that, though they weren't conceived by me, I was actively holding myself to, and I was unable to extend to myself the empathy and care that I performed for others, unless it was a matter of life or death. And I guess I never *really* felt like my suffering was real without proof so tangible that it was impossible to ignore.\n\nSince then, I have genuinely internalized the lesson that I deserve all the kindness I can afford myself, and that at the end of the day, just because I *don't* want to *live* doesn't mean I *want* to *die*. And I guess those hospital stays were good for *something* because other than the overwhelming fear of living through the consequences of another failed attempt, it seems to have convinced the government that it's a lot cheaper for them to just pay me welfare so I can stay home and play video games all day, instead of making me go back to full time work just to pay the bills.\n\nI'd say I'm in the 2-4 90% of the time now... on the condition that I have no schedule and no deadlines and no expectations. I hate being unable to provide for myself and feeling like my life is stagnant, but every day I'm still alive is another day I'm learning about myself and what I need to thrive.\n\nThe thought of building your entire life back up from absolutely nothing might suck, especially when you're looking at having to pick up the pieces of your completely shattered self-image and aspirations and close relationships and career, but once you're actually there, you're just genuinely happy that you finally feel like you're moving forward.",

If someone feels like they're at or above that point, I would strongly encourage them to start investigating whether therapy or meds could be helpful to them, and to be reaching out to any trusted friends or family for distraction, venting, comfort, etc. \n\nPersonally I used to be at a 4, sometimes higher. Stress sort of broke my brain, and when I got too stressed out my brain would start the very unhelpful routine of going, \"hey, you know what would make you not have to deal with this? Being dead.\" I never considered it particularly serious because it wasn't usually persistent and it was never an impulse or an urge, it was more just in that intrusive thought category. \n\nBut since I started taking an antidepressant to help my anxiety, that just... doesn't happen anymore. I don't have those thoughts at all, and I'm down to a 3 at maximum. So if you're in that phase and you're just suffering through it, please consider that you may not have to suffer through it! It's entirely possible that there could be something out there that could help you get to a place where you don't have the added stress of needing to slap those thoughts away when things get rough.",

Like I have disinct memories of being in elementary school and wishing I was never born or that something would happen to me. It's been the background radiation of my life. Some days are certainly better than others, but most days if I'm not actively wishing to die I'm passively thinking about wanting something to happen to me. The amount of times I've gone to bed hoping, wishing, praying that I wouldn't wake up is inumerable. Whenever I consume media that involves people or characters fighting to survive, going to great lengths to stay alive, I wonder why they don't just give up, death is surely a better alternative. I have to actively remind myself that pretty much everyone else has a drive and will to live.\n\n\n\nI stopped taking care of personal hygiene, outside of showers and deodorant, in middle school. Why should I care about my teeth if I'm not going to be around for long? I reckoned. I only went to community college to appease my parents for a while, until I failed too many classes and they kicked me out. I've been coasting working dead-end jobs while my brothers have started their lives and are successful. I've had candid talks with my mother and one time in high school she got me a therapist, but I just ended up resenting it all and lying that I was feeling better and wanted to live to get out of it.\u00a0\n\n\nI've talked to my mom and have told her how I felt and she's made me promise to talk to her or at least someone if I'm not doing well. I'm her closest confidant and she says if anything happened to me it would be the death of her. I believe her, but I also can't help but feel like I'm being guilted into this. Guilted into an existence I never asked for. Like I said, I don't have the strength to do anything, even if I know nothing will matter in the peace of death, when my consciousness fades into nothingness. But it doesn't stop me from longing for it.\u00a0\n\n\nSorry for the rant, I've just been feeling this a lot the past few days and felt like this was the excuse I was looking for to get it out.\u00a0",

I'm effectively playing \"don't look at the ruined wasteland that is your life or else it takes form and tries to kill you\" and is running out of ways to outrun it once it gets going and makes me skyrocket to 8-10 short of just, going to sleep. I haven't done alcohol or drugs yet, but it might become necessary to survive soon enough.\n\nThe funny thing is, I felt _amazing_ during the pandemic, I had a job which gave me all the conditions I needed, a clear goal, direct positive feedback, no distractions (only person in the office), only saw people that were glad to benefit from my work... then the pandemic ended and conditions \"worsened\"... or rather went from once-in-a-lifetime exceptional to merely _normal_. It forced me to come to the realization that I hadn't improved but merely won the job condition lottery and spent the jackpot on doing a victory lap.\n\nThe more I write, the less I think our situations are similar... I also believe to be unable to provide for myself and that my life is stagnant, but ultimately, while I'm glad you're learning more about yourself, I feel like the more _I_ do so, the more that Damocles Sword of self-hatred and hopelessness hanging over my head risks breaking free.\n\n(Please don't let it take away from your own experience, though!

We developed brains that are capable of thought powerful enough to override our basic survival instincts for many purposes, some of them good, some of them less so. \n\nIf anything, I would consider suicide to be a sort of inversion of the survival instinct. When people experience such intense and prolonged suffering, whether due to physical pain, a malfunction of our exceedingly complex brains, or external circumstances that deprive us of hope and pleasure, the brain can begin to crave *any* solution to make it stop. \n\nFor us with our big brains capable of overriding our instincts, it can occur to us that death would make the suffering stop, even if it's at the expense of everything else. The survival instinct screams \"make it stop,\" and sometimes people act directly counter to the survival instinct to make that happen. Evolutionary adaptations happen because an animal develops a characteristic that helps it survive long enough to reproduce, and suicide definitely isn't that.",

It's the same with the pain and fatigue scales; 1 is \"I'm amazing!\" 2 is \"I'm pretty good!\" 3 is \"I'm occasionally not great but mostly fine!\" and 4 and higher serve to break down the varying degrees of Bad a person can be. \n\nIf you're doing really good and never think about suicide, you probably just don't need help communicating to a doctor/family member/friend/etc how suicidal you're feeling. You aren't feeling that way, so you aren't going to say \"yeah I'm at about a 2.5 on the suicide scale! Oh, what does that mean? Yeah it means I'm not suicidal at all and everything is fine :)\" \n\nBut if you *are* feeling some degree of suicidal and thus you *do* need to communicate with someone about it, these scales help give people the mutual language to talk about just how bad something that's a totally internal and subjective experience is, and how much help that person likely needs. The 1-3 gives a baseline of how it would feel if you had little to no suicidal ideation/pain/fatigue, because some people honestly have a hard time conceptualizing what that's like and just assume their suffering is normal, but 4 and above help facilitate detailed communication with caregivers and loved ones.",

I've seen countless failed attempts and their aftermath, each one enough reasons to never want to consider it ever again.\n\nLike I said: it's all brain pathways. The more you think about something, the deeper the groove is dug in your mind and the more comforting those thoughts become on their own.

Ultimately, the therapist (or whatever mandatory reporter you're in front of when you talk about suicide).\n\nSince it seems like this may be a matter of practical importance for you, I'll copy my comment from elsewhere. It gives direct advice on how to find a therapist if you want to discuss thoughts of suicide.\n\n---\n\nIf you want to find a therapist with whom you can safely discuss suicidal ideation, you can ask them in advance where they draw the line. You can ask them questions in a progressive series:\n\n\"Would you have a patient involuntarily committed if they said:\"\n\n* Sometimes I imagine myself dying.\n* I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up\n* I hope I die in an accident soon\n* I'm probably going to kill myself someday\n* I'm probably going to kill myself today\n* I'm going to kill myself today by jumping off the top of the building\n\nGood therapists will be direct with you in answering these questions. Sometimes, they will say, \"If you said such-and-such, I would need to create a safety plan with you.\" You can ask what that entails, and then you can decide for yourself whether you are okay with their procedure.\n\nIf a therapist is evasive when they answer these questions, they are probably not comfortable talking about suicide. These are the therapists that are most likely to have you involuntarily committed when it is not justified.\n\nYou can specifically seek out a therapist who specializes in suicidal ideation. And you can ask your therapist how comfortable they are working with patients with suicidal ideation.",

There is a path forward - it's self-compassion. It can seem impossible when you're already bone dry from feeling any kind of love whatsoever, so some measure of trust that your body will give you back a little bit of energy if you give it a little bit of kindness. Something tiny, like turning off the lights or getting yourself something to drink. *This does not cure how you feel,* it's a drop in a bucket that you will fill over time. Active compassion for yourself, practicing the mentality \"I am going to  ____ to take care of myself,\" as you do it. Forgive yourself when you struggle with this, too. It makes sense you have limits with everything you are carrying. One night at a time, put another drop in the bucket. When you feel you can add more, add more. We're here for you.",

Pillow is fine, but a blanket will stay lodged better than a pillow that could slip out if you roll.  \n\nI ended up with a weighted blanket I use for my legs, and it's lead to some of the best sleep I've had.  You wanna position it specifically, but once you do, it's like the comfort just suddenly clicks.  And due to its weight, it's even harder to dislodge, ensuring it'll likely stay between your legs.",

It went away almost overnight! \n\nI use a knee pillow *every* night now pre-emtively and the sciatica hasn't come back since! Pillow between the knees should be standard sleeping practice for every side sleeper imo.",

If it\u2019s your thumb through ring finger or a variation of those, you should consider wearing a carpal tunnel wrist splint at night it should keep your wrist in a neutral/straight position. If it\u2019s primarily your ring finger and/or pinky, then consider a neoprene elbow pad with the pad rotated to cover the \u201carmpit \u201cof your elbow to help keep the arm in a straight/neutral position. A lot of people say it\u2019s the \u201cwhole hand\u201d but I always challenge them to really focus on which fingers are affected bc it\u2019s usually not. Most commonly it\u2019s carpal tunnel which would be thumb to half of the ring finger or any variation of those fingers. There are many other places that could cause symptoms in the hand but carpal tunnel is the most common.\n\n*disclaimer* always recommend consulting with your doctor for these sorts of things. Could consider asking for a referral to a PM&R doc for further evaluation as they tend to be more conservative and look at the big picture. I am biased in those views though!\n\nI originally wrote this as a response to someone else but it does answer your question",

They beat the hell out of me too.\n\nMy doctor in Rifle refused to tell me that there are higher prescriptions than .5 clonazopam, despite me stating over and over I wasn\u2019t an idiot and if she just didn\u2019t want to prescribe me something else, she could just say no. I was upset but I didn\u2019t yell or anything, I just got up and left.  \n\nI left the appointment and the doctor put a medical hold on me out of spite. (To cover her ass she made a report stating I punched a wall and threw my cane, and despite her statement saying this was all being on camera, nobody would pull the tape when I requested it.) So while I was waiting for the bus, SIX officers showed up up, surrounded me, then tackled me from behind and proceed to kick me, punch me, and grind my face and body into extremely sharp stones. (I\u2019d like to point out that I\u2019m a disabled veteran WITH A CANE, and a cripple) but they felt that much force was necessary.\n\nI wasn\u2019t fighting back or anything, they just DESPERATELY wanted to prove how they were big men. I literally had to tell the idiots where my left arm was because they were just so happy to be hurting somebody, that they couldn\u2019t find it apparently. They hauled me back to the hospital, escorted me the long way so everyone could see, threw me in an empty room with a bed and I was stripped to my underwear. Two police and some of the hospital staff kept looking in and laughing at me until I lost my temper, then they closed the blinds to the door. Two hours later another doctor came in, drew blood and took a psych evaluation. After realizing my blood was clean they let me out immediately. \n\nTried to sue but the lawyer said that because of the medical hold, they were within their rights to do whatever they felt necessary. A friend told me a week after that, the cops were stopping everyone who matched my description and was walking; so now I just don\u2019t go back.",

Not only it takes away the nausea, but I also makes you very sleepy and you will have the best drunk sleep in your live. I drink every weekend a lot and this is by far my favorite counter",

                    "body": "I would also have to imagine that people aren't searching the literal term \"sports gear,\" because that's a pretty weird term - the poster may have combined various searches like \"baseball jersey,\" \"referee uniform,\" etc. In which case, there's absolutely no way to know whether those searches were done for masturbatory purposes. Same with something like \"balloons.\" The picture says it's just based on Google trends - it'd be more accurate to look specifically at Pornhub trends, or some other major porn site.\n\nAlso, I'm 100% positive that the word \"sounding\" was searched completely innocuously (probably as part of a longer phrase). It's already such a unique kink that even most BDSM people probably don't engage in (or view on porn sites), let alone a whole state of people. I think the same is probably true for something like \"wax play\" - that's a pretty unique term, making me think maybe the poster took any mention of \"wax\" to be for masturbatory purposes, or something. I doubt \"wax play\" is more widely searched than something like \"roleplay,\" no matter which state you're in. None of this makes any sense, really. \n\nAlso, I wouldn't be surprised if most of the Texas searches were actually for \"whipping cream\" for recipes or something like that (not that I'd be surprised that Texans are into whipping, but still).\n\nEdit after seeing some other comments: I think the poster may have only been looking at a handful of specific terms (and terms that tend to be searched more often by gay men), and that's why some of these states have such odd fetishes as their \"most-searched\" fetish. Though that still doesn't really make sense, because there's just no way that \"sounding\" would be more highly-searched than something like \"roleplay\" in any state. No way. So maybe it's a mixture of only looking at some specific terms, and also misunderstanding some of the results (like \"sounding\" just being part of a longer search - people may have searched something like \"parakeets sounding like humans,\" and since the word \"sounding\" is part of that search, the poster counted it on this map).\n\nDouble edit: Just realized, it's possible that this person was only looking at the google trends over the course of one day (or hell, maybe just over the course of a few hours or so), so it's not like an accumulation of a year's worth of searches. Any given day/hour can have some odd things popping up more often than usual. That would make much more sense.",

So you can give as many thumbs up as you want.\n\nThe Corna Is not just \"I'm having an affair with your wife\" but also used to talk about someone who's having an affair, and in a few cases just to say \"you're an as*hole\". It is also recognized as the rock gesture but you gotta be in the right context. \nI'd also like to say that if you raise your thumb while you're doing the Corna It Is a gesture associated with liking someone (not in a romantic way)\n\nThe fig sign had that meaning in the past and in some areas but most Italians wouldn't understand the gesture, before doing a quick research I was so confused reading it because I had never heard about it.\n\nThe \"me ne frega\" gesture's meaning is accurate even if the way the gesture is made can slightly change depending on what region you are in.

Friends (or family) may use it sometimes if the other friend does something really dumb. For example, \"I bet 1000$ on Blackjack and lost\" would elicit a \"\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\" and a \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b6\u03b1 response.

As luck would have it for the English, the heavily armoured French knights got stuck in the mud, attempting to charge them. Whilst they were stuck, the longbow men filled them full of arrows. Once they'd rounded up and captured what was left of the French, the longbow men went around waving their first two fingers in their faces to say 'Up yours you French twat.'\n\nAnd thus the two fingered salute allegedly was born as a way to non verbally say. Go fuck yourself.\n\nI would just like to reiterate this is supposedly where it came from.\n\nAs a Brit, the wanker sign is best rude gesture.",

Ask people somewhere in the world \"but what O.K. means?\" and they will be looking at you like you have 5 heads and 3 tails. Because people don't give a shit ;) They like things that are easy to replicate.\n\n\nThe gesture apparently comes from the Anglo-French history, where the middle finger was needed for use of English longbows. And the name comes from: \"pluck yew\".",

He was wearing a bright yellow swimsuit when I left my husband on shore to watch him and went into the water to play with my niece (you can see where this is going). Husband turned his back on our son for a moment to take off his shirt and put it by his shoes, son took that moment to go run straight into the water. When I looked over, I could not see my son. Until I was able to spot his bright yellow swim shirt under the water, where he'd gotten knocked over by a wave and pulled under and was stuck, trying to get up and just getting knocked down again and again, never able to surface. I screamed for someone to get him as I ran over as fast as I could in the waist deep water, but no one else saw him but me. He coughed up some water and was fine but it was a nightmare, and because of that experience I will never buy my children a blue or gray swimsuit and always opt for bright orange if I can. **It can take as little as 30 seconds for a toddler to drown.**\u00a0",

It's very true that if he was much further out than where he was I might not have been able to spot him anyway, he was only stuck in a spot maybe one and a half feet deep. But drowning happens super quickly and easily for little kids so I'd argue that any additional edge you can possibly gain would be worth it, especially if it's something that's as low effort/cost as \"do I pick the blue or the orange swimsuit\". Also I'd imagine it's even more applicable for a local swimming pool context.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nDefinitely won't help you one bit if you fall overboard in the middle of the ocean, you're right about that. Or if you're swimming out by the buoys in the lake. But you're kinda hosed in that situation no matter what anyway.\u00a0",

I am NOT even a little bit trying to advocate for swim suit color as the only line of defense against child drowning. That's stupid. But we did take our eyes off him, he did sprint into the water and get knocked down, and I did spot him because of his bright yellow swim suit. The only reason I spotted him so quickly was because I was constantly scanning the shore because I knew how much he loved the water and I knew it would be easy for my husband to lose track of him. The attention was the most important part. The swim suit color helped, that's all. I am NOT trying to negate your experience as a life guard.\u00a0",

Always say how you\u2019re like a family with your current coworkers and genuinely enjoy the working environment, that it pushes you to become a better person and worker. You feel as though this opportunity gives you more room to grow.

Try and figure out if the interviewer/interview panel is middle managers, HR people, or team leads/subject matter experts and tailor your responses accordingly. This is especially helpful when the job is highly technical or requires some kind of specialized skillsets. \n\nEspecially with large companies, it is pretty common for HR to do a first interview and filter people out. But these people likely have NO idea about the specific skills needed for that job. For these people, read the job description thoroughly. Do your best to use the exact terms/phrases that they have listed in the text. If they use acronyms, you should use the same ones. If they spell out the full name of a common acronym, you should do the same with your verbal responses. If they ask about strengths/weaknesses, give your responses in general personal terms. Things like your work ethic, problem solving, etc. If you're interviewing with a SME and they ask the same, call out specific technical skills. i.e. \"my greatest strength is that I am an absolute wizard at debugging code written in object oriented languages\". \n\n* HR: Wants someone that checks off the boxes they see on the job description\n* Middle Manager: Wants someone that is competent, doesn't create problems for their manger, and works long hours with little thanks. You don't have to actually BE that person, but make them think you are.\n* SMEs: Wants competence and someone who can work independently. They want someone who will not need their help on every little task.",

So, because you're naturally good at talking to people you might be wholly unaware that some people need to prepare it ahead of time. \n\nAlso, this is a part that not a lot of people talk about IMO. There are two people in the interview, you and the guy asking all the questions. And the guy asking all the questions is just some dude who had to prepare for the interview too, he prepared by putting together a list of questions that don't normally get asked and which are all intended to find a person's limits, test their ability to think on their feet, test their ability to socially interact in uncomfortable situations, or articulate themselves, or think outside of the box like they would have to do on the job.\n\nI often get sucked into conversations about the importance of higher education in the run of the mill work force, I think this is similar. For the most part, the specifics of a person's undergraduate degree are unimportant, the important part is the person got it. Harvard? University of Miami? Doesn't matter, they are the same... The only thing that matters is that a person got it, because it shows a particular set of BASIC SKILLS ...\n\nIn the same way that preparing for an interview by brushing up on interview questions shows a BASIC set of skills.",

Even different batches of the same strain can have far different concentrations due to grow conditions, how the material was processed/dried, how it was stored and how long, etc. \n\nIm getting fed up with all this semi legal drug nonsense popping up online with a bunch of foolish brand new buisness/investment types thinking they can get in early and make millions by convincing folks its safe to microdose shrooms or therapeutic ketamine or counseling mdma sessions when they know absolutely dick with freshman level understanding of drugs and their effects. Amatuer hour needs to get shut down because these dbAgs spreading faulty info can get people hurt or worse and ultimately will end up causing prohibition to be reinforced by lawmakers panicking because bad info is causing harm and overdoses and overreacting in punitive harmful fashion is the only way politicians know how to respond to pearl clutching outrage from ignorant public voices demanding drugs be eliminated from society. \n\nNot a \"cool\" guide, this is foolish misinfo that can lead to people harming themselves accidentally.

Had surreal experiences while at home and experienced a better understanding of myself and especially my look on myself. I\u2019d always been slightly upset with how i looked, during the 5 hours i was awake i absolutely fell in love with myself.

(3 year period, around once a year, not gonna do it this year cus i dont feel a need or want but i\u2019m definetly going to do it again at some point)\n\n(The reason i mention the weed is because it gave me some slight experience in how to keep myself happy and optimistic, away from any bad vibes or feelings, wich really helped make and keep it a good experience.)",

At least for me. Everyone can have different reactions. \n\nExample, I've taken 4-5g multiple times and have never experienced Heavy Hallucinations just the warped/kaleidoscopic visuals. I've also only had Ego Dissolution/Death once, the first time I tried that dose, and it was more mild than others have described. It wasn't a scary/ bad time for me. It just kinda made me more aware of who I was/am, why I was/am that way and how to best address my problems/insecurities. I came out of it a more well rounded, empathetic and open minded person.\n\nOthers also sound worse/more intimidating than they are, at least in my experience. Disconnecting from Reality for me was just laying on a couch listening to music and only experiencing the feeling of comfort and the music. It was the most relaxed and comfortable I've ever been. Zero scariness/negativity to it at all. I still remember how great that feeling of total serenity was a decade later.\n\nTLDR: Your mileage will vary, so to speak. Try not go in with many/any expectations. Be in a relaxed state of mind in a safe space and experience it as it comes. As long as you are not schizophrenic etc you will be fine in the end and perhaps even better for it as I was.",

There was a lot of yelling \"shiver me timbers\" and \"I'll keelhaul the lot of ya\"\n\nand then I sat down in front of the bathroom mirror and laughed at my face while it morphed through impossible proportions and angles.\n\nI also listened to a lot of music, to try to improve my tone deafness and difficulty with exposure to certain sounds. It helped a lot.\n\nIt's been almost twenty years and I still very much want to do it again, but that first time was so good I'm not sure another round is worth ruining the lasting joy of that first experience.

You build up a tolerance to mush very quickly so if you trip multiple times within the span of a couple weeks you're going to need to take higher doses in order to trip as hard. Most I ever took was a quad (7g) and it did not effect me as hard as when I had taken an eighth of the same batch just weeks before. \n\nAlso... to be as straight with you as I can, there is absolutely no description for a mush trip that will prepare you for what the experience is like. Not just because it is different for everyone, but because the experience is something you just straight up cannot imagine until you have tripped. Its a great experience imo, and one that has altered my perspective on life entirely, but at some point I took my last trip and I'm happy I have moved on. Mush is weird and wild and quite possibly the most fucked up I have ever been in my life (apart from Salvia). But at the end of the day just keep in mind that you're literally poisoning yourself. You're just on drugs, and no, you are no more \"in tune\" with anything, much less the universe, than before your first trip. Be safe and have fun :)",

But if I have to pick one, the Golden Teacher has been the one that gave me the best experience.\u00a0 Penis envy gave me both absolute terror and absolute heavenly bliss euphoria.\u00a0 They all feel about the same, the difference is in the intensity and come up\u00a0 and which end of the happy/fear spectrum . You can take 2g of GT and it will feel different every time. You will be within a certain range of feelings but it won't be exactly the same. If you took 4g it will also be within a certain range and not be the same, and so on.....but once in a while you'll have a suprised experience you never expect at either a low or high dose. I've experienced mushrooms for over 35 years and never gone over 5g. I record dose, time and what mood I'm in .\u00a0 I know...but most were great! .mush love\u00a0",

                    "body": "I recently split a mushroom chocolate bar with a couple of friends one night. I'd done mushrooms like 3 times over the years prior to this, always around the 1g museum dose range.\n\n\nThe entire chocolate bar was supposed to be 6g, was called penis envy. I had a couple of bites equivalent to what I thought would be about 0.5-0.75g. However, after a half hour it hit me hard and fast. I was at that \"museum-level\" high very fast, and I knew I wasn't near peaking yet, and my high zipped right on past that into the megadose range, or maybe further I don't know. I had a corner of the chocolate bar and pretty much got the whole dose I think; my two friends barely felt anything. Might've been an issue with how it was made.\n\n\nSo about 1 hour after eating, I am at the level 5/6 range now. I am extremely nauseous and vomit a bit. I lose most of my motor function, walking becomes too challenging because I am either dizzy or can't use my legs right, I am not sure, so I go lay down in bed. The whole world around me is engulfed by hallucinations; patterns emerging from the walls overwhelm my vision so I close my eyes. I am in a complete dream state now, feeling like I have left my body into this realm of just light and orbs, and there are other orbs of energy around me that feel like they're other souls. All collecting to a center pillar of light. I sense this light is the source of truth of reality; it has the answers in it to the meaning of life. And I sense it is all just made of pleasure. It was chaotic but somewhat comforting to see. Keep in mind as much as this is a \"dream\", I am not asleep. I feel totally awake and just vividly there as an orb outside of my body in this new realm, I became that light. This light feels like the foundation of everything \"behind the scenes\" of reality. It is the foundation of ethics, morals, obligations, everything is \"above\" this pillar beyond my view, and many levels above it beyond my vision is our true reality. I feel elsewhere, like I have broken through to a place that \"controls\" our world.\n\n\nEvery now and then my friend would check on me. Then I would open my eyes, and they'd be there, but their face would repeat in my vision a thousand times and overwhelm my vision. I would take up most of my field of view; eyes open and eyes closed was similar in intensity, and the room is barely identifiable now.\n\n\nEverything is surrounded by kaleidoscopes of light and colors shifting shapes and colors chaotically. I feel my body still somewhat, but it feels like my limbs have all melted together. My senses are confused, I feel hot, cold, sweaty, dry, uncomfortable, pleasant, relaxed, anxious, all at the same time. I can't quite figure out my thoughts; they're fragmented and chaotic. I am afraid, but I know what is happening and I don't resist it. I try to just observe and just watch what is happening and feel what's happening. I didn't plan for this, but I had informed myself enough to know in advance how to handle a high dose just in case. Messing with psychedelics is no joke and it can be extremely intense so I didn't want to experiment whilst unprepared. You just need to let go and let it happen.\n\n\nIt was a very intense experience to lose sense of control and lose sense of your body, feelings, and even your own self. That's what I'd call ego death. You really just don't understand yourself anymore nor your surroundings or the inputs going into your brain from your body. I was in bed like that for about an hour, but for me it felt like about 3 or 4 hours I think.\n\n\nAfter that, I was able to get up and enjoy some time with my friends since the nausea was going down. I was tripping for another like 3-4 hours, seeing visuals everywhere I looked, but these hours were very pleasant and amusing. Plant leaves were melting, my phone's keyboard was impossible to use cause the letters kept changing, and the colors are all changing fast. The floor, and most objects, were bubbling and waving, growing larger and smaller, and each tile on the floor had it's own animations in it like a cartoon. Specs of dust would turn into little swirls of fractal patterns. The visuals were very interesting and I found myself just sitting and looking at fabrics, and various objects around the house and watching them animate. I would go to each room and feel the energy of the room, each one was so different. I would think \"hot\", and everything would turn a shade of red. I would think \"cold\" and it would all go cool like changing the dial on a white balance meter. During this phase though, I got bad diarrhea and had to use the bathroom frequently. My body was not happy with what I ingested. But it didn't ruin this phase of the experience, I just remembered to remain hydrated. Mentioning this as a PSA for anyone that get's to this point.\n\n\nI dosed at about 7:30pm and it finished around 1am and I slept well. The days following, I spent time to reflect on the experience. I was something I don't plan to do again, but it certainly left an impact on me in a very good way.\n\n\ntldr; if you're gonna do shrooms, just eat the mushrooms or make tea. Don't trust those baked goods, you can't dose properly. If you end up dosing higher than you intended to, just remember: You aren't dying. You aren't in danger. You can't stop what's happening. Don't resist it, just let it happen and observe. You need to just let go and it will end. Just ride it out, and let it take the wheel for a bit.",

I have taken large amounts of many different psychedelics on many different occasions, and have experienced what I consider to be ego death a handful of times.\n\nImagine being broken down, atom by atom, until there is nothing left of \"you\" but a point of awareness... realizing that the difference between what you have hitherto thought of \"you\" isn't unique or substantially any different from what you have believed to be anyone, or anything else. The real \"you\" that remains is the same substance of everything else... and then Imagine feeling a profound connection with that infitesimal but fundamental \"you-ness\" that exists within everyone and everything. There is no longer \"otherness\", you and the other are the same. I think this is what folks refer to as \"oneness\". There is no then or before. Only the present moment - the expansive \"now\" in which this whole miraculous pattern takes place, ever changing. \n\nAnd then Imagine being overcome with love for that self that exists in everything... love for it it and it's love for you (this is kind of where the words break down for me, because there is only the oneness and the love. Love for another, love for myself, and being loved are all different sides of the same coin, so to speak.) That love is not like romantic love, or familial love. I've heard it called \"agape\" - the love for/from God. It's almost physical. It's *incredibly* overwhelming. Everything vibrates to the frequency of that love, and it is bliss. \n\n...and then you slowly come down, and regain a sense of your body, a sense of having likes, dislikes, memories of the labels we apply to ourselves like our names, and roles - job titles, brother, son, etc. But an echo of the love still remains. Ideally we have some grapes, or cheese and crackers and warm tea handy, cause it's been hours (though it may have years or minutes for all that matters in the midst of the experience). At this point I like to have some nice, calm music, and maybe a big fluffy blanket and a friend, loved one or pet who I can cuddle up to and share in that transcendental love, and catch a glimmer of the \"sameness\" in their eyes, and I'm reminded we are fundamentally One. But during the experience I prefer to be alone and to minimize distractions that will pull me away from the experience - dim lights or dark, very soft nature sounds or silence, light loose fitting clothing or just a large blanket. \n\nIt is absolutely necesarry to make sure there are no obligations or appointments for the entire day, and the next day. After some sleep I might like to make a light breakfast and go walk in nature. Feel the breeze, and allow myself to be present in this moment. For weeks/months after the experience, I tend to wear my \"self\" like loose and comfortable old clothes. Things which seemed  super important become trivial, I tend to not get overly excited or upset about much. There is a gentle evenness to the days.",

I had experimented when I was younger, just forgot everything. \n For me, the initial trip was cool, bubbles, squishy, like watching the world turn into bubbles. Then blast off!! My consciousness left my body! Then something stopped my brain, it was like something was, for all intends and purposes, stopped it. That was the peak, the fall back to reality was completely life changing. Like it was complete horrible death, very vivid, very painful, shocking, betray of trust. \nIt felt like like episode on Rick and Morty, where Morty jumps dimensions after he made bad choices, except it was more like I kept realizing death, and would wake up and die a different way. Snake (massive)strangling & swallowing me, a good friend executing me, beat to death by intruders, poisoned by lover (now ex, cause I guess my dumbass called her during it), there's more, but they were truly fucked!\n\nAnd then it was like I awoke into a brand new world. Everything felt brighter and different. Since, my mood has changed. I don't sweat any issues, and everyday feels like a good day to be alive. I don't really know how to describe it. I don't recommend doing that much, especially solo, but my brain thanks me for it. I feel like I can connect with others a little better, and my dreams are way more vivid now.\n\nAnd I've tried to trip once, and there was nothing. Just like I was observing above my body while it was in automated mode. Hard to explain.",

I knew that I needed to experience this is some form and I usually prefer DMT for the calmer and short experience that can get close to ego-death or more enlightenment. I got a 5g chocolate bar from a medical provisioning center and set aside a day where my wife would be present to monitor everything and made sure it was a nice day if I wanted to go to the park or outside. \n\n  \nThe start of the trip is always awkward, for me it feels like the slow ripping off of a band-aid, where your body feels a bit uncomfortable, you start to get anxious as your mind can tell something is changing and different. Once the band-aid is off, there's the removal of the \"shield\" or mask that prevents you from acting in a more natural and childlike state than you normally would. Playing with bubbles, listening to music, walking around in the grass and closed-eye visuals are awesome at this point.\n\n  \nA few hours later, I was starting to get intense visuals, strong visceral reactions, and some sensations of worry. At this point I knew that I essentially needed to face \"self\". Informed my wife I was going to lay down and asked her to check on my every so often. Went to the mirror and stared at myself. Wondering about my past, who I was, how I looked, what I have done, what would I do? I then laid down and closed my eyes and began to face it.\n\nMy visual was of a Maori tattooed, horned face/mouth that would repeatedly open like it was about to devour me. The sensation of wanting to purge came with each opening. For me, this process is like facing your inner demons, accepting what they are, and mentally purging them from your psyche. This can be so profound your body might want to replicate it. I've done it a few times and knowing this stage, accepting it, and placing myself in a proper and comforting place makes this way easier to pass.\n\nAfter about an hour, a very massive wave of relief and comfort passed over me. I still had some strong visuals and emotional heightened senses during the \"glow\" phase to end it. For me it is about the journey. You knowingly took this that will take your mind somewhere else, it won't last forever, and there's a purpose. It's up to the individual to find that purpose. For me, I like to surround myself with those who are on the same journey of self-discovery and self-acceptance. There are some people who just want to get fucked up.\n\nMy two cents, hope you enjoyed it and if you have any questions, let me know.",

I get a weird feeling of \u201cthis is gonna be an all day thing, do I really want to do this today\u201d\n\nThat feeling turned into \u201cokay shit I really don\u2019t want to do this now.\u201d Then I felt serious fear and more fear and then I got higher and higher. Then, I couldn\u2019t remember where I was or what I was doing. My brain was in panic mode and my mind was absolutely racing, visuals were starting to go nuts. Not remembering much at this point except what I was experiencing, my mind began to tell me I was dying and this was the afterlife. \n\nWith the last of my memories. I reflected on my loved ones, I thought of my mom, and as I entered \u201cheaven\u201d I swore I could hear my Grandmothers voice. I remember just standing outside of my car as the sun is rising, barely able to move. My \u201clast\u201d action was to call my mom and tell her \u201cit\u2019s so beautiful, it\u2019s so beautiful, heaven is just like the land, everything\u2019s okay, it happened, I died\u201d\n\nAs she was calling my name on the phone screaming \u201cwhere are you?!? Where are you?!?\u201d I lost control of my muscles and just dropped the phone. \n\nThe experience afterwards is where my ego death truly started. I not only forgot where I was, what I was doing, etc, I forgot WHO I was, WHAT I was. So I no concept of what a \u201chuman\u201d was. I couldn\u2019t feel my body, I could only understand myself as a concentration of energy.\n\nI looked around and I was surrounded by tall pine trees, it was absolutely silent and I can still remember the intense peace I was feeling my. Not happy, not sad, but just extremely at peace with the fact that I am energy and have always been energy. Since I was surrounded by trees my mind told me that I too was a tree. Since I couldn\u2019t feel things physically, I could imagine my roots growing into the ground. I could feel myself growing towards the sun and I was so fucking grateful to be surrounded by other trees just experiencing existence. \n\nThen I got stuck in a \u201ctime loop.\u201d My brain started racing, in my experience it absolutely felt as if I was experience all of time passing by, until the last star in our universe exploded until the universe restarted and came back to the exact moment I was tripping. I went through that loop hundreds of times. I still feel that I was shown a cycle, that existence is a cycle. I remember the release of all guilt and all pride, it was just such a blessing to even exist to be a part of this cycle, because I am the cycle and the cycle is me. \n\nThen my memories came back a little and my brain told me that the recently arose sun was a nuclear bomb that NK had just set off, that shifted to me thinking I was a scientist who had been working on nukes and that we fucked up and blew up the world. \n\nI don\u2019t remember much after that, my mom did find me later. She told me I was just muttering to myself walking in a circle. \n\nI had another pretty insane trip like that too. Good times.",

Also had 2 friends with me who took way less, and I remember seeing them check in on me although I was completely out of it.  1 hour seeming like forever...  and definitely a period where I thought I had for sure died and was experiencing some afterlife thing, then coming back to reality and being super grateful for being alive.  Also glad I had the experience but not looking to do again any time soon",

Just wave it away like every other gnat\u201d and then I went on to have an incredible trip and never once thought of him again during it. \n\nAnd literally ever since then my perspective about that guy totally changed. We used to be arguing all the time and suddenly I didn\u2019t care. I was like fine dude whatever you wanna do I\u2019ll make it happen even if I disagree, it\u2019s just not worth my energy anymore. And magically he started to be nicer to me lol. Crazy how that happens sometimes, you stop putting out negative energy yourself and the reaction you get totally changes. \n\nEventually I was able to journal through what specifically was triggering me about him, and while he was slightly annoying he wasn\u2019t abusive or anything and my pain was coming from past experiences (aka the definition of getting triggered \ud83e\udd23). And yeah\u2014 slightly annoying but pretty much harmless. \n\nDude was totally a gnat!\n\nAnyway later we ended up with a great working relationship and I don\u2019t doubt he\u2019d give me an excellent recommendation if I ever needed it. \n\nAll because of one mild trip.

It's not an easy thing to do and I know some people who have tried to speedrun their experience by taking a hero dose from the jump. Definitely not recommended because without having worked out other aspects of your mental health an ego death experience can actually do far worse damage.

When I laid down I had a hard time remembering to breathe, but I slowly just kind of surrendered to it. As I was going down, I asked my fianc\u00e9 to put some music on. This song called guyute by Phish came on. It\u2019s about an ugly pig. \n\nAs I dozed off, into a galactic slumber I\u2019ll call it, I met Guyute - the ugly pig. He looked like a massive Pig/Octopus god. I had ai do a rendering of what I saw. I can send you it if you\u2019re really curious. It\u2019s not exact, but it\u2019s pretty close. Anyways I met that thing and it kind of conquered my soul. At first I was horribly frightened of it. Then I kind of learned it was just fucking with me. It represented some of the bad things inside of me, and if I just know that they exist and learn to laugh at my faults, rather than letting them ruin me, I\u2019ll be just fine.\n\nTLDR;Happened to me and I met an octopus pig god that changed my life.\n\nHere\u2019s [guyute](https://imgur.com/a/z9VDZ3N)",

                    "body": "My story is kinda long. God reveals himself in different ways to different people.  I had been smoking weed for years. Drinking excessively.  I was also taking mushrooms and doing lsd. High doses of both. Ten strip of lsd and up to 24 grams of golden teacher mushrooms. Sometimes soulbombing . So With me. It started with a dream. I was walking along with my grandmother in the barren desert. She was asking me \u201cwhy do you want what I have?\u201d . I started telling her how I want it for my sons and my family.  I noticed a blue gas station not too far away. All of a sudden a bunch of trucks pulled up to the gas station. This blonde girl walks up to us. I tell her her that if she\u2019s trying to have a good time.  To just take a mushroom. She takes out a mini sticky note pad.  Doesn\u2019t say a word. Just writes out \u201cI > Drugs \u201c. Hands this to me. I read it.  Then I wake up. I tell my wife. I tell my boss/ mentor. Three months go by and the date was feb 24th 2023, around 10 pm. Wife and I are watching a show called alone. I\u2019m on 24 grams of shrooms. She\u2019s not on anything so she\u2019s sober.  I\u2019m laying on her lap when she has to get up and do something real fast. So I pause it. My wife always had subtitles on her shows and movies. I never did. But we always had them on for her. So she gets up.  Goes and does whatever she\u2019s doing. I get up as well go do some random thing.   Then the WiFi drops and stops working. My cat Captain Sparrow D. Katson starts running around the house checking all the entrances to the apartment. Goes in the bathroom and pees on the floor. Then walks along side me until we get to his cat box, at which point. He stops and begins to just stare into the back of it. He sees something. And it\u2019s there.  The cat box is also situated beneath the WiFi and modem boxes. Then I sit back on the couch after I open the cat box door to show him there is nothing there.  I look at the screen.  The words on the screen that we had randomly chosen to pause at said \u201cI am not having a good time\u201d.  The everything got dialed to 11. My heart started to have what I thought was a heart attack.  Then I thought my cat was having a heart attack, and I was just feeling it. So I kept telling my wife how I had died. And kept losing it.  Then it was like. If someone had compressed all of your happy moments in life , and made you swallow it and experience it. I began to be overwhelmed by love and understanding. Understanding why my life had been the way it had been. Understanding what was happening to me in that moment. I began to cry. My wife who\u2019s looking at me worried asks me what\u2019s wrong. I look at her and tell her I finally have a path. I understand why I\u2019ve been through so much so young and fast. And she asks me what my path is. I look at her dead in the eyes and tell her that my path is to Spread the word of Jesus Christ. Now for anyone wondering. I wasn\u2019t searching for God. I didn\u2019t even own a bible. I did what a lot of potheads do. Refer to the universe as the power. But God interceded in my life that night. Now how I know it was God is the fruit that came. Since that night. I haven\u2019t had a drop of booze. Not a toke of a joint. I cant even give in to physical self pleasure. It\u2019s been erased and replaced with other things.  A hunger for the word. I\u2019ve read the Bible cover to cover twice and I\u2019m now on my third time. I keep being in the right place and time to help others in moment of need at random times. People approach and ask me randomly if I\u2019m a believer in Jesus Christ.  Then I never see them again. My life has been completely changed.   Of course. Born again Christians know that it\u2019s not always easy. But the Lord revealed himself to me.  And that\u2019s my testimony.  I know there will be a lot of people saying well that\u2019s just coincidence or something else. But I\u2019ve chosen to open up here. Because I know my God. I know he\u2019s real.  And there\u2019s not a word a person can say to ever make me back down. Have a blessed day.\n\nPs. I also must add that stopping all the substances. Hasn\u2019t required any effort. It\u2019s just gone. No classes or anything else. It\u2019s just. Gone. I\u2019ve been. Healed.",

It can be terrifying, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve had on weed alone. It can be good though, informative, formative, it can help you better understand what you want out of life. I think the mind is a very fragile thing for most people and these experiences can greatly alter the people who were not sturdy enough for the experience in the first place (for all kinds of reasons). It can healthy I think, but you need to feel secure in yourself, able to face yourself, willing to understand and grow. Powerful experience, shouldn\u2019t be messed with lightly.

I'd had micro/mini-dosed previously and got a sense of how it would go. I'd say I was at a moderate dose level. If I sat in my camping chair I would get pretty dizzy, but the kaleidoscopic visions amplify.\n\nMy buddy was playing Sea Shanties and the coals in the fire pit moved and danced with the music. Then I shut my eyes and a thousands of uniform turquoise phalic shapes were raining down my vision. Each head of them bouncing back in forth with the music. They weren't dicks but dick shaped. It was amazing. \n\nThen we stepped out of the woods so I could move around some. That cut down the nauseousness a ton. We had the brightest moon out that night and clouds covering it. While looking at it, the light shining through the clouds felt holy. I've been an atheist for a while. I thought, is this my religious moment of finding a higher power? Then the clouds moved away and it was just my buddy the moon, chilling in space. The grass out where we were standing looked so gnarly in the moon light. Just swaying with me.\n\nIt was a nice night out and I left the rain-fly off my tent. My tent is mostly just mesh on the top so you can see out in all directions. So when I finally laid down that's when my mind started wandering into stupid shit. \"If something wanted to grab my feet and just drag me into the woods it could....\" or \"A coyote could definitely walk right up and bite me in the face.\" Just silly shit to freak myself out.\n\nFinally I woosah'd myself back into a good place and just went to sleep. The next morning I felt pretty good and It definitely improved my mood over the next few weeks. I'd love to try a large amount in the future some day.\n\nLike edibles for weed, you just have to keep in your head that it's not going to kill you and you just have to ride it out. Once you're on the bus there is no getting off. The only thing the hospital can do for you is give you some fluids and a huge bill.",

There is endless literature and so many studies going on about it, I believe it's a topic that will open up to great discoveries on the nature of the human mind in the future. \n\nI definitely can relate with the feeling of standing across an endless humongous presence that made me reconsider the very essence of size differences and space, I had an incredibly similar experience just lately with marijuana while in a floating tank: just an explosion of space and light while feeling like I was facing the infinite universe itself, roaming from infinite big to infinite small in and out, over and over again. There was a humbling, recharging and powerful feeling in that. \n\nI never had that amount of shrooms though, I had ayahuasca and a few level 3 and 4 shrooms experiences but still didn't feel right about going stronger. Definitely will when the time and situation gets right.\n\nSafe travel, brother.",

Cow Hollow, Marina, North Beach, and Hayes Valley, for example, all seem to have a healthy flow of residents, retail, and restaurants. In my neighborhood, I can think of five new retail or restaurant tenants just off the top of my head from the last 4-6 months. So the problem is more complex than just \u201cSF sucks.\u201d\n\nThe first issue is the crime. Union Square borders the Tenderloin and Market Street. Tenderloin has always been a shady place, and with the accelerating drug epidemic (not just in SF, but nationwide), this area\u2019s only gotten worse. Add to that a rise in organized retail crime in the Bay and black markets for stolen goods, and you have a perfect storm. Enforcement has been weak in the past, and while there\u2019s been some improvement in prosecutions since the ousting of our last DA, the cops still can\u2019t be assed to do their jobs, clearance rates are in the gutter, and prisons are overcrowded.\n\nBut the bigger issue with Union square is this: it\u2019s basically one giant mall. Nobody actually lives there. You start to see residents once you hit Nob Hill to the north, but Union Square itself isn\u2019t really a \u201cneighborhood\u201d in the traditional sense. As such, it doesn\u2019t have a natural flow of people to support commerce. So now that 30-50% remote work is the norm, it\u2019s stuck in a feedback loop where people just have fewer and fewer reasons to go there.",

People switch to street supplies to save money (and Purdue/other profits decrease so they bill the remaining/new people more) or because Rx ran out. Now you have people addicted to drugs and scraping to afford the meds/drugs, so they start to steal other things, like essentials and the companies trying to make a profit start to feel it as more and more people steal. So they companies close down stores entirely and suddenly they\u2019re making less profit. Now I\u2019m guessing as there\u2019s nothing to do and no inflation-proof hobbies to buy into that will allow anyone working-class to stay occupied for any length of time, and consider there\u2019s no work as all the stores are closing\u2026 and suddenly the only people making any money are the people selling drugs on the street or the big companies like pharma who have their captive audience with no choice but to bankrupt themselves under threat of death or severe pain if they don\u2019t pay up. \n\nShits fucked\u2026 proper fucked.\n\nDisclaimer I could be wrong but this is how it appears to an outsider, it\u2019s bleak\u2026 you guys doin okay there?",

I have no idea why it is important to treat the rent and the homelessness like it's somehow unrelated. Rent was $500-ish dollar lower 5 years ago on average and that was $500 more affordable for some people that have now fallen into homelessness. In SF, since there are very few shelters, \"homelessness\" can turn into \"on the streets\" pretty quickly.\n\nSo, increasing rent -> increasing homelessness -> decreasing hope + very little new investment in affordable housing + very little investment in temporary shelters + increasing access to fentanyl = extremely high levels of disorder -> increases in property crime. \n\nIn other words, it's all of a piece. San Francisco is unique not because it has uniquely bad leadership, but because it has especially high housing costs and unusually low property tax revenue relative to housing unit costs due to Prop 13. Versions of this lesser in scale and visibility are happening all across the country and all across the world. San Francisco is a harbinger or things to come to a city near you if we don't start building some fucking housing right quick and investing in our long-neglected social safety net.",

I can\u2019t blame them either because who\u2019s to say the SF local gov won\u2019t pivot again in a few years and let crime go unpunished again?",

We spent the three days walking tons, Mission and Castro, the whole northern coast, Chinatown, Little Italy, and tons in-between. With a toddler in tow it was the best city we visited in the States so far.\n\nIt was mostly clean, some parts a bit grittier but nothing you don't see in European big cities. In terms of public facilities I was blown away, the playgrounds and parks were clean and well kept, public toilets were clean and sometimes guarded. Ate great food, had fantastic coffee and left with a \"must return\" feeling.",

In addition to that, there was enormous organizational bloat with different offices handling all of the merchandising and operations for each region. The past 15 years or so has just been an ongoing effort to trim that bloat and also keep up with the rise of online retail which has caused people to stop shopping at their stores. Currently Macy\u2019s has maybe 20-30 locations that actually do well and the remaining ones are basically just struggling relics of the old stores that they inherited, suffering from massive disinvestment.",

With some work, it's downtown could be walkable again. You could connect the lake shore bike path all the way to Gary and make it even possible for bike into the city.  \n\nBut I still believe it will take possibly decades to turn around.

I'm basing myself off studies (and personal experience) to reply to your comment.\n\nIn more technical terms, Northern Italy's society has been observed to be more individualistic (scoring 76 according to Hofstede Insights's website), while the South is on the more collectivistic end of the scale. Living in an individualistic society doesn't mean hating everyone but yourself, but only that you tend to look after yourself and your immediate family and friends, and therefore might consider it invasive when strangers get involved in your life. A simple example: in the North of Italy, it might be unacceptable to scold stranger children that are playing on the street and doing something that they shouldn't be doing. In the South, this is less frowned upon. This is because in collectivistic societies (like Southern Italy or Spain) individuals tend to have a larger community of people that they 'look after'. This is why a lot of people say that Southern Italians are more outgoing or easily approachable than their Northern co-nationals. This doesn't mean that Northern Italians are terrible, but just that they are very faithful to their close friends and family rather than open to everyone (almost) indistinctly. To make it blatantly simple, while a Southern Italian will invite you to eat at their place and to their family parties after having met you one time only (necessary exaggeration), it will take a bit more time and effort to gain that kind of trust coming from a Northern Italian (but it will be truly worth it). \nAs a Southern Italian who lived in the North for many years, I can confirm the culture shock that we feel when we first need to learn 'the ways of the North'. Our physical dimension of personal space is smaller (we tend to touch each other more, which is also why I added the previous comment), so we need to learn not to; we are more disorganized or, to put it differently, we need less organization to be comfortable, and much more. In intercultural communication studies, the latter concept is a social dimension that Hofstede calls \"uncertainty avoidance\", basically the answer to the question \"should we try to control the future or just let it happen?\". While Northern Italians would most likely try to have control over their (immediate) future \u2013 an example: they organize a dinner a week in advance \u2013 Southern Italians will just let it happen \u2013 meaning they'll ask you \"are you free tonight? Come eat at my place\".\n\nThese are just a few examples of the main difference between the deep North and the deep South of the country, and those that are easily backed up by studies. Italy is sort of big though, and there's a lot of grey area in all of this, so don't forget my disclaimer! \n\nI hope I could help :)\n\nEdit: here's a website ([Hofstede Insights](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/)) on which you can find some more info about other countries as well. It's intuitive, clear, and easy to use!\n\nEdit 2: corrected a spelling mistake",

TBF I don't have any numbers to support this, I just think that if anything, it's the type of violence that's the difference. Where men may generally be approached by strangers to be robbed, as a female-presenting person, I've always felt awkward by male strangers touching me because I can't gauge their intentions, but ive been told from a young age to be wary \n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to diminish men's experiences at all, I just don't think your statement of it being worse for men is entirely fair. I do believe there is a lot less room for men to come forward with being assaulted - be it purely physically in case of robbery, or sexually - and that's a huge problem in and of itself. But I don't believe that they necessarily experience it more than women do. I've been followed and harassed and touched at clubs without permission numerous times, to the point that when some stranger's hands appeared through the crowd and honked my chest I barely even reacted to it apart if feeling annoyed and standing closer to my friends. It's just that the experiences are, generally, different, and have different mental consequences for the people that experience them.\n\nMaybe I'm being too shortsighted, I do only know my own point of view. And I don't believe in it being a matter of who suffers more from this, because there are definitely men that are touched and grabbed without consent and that's fucked up. But from my own experience Vs my male friends' experiences, I just cannot agree with your statement, I think?",

Treatments with their mean effect and confidence interval to the left of this area are considered to have clinically important benefits.",

                    "body": "Might be a bit late to address common questions, but I\u2019ll give it a go. I should point out that I\u2019m not involved in the research or the image, but I thought it was helpful.\n\n[Here is the actual paper.](https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-075847)\n\nCommon responses:\n\nQ: \u201cThis is complicated and not a Cool Guide as I can\u2019t understand it\u201d\n\n\u2022\t\u2060fair call, and my bad. I work a bit around research and didn\u2019t realize this was not so intuitive for most people. I assume this diagram was made to convey ideas to a professional audience who would understand it all fairly easily.\n\nQ: \u201cExplain it like I\u2019m 5\u201d\n\n\u2022\t\u2060a meta analysis is a review of many other studies to see if they really agree with each other. This one looked at 200+ studies into whether exercise helps treat depression. The finding is that all sorts of studies seem to suggest exercise in many forms is helpful for people with depression. However it also shows that more of these types of studies need to be designed to have greater \u201ccertainty\u201d (which is an idea in statistics about how likely it will be to forecast a true result from that study) \u2026 the real answer to that issue is more studies with more people.\n\nQ:. \u201cHow do I read that table at the bottom?\u201d\n\n\u2022\t\u2060it\u2019s called a Forest Plot. It lists all the various studies one after another down the page. If the green dots fall to the left of the orange colored bar, it means they support the idea that exercise helps depression more man \u201cactive control\u201d (explained below). If a dot fell to the right, it would mean that the study favored the \u201cactive control\u201d. You can see that they all suggest that exercises help more. The number in the green column is the number of people included in each study. The green bar that stretches either side of the green got shows the amount of variation of results (eg a very long bar means there are some extreme outliers).\n\nQ:. \u201cWhat is active control?\u201d\n\n\u2022\t\u2060in this case it describes prescribed medication and therapy. So, it was looking into whether various exercises were better than these typical treatments. The authors do not suggest exercise as a replacement, but rather an adjunct / addition to other typical treatment.\n\nQ:. \u201cHow does this help when a depressed person can\u2019t even muster the energy to get out of bed, much less exercise?\u201d\n\n\u2022\t\u2060that idea was not the focus of this study, but it is a well observed issue when treating people with depression. Every person battling depression should be helped by a professional, and data like this helps those professionals understand all options better. For someone living with depression, I personally suggest finding whatever smallest step you can manage. For example, [this describes](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/benefits-sunlight) how simply seeing sunlight can help with mental health, so, jogging might not be realistic for you but possibly walking ten steps out into daylight is possible (or whatever you can manage).\n\nQ:. \u201cDoes the low certainty mean the info isn\u2019t very reliable?\u201d\n\n- there\u2019s a difference between statistical robustness (which is shown in the \u201clow certainty\u201d image), and inference that is probably helpful in practice. The authors make note of the low certainty as a call to researchers to pursue further study, with bigger numbers, to help make the findings stronger for their predictive ability. It doesn\u2019t suggest that the findings are probably incorrect. \nThe fact that all of the those types of exercise all seem to point to the same conclusion helps greatly with real life confidence. \n\nQ:. \u201cDoesn\u2019t this just shame and blame people who are already unwell?\u201d\n\n\u2022\t\u2060no, the idea of this study wasn\u2019t to suggest that people bring depression on themselves (it didn\u2019t even ask that question, but it\u2019s generally understood among professionals that depression is caused by a multitude of factors, many of which are based in biology and genetics and environment). These various studies and the authors of this analysis understand that depression is a disease. In the same way that someone with leukemia isn\u2019t to blame for their disease, it\u2019s not logical or helpful to blame someone with living depression for their disease. Having said all that, no matter how tough the fight may be for the individual, every person with depression should be given information that might help. While depression might not be their fault, like any health issue, it becomes their responsibility (with professional help) to manage.\n\nQ:. \u201cHow is this a Cool Guide if I need to have so much explained?\u201d\n\n\u2022\t\u2060again, my fault. I think I assumed more of it would be able to be understood by more people. Maybe someone with both academic or professional knowledge and a bit of design skill can make a Cool Guide with this info.\n\nQ:. \u201cWhat about dance!? I read that it was good for depression?\u201d\n\n\u2022\t\u2060the paper does call that out specifically. And yes, the research indicates it does help. Personally, I\u2019d suggest people find the type of bodily movement that they find possible, enjoyable or motivating. The summary of this paper is \u201cevery type of exercise seems to help\u201d. Side note, I once saw [this guy](https://youtu.be/ihCh5wzNjYY?si=vQhkstanpTB40Kgt) give a talk about the psychology of dance, and he was epic.\n\nI mentioned the lead author, but there is actually a broad team involved. I might ask the lead author if he wants to do an AMA to offer his views in plain language. He is both a psychologist and academic.\n\nAnyway, sorry if I pissed anyone off with a hard to understand (and therefore uncool) Cool Guide, but on the other hand I hope it helps or inspires someone out there. Depression is a complete bitch and deserves every weapon that we can find to fight it. Hang in there if you\u2019re in the fight \u2026 the world needs you!",

                    "body": "I'm in a neuroscience lab, so I gotchu!\n\nSHORT ANSWER: Blue dot going further left is better (lower depression scores), meaning walking and jogging is the best for curing depression and SSRIs are (STILL HELPFUL since they're to the left of 0, but) the worst.\n\nLONG ANSWER:\n\nThis is a meta-analysis, meaning they are showing the average results across many (in this case, 218) studies to remove inaccuracies from bad choices made in individual studies.  Since they include so many studies in this graphic, the data is likely to be very accurate.\n\nThe graph is measuring the amount of people in a group who diagnose with depression before and after that group receives different kinds of treatment.  It could also be measuring how many symptoms people show before and after treatment.\n\nThe 0 on the graph represents where you would expect a person to be with no treatment.  The blue dot is where you would expect a person to be with the kind of treatment listed in that row (e.g., exercise, SSRI, etc).\n\nThis is where it gets a little more complicated.\n\nThe number the graph is measuring is \"the effect size\", which is basically the difference between the control group and the experimental group.\n\nWe know 0 is where we would expect them to be without treatment because there is a \"control\" group.  In the context of medication, if 200 people with depression sign up for your study, you would randomly assign them to an \"experimental\" group and a \"control\" group.  The experimental group is given the real medication, and the control group is given a placebo (or fake medication that does nothing).  \"0\" is set to the amount of people in the control group who have depression at the end of the study, and the blue dot represents how many people in the experimental group have depression at the end of the study relevant to the control group.\n\nThe reason you need a control group is because, for example, people with depression might get better over time.  So if you don't measure how well people on medication do relative to people off your medication while they are getting better over time on their own, you might conclude your medication is helping more than it actually is.  Having a control group lets you say \"yes, both groups got better, but people on the medication got WAY better relative to the people who just got a little better over time.  So they are getting better because of our medication and not just because people with depression get better on their own over time.\"\n\nThe red zone around 0 represents the amount of a difference between the experimental and control groups needed in order to conclude that the study was effective.  For example, if you have 10 people on your medication and 10 people off it, and 1 person off your medication gets better after the study whereas 2 on your medication get better after the study, there's a high probability that's due to random chance and not your medication.  So you need to make sure the difference in improvement is high enough that it's not random chance.  The blue dot being anywhere outside the red zone means there is higher than a 0.2 effect size, meaning the improvement the people on the medication experienced is probably not due to random chance, meaning the study found a \"statistically significant\" difference between the experimental and control groups.\n\nAnd the horizontal blue line around the blue dot I'm pretty sure represents a 95% confidence interval, meaning there is a 95% chance that the actual amount the medication should help is somewhere on that blue line.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!  And my stats are a bit rusty, so feel free to correct me.",

So the farther from zero you are, the more difference there is. The way this one is structured, less depression = negative number.

                    "body": "Might be a bit late to address common questions, but I\u2019ll give it a go. I should point out that I\u2019m not involved in the research or the image, but I thought it was helpful. \n\n[Here](https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-075847) is the actual paper. \n\nCommon responses:\n\nQ: \u201cThis is complicated and not a Cool Guide as I can\u2019t understand it\u201d\n\n- fair call, and my bad. I work a bit around research and didn\u2019t realize this was not so intuitive for most people. I assume this diagram was made to convey ideas to a professional audience who would understand it all fairly easily. \n\nQ: \u201cExplain it like I\u2019m 5\u201d\n\n- a meta analysis is a review of many other studies to see if they really agree with each other. This one looked at 200+ studies into whether exercise helps treat depression. The finding is that all sorts of studies seem to suggest exercise in many forms is helpful for people with depression. However it also shows that more of these types of studies need to be designed to have greater \u201ccertainty\u201d (which is an idea in statistics about how likely it will be to forecast a true result from that study) \u2026 the real answer to that issue is more studies with more people. \n\nQ:. \u201cHow do I read that table at the bottom?\u201d\n\n- it\u2019s called a Forest Plot. It lists all the various studies one after another down the page. If the green dots fall to the left of the orange colored bar, it means they support the idea that exercise helps depression more man \u201cactive control\u201d (explained below). If a dot fell to the right, it would mean that the study favored the \u201cactive control\u201d.\nYou can see that they all suggest that exercises help more. The number in the green column is the number of people included in each study. The green bar that stretches either side of the green got shows the amount of variation of results (eg a very long bar means there are some extreme outliers). \n\nQ:. \u201cWhat is active control?\u201d \n\n- in this case it describes prescribed medication and therapy. So, it was looking into whether various exercises were better than these typical treatments. The authors do not suggest exercise as a replacement, but rather an adjunct / addition to other typical treatment. \n\nQ:. \u201cHow does this help when a depressed person can\u2019t even muster the energy to get out of bed, much less exercise?\u201d \n\n- that idea was not the focus of this study, but it is a well observed issue when treating people with depression. Every person battling depression should be helped by a professional, and data like this helps those professionals understand all options better. For someone living with depression, I personally suggest finding whatever smallest step you *can* manage. For example, [this](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/benefits-sunlight) describes how simply seeing sunlight can help with mental health, so, jogging might not be realistic for you but possibly walking ten steps out into daylight is possible (or whatever you can manage). \n\n\nQ:. \u201cDoesn\u2019t this just shame and blame people who are already unwell?\u201d\n\n- no, the idea of this study wasn\u2019t to suggest that people bring depression on themselves (it didn\u2019t even ask that question, but it\u2019s generally understood among professionals that depression is caused by a multitude of factors, many of which are based in biology and genetics and environment). These various studies and the authors of this analysis understand that depression is a disease. In the same way that someone with leukemia isn\u2019t to blame for their disease, it\u2019s not logical or helpful to blame someone with living depression for their disease. \nHaving said all that, no matter how tough the fight may be for the individual, every person with depression should be given information that might help. While depression might not be their fault, like any health issue, it becomes their responsibility (with professional help) to manage. \n\nQ:. \u201cHow is this a Cool Guide if I need to have so much explained?\u201d\n\n- again, my fault. I think I assumed more of it would be able to be understood by more people. Maybe someone with both academic or professional knowledge and a bit of design skill can make a Cool Guide with this info. \n\nQ:. \u201cWhat about dance!? I read that it was good for depression?\u201d\n\n- the paper does call that out specifically. And yes, the research indicates it does help. Personally, I\u2019d suggest people find the type of bodily movement that they find possible, enjoyable or motivating. The summary of this paper is \u201cevery type of exercise seems to help\u201d. Side note, I once saw [this guy](https://youtu.be/ihCh5wzNjYY?si=yqE5egb3vxMtWncP) give a talk about the psychology of dance, and he was epic. \n\nI mentioned the lead author, but there is actually a broad team involved. I might ask the lead author if he wants to do an AMA to offer his views in plain language. He is both a psychologist and academic. \n\nAnyway, sorry if I pissed anyone off with a hard to understand (and therefore uncool) Cool Guide, but on the other hand I hope it helps or inspires someone out there. Depression is a complete bitch and deserves every weapon that we can find to fight it. Hang in there if you\u2019re in the fight \u2026 the world needs you!",

Never had a father around growing up, and after losing him, my life went in a spiral downhill.. boozing uncontrollably abusing drugs (coke mostly)\n\nThen, one day after work, I decided to watch a few documentary films on Netflix, specifically.. how to control your mind and fantastic fungi it was such an eye-opening documentary that after watching it, I researched and researched how to go about dosages and supply. Got my first 7 gs from a site..\nLiterally arrived 2 days after ordering (Canadian, btw)\n\nI meditated with sage and smoked herb, then I took a week off of everything and mentally prepared my mind for what I was about to put it through..\n\nI was going to eat it but noticed so many ways to go about ingesting it, but like the tea maniac I am, I made a citrus honey mix with 2 grams Penis Envy I never done mushrooms before but I read the beginning dosages are usually 1g-1.5g boy did I get floored in about 40 minutes..\n\nMy mind was racing with so many thoughts about my inner feelings, and the visuals were something I could not explain without sounding crazy(dumb) but than after about 1.5 hrs I notice visuals were wearing down but than my mind felt like it was in super mode I could remember little memories I long forgot mostly with my mom and grandfather bonding moments.. \n\nAnd then it hit me after meticulously trying to grip reality this thought poped in my head about my grandfather wouldn't want me in the state I am...like the caring man he was he'd \"say sonny get your head out the mud an wise up\" I than went in a thought loop on why I felt this way..\n\nThe alcohol was the culprit, and I was the victim, I took the leap and am now 3 months clean off of everything..\n\nMy mental health, Depression is at an all time low  never felt my mind this pure thanks to the magic mushroom \ud83c\udf44 \u2728\ufe0f  I wish everyone could experience this one time in there life but thanks to the 60s-70s it's classified substance 1 drug total bullshit when there selling literal poison on the shelves.\n\nI am still studying microdosing and am very interested in it and growing also..\n\nCheers much love, and may whatever religion you believe protect you from harm.

On the lower end, you have fewer people very very non-depressed (-1.5 is low depression), and on the upper end, you have fewer people very very depressed.\n\nSo -0.5 means 0.5 SDs down from the mean, or that around 17% of people not on medication would fall between -0.5 and 0 in depression scores.  Between -1 and 0 would be 34% of the population, etc.\n\nThe blue dot being at -0.5 means that people on that treatment plan are doing 17% better on average than expected of people not in treatment in terms of depression scores.  Being at -1 means they are doing 34% better, etc.\n\nEDIT: My wording here is very poor.  It's not 17% better than average.

In this circumstance it is necessary to standardize the results of the studies to a uniform scale before they can be combined. The standardized mean difference expresses the size of the intervention effect in each study relative to the variability observed in that study. (Again in reality the intervention effect is a difference in means and not a mean of differences.) (Standardized mean difference  is calculated by the taking the difference in mean outcome of groups divided by the standard deviation of outcome among participants)\n\nThus studies for which the difference in means is the same proportion of the standard deviation will have the same SMD, regardless of the actual scales used to make the measurements.\n\nIn other words, it's a number calculated from the results of the studies allowing the studies to be compared against one another even though they may have different measurements, kinda like how much food does the average person eat per day worldwide? Well, instead of gathering a bunch of measurements of different weights of food, convert everything to calories before comparing the amount of calories of each group measured.",

If you take a random group of depressed people and measure how depressed they are without giving them treatment, 0 represents the average depression of this group of depressed people without treatment.\n\nThe blue dot is how much someone got better or worse based on treatment.  If the blue dot is 0.5 to the left, then the average person who did that treatment, like exercise, is likely to be less depressed than people who did not do that treatment.  The number 0.5 is called an \"effect size\", which means 0.5 standard deviations.  0.5 standard deviations is 17% of a population, so where 17% of people with less depression among those who are depressed would score is where the average person who uses that treatment end up.  It's like if you have the IQ average of Americans and Canadians.  They are both in the shape of a bell curve.  Let's say Canada's IQ average is 0.5 SDs, or around 8 IQ points, higher than the US.  17% of the US would fall between 0 and 0.5 SDs in terms of IQ points on that bell curve.  But on the edge of where the 17% of Americans fall on their bell curve\u2014that is where Canada's average IQ is.  If you had both bell curves on the same graph, the middle of the US bell curve would be at 0 SDs, and the middle of Canada's be curve would be at 0.5 SDs because their IQ average is 0.5 SDs higher than the US.  It's the same except instead of the US and Canada, it's depressed people without treatment and depressed people with a certain kind of treatment.  This is a hard concept to explain, but does that make sense?\n\nThe blue line means we're 95% sure that it helped by an amount on the blue line, and that there's a 5% chance that it helped by an amount outside of the amount on the blue line.\n\nThe red zone is where there wouldn't be enough of a difference between the blue dot and the baseline depression score to say the treatment helped.

Luckily, some interventions can help an upward spiral (we exercise and feel a bit brighter, which makes us more likely to chat with a friend, which makes us more likely to speak with a doctor for help \u2026 etc)",

Make the assumption that since exercise is on the positive side, it means that the positive side is good, and the more positive, the better.\n\nYou can also notice that the dots are ranked so the more positive ones are at the top.\n\nThat's what you can glean by just glancing around. Also, knowing middle school statistics, you will know that a mean is derived from a group where you have a range, so you can surmise that the bar is analogous to a range and the dot to the mean. So some interventions vary a lot more than others.\n\nSo, if you managed to get through school, you can make a reasonable guess at what it means.",

Which hurts me as a communicator of science\n\nFor what it's worth, all the interventions shown here (except for SSRI, potentially) are *statistically significant*. The red band indicates clinical meaningfulness. Sometime an intervention can be statistically significant, but the difference might not be clinically meaningful to a patient or end user, which is determined through complex user engagement discussions that involve these patients and end users.\n\nExercise may have been statistically significant, but if the change in depression scores wasn't large enough, then it may still not be recommended by clinicians for a variety of reasons. The authors of this work have shown that exercise is both statistically significant and clinically meaningful and it should be communicated to patients that exercise is the best possible intervention that we know of with the evidence available. \n\nCertainty of evidence can have 4 levels. High, moderate, low, and very low. All evidence from Randomised controlled trials starts as high, then we downgrade on 5 factors, explained as simply as I can:\n\n1 - Risk of Bias (are the individual studies well conducted) \n2 - Inconsistency (are the individual studies similar in their results? \n3 - Imprecision ( is the final pooled estimate tight (no variation in potential final effect) or wide (variable final effect) \n4 - Indirectness (are all the studies contributing to the final pooled estimate similar in the question they're addressing?) \n5 - Publication bias (is there evidence of a systematic under-representation of the available evidence)\n\nWe downgrade certainly one level for each infraction of the above. For something to have low certainty, two of the above were must have been violated, which simply means the manner in which we communicate and recommend this intervention to our patients may change.\n\nEDIT - I hope this doesn't come across as preachy, I live a breathe this stuff and I really do love my job so chatting about it excites me.

When we asked her to explain, she clarified that she LOVES people and really enjoys talking to others and leading class, but she has a finite amount of energy to spend on it and when she runs out, she shuts down and needs to step away and recharge. This baffled us because we only saw the energetic and social person during school hours, and didn\u2019t realise how much time she spent alone between classes or at the end of each day. \n\nIntroverts aren\u2019t just like shy little cats that are socially inhibited.

Eggs are fair game because they can be harvested without killing the animal. Fish and shellfish are ok. Anything vegetarian or vegan would be fine. \n\nWhere it gets strange are the more obscure animals, and specific Catholic diocese have had to make decrees about certain animals. For example, gator (thanks New Orleans) have explicitly been permitted and allowed on Fridays. Beaver is also allowed. The exact reason for that is unclear, but it\u2019s believed to be because it was a necessity during the early days of French Canada due to food scarcity and lots of beavers. Muskrat, puffin, armadillo, iguana, and capybara are also allowed. The Church takes it a step further and doesn\u2019t just say \u201cthese animals are allowed\u201d but declares \u201cthese exceptions are fish.\u201d So if you really want to mess with people, tell them gators, beavers, capybara, etc. are fish. \n\nInterestingly, you also have Catholics to thank (or curse?) for the Filet-o-fish at McDonalds.",

For this reason, a human's flesh cannot be eaten while that human is alive. You cannot kill the human for its meat, because that is a separate, MASSIVE prohibition. You also cannot eat the flesh of a human corpse that ceased living for other reasons beyond slaughter, because it is forbidden to benefit from a human body.\n\nThe base argument that they are kosher because the Torah forbids only animals with one out of the two of cud-chewing and split hooves, is debated because some opinions take the lack of statement on animals with neither of the two at face value (i.e, nothing was said, so human flesh is kosher). Others look at the lack of statement through the lens of the logical process of a \u05e7\u05dc \u05d5\u05d7\u05d5\u05de\u05e8, or an 'a fortiori' in English, which leads to the conclusion that if the less far-from-kosher animals are forbidden, animals with NONE *must* be forbidden.\n\nEither way, if human flesh was grown in labs, it's quite possible that some opinions might consider it kosher.\n\nAlso, some grasshoppers are kosher, but debate abounds as to which species, so most denominations simply refrain from eating them.",

A lot of people have already commented on here that hybridization and closet growing back in the day has pretty well blurred that line to the point of not really existing much anymore. However I've read that a lot of the effects come from the stages of development of the trichomes. Clear trichomes aren't psychoactive yet so they're pretty much inert. Cloudy trichomes are the more mentally simulating ones and more of the sativa high that we experience. When the trichomes turn amber those are more of the physically sedative ones that would be in the description of an indica. TL;DR IMO it's mostly about stages of trichome development.

I love seeing how plants express in the grow tent and how different plants with the same genes can show out.\n\nPlenty of research online for folks wanting to know more!",

I've had 4 major back surgeries and a total reconstruction of the first 3 lumbar sacral/levels. I first tried cannabis about a year after my first surgery (yes much different than today's strains) but to say there is no difference between Sativa and Indica is your myth because I can hand on heart tell you when it comes to pain plus many other things there is a massive difference. I will tell you we got some of the purest hash from friends working boats off the top end of Australia and I can tell you I could not smoke Indica hash because I ended up in agony. Now I spent years in and out of hospital and spent many many months over years as an inpatient and outpatient of Perth's best Spinal Hospital in Shenton Park and having met many friends there over the years I was not the only one that suffered an intense increase in pain after just a couple of spots of Indica Hash. We have spent hours, days even months discussing it but the best we could come up with is that maybe it relaxes the muscles around any injury site so much that some of the support has gone for as long as that hash took effect.  So I never smoked any hash after that because as our supplies dried up or boats moved on I had no idea anymore if it was Indica or Sativa. Any thoughts on why you think it may have had that affect on us in that way would be appreciated and discussed with those few of us that are left.",

This has been said to be the precursor to most other cannabinoids, including but not limited to THCA and CBDA. This produces a more sativa like high if cut down during this time. As the trichomes progress, it turns into THCA and CBDA (cloudy trichomes), which can balance out that sativa feeling leaving you with a hybrid high. As they continue their life, the THC degrades into CBN (cloudy trichomes) and this produces that indica couch lock feeling. \n\nAs the plant progresses, there are all these different trichomes on the plant at different stages. You start to monitor the plant late in its life and determine when to cut it by the ratio of clear, cloudy, and amber trichomes. 70% cloudy with 30% clear, you'll get more of a hybrid sativa. 70% cloudy with 30% amber will get an indica hybrid. 70% amber and 30% clear, a HEAVY indica. \n\nHowever, if I'm being honest I can't find good research to back this up at the moment. I found several sites but I don't know if they're reputable enough. I'm not able to do more research currently though. \n\nSource: Worked in a dispensary for 4 years in Colorado and have grown several times myself.",
