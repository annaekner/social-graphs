I'm by no means an expert so take what I say with a grain of salt but maybe u/ottergang_ky can touch more on it. I want to say I remember a video from mrgunsngear hearing the aem5 had around 40db reduction and in the info of the ocm5 it stated that it was slightly even better than that but didn't give any specific numbers. I'd love pew science to cover them. I believe both are traditional baffled cans and the ocm5 is a more modernized version.",

I almost wish I would\u2019ve started out with a couple of 22s for the bad ass AR-22s and the plethora of 22 pistols I have. I decided to get the 22s last because they\u2019re pretty cheap and readily available. I\u2019m actually glad I did that because the popular suppressors are getting harder to find with the wait times being what they have been the last 10 months or so. Ive bought 4 in the last 10 months and the longest wait was 56 days. The other 3 came back in about a week. I also did an SBR with a rifle I already owned through a form 1 and that took 8 days. So people are going crazy buying this stuff now and most places have pretty low stock.",

I am a 1911 guy and have bought spring kits to play around with different weights and there are a few companies that sell kits with three different weight springs so you can tune the pistol. search and see if anybody makes a kit and I would start with lighter, good luck and if all else fails call Taurus I guess, wish I knew more about the TX22 but mine has been 100% reliable.",

I only shared it here because this is the original place I shared the issues so I figured I owed this sub a one last follow up post to close things out. And thats a perfect reference \ud83e\udd23 in this case though that bunny then took the basket back and returned it with an even bigger pile of poop in it unfortunately.",

The FRP on subsonic 300blk (all the rounds in this video are subsonic btw) is legitimately loud enough to be painful to the shooter and bystanders. Subsequent rounds are somewhat quieter, but if you\u2019re just shooting one round, like if you\u2019re hunting, it\u2019s loud enough that I\u2019d wear foamies or over-ear protection. \n\nGas stack is also a real issue with this silencer & host combo, whether you\u2019re shooting supers or subs it starts spitting gas back at you within a few rounds. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just adjust the adjustable gas block to tune the gun?\u201d Great question. The geniuses at Q decided that I shouldn\u2019t be able to do that, so they installed the gas block [so canted it is gauging the inside of the handguard.](https://postimg.cc/qgsR0y70) This is the kind of flaw I\u2019d expect on a $300 BCA, not on a $3000 gucci gun. I guess we can assume the Q doesn\u2019t stand for quality control.\n\nYour money would be way better spent on an Anthem S2, ODB or Hyperion and home-brew 300blk AR15 than this piece of junk. Wish I hadn\u2019t spent $4200 on this setup but hopefully someone on here can learn from my mistakes. ",

I have accrued tens of thousands in debt attempting to fill this void with sexual 'toys,' including several custom, unregistered form 1 silencer dildos and a balding Kevin-shaped real doll with a tramp stamp that reads \"Take My Bepsi Challenge\" in Chinese characters. I have had my face made love to by hundreds of balding, bearded, gen Xers, but not one of them could make me climax. Only Kevin is capable of giving me that release.\n\nThe wife and I are separated, and have accepted the fact that I will never see my kids again. The only thing keeping Karen from divorcing me is the fear that she might be the final push into a deep. inescapable abyss, at the bottom of which lies my death.\n\nThe truth is, our marriage died nine years ago on the night I met the love of my life. While browsing Instagram I saw Kevin's inconsistent welds and became rock hard, collapsing in the shower and sobbing at the realization that Kevin would never, could never, pin me down with his perfectly smooth body and stubby arms, penetrate me with his incredible shallow girth and empty his huge, aching balls deep inside my tummy. I sat there all night, sometimes weeping, sometimes ramming my flaccid dick into the shower drain in frustration.\n\nIt has been nine years since that night. I have nothing now. I have accepted that. My apartment is a squalid den of inescapable despair, filled with jizz-stained 300 blackout shells and tormented notes etched onto lewd posters of the trash panda. I spend my days printing out screenshots of his forum posts and crying. My only friends are the roaches.",

I'd suspect that tiny turnbuckle before anything else, then maybe QC on the gas block/barrel/index pins. If something is twisted, the gas tube is twisted, and you're having to run way more gas to get the action to cycle, which makes everything way louder than necessary. Can you not see/reach the gas adjustment screw through the handguard cutout? A picture from that angle would be useful. I'd have already taken the handguard off to figure out what's going on.\nI'm not saying to take it apart. If you do, cool, because I'm curious, and you should do it on video. But I'd talk to customer service first. Maybe send it back to them to look it over. I don't really care if a company leaves a bad taste in my mouth with an initial problem, or anyone else's problem, it's how they handle my case. I may or may not buy anything else from them, but they're on the hook for this one until I sell it, or the warranty no longer applies.",

I have had my face made love to by hundreds of balding, bearded, gen Xers, but not one of them could make me climax. Only Kevin is capable of giving me that release.\n\nThe wife and I are separated, and have accepted the fact that I will never see my kids again. The only thing keeping Karen from divorcing me is the fear that she might be the final push into a deep. inescapable abyss, at the bottom of which lies my death.\n\nThe truth is, our marriage died nine years ago on the night I met the love of my life. While browsing Instagram I saw Kevin's inconsistent welds and became rock hard, collapsing in the shower and sobbing at the realization that Kevin would never, could never, pin me down with his perfectly smooth body and stubby arms, penetrate me with his incredible shallow girth and empty his huge, aching balls deep inside my tummy. I sat there all night, sometimes weeping, sometimes ramming my flaccid dick into the shower drain in frustration.\n\nIt has been nine years since that night. I have nothing now. I have accepted that. My apartment is a squalid den of inescapable despair, filled with jizz-stained 300 blackout shells and tormented notes etched onto lewd posters of the trash panda. I spend my days printing out screenshots of his forum posts and crying. My only friends are the roaches.",

I will allow Kevin to come on my program and talk shit about other brands just as other brands are welcome to come on my program and talk shit about Kevin. I\u2019m glad to make the video for either. In other words, Kevin explaining why Q is better than Y is not James adopting the opinion that Q is better than Y. As an example, I said on my video about the MCX Rattler LT recently, it\u2019s my choice for this very narrow field of 300 BLK PDWs. \n\nQ is not an advertiser, and does not pay me (because I\u2019d get fired) or the company that owns me. My compensation for filming with Q was a plane ticket and a *shared* hotel room in Portsmouth with my camera bro, Ryan. Q gave me the aforementioned Mini Fix for appearing on the Q podcast, but that was after my Q content (which Q content did not contain my opinions, anyways) was filmed.\n\nI\u2019m extremely transparent about the content I create and the relationships that I have with the people I create content with. My trip to Q was the first time meeting Kevin in person (or otherwise). I would say I'm sorry if my videos make you angry, but I admit that I get some enjoyment from people getting angry about videos on the internet because it\u2019s simply something not worth getting this riled up about.\n\nThanks for the tag /u/phraoahactual\n\nETA I am not conceding or denying the grievances OP has here.

It allows expansion and cooling and venting in all directions rather than the higher pressure venting through an end cap hole.\n\nAll that being said, i personally see little to no difference in how the gun is gassed with/without.

You can check this on Wikipedia. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vista\\_Outdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vista_Outdoor)\n\nVerticalScope, a media company, owns TFB and TFBTV.\n\nTFB is paid by its advertisers and those relationships are disclosed. Q is not an advertiser as per the inference here.\n\nGun reddit is incredibly alarming. There are two blatantly false statements being made here as if they are completely true, and people are actually upvoting them, most likely because they want them to be true.\n\nETA: this guy has made and deleted multiple comments about TFB not \"wanting that smoke\" because it would expose them to written discovery.I've typed this response 3 times but the comment I'm replying to keeps getting deleted, so I'll just leave it here:\n\n*As I said, initially, no, I very seriously doubt TFB would sue over a reddit comment, even if it were defamatory. But to answer the theoretical question about discovery: You'd have to make a prima facie case. Vista Outdoors is a publicly traded company and they disclose who they own. You don't get access to the CEO's text messages if you can't at least make a facial showing that Vista Outdoor owns TFB. The really funny part is, if it were true, they would just admit it and it would never get to litigation. If you had a scintilla of evidence that TFB was owned by Vista (you don't), then it would get to written discovery.*[*https://vistaoutdoor.com/brands/*](https://vistaoutdoor.com/brands/)\n\n*But you've walked your comment back and made and deleted a bunch of comments so I'll leave it at that.

My reluctance is, if this gun made it out of his hands and into mine with these issues and didn't even make it through 5 rounds of the supposed ammo he uses to test them, why would I send it back? He clearly didnt notice the problems it had, or maybe he did and chose to send it out anyway. Which would lead me to believe that I would be wasting my time sending it in especially when he has another drop coming soon, and probably several others coming back to him along with mine. \n\nThis may be irrational to think this way but from the get go this entire process has been unorganized and TB has been terrible about communicating website issues, late orders, and updates. I still haven't received the two grips I ordered in May that were in stock at the time I ordered them.

Some other importer tried claiming that they were easily converted to full auto like the SL8s out there. So the ATF rescinded their approval for the T36 and forced him to do a recall even though they couldn\u2019t replicate any machine gun ability with the receiver unless they did a lot of alteration. Tom could have very well just said, oh well and let end users just have their guns destroyed or face charges. Instead, he offered up the \u201cupgrade\u201d in better material with the added reinforcements that the ATF approved (again). That upcharge was for better materials and the labor to swap all of your existing parts over. It\u2019s a one man shop, he alone took on over $100k fighting it in court. Everyone that had a tax stamp on their T36 didn\u2019t pay a dime for the upgrade. So he at least helped in that sense. Another issue people seem to forget is that all of the TG36 and TMP moldings and parts were from Todd Bailey, Tom simply got them working as best he could out of the parts they sold him. This whole T7 thing., everyone assumes he\u2019s a large manufacturer with the HK blueprints and already had the tools to do this. He started from scratch to bring us something we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have. He created the mold and everything and does all of the work to build these things. So in essence, he redesigned a machine pistol to be semi auto only and had to do it from scratch on every single part. It\u2019s a generation 1 firearm, of course there will be flaws. One thing about Tom and his service though, is that he will always do whatever he can to make it right.",

Voids or inclusions would be very common. Maybe a genius sprue placement could remedy this, but it\u2019d be a stretch. \n\n2) the vented feature on the lower portion would suffer from the same flow/void/inclusion issue. \n\n3) a cast part would have a randomly oriented grain structure and will be brittle. The mechanical properties for an SLS printed part would be better due to tailoring of the finer, columnar grain structures iirc.  \n\n 4) producing the wax pattern seems like it would be difficult and you\u2019d lose a lot of the patterns to breakage. \n\n5) you\u2019d need to do post processing on these parts and with them being intricate, brittle parts, you\u2019d probably lose a lot to post processing too. \n\nAll in all, there may be geometry we can\u2019t see that required 3d printing to achieve.",

I got it for $1700 (including tax and shipping, it was $1400 before it) in February brand new. Two years ago the store wouldn\u2019t sell it to me and I went back to the store to see if it was still there and sure enough.\n\nThey wouldn\u2019t sell it to me because I was out of state, even though I had my work\u2019s FFL and SOT and my boss was willing to call and/or email them to tell them to form 3 it. And I was willing to pay whatever shipping was going to be. The employees said it was already there for over a year and I was the second or third person to ever look at it.",

Looks like I can finally post in here and I just wanted to pop in here and introduce myself. \n\nMy name is Dakota and I'm going to be using this account to help take some of the load off Andrew and his 24/7 reddit presence lol. Fear not, he will still be active on reddit, I'm just here to help.\n\n\nLittle about me, my main reddit is \nu/dakotastomm so you may have seen my posts in the other nfa/suppressor subreddits in the past. Andrew brought me on the otter gang back in May, and I've been learning the ropes here at OCL. I've been a 07/02 ffl sot since 2018 so l'm not new to the industry\n\nGoing forward, you can use this account to tag me in OCL issues or even just regular posts. You can message direct for questions or comments, and I'll try  to answer them as I can. As always, don't hesitate to reach out directly at info@ottercreeklabs.com\n\nAnyways, I look forward to interacting with you all.\n\nP.S. here's a behind the scenes Pic of some infinity testing. ",

Its essentially a Nismo minus the front and rear bumper/wing. Has the Nismo engine with GT3 turbos and ceramic brakes stock, along with all the nismo CF body parts and suspension. Very reliable, never had a single issue after years of beating on them. I'm debating whether to go for 1100 whp, but I'm already at the brink of awd traction for street tires. As is, its a handful for the mountain roads. I have to turn it down to 650whp and even that my knuckles are white when taking it through the twisties. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wfzt6nl1m09d1.jpeg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ccc79e563a6722c42910c70634074ea1ccc6b23",

They are semi-auto, but with the transferable sear pack, I can move it around easily. I got a black Aug, a mud Aug, a 20\" machinegun barrel and a 14.5\" barrel with surefire warcomp to run a RC2. The third Aug is what I am most excited about. It is a one of 300 that were imported briefly before the ATF pulled the import license plug on. The A1 is unfired from 1985, so I don't care to beat on that if I don't need too. So my plan is to put the sear pack in the 9mm Aug. I got several SMGs with a double pushpin MP5A4 being my current favorite. However I think the 9mm Aug has a real good chance at becoming my favorite. Here is a pic of the actual 9mm aug I bought. Also just got in a Eotech xps3 for it.",

It is perfectly reliable right now and feels and acts like stock. I built it for mountain climb events which I wanted instant spool and manageable power. It needed to be beat on for 5+ minutes at a time, not just a 1/4mile pass and cool down. No over heating issues at this current level, but I fear at 1100ish, it would have those finicky traits like you mentioned. Misc warning lights popping on, overheating etc.. I could be wrong, but even if it would be reliable at 1100whp, I could not handle it. That kind of power is for straightline drag/roll racing on drag radials.  \n\nGT350 is a sick car. I have been looking to pick up an additional NA car for the mountains and have the GT350R on my short list. I know those coyote engines can put down some serious hp boosted, but I would leave it NA. Id try to get 550+whp NA and call it the day. That's more than enough for the mountains.",

I do not know who this guy is in these big FB groups but he seemingly knows everything about these guns yet the only information he shares is negative and degrading. I can confidently say that regardless of what this guy says, and Tom telling me that he tests these guns with Hornady Black ammo. Mine does in fact not work with it even with about 450rds through the gun. Along with the other issues this gun had for me out of the box that I showed in my previous video. I am not trying to shit on Tom as a person nor a business owner I am simply sharing information that I found to be useful. I now have about 500rds of Hornady Black that are useless to me and if somebody else can save some money by watching my videos then great! Thank you to this subreddit for allowing me to share my experiences. And I hope that Tom only takes this as feedback to make changes in future designs or is more transparent about what ammo should be used and the break in period required. ",

That being said I'm not buddy buddy with him by any stretch of the imagination, and I've been pretty disappointed by the visceral reaction from him towards people posting on the FB page and his censorship of issues or anyone that had to anything remotely negative to say about the T7. \n\nI don't know Tom personally either, but I fully believe that he's trying to do his best and will take care of people who have issues; Sirris as far as I can tell is a friend of Tom's and he stumps for him a lot, but I don't believe there's any employer/employee type relationship there. I personally feel his antics don't looks good for Tom though because there's a strong appearance of an association there, and his attitude to the customers with issues has been very offputting lately to say the least; I'm trying to keep the mental delineation between Sirris and Tom though. \n\nI get his (and the other members on HKPros) mentality that they want people to go to Tom first instead of airing their grievances to the internet, but to me that is more apt for non-constructive content that would only serve to be defamatory to Tom. Content like this which just show the issues they are experiencing with the product to serve as a warning/heads up/ or whatever you want to call it, to me is a good thing cause it brings awareness, and people can make educated purchasing decisions. \n\nIs every gun like this? No, probably not. Am I glad that I know the risk is there before I purchase one? Yes, I am.",

I had another TMP from his vendors and it did not run well. \u00a0I believe his designs are fine, his sub contractors on the other hand have poor QC or don\u2019t have tight enough tolerances which leads to his guns not running well when assembled. \u00a0Guys have to remember this isn\u2019t the first drop, this is just the first drop of \u00a0using all his parts. He did a separate run of about 25 a while back with German parts kits. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a video of those not running.\u00a0\n\nI will say Tommy has excellent customer service. He privately sent me a video on exactly how to file a g36 lower to fit his receiver. \u00a0He milled my UMP bolt for me the same day he got it and turned it around the next day. \u00a0He will resolve issues with his product.\u00a0",

The gun may not like the ammo as much as it likes the ones it only fails on infrequently, but an \u201cammo\u201d problem would, as I (and I think most) define it, occur on other weapons as well. \u201cAmmo problem\u201d is also a pretty vague description of the concern- are we suggesting a bad batch, or suggesting a bad load/hardware combination? Either way, the propensity for the firearm to experience failures leads to a pretty compelling inference that it\u2019s the gun. \n\nImagine a hypothetical gun that could only reliably fire one brand/load/hardware combination of ammunition (an absurdity, for illustrative purposes). Every other ammo fed through hypothetical gun causes extreme, repeatable, and frequent failures. But ammo X, for whatever reason, always works. I would call that a firearm problem, not an ammo problem. \n\nThese are pretty accepted off-the-shelf brands. Moreover, I\u2019m not familiar with MP7\u2019s having issues like these requiring super-picky ammo selection.  I\u2019m not sure I have a threshold in mind where the problem shifts from gun to ammo, but the extremes seem pretty clear- most ammo works fine, but a few non-standard variations don\u2019t is \u201cammo problem;\u201d using a variety of ammo to figure out who fails the least, but still every mag is \u201cfirearm problem.\u201d",

Again, not accepting of it but it\u2019s to be expected. Most of their shit is under $500. With respect to them they\u2019re barely just above BCA in terms of quality.\n\nHowever TommyBuilt? His products are not only expensive than a mothafucka, they are more limited. Taking a $500 L is easier than taking a $3500 L. I don\u2019t want to take one at all, but Tommy knew better. The problem is that he rushed this shit out because he knew no matter what, 100 dickheads were gonna salivate over it, crash his site, pay the fee and take it to the chin no matter what he put out. \n\nTommy\u2019s core market is the guys/ladies with more money than they know what to do with that want to live out their COD dreams. Your wallet as a consumer, has more power than you think. If you looked at his other firearm drops, they all have had their set of problems.

That means we take every single mount, put it in a suppressor we know to be true, put it on a muzzle device that we know to be true and check it with an alignment rod on a barrel we know to be true. Every \u2013 single \u2013 mount. I say this because we have seen a surprising variance in the CR2 muzzle device tolerances and there\u2019s obviously variance with suppressors. If you put this thing on your gun and it doesn\u2019t rod check good, don\u2019t email us about it. We\u2019ve already checked it. It\u2019s your muzzle device, barrel or suppressor so email those people.\n\n>I have to also say I hate this mounting system. In my opinion and based on what we have seen over the last year of testing, it\u2019s just not very good. I think buying this mount is a poor decision. Not because the HUB mounts are bad but because the mounting system and muzzle devices they\u2019re designed around is bad. You can only polish a turd so much. I think it would be a better use of your time and money to invest in a different mounting system. But as I\u2019ve said before it\u2019s my job to make what people want and that doesn\u2019t necessarily always line up with what I like or what I think is best. It\u2019s long, it\u2019s heavy, it\u2019s expensive, it\u2019ll carbon lock but hey at least you can use the same muzzle device that the military uses for when you\u2019re knee deep in the shit in your boogerloo fantasies or whatever. So here you go, you\u2019re welcome.\n\nAndrew is throwing some mad shade at SureFire.",

If you're in a position where you can move away from it and aren't trying to get into cloning guns that use it, then I'd say look into other options, there's a bunch that might offer what you prefer/need.\n\nJust because a bunch of us like the Plan B system and particularly clones of it (atlas), doesn't mean you have to use it.

I live out west and do a lot of off-trail hiking in the mountains.\n\nWhen I was deciding on my build, I knew I could save some weight going shorter than 16\" without much compromise on terminal performance, and it would be more balanced with the can.  So, I figured my choices were 13.7 -14.5\"\n\nWhen you start looking at mounting options, most QD systems are heavy compared to Rearden.  For example, a 13.7\" barrel with a NOX and keymo adapter is heavier than a 14.5 with R2 and the Atlas.  QD isn't important to me, so why give up velocity for QD.\n\nIf you want the QD, your realistic choices are keymo, SF, YHM, or Griffin.  Now you need to find out what muzzle devices are available for those technologies and if the compatible suppressors meet your needs.\n\nFor me, the Polonium has RC2 performance, but there are more mounting options that result in an overall lighter system at a lower price.  The only compromise I made was needing to go 14.5 instead of 13.9, but that was an easy compromise.",

Go to range and shoot the gun, as it warms up it taper locks to the muzzle device. I used a welding glove and a supressor wrench and it was firmly on there after about 15 shots. When I go to clean the gun a quick pop with the wrench and it's off. So far my experience has also been limited zero shift at 100 yards now this may be due to it being a socom profile dd barrel but zero shifts about 1/2 inch at 50 yards vertically.",

It's very secure\n\nI have a decent amount of zero shift with and without the suppressor, but return to zero has been perfect.",
