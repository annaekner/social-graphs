I appreciate that they promote adoption and community service, such a good idea. They really promote taking responsibility for oneself, like the point about doing great things with your genetics instead of waiting for the next generation to do so, or the point about dealing with regrets and leading a fulfilling life instead of living vicariously through your children. I also like the idea of donating blood to spread your bloodline instead.",

Perhaps she sees the contradiction in that allowing trans people to transition often involves allowing procedures that cause sterilization (which is a good in any antinatalist's eyes), so she chose the side of her that gets far more traction these days (mostly among bigoted idiots on Twitter). It's not like Les and other antinatalists are blowing up by espousing AN loudly and proudly. Doing so seems to bring mostly ostracization.",

Like unless you are seriously suicidal, you can't possibly view bringing new human life into the world as a thing that should literally never happen again. Simply being alive isn't so terrible that it should be viewed as some sort of affliction to be cured. You aren't sparing anyone from overall harm or increasing the amount of goodness in the world by advocating for the \"voluntary extinction\" of the human race. Hell, this way of thinking is only one step removed from straight-up genocidal accelerationism. Like at what point does the cult stop believing in the \"voluntary\" part of human extinction and start seeing it as their responsibility to save mankind from its woes by deliberately snuffing out all life. Like why bring about extinction by persuading people to not fuck, when you could instead support industries and politicians who ignore climate change as a way to try and accelerate humanity toward an extinction event or mass death scenario. The rhetoric is that of a Doomsday Cult. \n\nThis \"Antinatalism\" stuff is weird af. I'm surprised this subreddit is even allowed to exist. Somebody else replied to my original comment and got it 100% right. This is like an even sadder movement than flat-earthers.",

Now, I can\u2019t speak for every AN, but as far as my beliefs go, the human race is corrupt. Always has been, always will be. Of course humans do have some fundamental positive qualities, but our collective negative qualities far outweigh those imo. Look at any society at any point and history and you will find that it collapsed due to greed and/or hatred of the \u201cother\u201d. \u201cOther\u201d meaning any meaningless line we draw between one group of people and another to convince ourselves we are different, so that we may feel superior in some way. Whether this be race, gender, religious belief, political affiliation, sexual orientation, it will always be something. Humans are incapable of co-existing peacefully with each other, yet human connection is also one of our biological needs. The human race is a snake eating its own tail. As hard as we try, and as humane of a government as we try to conjure, eventually, somewhere down the line, greed and hate will come in and thousands if not millions die as a result. It is a pattern we have proven time and time again we are not capable of breaking. And why subject innocent life to the greed and hate that they will eventually grow into, when they could just never exist? When we could all just cease to exist? Our movement is not out of hate for children, or even hate of humans necessarily, but more-so out of a desire to protect the world, its creatures, the universe, and potential human lives, from our sickness.\n\nEdit: typo",

(I\u2019m also an independent voter, not a democrat) hoping our country wises up, knowledge is power!\n\n1.\t\u2060GDP Growth: Since 1945, GDP growth has averaged 4.4% under Democratic presidents compared to 2.5% under Republicans.\n2.\t\u2060Job Creation: Between 1945 and 2021, Democratic presidents have overseen the creation of 82 million jobs, while Republicans have created 36 million.\n3.\t\u2060Unemployment Rate: The unemployment rate has generally decreased under Democratic presidents, with an average reduction of 0.8 percentage points, compared to an average increase of 1.1 percentage points under Republicans.\n4.\t\u2060Stock Market Performance: The S&P 500 has returned an average of 10.8% per year under Democratic presidents, compared to 5.6% under Republicans.\n5.\t\u2060Federal Deficit: Federal budget deficits tend to increase more under Republican administrations.

For example, the Gini coefficient (a measure of income inequality) increased less under Clinton and Obama than under Reagan and Bush.\n8.\t\u2060Minimum Wage Increases: Democratic presidents and Congresses have been more likely to raise the federal minimum wage. For instance, the minimum wage was increased under Clinton in 1996 and Obama in 2009.\n9.\t\u2060Poverty Rate: The poverty rate tends to decrease under Democratic administrations.

Bush and the Paris Climate Agreement under Obama.\n12.\t\u2060Healthcare Costs: The Affordable Care Act, passed under Obama, slowed the growth of healthcare costs, saving families an estimated $2,500 per year by 2016.\n13.\t\u2060Consumer Confidence: Consumer confidence, a measure of public optimism about the economy, has historically been higher under Democratic presidents.\n14.\t\u2060Wage Growth: Real wage growth (adjusted for inflation) tends to be higher under Democratic presidents. For example, median household income grew by 14.9% under Clinton and by 8.1% under Obama.\n15.\t\u2060Social Security: Democratic presidents have generally expanded Social Security benefits or opposed cuts, while some Republican administrations have proposed privatizing or reducing benefits.\n16.\t\u2060Education Funding: Democratic administrations have generally increased federal education funding, such as during the Obama administration\u2019s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n17.\t\u2060Economic Mobility: Research suggests that economic mobility, or the ability to move up the income ladder, has been higher under Democratic presidents.\n18.\t\u2060Tax Rates: Democrats have generally advocated for more progressive tax policies, raising taxes on the wealthy to fund social programs that benefit the middle class.\n19.\t\u2060Veterans\u2019 Benefits: Democratic administrations have often expanded veterans\u2019 benefits, such as the GI Bill under Franklin D. Roosevelt and the post-9/11 GI Bill under Obama.\n20.\t\u2060Infrastructure Investment: Democrats have historically supported greater infrastructure investment, such as the New Deal under Franklin D.

A streak of paint covering either the word \"women\" or the word \"property\" would render that sign useless. \n\nThey'd have to take that to small claims court, and it's not worth their time to pay legal fees for a sign that cost them $10 in materials. lol",

A few days after the argument I asked my grandmother about it. She responded by burning my hand on a coffee maker. \"Spare the rod spoils the child\" and \"don't question god\" were her favorite things to say.\n\nBTW, the thing that they were arguing about? My grandmother gave Pat Robertson my Grandfather's life insurance policy ($100,000 in 1982).\n\nI know for a fact that I wasn't the only one who was raised like that. My whole community grew up that way.

So every year there would be people filing for a change in infertility status. The cost of administering such a law would be more than the increased tax revenue. Also, if someone has been sterilized prior to the law, does it still apply to them?  It\u2019s not like they had any information about this law prior to making the choice to be sterilized. What about those who are childless/childfree and past menopause?  Should they be subject to this law?  Does this apply to biological children only?  And how can any of this be accomplished without violating HIPAA? \n\n4. If your children are no longer dependents, you will need to prove that they exist. Again, a costly administrative process. \n\n3. What a cruel joke to people who really want kids and can\u2019t have them.",

Then, once you have the kid, he wants to put the entire burden on the mother.

My mother started having kids at 16, and I am the second youngest of 4.\n\nTo say that she hated us would be an understatement. \n\nIf we had to wait in the car while my dad ran to get something, she'd pull out this large, thick safety pin, telling us that if we made a single noise, (sniffling, coughing, sneezing, breathing too loud), that we'd be sorry. Within five minutes, I got stabbed twice, my brother once, my older sister once. \nThe second stab was just before my dad got into the car. I didn't know what I did wrong. \n\nShe left me locked in a hot room in the middle of summer when I had a bad cold, sweating and in pain with 103\u00b0 fever. My dad was the one who unlocked the door and saved me. She made some half- heated excuse about me misbehaving and not having enough medicine. \n\nShe neglected me so badly during a serious illness that she was forced to take me to a hospital. The doctor confirmed I had whooping cough. I remember him looking at my mother with confusion, saying, \"This is pretty preventable. I haven't seen a case in a while. You've vaccinated them, right?\"\n\nShe got quiet, then her and the doctor went out in the hall for a while. When my mom came back, she looked angry. Apparently, the antibiotics I'd need were expensive, I got her in trouble with the doctor, and she'd have to monitor me, which to her was \"a waste of time.\"\n\nIt escalated as the years went on. Frighteningly so in my early teen years. (13-15).\nShe would \"accidentally\" leave me somewhere or forget where I was.\nShe \"sincerely\" thought that I would be happier with stranger X, Y, or Z that she happened to have met recently. \nShe'd let me get sick to critical levels any chance she got. \nShe waited until my father wasn't home to shove me out into the snow for hours in only my pajamas. I would hear her crack the front door open every now and again, watching me carefully. \n\nI have never in my life been so obsessively hated to the point of suspiciously murderous levels. According to my older sister, it was terrifying how close she came to ending my life by \"accident.\" \n\nSafe to say I went full no-contact as an adult. \n\nI don't understand how someone who hated children so much would continue having children at all. But she did have this... creepy smile? I can't describe it properly. \nThink, like, those descriptions in books where someone is giving a 'mad smile of delight.'' That's the look she'd get when she hurt us enough to make us bleed. \n\nMy father was abusive as well, but even he became afraid of my mother when he saw the aftermath of her beatings. She got so bad that my dad ceased his abuse altogether and even took us to work with him when he knew my mom would be alone with us. \n\nI never questioned why he didn't marry her. Even the devil knows not to compete with the monsters existing in the shadows. The devil waits for victims. My mother finds them and makes them. \nI don't know where she is today, but murmurings through the grapevine have revealed that one of my siblings just gave birth to a baby boy... and that my mother was on her way to see him, offering to watch him when my sibling went back to work in the future.\nI don't believe in gods or the effectiveness of prayers. But hearing that news makes me wish I did, if only for the small hope of a miracle to save that child's life.",

                    "body": "I\u2019m pretty neutral on natalism myself personally, but holy FUCK this hit close to home.\n\nAt the age of 10 when my alcoholic (not to mention narcissisitic) mother was in another drunken bender, she admitted she regretted having ALL of us, and we\u2019re talking 4 kids over the course of 10 years. To this day she still shit talks each of us individually behind our backs even when sober. The only difference is, and even my grandmother, her own mom noticed it too, was she brought all it on herself. She chose to have every single one of us and would brag about it even, never helped herself with anything. Always blamed shit on whoever, whenever and to this day throws hissy fits whenever she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. I presume that when she started realizing that none of us turned out the way she wanted, this was when she turned on us. My father genuinely cares about me and my siblings, he\u2019s just severely mentally ill (admitted he\u2019s very likely autistic, and I can almost guarantee he has bipolar because his own mother had it, and I have it myself alongside the \u2018tism) and I think my mother took advantage of that, because a lot of times he goes with what my mother says. I mean, the sole purpose of why I\u2019m even here was she simply wanted a mini-me. That\u2019s it. The fact that my mother\u2019s own mother was disappointed in her parenting, and was the one to break the news to me, just goes to show what kind of person she really is. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nFor the longest time I wished I was never born, parroting shit my mother would say. Constantly blamed it on myself. But after finally getting diagnosed with my mental health conditions and going to therapy, nowadays I\u2019m honestly glad I\u2019m here. I wouldn\u2019t have met the friends I have now, and I wouldn\u2019t have met my amazing partner who saved my life from homelessness and helps me through my traumas. Plus, existing is also kind of my very own way of saying \u201cfuck you\u201d to a parent who straight up wished I was dead.\n\nIf I do go down the route of kiddos, adoption/fostering is my VERY first priority. But that\u2019s after I go back to school and into the workforce again (pandemic put a dent in my education, plus my bipolar treatments as mine\u2019s severe). I\u2019m on birth control and it\u2019s been working tremendously so far, but if I EVER happen to fall pregnant, BUT, I\u2019m also in a good place in life, partner or none, I\u2019ll think about it. I do have a little experience from helping my sister raise her kiddos. Because simply not making the mistakes my parents made is already a HUGE step towards breaking the toxic family cycles. Not having kids would probably be an even bigger step, but you honestly never know.\n\nSome people really just should not be parents, nor should they try to persuade or straight up force their partners into having children for their own selfish gains. The NASA one was fucking depressing to read :/",

I know there are so many circumstances around that that we don't always know all the details for, but y'all, your existence is not something to regret, and it's not something that your parents get to throw at you because they're mad and bitter. That shit is on THEM. Their are parents who have gone through so much worse in their experiences as parents who would never DREAM of saying that to their kids. Just because your parents did that does not exonerate or excuse that. They chose to have you and raise you. You didn't ask to exist. Any pain they've caused by being bitter and resentful toward your existence is on THEM.\n\nThis is NOT a pro-natalist statement. Having children should absolutely be an opt-in, not opt-out choice. But the fact that so many people are internalizing the bitter words said by grown ass adults to children is a symptom of children being seen as something that everyone should have, not a cure for that. \n\nWishing you all healing and happiness.

(Stating this as I don't want to make it seem like I'm talking out of my ass)\n\nThey left behind everything they had to provide me a better life than they could ever dream. They went from having careers as respected professionals in their home country to having dogshit, backbreaking, minimum wage jobs where they were treated miserably. In every sense, they socioeconomically downgraded themselves for my sake. \n\nEven as a kid I knew this and felt deeply guilty, I couldn't imagine how much happier, safer, and healthier they would have been had they not come here.\n\nBut they did, had I not been born, they wouldn't have left.\n\nBy the time I started school, I felt even guiltier as now they were using what little money they scaped and bled for to help pay for it. I finally broke and told my mom how I've felt my entire life knowing they burned themselves on the pyre for my sake. (Disclaimer: I had my own difficulties too but theirs is on a different plane and magnitude)\n\nShe proceeded to call me a fucking moron. She berated me for 15 minutes and told me that for me to feel any guilt for her sacrifices was to spit on her work. She told me every tear and drop of sweat was to make sure I could smile, that she had done everything for the sake of even just the idea of giving a better life to another human that wasn't her. \n\nShe didn't do all that for me to feel sorry, for me to miss out on even a moment of relishing the good life she bled to give me. None of our parents went through what they went through for us to not seize the opportunities and to be depressingly deluded by fantasies of the lives they could have lived. I started looking at things differently since then, now with more respect than guilt and it taught me a valuable lesson of what it is to be human.\n\nPart of being human is to pick whatever nutrients we can from our predecessors with the goal of becoming strong enough to do the same for the next generation. She led the life she wanted and decided it was time for the next human in her place to enjoy life, I admire that and will do the same someday. \n\nNote, my mother's not all that religious, just incredibly fucking based.",

He doted on me all my life and was always in my corner.  Then he was diagnosed inoperable liver cancer.  He began to encourage me to settle down & produce a grandchild when I was in my mid-twenties.  Now this was a man who heard me talk all my life about how glad I was to be an only child & how intolerable I find children.  As he finally realized I would never willingly become pregnant, he became increasingly distant.  I was at his side in hospital when he passed away and took care of everything.  He couldn't speak or move at that time, so I can only assume he still considered me outside his circle of trusted people for not fulfilling his wish for a grandson.  I know he loved me, but he did withdraw from me & that's the only reason I can come up with.  All I know is I turned out to be a disappointment to him, and haven't forgiven him, my mother, or myself.\n\nAfter my parents divorced I lived with my mother who tied her tubes after me & threw herself into building public water access & toilet facilities in Cambodian villages on the Methodist Ministry's dime.  Saw my father every weekend, which felt liberating.  Pretty obvious Mom didn't really want to be a parent.  Can't say I blame her --  I feel the same!  I can't begin to express the sadness I feel, knowing I took her life away from her for 15 years.  At the same time, I couldn't bear to let her know I'm anything but happy & well.  I wonder often what she would've been if she hadn't given in to the pressure from my father.  She travels all around the world now, places like Tikal, Malta, Angkor Watt, Ireland, Peru.

I mean there is research of father figures and how they changed and books aimed at fathers  and since the 1970s it is considered a good thing if fathers participate in upbringing and fathers are praised for doing so, but there is no outrage if fathers do not do that.  \n\n\n>... what, having a job? Which is a basic adulting thing? Does this mean men who earn more are better fathers?\n\nTo be fair if a man is unemployed, disabled, wants to be a Stay at Home dad, depressed etc. He is considered a loser, not worthy of a family. But that only goes for men, who are in a bad situation. A man who has a stabile job is considered solid. \nYes, as men sometimes are promoted to have more boring, stabile jobs, but women are asked to give up EVERYTHING to be a mother.\nFor the last question man are judged by their income, higher income better person, better partner etc. but not better father.",

Our culture has become so obsessed with productivity, achievement, and constant stimulation that we've practically banished boredom from our lives.\n\nIt's as if we've all been brainwashed by the \"Hustle Harder\" mantra, endlessly scrolling, tapping, and clicking our way through each day. We've become adrenaline junkies, constantly chasing that next hit of excitement. \n\nBut here's the thing - embracing a little boredom every now and then can actually be incredibly beneficial. It's like giving your overstimulated brain a much-needed vacation. When we allow ourselves to experience the sweet, sweet silence of nothingness, it creates space for deeper reflection, creativity, and inner exploration.\n\nThat's where The Bored Room comes in - a safe haven for the chronically overcommitted, a respite for the relentlessly restless, and a playground for the perpetually preoccupied. It's a sanctuary for the tired, the stressed, and the overstimulated - a place where we can finally unplug, unwind, and unleash our inner couch potatoes. \n\nCome join us in aThe Bored Room, where we simply exist. We sit. We stare. We revel in the sheer, unadulterated glory of uninterrupted, unproductive peace. Subreddit- TheBoredRoomOG",

The closest \"ism\" is safetyism, but it's deeper, it's like: Nothing is meaningful, so just minimize your pain. Suffering through a book or a career or starting a family; not worth it. Of course there's hedonism too, that can make it look fun and cool from the outside. Or video games and porn at least. But hedonism always leads nowhere, your brain adjusts and leaves back in a harm minimization cycle. Then you're looking for SSRIs, posting how upset the latest news event makes you, hating yourself for not exercising or getting enough sun, or whatever the safetyist authority figures tell you.\n\nIt ain't that bleak though, you just need find ways to make the suffering meaningful. This takes creativity, and time, and work, and therefore well, suffering. But w/e, you're gonna suffer anyways. \n\nAnd weirdly, its selflessness that kind of makes this so hard. You will make others suffer, not just by existing but even by finding meaning and happiness. Nothing is worse than being in pain and having someone go, \"it ain't that bad. Anyways bye, I'm gonna go look at something beautiful.\" Most people can't do this, they are selfless (conformists) and jump into the hole with them. \n\nThat moral impulse is false utilitarianim, the drive to minimize harm in the moment always leads to more harm in the end.\n\n(Sorry for making you read this, I'm sure it sounds trite or something.

Because we were forced into life with a consciousness and thought to where we now have to worry not just about living but dying and the fear of it all. Because we were born we are now forced to worry about illnesses, accidents, and therefore, death. And just because we are antinatalist, does not mean we don\u2019t care about people or our family and friends. We might care a little too much, because a lot of us also end up feeling guilt about not enjoying being born when we still love our parents and family members. Yes, we fault our parents for bringing us into this world but we also can love them deeply. We aren\u2019t antinatlist just because of physical aspects of life as in being born with/having to deal with or spreading \u2014 diseases, disabilities, accidents, abuse, etc. but also due to the mental aspects of guilt, pain, anxiety, loneliness, loss, etc. that are felt on a near daily basis simply due to the fact that we are sentient human beings.",

You simply have to adjust your perspective and either choose to look for the positives or the negatives (this one is a lot easier). Also, stop overthinking life so much, try and actually enjoy it.\nI'm not saying in a scenario where you are a slave, for example, you should be happy. You should instead strive to free yourself in order to have the choice.\n\nAgain, how should I know? It just is. The world isn't fair. It sucks sometimes. Sometimes more than others. Some suffer more, some less. If you want, you can help others so they don't suffer so much. That's a very noble thing to do. If you want to just be happy, that's okay too. Either way, don't put the whole world on your shoulders. Try to enjoy yourself and be kind to others. Don't do those who can't avoid suffering the disservice of not at least giving happiness an honest go.\n\nI know it's all empty words at the end of the day, but life is pretty simple. You try to avoid suffering, and you try to be happy. Most of all, try and be present each day. Don't spend too much time on the past or future. Don't despair so much. I promise you, if you stop to appreciate the small things and moments, and maybe sprinkle some optimism in there, it can be pretty great. \nThinking about life too deeply is not very productive.

There\u2019s been SO many things in history changed because someone didn\u2019t like it. They certainly didn\u2019t get told they should off themselves because of it. (Well maybe some, by forgotten people who did nothing)\n\nHere you have 200,000 people in a subreddit that know the world can be so horrible so they aren\u2019t going to gamble on someone else\u2019s life or there\u2019s a few adopters in this group. For you, one troll, to tell all these people that they should leave if they don\u2019t like things makes you seem like a petulant uneducated toddler. \n\nMany ANs are happy with their lives!! They just know that regardless of liking life, someone did take a gamble on theirs and it could\u2019ve went well or horrible. I\u2019ll speak for myself when I say I won\u2019t be a hypocrite and do that to someone else when I don\u2019t like that someone did that to me. \n\nSo, you know, you can cry about our decisions all you want but at the end of the day no one here cares about your shite opinions! \n\nHope you have fun shouting to the void in here! \ud83d\ude01",

I hate the idea of forcing anything on anybody and I can't imagine anything bigger than the forced experience of living.

I expect yours is far worse than mine if this is how you're spending your free time - or dull work hours.\n\nYou sound quite angry and resentful that others aren't sitting down and taking it like you were instructed to. You were taught to Suck It Up Buttercup and when others aren't compliant like you? You feel robbed. But you can't lash out at the powers that be lest you face punishment, so where do you turn? To everyone else getting screwed over. Grasping at any sense of power or superiority you can get in a dog-eat-dog environment. \n\nSo again: yeah, I'll whine. For you. I'll whine because you'd sooner complain about us feeling sorry for you than acknowledge just how bad you really have it for fear of being \"childish\".

Child was not compatible with life, lived five days. SHE knew every step of the way what was likely to happen.\nShe said next time, they'd go through IVF. I remember everyone around her was horrified when she said that, because  1.We were all medical professionals, and all knew no medical intervention could help produce a healthy baby for that couple.\n2. The genetic counsellor reiterated that the two should never get pregnant again.\n\nThe absolute worst thing was how that woman manipulated the situation for sympathy. The sob stories were something. (They couldn\u2019t afford the funeral for the bub, some debacle around baby clothes.) There were many more stories surrounding that couple, and their financial situation. How the frick they were going to afford IVF was anyone's guess.

It\u2019s the exact opposite the government wants!\n\nI hope the reason she didn\u2019t just skip the state and abort somewhere else was to ensure the case got the publicity it needs, but at this point, some states are so entrenched in their prejudice and high off their \u201cvictory\u201d that I don\u2019t know what will turn the tide.",

But everyone just embraces these clear disabilities now. \n\nOf course people born with such ailments don't deserve to be treated differently or subjugated, but we should have enough dignity and common sense to know when not to reproduce. Sadly, we don't, and now we have a bunch of people with all sorts of genetic problems, some being small like needing glasses, having weaker teeth, and others having chronic lifelong effects like down syndrome.",

So it was just a bunch of malfunctioning equipment taking up a lot of my bodies, nutrients and time and healing.\n\nI only add this bitin to give you a little bit of perspective on what it felt like for me. I don't feel like it was really painful at all to recover from it. I had a slight bit of cramping but honestly my cycles before everything was just simply removed. Had been very painful. I had already had an ablation which did not do the trick in terms of relieving pain and issues with my cycle. So for me this was a great relief. If everything is on the up and up with your reproductive health, it might seem like relatively more pain to you, but honestly I think we're talking Tylenol level here.",

But I believe they typically will do either a tubal ligation or bisalp via laparoscopy (I'd encourage her to ask about bisalp as lower risk of pregnancy *and* cancer afterwards). \n\nI had a bilateral salpingectomy done via laparoscopy and it really wasn't a bad experience, plus now I have peace of mind.

They would argue that point, death is always worse than suffering etc, but that seems incredibly contradictory. So that\u2019s the bit about killing the cat. I don\u2019t think the cat should be killed I just think it hypocritical to keep an animal in suffering if that\u2019s your world view. \n\nOwning a pet obviously contributes to ecological problems. I can\u2019t remember the figures off hand but humans keeping pets have a significant effect on the environment. AN often cites ecological problems as to why they wouldn\u2019t bring someone into the world or further, it\u2019s selfish. A cat is quite a luxury given the AN view above. Its selfish as well and contributes to the exact problem they cite as a reason for their AN belief. But they like cats do it\u2019s fine to forget about those things.",

Usually let down by the people in here who don\u2019t understand what their thought processes mean. Such as the OP and yourself. \n\nNow, What has saying the cat should be put down got to do with comparing it to a baby? It is a sentient creature separate from a baby that suffers the exact same logic that AN applies to it. It isn\u2019t a baby. \n\nSo what if the cats adopted? You mean it now has a life worth living? Well if you hold with Benatar that death is the ultimate \u2018bad\u2019 and thus life is worth pursuing once you exist, then great. The cat lives to fight another day. I don\u2019t believe that. I believe that at the point of death it is neutral. At this point if this is true, (Benatar admits this, as it is the thing he is most unsure about.) then it leads to pro-mortalism. He admits then he would have to hold that view. In this case the cat should die. \n\nThe second point is about the hypocrisy of having a luxury (a cat) that is increasing suffering (ecology) whilst using that increase suffering as a reason not to have children. Again the cat and the child are not being compared here. The cat is causing causing a situation where someone decides it is not advisable to give birth.\n\n3. Remove the cat from the photo. It is still analogous to someone holding a picture of their child posing for their belief. Something often ridiculed here. Again no one is comparing a cat to a baby.\n\nByebye now",

He gets drunk every single weekend and they\u2019re always fighting, threatening each other with cops especially whenever she finds out about other women. Oh! He also already has a baby with some lady he hooked up with once. My friend is also poor but she at least has a decent car and her own apartment in a nice part of town but she can barely afford food outside of her bills. I genuinely asked her, does she think having a baby with that person who will most likely not help her emotionally or financially is a good idea? Being in her situation? She said she didn\u2019t care she wants a baby and it\u2019s not fair that he gave the other woman a baby and not her when she\u2019s been dealing with him for years. I honestly felt really bad that her self worth was so low and I really tried to convince her that she should wait to have a baby with someone who loves her and is in the position to raise a child with her. I don\u2019t talk to her anymore but I do know her situation did not get any better since her baby was born \ud83d\ude2c She does uber eats with her baby to get by.",

Sexual education in schools is essentially non-existent. Clinics that COULD make up that educational deficit and provide free birth control and condoms are being shuttered left and right. Abortion is illegal in much of the country. Across all cultures in the US there's still A LOT of pressure on women to keep unwanted pregnancies, regardless of whether the mother can afford it - family and community members tend to emphasize the positives and how 'everything will be ok', (not to mention guilt about even considering abortion) and then after the baby is born that professed help vanishes faster than the father, leaving a poor single mother who needs government support.\n\nSure, there are certainly those idiot adults who WANT kids even though they can't afford them. But so many of the examples brought up in this thread can be attributed to societal conditions - many of those women would NEVER have had that baby if they had the education, financial means, and emotional support to make the decision that's right for them.",

I don't approve of it either but I can understand why someone in survival mode would want to pop out kids to get a chance for a housing unit.\n\nOverall, I disagree. Housing is a basic need yet we need income and credit check in the states. Why can't we require the same for someone to bring their newborn home? People complain about CPS getting reported for parents with lunch debt. They're not feeding tbeir fucking kid, even if it's just because they're too poor. That's child abuse! \n\nI was neglected and starved for the first 18 months of my life. I was born for welfare although it was un a country w a low birth rate so people got paid just to breed, even if they drank/did drugs during pregnancy like with me. I was abused through that before I was even fucking born and my birth mom likely got the money and left me for adoption at birth. Why the hell did she get paid? \n\nI don't agree with poor people having kids. My country doesn't gave room so I don't understand why we encourage the poor to breed. If anything, why can't I get a credit every year that I don't have a kid? I'm poor. \n\nMy best guess is more poor kids = more poor workers wbo will accept shitty pay and working conditions. I'm in the US and realize some of these concepts can vary widely across countries/cultures. People breed in the 3rd world and they have even less money than Americans (who are already poor for the most part.)",

Rabbits are a perfect example. While human beings are capable of ignoring base instincts, someone under heavy stress likely has a lower level of consciousness and is therefore less likely to be able to ignore these impulses.

I grew up thinking that having a water dispenser in your fridge was something only millionares had, same with multi-level homes, and dining out more than 1-2 times per year.\n\nMy childhood was fucking awful, and my mom chose to have 6 more kids (we live in one of the 1st states to have legalized abortion, it was a choice) to put in this situation which made it a thousand times worse. We never had money for anything. My mom has substance issues, so we were either broke from buying or she was dating her new (usually abusive) drug dealer of the month to get her fix. When we did have money, she would go shopping for Victoria's Secret lounge wear, that one fills me with insane amounts of rage to this day. She would let almost anyone watch us, including people who were actively using in front of us. She should have had us all taken away.\n\nHaving children is not a human right, which is why CPS exists. If you can not provide for all of your child's needs on top of your own and then some, you can not and should not have kids. Children are not accessories. They can't survive off their existence alone like a bracelet. We'll never be able to stop people from having kids, but it should be a mandatory process to make every expecting parent take classes on parenting and have their finances assessed.",

Unless you got pregnant then you could get Medicaid and I think they used to let you keep it for as long as your child was little if you were the only custodial parent.\n\nIn high school a couple girls I knew with chronic illnesses had to get pregnant before they turned 18 because they had no idea how they would continue to get medical care otherwise.\n\nI follow this lady on social media who was on a weird reality show. She has serious mental illness and she made her self homeless because of her delusions. Because she\u2019s bodied and can\u2019t admit that she\u2019s mentally ill she couldn\u2019t really get help.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not, but if it\u2019s true, she was smart to have a baby because she wasn\u2019t going to get Housing anytime soon otherwise.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m not advocating for this baby was born addicted to drugs and had to be in the NICU which is why CPS has him, but still.

Why would they consider a world where they wouldn\u2019t have children simply because they were poor? It isn\u2019t even a consideration. \n\n3.

Like I think there is some standing on the fact of society impact on kids and family. I can imagine ppl who could afford a child but not really great insurance. Then child grows up and parents are living within their means. Sacrificing a few things here and there but overall happy. Then child goes to school and sees potentially other kids with more and nicer things. Then from that prospective the child and his family is poor. Kids probably start to think their way of living is not good and someone elses way of living is better. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple. Bc my living with in my means could be different than yours and you could consider our lifestyle \u201cpoor\u201d. \n\nIm in no way saying people who can\u2019t afford children should have anyways. I am saying sometimes you can be at a point in your life where you are making money and all seems well& have kids but then you aren\u2019t at all well and the people who see you in this portion of your lifespan see you poor and just assume you have always been poor and had kids anyways.\n\n\nI should add when I worked and could afford insurance I paid 9,000 out of pocket for my first baby. My second I paid 0 bc of not being able to work while pregnant and temporarily on government assistance. First child I was at peak of my career manager of several departments. Made good money. Bc of health reasons I had to not work with second baby and went ahead and asked for pregnancy related assistance for just my second pregnancy. It. Was. All. Free. My doctor who saw me wouldn\u2019t have know I made lots of money and assumes I\u2019ve always been poor and on to baby #2\u2026.\n\nI would say maybe this is why some chose to stay in poverty bc they get more help than when they worked. It\u2019s life you know you gotta pay what you gotta pay. But if people see this or similar. That I paid 9,000 out of pocket with insurance I paid for vs nothing for government related pregnancy insurance. I think you would continue to see ppl in poverty having kids. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

That's where I draw the line typically. Expressing this before that line is crossed is unhelpful for the parent or child and might start aggression prematurely.\n\nI would caution against having \"no respect for parents\" and find a way to assess the person regardless of their status. Do they make choices that impact you? If yes to, and they impact you negatively, then find a more nuanced way to express your disinterest in that specific person, and I'd tend to agree more with you. I don't generally have more respect for parents than any other person I meet simply because they are parents, until they've done something to earn the respect.

I don't think poor people OR rich people should have kids - not rich in the sense if they are going to raise the kids with a lavish lifestyle - huge house, brand name, designer everything, limo rides all the time, first class flights, luxury world travel, etc. it robs people of the joy and appreciation of these things later. I have met lots of people like this and it is almost always the case. It is best to raise kids with a solid middle class to upper middle class lifestyle (even if you are wealthy in the bank). The middle path is best - not for parents to have economic anxiety, have all the essentials covered with a bit of cushion, but not raise joyless, spoiled monsters either. Moderation and appreciation is key! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

Parents who deserve to raise kids and those who don't and those who improved greatly from sheer will to provide a better life for their kids.  \n\nBringing someone into the world is not solely a curse.  Being alive is a blessing and a curse all at the same time.  Of course its not good to raise a kid if you can't afford to, i already agree with that.\n\nI have no idea why you're bring slaveowners and rapists into this.  If you mean parents who sexually assault their children then of course i find that reprehensible and disgusting.  Ive known girls who thats happened to and it messed them up horribly.  And even if i hadnt seen the results, you can certainly infer the results.\n\nLast thing I want to refute is your claim that a child will become a wage slave for 60 years.  Thats just not true.  There are many who remain in poverty but many who break out as well and become financially more stable.  But that's almost more of a critique of capitalism and existing power structures, etc.  There's many factors that contribute to poverty and staying poor or losing money after making it.  Many of those things include bad habits and sort of a closed loop.  If you're exposed to methods of how to become more financially independant thats probably the most helppful along with self esteem boosting that you are able to and deserve to be happy especially with money.  Learning a variety of skills is probably the best in my opinion so that you aren't tied to one job.  But there are also learned behaviours like socially accpted alcoholism, smoking and gambling that are coping mechanisms that also keep one poor.  Ive had my own experiences with all those vices.\n\nDon't go around and throw out damning buzzwords like slaveowners and rapists, wageslaves and death sentence and then also claim i have no idea what im talking about.

Honestly I think most people are under the assumption \"it'll never happen to me\" and a lack of planning seems to be more rooted in that mindset. I'm pretty sure too that if you die and have minor children, they'll receive social security checks until they turn 18. I don't think it should be relied upon and the responsible thing is to of course have a plan set for serious injury and/or death of one- if not both- parents... but, knowing our fellow man, I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for everyone to get their shit together. \ud83d\ude43\n\nI know YOU didn't say anything about being rich, but I've noticed a theme with some redditors on this sub. A lot seem to think people who don't have \"x\" amount of money shouldn't have kids and some even resent that their parents had them and that they grew up \"poor\". I've just seen firsthand that money doesn't necessarily mean \"better\"",

You're just lying and styling yourself as superior to everyone else who you think is unworthy of existence.\n\nThe issue isn't how you live your life.

I chickened out, I'm not paying 400 bucks to later find out they thought I want them to cut off my balls or something similar. I chose to get it done after we'd move to Europe, where they know what it is and can do it with a special laser. So I wonder if it was similar for you where you are or better.",

Seems you are very affected by your family's oppinions, which means they are affecting your quality of life as well - you are making decisions (small and bigger ones) not thinking of your interest first, but theirs.

Family should improve your life, make it better, not turning it to misery.\n\n\nPS. I don't know your age, but keep in mind things change, and your wife could turn her mind about kids (trust me, it CAN happen very likely).

Literally had one of her mom's cousins tell us that we weren't really married because we weren't trying for kids.   Luckily not people we had to see every year or anything like that.",

Written by Harald Ofstad, professor of applied philosophy at the University of Stockholm.  Said contempt for weakness was the driving force of Naziism, and antisemitism mainly to the extent that being Jewish was deemed weakness.  Argues that Naziism wasn't (and isn't, tbh) so much a unique one-of-a-kind philosophy as it was/is *an exaggeration of* certain mainstream Western values - values still widely held today.  Warns that without tackling contempt for weakness (and other kinds of distaste for mere difference from the norm) something like Naziism is bound to arise again sooner or later. You've been warned!\n\nWhen kindness is deemed weakness, and the weak are held in contempt, what happens to society?",

It's also a way to show that beneath my criticism and disapproval, there is love, even for someone I don't know, don't agree with, and probably won't ever meet in person.\n\nThere is love because that person I'm sure is loved by many people in their life, who know them directly, just like I love the people in my life, and I would always want the people I love, to be treated with love, even by strangers.\n\nPeople that believe in God and pray, can feel like they're all part of the same struggle. We can bond in the difficulties of life. I think a lot of people on this sub are just pissed at life for other reasons, and it's sad that for a lot of young people, good old fashion faith and determination aren't tools that they were really given. Not by society, their parents or anyone else for that matter.\n\nIf I can help even one person, even from a distance, to get a sense of empowerment and climb over whatever is making them think life isn't worth it, then that's fine.

Heresy where the shit gets interesting and the religious authorities say no go there.\n\nEver heard of the book called High Magick by Damien Echols?\n\nInterestingly, the Lord's prayer is one of the rituals as it has a tremendous protective effect.\n\nYou can choose to believe in that or not too, but lesser magick doesn't have to defy physics. It has tremendous power just in it's bridging between our psyche and fundamental truths of reality.\n\nIf there is a truth about anything, just remember that it's authority figures like clergy and government who distort the truth to their own benefit.\n\nThey can even take something like the Lord's prayer, and make it into a symbol of oppression.\n\nDon't give them that power. Let good, wholesome things be good, and protect their use and symbolism from tyrants. Part of that is simply refusing to go with the lie. Don't let bad people run our symbols, rituals or anything else.\n\nKeep it free, distributed, decentralized and open to new influences that can have a new take on old, stale ideas.\n\nIf you think about it, that's what history is.

God is actually an empty variable. undefined.\n\nWhen a \"people\" allege that \"God\" is their ruler, if you follow, that means they don't have a ruler, therefore the incoming tyrant is illegitimate by virtue of being less than \"God\" which equals \"undefined.\"\n\nIt's an interesting trick, really, because the reality is, when group-think kicks into gear, all of the dumb sheeple who follow \"God\" are actually following men, who claim to have communication with \"God.\"\n\nThat being said, a lot of sheep seem to like tyrants, as long as the tyrant is persecuting people they don't like.\n\nNow look back at the original character of this whole Christian show we've been watching for 2000+ years\n\nOriginal guy Jesus and perhaps earliest followers had something interesting and revolutionary going on, but as the group-think rolls along, it all turns into virtuous excuses for rape, tyrants and conquests.\n\nLikewise you have communists which are a new social experiment. What's their magic? Atheism and the abolition of the empty symbol \"God.\"\n\nSo who takes the place of that empty symbol, which rests vacant in the minds of every human? Like an empty seat, or throne, only empty because there truly seems to be something hard-coded in our brains that desires that CATCH-ALL empty symbol of \"whatever I don't get it God must have done it.\"\n\nThat empty God Throne gets filled by Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao, Kim Jong whatever!\n\nSo, why I respect the concept of God, is because from the evidence I see, God is a symbol that casts off tyrants, and then gets used by tyrants. It's a powerful symbol. But power doesn't make it necessarily bad, especially if it can be used to cast off a Hitler or a Stalin.\n\nLike all symbols it's a tool. Use it to liberate yourself. You can say things like \"don't tell me what to do! My only master is God.\" Lol\n\nTry that in China, and you'll be working in an Apple \ud83c\udf4e factory in NO TIME.\n\nWhen they colonized America in the early days, people used their religion to create a culture that eventually welcomed everybody. It's not perfect but it's more true in America than anywhere else. Take a second to think about it. I know a lot of shit talk about America goes on, but I really don't think there is a more free place in the world, as far as people and ideas, from a general standpoint.\n\nGod was a symbol that in that case was used to cast off monarchy. I think that was a win, a step in the right direction.\n\nSo I wouldn't throw God away completely. It's useful.",

I like to think of him as a time period-accurate anarchist that caused such a ruffling of feathers that they had to hang him up on a cross to get him to shut the fuck up.\n\nNot unlike Socrates or many other antagonizer types. I do realize the ideas and methods were very different but those antagonizer types play an important role in making sheeple turn into GOATS\n\nChristianity is very right hand path for most followers, which again, can be good or bad depending on the energy and will of the person holding the ideas.\n\nOkay, so the reason for my antagonizing here, and my use of Christianity, is to weed out and reject the arguments of the anti-natalists that are just religious, group-think idiots of a different breed than \"evangelists.\"\n\nThe most scary religious people to me, are the ones that replace God, with the state. They often call themselves atheists, but in practice, they believe in a god-like concept. Such religious statists are very anti family because the decentralized institution of family is the biggest threat to the state and its holy monopoly over death and violence.\n\nWhen the state says do something stupid, real family people be like, \"fuck you\"\n\nAnd that stops guys like MAO from killing 20 million people for no reason.\n\nWe all gotta know who the new \"Catholic\" church is. It's this slippery slimy government overreach and erosion of individual rights to rule ourselves.\n\nAlso, just want to point out that the true destruction of the Christian religion is when it became the Roman religion of the state under Constantine, I think. I mean I don't know all the details like a scholar but I would point to that being a big part of how it got roped into so many scams and murder conquests.\n\nI mean seriously. Co-opted, appropriated, whatever you want to call it.",

The average woman knows that there are multiple methods of birth control that can be combined to give us a damn near 0 percent risk of pregnancy. Fun fact: more abortions actually happened after roe vs wade was overturned\u2026 women are still getting plenty of abortions. If you think the average woman just \u201chates\u201d herself and feels that that is why they voted then I would suggest you try to look for other reasons why people wouldn\u2019t have voted for Kamala and/or would have voted for Trump.

But the older I got, the more disgusted I was, and when I became anti-natalist, I hated her even more, my son is so wonderful and always makes me happy, but we're not rich, I'm not smart, and I have no formal education, not only that I feel horrible when I have to show him how the world works, I know he won't have an easy life and he won't be able to blame me because he loves me\n\nLast month my aunt died and he asked me about death, I just explained to him and he started crying and telling me he doesn't want me or him to die, I wanted to cry, but I stopped being able to cry a long time ago, now his mother wants to see him, and I don't know what to do, I hate her so much but I also know she loves him \n\nSome people have told me I should report her, but I can't it's too late. Nothing good will come from that \n\nShe technically still has parental rights, my parents made a deal with her, we don't report her, and she gives him to us, but lately she keeps calling my parents and telling them she wants to see him, even after they threatened her she still doesn't back off, and tells them she's changed ",

Please if you can, tell someone. If she denies it, it's quite easy to clarify with a blood test. Then match up some dates. It will be clear that you were a child when she got pregnant.

But the fact is that no matter how you feel now, you and your family kept that child and his physical and emotional well-being is your responsibility; furthermore, there will come a day when that child will come to resent you for disallowing him the opportunity to know his mom based on how you feel. \n\nAlso, what do you actually *know* about death? There are ways to explain it to child that aren't from a place of anger and bitterness, and won't terrify them. Holding on to anger and hate is like swallowing poison and expecting the other person to die. What's more, you are setting the example for your son. Do you really want him growing up and thinking that the correct response to being hurt is revenge? Look around at the world and tell me in all honesty that that approach doesn't cause it to burn. \n\nIt is also apparent that your parents seem to hold you responsible, unless they are raising your son like he's theirs. I'm not saying that is right or wrong, unless they are putting the financial burden on you. That would be wrong, especially if they insisted on custody. \n\nIf I seem harsh I apologize, but there is a reason for it. It is now 100% about your child's emotional well-being. Your feelings on the subject no longer relevant and should be kept out of his sight. My advice to you is to take the love that you have for your son and understand the lesson it can teach you. Use it to practice forgiveness and let those feelings go for your son's sake. \n\nYou don't need to make a happy family with her, or even associate.

None of it adds up unless this was some off the books baby and nobody else knows OP, OPs family, or the rapist. But considering she has other kids, it\u2019s gonna be fucking hard to hide a pregnancy, let alone what you did with the baby after.\n\nChild abandonment is a crime unless done through the appropriate channels.

Meaning it is not a matter of morality because it is not a conscious decision.\n\nI want people to be as righteous, angry, judgemental against rapists as they are right now. But I don't want them to have this attitude against pedophiles who aren't rapists. \n\nSo I hope by speaking about this nuance, people will stop misusing the word pedophile as a synonym for rapist and hopefully this means we are better able to help, prevent, monitor and protect against sexual child abuse.\n\nThanks for the respectful talk, you rock.",

This could possibly lead to, particularly in the case of china, a national collapse unprecedented in our life time. To summarize, it's economy  is heavily reliant on low skilled manufacturing. A young work force is necessary to maintain this, and there are few other markets they could successfully occupy due to not breaking out of the middle income trap/ geographic reasons. This means pretty soon low birth rates could send the country into a death spiral, which would cause untold levels of human suffering for people who are pretty happy with there lives. The historical precedent for national collapse in china, is war lords and lot and lot of dead people.\n\nNot saying internationally this is hold true as of now, but an aging humanity would not be gracefull. It would be back to ye-olden days for most people, and not in Tolkenist fantasy type of way, more in a get pillaged, raped, and enslaved type of way.\n\nGovernments should try maximally improve peoples quality of life, and make reproduction incentivized and family building subsidized. However ironically, even some of the biggest, winners in rolling out these types of reform this, France and Sweden for example, still have dwindling sub replacement birth rates compared to people in hell on earth circumstances in Africa, the middle east, and other places. To some extent personal responsibility to humanity and the continuation of our species is going to have be expected for us to have a prosperous happy future.\n\nI'm a proponent of fazing in some new-deal esq reforms in America to resurrect the American dream. But it seems like, even in the best case senario for most countries, some social conservatism and baby making pressure is going to have to exist if we want to avoid catastrophe.

Why not buy the cheapest things, or the things no one else buys, and leave the good things for other people? But something being selfish doesn't inherently make it a bad thing. Does the selfish thing *actively* harm anyone else? If it doesn't, then it's not a bad thing to do. Selfish, yes. But not harmful to anyone. \n\nThat shopping example is quite terrible, i will admit, but let me explain it a bit. Something being selfish means it's something you do predominantly for personal gain. When you go shopping, you buy things only with your own personal interest at heart. No one goes shopping and thinks, \"I'm gonna buy this specifically so that other people can have the better alternative.\" Therefore, shopping is selfish. However, it doesn't actively harm anyone around you. So it's not a problem. \n\nMuch like most things in life, selfishness isn't black and white, good or bad. It depends on *context.*",

Heck, have you ever ridden a car or any form of public transit, well, you are using the fruits of some environmental destruction.\n\nBut vaccinating animals that are not pets is the exact opposite, it can come only through higher taxes, it's best if they come from the rich, but we all know that has an even lower chance than what we are talking about. And if it happens, give it a decade, now it's no longer so. Because helping nature takes resources away from people and therefore makes us poorer.\n\nHaving both a perfectly intact and healthy environment AND having TVs, internet, phones, etc. is not compatible, it's a contradiction brought about as a consequence of what resources nature itself says are needed (you can't change cobalt for some simple rocks, it has to be cobalt due to its inherent physical and chemical properties that arise from immutable laws of nature, namely quantum mechanics), where those resources are and how to efficiently (synonymous with cheaply, otherwise it will be more expensive for you, the consumer) get them, which most often than not happens to involve some environmental destruction. \n\nThis is why I am antinatalist, utopias are impossible, we cannot have our cake and eat it too, but the unborn are perfect, they have no wants and they are literally incapable of minding or caring or complaining about anything whatsoever AT ALL.\n\nOn the veganism stance, that is easier to defend, veganism has some pretty good arguments.

Same reason we ain't satisfied with having what animals have, they just don't know more or even have a grasp of it, ignorance is bliss.\n\nI know you didn't want me to use the word \"human\", but I hope I expressed my reason as to why I treat humans different to animals, but don't expect it to sound satisfying. Life isn't satisfying and rarely gives such answers.\n\nEthics is solely a human thing, a bear will not care if it tramples you, it will not mourn, not will most other animals (apes might be different, unsure), and reality as in the Universe and all its laws REALLY doesn't care for ethics, an asteroid capable of killing most life will not change its trajectory for us.\n\nBut I do agree animals feel real physical pain, like humans do, they just don't care if they inflict it on others. A lion kills a deer without mourning. A seagull will eat a mouse the same way. Just giving examples, you know the jist. Sounds terrible, right? Welcome to objective reality!

From her point of view, she 'sacrificed' time, resources, and her health in some ways, to have you.  Her self-esteem is tied up in your success.  Not material success but in your *evolutionary* success.  Her evolutionary worthiness as a woman with reproductive potential was satisfied through successfully reproducing; her worthiness as a mother is tied up in *your* reproductive potential.  If you fail to reproduce, all those expended efforts and resources were pointless.  She bought the genetic blue chips, now she wants her return on investment.

                    "body": "Her societal worth is also tied to that extremely, ESPECIALLY as a woman, though men have that problem too to some extent. I have seen women who think they only truly will experience womanhood, when they have a child, and I know at least one woman, who said that women without children are inherently inferior to herself, if they have not birthed children. A similar thing goes for being a grandmother. The women want status and do not care about the child at all. And it is only partly biological as in a pack animal like humans not every individual is supposed to reproduce, some individuals are there to either adopt in case parents die, be aunties and uncles or do other things to ensure survival of the pack. Plus, we are humans and thus more than our instincts. Like say I was not childfree and not AN, and my child did not want children I would respect them, because they are people with their own values. I would be sad, if my child suffered poverty and bpd, but I would not blame my child for ressources as it would have been my choice to take the risk. ( Am non- binary afab )\nIn addition to that, from my observation people treat their children and grandchildren  as objects and projects not as people.\nI have seen eldery people having the following conversation:\nEldery man1: \"My daughter takes me to her holiday flat every weekend.\"\nEldery Man2: \" That is nice and good, but my daughter visits every weekend and cooks for me for the entire week.\" \nEldery Man3: \"And MY daughter lives with me. She cooks for me and cleans the house. And my granddaughter works in an advert agency and earns a lot of money, she has a great car.\" \nHaving children and grandchildren was something akin to having a fancy car or a tool and grandchildren were a fancy gimmick.  \nAnd there even has been a study, where they said that middle class parents treat their children as projects, which leads them to bragging with their children's achievements and compare their child to other children. I was born in 1988 in Russia and I experienced this: \"Look at Dima, he is like a little adult already and you are so childish.\" \"Look at the children in the children's singing show, look what they can do in your age, you are already 4, 4, do you realize that? And you are running around echollalling, look at those children, they sing and dance.\"",

I\u2019m a young woman and I get the impression at least half of women like the idea of having kids and genuinely want them. \n\nI think the issue is that as much as Redditors love to say we have equality and that actually society is skewed in favour of women (not sure how both statements can be true but ok), the vast majority of parenting still falls on women. If you\u2019re a woman who wants to have a kid, you basically need to accept that most aspects of your life will never be the same again and in fact, many aspects will get WORSE. Pregnancy and childbirth can result in many permanent health and bodily changes (for the worse), many women suffer from mental health issues as a result of childbirth trauma and just general post-partum depression, responsibilities still aren\u2019t divided up equally etc. I still read so many stories about how people\u2019s female friends just completely disappear when they give birth but their husbands continue living life as normal, continue to go out with their friends at the same frequency as they used to (sometimes even more!) etc \n\nAs a woman, why would you choose to have a kid when it\u2019s so unfairly burdensome on the woman while the man suffers almost no impact? And on top of all that society ostracises mothers, claps for men doing the bare minimum when they change a nappy once every few months and bullies mothers into getting \u201cmommy makeovers\u201d while \u201cdad bods\u201d get celebrated and circlejerked over in the media everyday. \n\nEvery parenting mishap or anything like that gets blamed on the mother. Even in this subreddit people are guilty of it. \u201cGahhhb why do women continue to shit out kids\u201d. I saw a comment that was angry at women for continuing to give birth for thousands of years, completely ignoring there was no access to birth control back then and marital rape was fully legal and thought of as fine. In many parts of the world women still don\u2019t get any say in whether they reproduce or not. \n\nRight wing men harp on about how women need to go back to being mothers but then post shit like \u201cWomen didn\u2019t work for thousands of years!!!! Enough is enough\u201d as if having to shit out and raise 7 kids while still doing all of the labour at home and farm work isn\u2019t work. You just can\u2019t win. No wonder women are opting out. Motherhood is simultaneously expected of you but disrespected and not recognised as real labour. Why would you want to do something that is seen as your only calling in life but then is used to put you down?\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that as the world continues to get worse and worse, more people are waking up to the realities of what\u2019s to come (climate change, potentially another world war) and are deciding to opt out. A few months ago Putin called on Russian women to start having more children. I just can\u2019t believe the audacity of it. \u201cFeeemaaaaaleeees, please have 10 kids each so we can send all your sons off to get exploded to death by drones after you already spent 18 painstaking years raising them.\u201d No fucking thanks.\n\nEdit 2: I forgot to add how the cherry on top is the fact that after all the suffering you\u2019ve gone through to carry the baby and give birth to it, for some fucking reason society still expects the child to have the father\u2019s surname. I mean wow, what a way to recognise the backbreaking labour. A man\u2019s role in creating a child consists of ejaculation and that\u2019s it. Why is it HIS name that gets passed down?

I respect people who dream of being parents and try their best to do it right and actually commit to it, but it\u2019s just not compatible with the life I want to lead. \n\nBut, being a woman and having known women from different parts of the world and of different ages/generations, from different socioeconomic backgrounds and cultures, I have to say this:\n\nA lot of women do want children. But they don\u2019t trust men enough to do it anymore. They also don\u2019t trust the economy, and they don\u2019t feel ready. Mostly because of job/money instability. It\u2019s usually instinctive to women to at least postpone having children unless they feel completely safe and protected, with a stable home life and finances. Women had to grow up knowing very well they will be doing most of the work by themselves, and nowadays, just one source of income for a family just won\u2019t do, generally speaking. They don\u2019t want to be tied down to just any guy, and they\u2019re scared of even getting married earlier than in their mid 30s/40s, because men haven\u2019t exactly given them the idea they will be faithful and committed and work as hard as they would. It\u2019s also the fact that woman are _expected to work _ now. Which means husbands often see stay at home wives as lazy parasites, because they would be still expected to do all the house work and child raising even if they worked. We were told that being a stay at home mom is \u201clame\u201d and out, and being independent girlboss is \u201ccool\u201d and in, and with men pushing back on such concepts (as if they have a say lol) with such passion, women feel like they can\u2019t trust men anymore. Most of them want to have children eventually I think, they just want to take better control over the conditions under which they\u2019re gonna do it (at least from my experience getting to know other women), which I think is positive and very responsible! \n\nAlso, they can no longer hide from women how _absolutely horrible and disgusting and terrifying pregnancies are/can be_ , so of course women would think twice before making such a decision LOL. Not to mention women who have health issues or mental health issues and want to be able to focus on themselves and their healing, which is more than fair. \n\nBut yeah. Mostly economy, culture and fear/mistrust in the modern men, really. \n\nBut some women, such as myself, are just becoming aware that this is a life path for women who _really want it_. It\u2019s not for everyone\u2019s taste, but it\u2019s also not for everyone\u2019s capabilities. Some women are gonna be great mothers, but I would be great doing other things. There are other ways a woman can contribute to the world. There are other types of \u201cchildren\u201d one can give birth to (a project, a job, a dream, a community, a cause, an ideal). And to some of us, that feels like a more fulfilling path, where we can actually do good. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s best to let people who _want children_ to have a go at it, to ensure the kids are gonna be wanted, planned for, protected, and most importantly, loved. This is good. There is no universal good or bad when it comes to having kids or not, it\u2019s gonna be different for every person/family. What\u2019s important is knowing and doing what\u2019s best and smarter/more responsible for _you_.",

It occurs in every country worldwide as they transition from a rural agricultural/mining dominated economy with a bottom heavy population pyramid (lots of kids, lots of infant mortality, not many old people, lower lifespans) to a modern developed western-like economy/lifestyle (urbanization, high lifespans, education, wealth, health care, essentially the easy life when compared to history). This results in people having less kids, sometimes below replacement level (though this seems to be more of a housing/cost of living crisis more than anything else). \n\nThis makes perfect sense; your kids don\u2019t have a 40% chance of DEATH before they turn 10 now so you don\u2019t need to have 7 to make sure enough survive. Kids also go from an economic resource in an agricultural undeveloped economy (child labor on the farm was the NORM throughout human history) to an economic burden (developed countries don\u2019t have a need for child labor and we now have to work more to support them for 18+ years, whereas before they worked and helped us).",

Prior to that, it was mostly farm labor and things that benefited greatly from having an extra set of hands--as many as you could possibly get.\n\nAfter the Industrial Revolution, factories and foundries and whatnot became widespread and the main source of work. Around this time, crucially, *child labor laws* were put in place, preventing children from going to work in the factories... reducing them from contributors to income to a blackhole of income that requires 18 years of care. Suddenly, there was no incentive to have children. As a matter of fact, if you were intelligent, you were incentivized to have *less* children.\n\nThe numbers themselves do NOT tell the whole story, you have to look into the history of this stuff.",

I think it's a culmination of all of these things that the birth rate is going down.\nPersonally, I believe we're at an optimal birth rate right now (hovering near 2). But the reason why the birth rate is going down is kinda messed up. \nFunny how my dad says \"The means are more important than the ends.\" And I believe that the ends justify the means but tbh, I think it's a balance of both.

If I could sum it up in a word, that word would be risk.\n\nAs women become more educated, and that includes learning about the dangers of pregnancy, which health class doesn't even begin to cover, more women are choosing to opt out because they see that motherhood looks like it freaking blows. I LOVE to see it.\n\nGoing back to the risk part. Women risk their physical, mental, and emotional health throughout the whole process of pregnancy and childbirth (ew), both of which are an incredibly overwhelming experience on your body (which is never the same afterward). Then there's the financial health piece where mothers are valued (and paid) less in the workplace vs. fathers who actually see pay increases. Civilization has continued to use women't unpaid labor for centuries, while having the audacity to gaslight us into thinking that pain is our \"womanly strength.\"\n\nThen, of course, there's the invisible work of parenthood, which is downright sexist. Like you pointed out above, men can basically go out living their lives, working, seeing friends, and not being relegated to being a side character in someone else's life. It doesn't matter how progressive your partner, husband, etc. may be, as the women, you will do over 90% of the work in raising the child. It's a thankless job. Maybe you get a pat on the head now and then, but at the cost of everything else. It's downright insulting.\n\nOnce you become a mom, you can never go back to not being a mom (at least not in a way that would be illegal or looked down upon in society). The reason why men want children more than women is because they don't really have anything to lose. They don't carry it for 9 months. They can't die during childbirth or sacrifice their health in other ways (over 50% of women have post-pregnancy complications). They don't sacrifice the body they like and feel home in. They are not expected to put their career on hold. They are not expected to put \"good dad\" at the top of their priorities. They are not expected to give up their free time. They do not have to lose their identity to be a \"good dad\" in the eyes of society.\n\nYou're damned if you do, damned if you don't. I decided years ago that I may as well be damned living my life as I want and choose to as a childfree woman.",

Pregnancy and childbirth can result in many permanent health and bodily changes (for the worse), many women suffer from mental health issues as a result of childbirth trauma and just general post-partum depression, responsibilities still aren\u2019t divided up equally etc. I still read so many stories about how people\u2019s female friends just completely disappear when they give birth but their husbands continue living life as normal, continue to go out with their friends at the same frequency as they used to (sometimes even more!) etc.\n\nNot too long ago the father's income was enough to live well, and women could stay at home without that extra worry. Also, yes, woman with kids and the man straying, bringing diseases home. S\u00f3 natural. A woman who didn't give birth at 30 was \"barren\", a major offense. Not wanting kids was ungodly.\n\nI don't have the data, but perhaps post-partum depression wasn't as common (though I know it existed), simply because the women were homebodies, the future was laid for them (same husband forever) and not that many lifestyle changes in times when grandparents and siblings were close by. Now not anymore. Today's women worry about back to job, little or no support network, DRASTIC chance in lifestyle forever, the always present possibility of divorce, the getting in shape pressure, the perfect mom pressure... \n\n\nStill, many men and women want kids. \n\n>Edit: I forgot to add that as the world continues to get worse and worse, more people are waking up to the realities of what\u2019s to come (climate change, potentially another world war) and are deciding to opt out. \n\nRightfully.",

Hell, I even had to fight to get the regular oral birth control which I needed for medical reasons, they wen't, oh, we don't wanna mess with your hormones, what if you want a bayyybe, you haven't given birth yet. The condition that I have causes infertility in most cases and literally needs oral BC to manage it and stabilize the hormone levels. \n\nEven in private clinics, the doctors are like that, and I'm not in the part of the world where you can frivolously sue a doctor or a clinic for \"malpractice\" (giving you exactly what you asked for). Even in cases when there's actual malpractice involved, they will be like, yep, we investigated ourselves and found that we did nothing wrong! So, it's 99% not seeing women as full humans capable of making their own decisions and only 1% \"oh, what if she regrets it and sues us\".\n\nConversely, I've even spoken to several guys who got their vasectomies at *19-early 20s*. Meanwhile, I'm being dismissed or outright laughed at in my late fucking 20s. The situation is just not the same at all.",

                    "body": "Fantastically said. I don\u2019t have time to address everything you said but the invisible work of motherhood is, from what I have observed, soul destroying. \n\nWhat I hate the most is how the divide in labour is so unequal that women become \u201cmummy\u201d to everyone else while men get to keep their identities. I don\u2019t know how well I explained this so I\u2019ll use an example. If you live in the UK, you might have noticed that a lot of tabloids and newspapers just refer to women as \u201cmum\u201d in their articles. Like \u201cMum of 3 gets hit and run over by drunk driver\u201d - it\u2019s always articles where the woman\u2019s parenting status has absolutely no relevancy to what\u2019s being said. I NEVER see men who happen to have children being described first and foremost as \u201cdad\u201d. And we all know why that is. When you become a dad, you still get to be yourself, whereas when you become a mother that\u2019s it, the outside world doesn\u2019t see you as anything else but \u201ca mum\u201d after that point. \n\nWhy does this happen? Because women still do the vast majority of childcare. It\u2019s just what\u2019s expected of us, to the point where if a dad actually does something for the child people comment on how \u201che\u2019s babysitting\u201d. YOU CAN\u2019T BABYSIT YOUR OWN DAMN CHILD PEOPLE. It just shows how many fathers just don\u2019t give a shit. They just had kids so they can say they passed on their genes and that\u2019s it. They don\u2019t actually have any interest in raising the kids or seeing them develop. \n\nMy dad was like this. My parents are still together but I think of my mum as a single mother because she basically did everything while working a full time job (earning more than my dad may I add). Meanwhile he\u2019d get home and immediately go on his PC to play games. His only interactions with me were to scream at me if my grades weren\u2019t good enough (I.e. I got a B on some inconsequential test I didn\u2019t bother to study for when I was 12 while the rest of my grades were As). He barely talked to me outside of screaming about my grades. We just sat in silence if my mum was out of the room. He didn\u2019t know a single thing about my friends or anything like that while my mum could list all of them and every fact about me. I doubt my dad could tell you what musical genre I listen to or what my favourite colour is. \n\nMy mum is the one that actually sat with me to help me study for my GCSEs and A Levels. My dad would scream at me and then go back on his shitty online game. If you want me to have 100% test scores across all subjects then DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Instead he just left all the hard work to my mother and nowadays has the audacity to brag to people about his daughter getting into a good university. Dude, why are you bragging? You literally had no input in this - it was 100% my mother. \n\nSorry for the rant but I really want people to read this so it finally sinks in why so many women are opting out of motherhood. WHY would I subject myself to this after observing the way my parents parented me? I know I\u2019m not the only one that experienced this. I actually have 2 friends with shitty dads as well that basically got solely parented by their mothers. Oh, that brings me to another thing I hate: how single mothers are bullied by society and incels even though they\u2019re the parent that actually stuck around. I\u2019d love to see the same energy directed at deadbeat dads (of which there are too many) or men with a secret second family, but I know it\u2019ll never happen.",

To this day, I resent him so much for how much harder he made my mom's life. She's basically his nurse. She didn't sign up for that. My mom took it all on and did the best she could in trying to keep things normal for my brother and I. She did not always do well, but she did the best with the tools she had. Looking back, I constantly find myself wishing he had died the night he had the stroke. It would have sucked losing a dad that young, but I would have remembered him in a more positive light than I do now.

They often treat emotions the way you should treat logic and treat logic the way you should treat emotions. What this causes, is nonreaction to emotional sharing, as its all treated like useless facts they dont know what they could do with, and criticism of their logic gets received as emotional invalidation and personal attack or dismissal which is big fuckin danger. It makes even just having casual conversations completely impossible. Its often really hard to communicate this to them as well because they literally just dont understand the difference between emotions and logic, or have solidified the meanings in their brain backwards. You can teach them all the lessons about emotional validation that you want, and they will just apply it to situations of discussing logic, it will never click in their brain how and when to use those skills appropriately.\n\nThe few guys i know who arent like this are aware of the difference and how to treat them and can have sane interactions, but dismiss the importance of emotions entirely or only desire to be destructive with emotions.",

Gone to multiple geneticists, and a few IVF clinics, and they all say that IVF most likely was the cause (the original clinic I was \u201cconceived\u201d in has long since been shut down). I\u2019m sure that the process has been improved now, and they can actually screen for cancers before hand, but at this point when people tell me about them wanting to start doing IVF, I tell them my medical history and how much it has cost me personally over the years, and then point out that adoption is a much better option. Not only are you potentially helping a child who deserves a home and loving family, but you are saving yourself years of going through this, saving a lot of money, and not putting someone through what I have and am still going through. \n\nSeriously, please go adopt.

And by \u201cvalidate\u201d, I mean to see, hear, touch, smell, and even taste another human as they are, without judgement. Because of our egos, none of us can do that, so we lose our value when we develop an ego. So then, it\u2019s pretty easy to understand why people want to have children so badly. The baby they have will be the only human in their lives who will ever validate their existence and make them feel truly alive. It sounds fucked up, and it is fucked up. And what makes it even more fucked up is that when the baby attempts to validate their mother, she rejects them because she is so afraid of herself and of connection. In a sense, she is protecting the child from what she believes she is. She longs for that connection and validation, but once it comes, she is scared and she runs away. Kind of like a borderline. \n\nThis is all very metaphysical, and I have absolutely no evidence for what I\u2019m saying right now. So then the baby develops an ego, as a result of being rejected by their mother. In a perfect world(or one suited to humans and the way we evolved to live) nobody would have an ego, which means everyone could validate everyone. Babies would be conceived unintentionally, without the expectation of validating their mothers placed upon them before they are even born. There would be no boundaries or expectations of judgement and rejection. There would be no \u201cI\u201d and no \u201cyou\u201d. In your presence, I am alive. In my solitude, I am dead. There would be no yesterday, nor a tomorrow. We live together and we die together. My pain is your pain, and your joy is my joy. \n\nIn this world in which we exist, individuality is king, but it always has been and always will be an illusion of the ego, just as is everything else we believe. The ego cannot survive genuine human connection, which is why it does everything it can to prevent us from experiencing connection. Maybe right before we die, we can feel it. Once we have let get of the fear of being validated and seen for who we truly are. If I am about to die, I can no longer hurt you and you can no longer hurt me.",

I think the intractable avd immutable notion of morality presupposed by AN is arbitrary and, ironically, only emergent with the very existence that AN taken to it's logical conclusion would eradicate. There are logic systems - like 4-value - logic that are more applicable to real world application. The default binary logic upon which AN is predicated relies on the unnatural language of logic to address a much more dynamic and fluid real world. Abd please don't be disingenuous.

I seek out opportunities in life to contribute to a culture of creativity, courage, community, avs opportunity.

All-or-nothing thinking is a cognitive distortion that does more harm than good. It's protective by way of projection. Physician, heal thyself.

In fact, it is barely \u201cnatalist\u201d at all, all things considered. \n\n> People without a uterus have a vested interest in promoting the birth of children who can be adopted\n\nIs this your backhanded way of pinning natalism in the foster system on\u2026 gay men? Or women without a uterus / fertile sex cells? You think they (can) make sure the foster system is as much of a saturated market as it is? And not, you know, reproducing heterosexuals? \n\n> The child wouldn\u2019t have been born without restrictive policies by anti-choicers\n\nYou are right. The child should not have been born either way, but it is. I am working on the assumption that those children get born, whether we like it or not. They are in that foster care already, way too many of them compared to the families that are willing and ready to adopt. What other way do you have to get a net positive out of that situation?",

If you are genuinely interested in learning more, I can recommend literature outlining the net loss and gain of existence in a really well done and formulaic/mathmatical way, to demonstrate that nonexistence is always net-preferable.\n\nWhat scholars have you read or are familiar with, and what is your intellectual background with philosophy, to be able to interact with the nuance of the doctrine at such an expert level to say you single-handedly disprove it? Because it sounds like the majority of your arguments  and characterization of antinatalists comes from...lurking a subreddit?? \n\nYour asinine characterization of antinatalists also demonstrates a misunderstanding.

You are here trolling, yet you do not represent nor understand the philosophy, like many others, even those who claim to be AN. It's hardly a reliable source.

This article chronicles the story of CPS refusing to action against a clearly abusive mother because she was a white medical doctor. https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/04/mackenzie-fierceton-rhodes-scholarship-university-of-pennsylvania\n\n>They are in that foster care already, way too many of them compared to the families that are willing and ready to adopt.\n\nI don't remember you specifying that foster adoption of older or undesirable children is the only moral adoption.

I think of it as a logical utilitarian thought experiment rather than complaints about being born or being upset that parents have children, no matter the cause.\n\nSuffering is inherent in all creation. Living things must eventually die, and every action or inaction by a living thing goes towards the ultimate end of eventual 'death'. Hell, even \"non-living things\" like the fucking Sun eventually die. That is the nature of entropy, a law of the universe by which we all must live by.\n\nDue to this, as a utilitarian, we look to reduce the suffering as much as possible for the most people as possible. Like \"Increase pleasure for the most people and decrease suffering for the most people\" is a very basic utilitarian argument. That's where anti-natalism comes in.\n\nSince existence has the inherent attribute of suffering, which generally doesn't decrease (I am talking about inherent suffering, like getting old - not suffering like war, which can be decreased in some capacity), the utilitarian perspective would say that bringing forth existence into the world Non consensually (you can't ask your baby if they wish to be born while in the womb) is a concrete increase to the amount of suffering in the world. When a child is born, they have that inherent suffering of existence (the march towards death) that can never be reduced, and so, having a child is explicitly contrasting utilitarianism in this form.\n\nThe arguments against anti-natalism do not focus on this inherent suffering of existence - they focus on the suffering and pleasure that IS managed, like War or poverty and such. In that argument, more people/less people doesn't matter - in fact, you would typically want more people because with more people, society's capacity for pleasure increases (even though the capacity for suffering increases as well, in addition to the inherent suffering). The more people you have, the more opportunity society has to reduce the general suffering of people as well. Two heads better than one, and such.\n\nBoth arguments have their merits, but ultimately, the anti-natalism/pro-natalism arguments are just utilitarian on both sides, which isn't something that makes sense to complain about.",

Before that people had babies because they had sex which any other species does. Our literal entire human structure is geared towards procreation even if people don\u2019t want to admit it.

Nobody is entitled to wealth or a perfect life and rarely are people\u2019s lives void of suffering even when wealthy. To suggest that people should only have kids if they have wealth, you are suggesting that either people should not have sex until they are ready for a kid (which im not totally against) or that women should have to live their life on birth control (which for some women is catastrophic) or be willing to have an abortion (which many believe is murder) Children are apart of life just like death just like needing to eat and like sex.",

If the goal is to reduce suffering than more people is counter to the goal of reducing suffering since the more people = more suffering.\n\n Also your pain vs pleasure calculus is flawed. Pleasure has a much shallower upper limit than suffering does in terms of impact of experience. This is why torture victims can be broken in minutes or hours and it takes years of positive experiences to only maybe counter that to bring them back to where they were before. As Schopenhauer pointed out \"**compare the respective feelings of two animals, one of which is eating the other.**\" Their is no balancing out of pleasure and pain unless your one of the fortunate few to whom suffering is rare and minor.",

Hope is what can motivate someone to take the biggest gamble in their life, procreation. \n\nI think the least one can do if they make the life altering decision to introduce new members of society is to assess their financial stability and mental acumen.

I doubt so much people are self aware, much less comprehend this notion unless they're in this sub, or they have taken a theology course and studied the concept of free will.

Elon Musk demands more wage slaves and I feel the people doing the bidding of the corporate overlords are the sick ones. You know you are bringing innocent children here to work most of their lives for a smaller piece of the collective pie. Forcing them to play a sadistic version of musical chairs until they die. \n\nI don't know if you are from America. But here, you can get sick or injured, and all the hard work you have put in won't save you. You are no longer a productive worker bee, and your life now has no value to society. Now you're just a mooch. A broken person without access to reliable Healthcare. *I don't feel this way. This is terrible, but this is the society we live in.*\n\nI'm a conditional antinatalist. I'm not against people having children if we had a fair, equitable society where anyone can succeed. But that's not what we have. The top 1% holds about 30% of the total wealth. The bottom 50% get to fight over about 2.6% of the total wealth. \n\nIf you want to start a family with a partner you love, you can adopt. Someone has already forced the innocent child to play our sick game. Damage already done. If you want to bring an innocent child here on purpose, you should seek psychological help. \n\nPs. Climate change. Are you not paying attention? The earth is begging us to stop bringing more people here.",
