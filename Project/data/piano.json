My mom picked it up to see what it was, and she ended up snooping around, finding a photo album on my phone named \u201caaaaaaaa,\u201d filled with pictures of men. She immediately understood what it meant.\n\nMy parents are very homophobic and religious, they believe being gay is a sin. As I feared, they didn\u2019t accept me at all. My dad beat me with a belt, and although my mom tried to stop him, she was also screaming at me.\n\nToday, they told me they will look into conversion therapy for me (I have no say in this) and that I\u2019m not allowed to play the piano anymore. They\u2019ve already taken the power cable for my piano, and I\u2019m completely devastated. I\u2019ve been taking piano lessons for nearly two years and absolutely love everything about it. My teacher is amazing, and I really enjoy the classes. I\u2019m very dedicated and don\u2019t want to stop playing.\n\nCan I do anything to keep learning piano, even without access to one? Are there ways to train my ear or sense of rhythm independently? What would you suggest I do in this situation?",

This is a lot to handle at 15, but if it\u2019s even possible that some night in the not so distant future your parents will pay people to come to your home and kidnap you, take you to a \u201ccamp\u201d where you are abused, harassed, tortured, and hurt, you need to avoid that at all costs.\n\nIf your piano teacher is your closest adult in your life besides your parents and you trust them, talk to them about it. If not them, some other adult who you think will take action on this or at least help guide you to taking action yourself. You can lead the conversation with \u201cthey won\u2019t let me play piano anymore\u201d but please talk to someone about the abuse and threat of more abuse.\n\nIf you are in need, The Trevor Project is a great resource and can at the very least be a listening ear to what you have to say and help you process your thoughts out loud. They aren\u2019t only for suicide prevention, but also for crisis intervention. They are available 24/7 via phone call, chat, or text: https://www.thetrevorproject.org/get-help/\n\nThis is a crisis. You are in immediate danger if you stay home. \n\nAt a minimum, get away from home for a few days to allow things to cool and settle, and maybe your parents will be willing to talk about why you felt the need to leave. They won\u2019t suddenly change their mind, but something needs to be done to show them that THEY are the sinners here for beating and threatening their child. Pack a bag and see if there\u2019s a friend or relative you can stay with for even one night.\n\nIf you need to talk to someone, my DM\u2019s are open.\n\nStay safe. Love yourself.\n\nEdited to add: DO NOT let them take your phone. They may try to since that\u2019s what started it all, but your phone might be your only literal lifeline at this point. If things get worse (in my opinion it\u2019s already at that point) you need a way to communicate with others and get help.",

There are websites and apps that will give you a metronome, or in a pinch, you can at least use a ticking clock to give you a choice of 60 bpm (one beat per second) or 120 bpm (two beats per second.) You can practice different rhythms very precisely, such as learning to tap triplets with your right hand while playing eighth notes with your left hand.  You can also practice unusual/tricky rhythms such as syncopation, preferably with a metronome and gradually working up speed.  \n\nYou can also learn some music theory.  Are you familiar with the circle of fifths?  It allows you to figure out how many sharps and flats are in each key, and majors and minors in each.  You can draw a music staff and practice writing I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, and vii* chords in each key, for instance.  This will improve your playing later when you have access to piano again.  Same thing with learning about chord progressions, minor melodic vs minor harmonic scales, and so on.  You may be able to get a music theory book from the library.  \n\nOn a personal note.  As a gay woman who was effectively kicked out of the house for coming out as gay at the end of college\u2026\u2026 given your age, your location (tough situation) and your parents\u2019 reaction, I would begin \u201cplaying straight\u201d ASAP.  Your time will come, you\u2019ll get out, but if you can persuade them you\u2019ve changed your mind for now\u2026.. I\u2019m just not sure you have many other options where you are, though perhaps someone more familiar with OK law can advise.  You may want to check the r/legaladvice.",

                    "body": "I also had my main instrument taken away from me when I was a teenager and lived with my Christian mum, though I was bad in other ways and was being abused in other ways. Music was my one safe place, the one arena where I wasn\u2019t bullied, the thing I truly excelled at and the one and only source of joy and thing that gave me some sort of a future outlook. I totally get that despite being physically and spiritually and psychologically abused, you focus on how to still play the piano. \n\nA year after I had moved to my dad, my stepmother was quite vocal about how hard it was for her to live with the noise and the space I took up in my playing. I had also started learning the piano as a compulsory part of a programme I was doing. My stepmother refused to have a piano in the flat despite there being more than enough space, and money wasn\u2019t an issue. I got myself a keyboard for my own money. Only later did I realise she was abusive in many other ways. \n\nMy piano teacher, the second one I had as I got a new one after year one, noticed one day I was a mess and hadn\u2019t practised at all. I rarely did manage to practise much, but this time was different. I had been up all night crying. He realised there was no point in note bashing, and we talked instead. He only made a short and dry comment about how my home environment couldn\u2019t be safe, saying that nobody looks that beaten without a reason. He never got even a hint of annoyed with me for not having practised since because he knew why. It meant the world to me that one adult saw that and did not punish me for the consequences. \n\nBut even before this, we always spent time analysing the music, like chords and chord progressions. From that watershed moment, this  became the starting point for the lessons; what is this music all about, what is the composer really doing here and let\u2019s see how we can play it on the piano. I made astonishing progress. \n\nMy advice to you when it comes to the piano is to keep your love for music and for the instrument alive by other means, don\u2019t make it dependent on your abusive parents. Do everything that lifts your spirit, whether listen to music, read scores, watch masterclasses on YouTube etc., practise at friends\u2019 or a church (!) if that\u2019s a possibility, just know it\u2019s not lost. \n\nWhat your parents are doing is cruel beyond words on so many levels. Love is the elixir of life, as is music. In music and in love we express who we truly are. And that is exactly why your parents take the piano away from you, to remove the opportunity for you to express a personality they feel threatened by. \n\nRemember that this is also the core of music: Composers and performers tell stories of their own life struggles through music, stories of desperation, frustration and disconnection, but also of the wonderfully relieving harmony and beauty in nature and the universe, and of the deep understanding and love and loyalty that are the essence of the human experience. You will always have music. One day, what you are going through now may well even become fuel to your music-making. \n\nShow your piano teacher this if it helps. My DM is also open.",

Doing ear training and learning to identify chord cadences will help you so much later.\n\nLast year, I successfully helped a 19-year-old nonbinary person escape a similar situation in Texas despite the fact that I live several states away, so I have some experience with this. \n\nDo everything you can to get out. Hoard money somewhere they won't find it. Cash, yes, but also one of those prepaid debit cards from the grocery store (Green Dot or whatnot) that has a Visa logo on it. You can use it to buy things that require a card, like Uber or train tickets or things online.\n\nPack a backpack with a set of clothing, a phone charger cable, your meds, anything else you might need if you need to walk out in the middle of the night or something, and have it available. \n\nHaving a phone that they don't have access to is essential - they can trace the location of your phone. Even if you have location turned off, many cellular providers have parental control software they can install remotely that will track your location. (source: I was a customer service rep for the largest mobile phone service provider in the nation)\n\nOne of the things you need to do is get a photo ID as soon as you're able. Even a driver's permit counts. If you have a passport, that's the best. If you don't know your Social Security number, get it.\n\nDO NOT ASSUME YOUR COMMUNICATION DEVICES ARE SECURE. None of them. When I helped that nonbinary person get out, they swore up and down their parents would never look at their laptop. Well, their parents looked at their laptop and got the tracking number for the UPS package I sent to one of their friends that had a phone on my own cell phone plan in it. Then their parents took the package from the friend. \n\nUltimately, helping them get out was too much of a sacrifice of my mental health for me to do it again or even talk about it. \n\nThere are LGBTQ teens in Mormon families who end up in a lot of similar situations. People in r/exmormon will be happy to give you advice on how to get out even though you're not from a Mormon family as far as I can tell. We've seen this situation a lot before.",

Not if they're going to punish u for something that \"their God has created in his image.\" So according to their own text, u are who u are thanks to God anyway. And are a reflection of him. None of it makes any sense! It only makes sense when they pick a side that works for their current argument. The whole book is full of contradictions. It's always open to interpretation, or it wouldn't make any sense at all. \n\nDo yourself a favour and leave that house and the religion (which doesn't accept u for who u are anyway), and go live a happy, love filled life. U are certainly not going to get that with ur parents at home.\n\nI have a couple of gay cousins, and one of them, a girl, recently got married. Her own mother was bitching the whole time. My grandparents (and many more) decided not to go due to religious reasons. I turned my back on any of them that didn't want to support their family member on her very special day. Screw those ignorant people. I'd rather they not be an influence in my life or my kids' lives. There may not be a right or wrong, but i know what I want to accept in my life and what I don't. I don't see sexuality as anyone's business but the people having consensual sex. Every time I've heard a male friend of mine gay bash soneone, I've always asked them this question: \"Why do u care so much about what makes another man's dick hard?\". That normally shuts them up. Everyone is so hell-bent on proving they're straight that it means they have to show the world how much they hate everything about being gay. Like, c'mon, man... how insecure are u???

However, it might deepen the rift and cause more unwanted drama and division in your family.\n\nAll I can say is best of luck and I hope things get better for you.

Act like the straight kid they want but don\u2019t lose yourself.. and make plans now for how you\u2019re going to leave when you finish school / turn 18.\n\nAs much as you love your parents, you need to get out asap because they\u2019re abusive (even though that\u2019s really hard to accept). \n\nAnd there is some other great advice on here for how to continue your interest in piano without actually playing. Hopefully that part doesn\u2019t stick and they\u2019ll let you continue lessons.\n\nStay safe friend, and reach out to the resources others have linked to.. you can get through this \ud83d\udc9c",

                    "body": "I wouldn't say it's difficult to achieve, you just tune each key to its nominal equal temperament frequency with an electronic tuner. Agreed that it would sound awful though.\n\nA string that is perfectly flexible has overtones that are exact multiples of its fundamental frequency. If an ideal vibrating string has a fundamental frequency of 440Hz, its first overtone vibrates at exactly 880Hz, its second at 1760Hz, and so on.\n\nPiano strings behave very closely to ideal strings, but because they're made of metal that isn't perfectly flexible, the overtones aren't exact multiples of the fundamental frequency.\n\nIn practice, that means that the first overtone of A440 isn't 880Hz, it's 881Hz or something slightly above the fundamental frequency, and the second overtone is something like 1764Hz. The exact frequency deviation from nominal is highly dependent on a given piano's scale design and quirks.\n\nThis phenomenon is commonly called *inharmonicity.* If you were to tune each key on a piano to its exact nominal frequency, it would sound awful because none of the overtones would align. They are *inharmonic*.\n\nIf you tuned A4 to 440Hz and A5 to 880Hz exactly and then played those two keys together you would hear a slight beating as the first overtone of A440 is slightly higher than 880Hz, but A5 is tuned to *exactly* 880Hz.\n\nTo deal with this reality, piano tuners \"stretch\" the notes. They tune the treble side slightly higher than nominal and the bass side slightly lower in order to better align the overtones. In the example above, the tuner would likely tune A5 to match the first overtone of A4 as closely as possible. The [Railsback curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_acoustics#/media/File:Railsback2.png) illustrates this.\n\nTuning is an art because each key on the piano has many overtones that align with the fundamental frequency of the notes above it, but you can't align all of them perfectly because of inharmonicity. The best you can do is find a frequency that aligns with the most prominent sounding overtones above the key you're working on. It's a balancing act.\n\nLower inharmonicity is one of the main reasons that a tall upright piano sounds better than a console piano, and a nine foot concert grand piano sounds so much better than a five foot parlor grand. Longer strings have more room to flex and behave closer to ideal strings, and thus have less inharmonicity. Tuners can achieve a better alignment of the overtones, resulting in a more harmonic sound.",

The development of temperaments across that period was concerned with a couple of main things and one of them being spreading the comma out so that interval you reduce the harshness of that interval and use more key signatures (and their chords). \n\nWe\u2019ve got equal temperament now for almost everything but take a look at temperaments like 1/4 comma mean tone, Werckmeister III, Valotti. It\u2019s a total can of worms hidden down a rabbit hole and I find it super interesting.\n\nEdit: I was wrong, the diabolus in musica is another name for a tritone! https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone\n\nEvery day is a school day.",

The transitions between themes were really nice actually - none of them felt jarring at all. The dynamics - there could be slightly more variation, but it\u2019s probably just the recording.

                    "body": "Hi! Okay, I will start with criticism because that's easier that first typing out all the things you did well haha \nYou are far better at the piano than myself so I'll ignore technicality and focus on the things that are pretty much universal in music and can be translated to and from other instruments (my main instrument is the violin ^^ Also please excuse my poor language, I'm not fluent in English music jargon sadly)\n\nI personally found the two accents at the end of each main theme run (the one from the very beginning) to be a bit too much and sudden, almost gave me a heart attack the first time haha. To play a little crescendo could help and try to not let them jump out too much.\n\nConnected to that, remember that while playing your heart out is fantastic but give the audience some leeway to relax and don't make everything super exciting, it gets a bit tedious to listen to if there is constant action.\n\nWhat I mean is don't just play loud and epic in the main theme parts with all the runs and whatnot and play quiet and intimate in the more calmer parts but to not play every run and especially every accent like it's the most important one of the entire piece. Choose certain spots that you want to highlight and give it everything you got there but choose them wisely and scarcely. For the rest, try to keep your horses contained so that the spots you really want to shine can shine amongst other similar parts.\n\nAbove all is the ever difficult topic of the musical direction or how I call it the bow. It's one whole piece and everything should be connected, I sometimes felt a disconnection between parts.  The different themes sometimes seemed like blocks next to each other, try to connect and transition them so it's a smooth and rounded out experience (but this might be what you yourself meant with having to work on transitions). Try to, at all times, play either towards a specific spot or calm down from a specific spot, always have this goal in mind and you will automatically create tension!\n\nAbout the things you did well there are too many to name, the ones I found especially well done were your more quiet piano/pianissimo parts, so emotional and beautifully played, your trillers were really clean, the runs were pretty smooth and I just love how much you felt the piece.\n\nI played the first movement a couple of years ago, moonlight sonata certainly is a beautiful piece and you played it really well, nice job man!\n\nHope i was able to at least kind of explain what I mean ^^",

I recently played through some pieces of piano music that I, only a few years ago, thought I would never be able to master. Piano is my second instrument after voice (Tenor here), but I take it just as serious as voice... maybe even more serious since I'm not in school taking applied lessons and doing this all on my own... although piano and voice are two complety different monsters, they are still both monsters; they just function in their own unique capacities...\n...anyway...\nI've come across some pieces, even the more recently, that have completely rendered me dumbfounded at times.lol I really have to work at technique, finding technique (becuase i am mostly self-taught), and unlearning all of the bad habits that I picked up only because they worked for me when I really needed results.lol Technique and research have become my best friend for some pieces, but you just don't know what you don't know. Sometimes technique falls in my lap. Other times, technique strikes me like lightning and I feel stupid for not realizing it sooner... sometimes technique just eludes me altogether.lol\nThe funny thing is that piano is constabtly reinforcing some of the lessons I've come to appreciate as an adult: accept change; don't give up, just keep trying; when a door closes, a window opens; be consistent, etc...\nDidn't mean to text-wall you, but it invigorates me to see others succeeding and progressing! I am by no means a virtuoso, but I know that if high school me knew what I would be capable of on keyboard in the future, I might have focused up even more!lol\nKeep up the great work! Work hard, but have fun, and enjoy it\u2014 it is music!",

It's certainly important to progress in all areas but winning often takes the \"best\" version of yourself as an artist. \n\nFor this specific contest I actually chose more pieces that were shorter rather than two longer ones because I wanted to demonstrate a lot of contrast. However giving a judge a really interesting program is only useful if accompanied by an effective performance. Even though I felt comfortable with Bach, I chose it mostly so that I could lead into something really jarringly contemporary and then immediately into something incredibly serene (Ravel). \n\nAlso know your energy limit and how to program in breaks! I played a lot of technical stuff but was strategic in placing pieces where I could relax.",

Your technique is difficult to assess when viewing you from the back with grainy video. \n\nIf you\u2019ve really only been playing for eight months and that\u2019s you, then you\u2019re probably autistic at which point I would say, forget what anyone says and just play whatever you want however you want it, as long you\u2019re enjoying yourself. \n\nIf you\u2019re lying because you feel lonely and want to make others feel inadequate and have actually been playing much longer, then you should first tell yourself \u201chey, self, I\u2019m better than that\u201d and then go find a pianist on YouTube you want to play like, take better footage of your playing, slow down your execution so that they can examine your fingering, and also show a variety of material. You can play piano very well, so that\u2019s settled. But for example, I\u2019d like to hear you create a slow tempo arrangement of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star focusing not on arpeggios but on gentle, explorative chord theory. \n\nRegardless, good job on being able to play well! I do mean that.",

I agree that your wrists are up well and you have good finger/hand posture (gently curved).\n\nI'm just a hobbyist, but two small things to try:\n\nOne - generally, if you're repeating a note, you're supposed to hit it with a different finger - this gives you time to reposition and it helps keep the timing in check. For this song, it might not matter as much because of the mostyly narrow range and high rate of repeated notes.\n\nTwo - your playing is stiff (this is good for learning and avoiding mistakes). As you practice this song, try 'rolling' your   hand to smooth out certain parts, particularly runs. This will make the song sound more fluid when you play for your friends and family.",

I can\u2019t remember anything specific being said, but I also know my dad thought concerts were boring. Eventually, going to Kiwanis for adjudication, I would just go myself and no one from my family would be there. Now (at 36 years old) I am just learning piano for the first time and when my sister came over I forced her to listen to me play a terribly executed version of \u201cOh Come All Ye Fairhful\u201d and she plugged her ears and made a big scene. It\u2019s really more of a joke now.\n\nI never recall feeling hurt by any of this, because I didn\u2019t play music for them. I played for myself, and there were enough teachers, conductors, other people who played instruments, adjudicators, accompanists involved (as in\u2026 people who actually know things) who validated that I was making progress. The reality is that practicing (most of the playing we do) isn\u2019t usually very nice to listen to. And people who don\u2019t play an instrument honestly usually can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s good or bad playing because they don\u2019t know anything, haha. \n\nThere is a reason they make digital pianos with headphones now.",

It's different than sitting down and actually listening to someone perform. I think if you wanted to play around on a piano, a family gathering/party where people are trying to talk to each other isn't really the right place or time. Sometimes at parties people invite someone who they know can play for an impromptu performance, but it doesn't sound like that's what happened here. I don't think they really cared about your technique or even listened to it, they were just expressing that what you were doing was disruptive and annoying, and they did it in a really rude way.",

Celebrate your own milestones and successes.\n\nLiving with someone who is learning an instrument can be challenging, especially if you have no clue about the difficulty of the task and you only think of yourself. If you can, try to have compassion for their ignorance and pettiness. Understand that is coming from them and only reflects badly on who they are.\n\nNot everyone is going to enjoy listening to you play no matter how good you get.

It's surprisingly easy to impress non-musicians with a few arpeggios or runs. Really only needs to be a few seconds. Get everyones attention so they categorize you as an expert (consciously or subconsciously). And once that's happened, you can stop and do whatever you want. Even if it's really unimpressive, they'll just assume that's some kind of special genius-musician magic.",

In this situation, you see a piano and naturally want to have a go on it. But in doing so, you are bringing the attention to you. No one asked you to play anything, and so a couple people might be interested to see/hear what you are doing, but most people will find it annoying. If you are playing impressively, you might turn a few more heads positively, but overall, you\u2019ll still be a noisy disruption to everyone\u2019s conversations. And even then, performing well in this situation will often be viewed by most as showing off, and of course, some of that will come from jealousy. If just tinkering around, you\u2019re a disruption that\u2019s not worthy of everyone\u2019s attention, and viewed as bad.\n\nUnfortunately, it does tend to be the way that, when people ask you to play, they know you play and there\u2019s a piano, and they nagging you to perform, those are the times for it, and usually those are the times you aren\u2019t feeling it, and then have nerves about performing. Sucks but this is how it is.\n\nIn short, experience over time will help you know when it\u2019s a good time to play around people and when not to. The comments about you being bad can be ignored, they are just annoyed you are disrupting the party.",

Now, that piece is not hard relatively to other pieces, but anyone who's played piano for enough years knows that for many students that piece represents a new challenge because it will probably be the first piece that tackles polyrythms that they have to learn, so for them, that piece won't be easy at all.  Someone who plays an instrument also knows that music sheets can be deceptive in general. \n\nThis is just an anecdote to say that people who don't play piano or have experience with playing instruments will be ignorant on the matter or lack in imagination. Being ignorant is not bad, but it is bad not to take a step back and consider you might be too ignorant to judge. A person who has experience with learning an instrument would've been able to understand that you shouldn't give a definitive evaluation on someone's playing based on how they're messing around the piano, especially if you took a break for some time (kind of like when you don't speak a language for long and you'll end up rusty, but you could pick up faster if you started learning again in comparison to someone who is learning from scratch). Ofc it depends on what you want to learn, but if you study classical music, you might be really good at reading sheet music while also sucking at improvising. Basically, don't mind them, their comment genuinely sounds like it stems from ignorance",

But thats a very non musical way of being. and they usually suffer from the fact that music isnt fun for them anymore and they dont know why. its a tradgedy for them, and you dont have to take it on. music is just fun. \n\nBeing a good musician means being someone with an open creative mindset. \"good\" and \"bad\" dont really exist for truly creative people. things are different. people like different things. its all a question of style. and acceptance and encouragement of self expression.\n\nsome people have spent more time being open to different methodoligies and have read different books and have pracrticed in different ways that maybe does reflect in their overall sense of musical culture......and when they play you might appreciate those things, but its not because, they are \"better\"\n\npeople want it to somehow be about them and their ego, they somehow want music to validate them as people......but thats not real. \n\nthe lack of structure  makes people feel insecure. they want there to be a box for them to judge themselves by. so they tell themselves they are \"good\" and that others are \"bad\" to highlight their own \"goodness\". and people like that are hard to collaborate with becuase its not a creative and fun experience. i prefer a musician who is easy to work with and less virtuoso, becuase they are better at being a musician in other ways.\n\nmusic is just fun. thats it. sorry the music industry has given so many people the idea that participating in music could mean anything else. People like to talk about the intellectual intricacies and complicated pieces of music theory in a way that helps them validate a feeling that they are special......but really music is special because how unintellectual it is.....it just feels good. even the simplest stuff. \n\nexplore your own style and enjoy how enriching it is to participate in music. how good it feels.\n\ni dont know what complex or simple is, i just know when something sounds good to me.\n\nits almost a cliche at this point to hear musicians giving their pedantic opinion and commentary about what is good and bad and what is truly impressive and isnt. its a contradiction of the openness and fun that is inherent in music.\n\nmusic is like a delicious meal, you know that its good, not because you are so special and smart, but because when we like something, its undeniable. a warm bowl of delcious soup.....is just good. doesnt take anyone special to appreciate the things they like.  children who dont know anything about music can be just as sensitive as an adult whose studied music his whole life. THIS is what makes music special to humans.\n\nso.....whenever the same old boring conversation grounded in musical critique starts, i usually check out.  better to focus that attention on enjoying yourself in what it means to grow your own self expression either as a solo artist or with others",

While playable, it doesn't fit well under the hand and there are better ways to accomplish many of the things you're trying to do, pianistically. The effect, on playback software, is nice. But it could be written better for humans.\n\nThere are also multiple notation issues: Mixing sharps and flats is perfectly fine, but not in this case. These chord spellings make no sense. Composer does not seem to understand basic music theory/orthography. And carefully consider use of ledger lines vs cross staffing and/or use of 8va markers. \n\nIs this written Musescore? Some of the rhythmic notation errors look like Musescore, so I'm assuming. (Also worth notating rhythms correctly.)\n\nAs a first piano composition, this is a good place to start. But there's a tremendous amount of runway for growth here. \n\nThis is not meant as gatekeeping, but that would be my legitimate reaction on seeing this on the music desk.

I might have to revisit those to see how good they were...\n\nI think I have a good ear for what I want something to sound like and understand the capabilities of the piano but this little journey has really inspired me to want to get more formal training in true composition.

I like to think of myself as a flexible teacher who meets students where they are.\n\nI really wanted thing to work with this student, the way I do with all my students. But God, I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nMy student is 11 years old. She constantly complains things are too hard and refuses to do them. This part I can handle but it\u2019s in addition to impoliteness.\n\nShe constantly comments on my \u201cmessy\u201d handwriting, tries to override my 25 years of music education asking how I know things or making obvious comments on music as if I don\u2019t know them, asks me to play her the hardest songs I know. She gets angry and defensive if I tell her she played the wrong notes, she  won\u2019t play it again because she \u201cplayed everything right, you\u2019re wrong\u201d. She challenges me on pretty much everything.\n\nMy mum thinks I should quit, my mum was a piano teacher for 40 years and has told me she can count on 1 hand how many students she\u2019s had like this one.\n\nI also have to go to this students home and it\u2019s super difficult to commute to, it\u2019s not near any major station.\n\nWhat do you all think? Think my mum is right?\n\nUpdate: Thanks for all the different comments and insight! Tons of great differing opinions. Happy to say I got a second opinion from one of my old music teachers, she gave me some great advice and I\u2019ll share it here with you. I should have mentioned before that I\u2019d already spoken to my students parents but that didn\u2019t help. The parents had also sat in on a lesson.\n\nAs a last go, my teacher told me to directly ask her \u201cdo you actually want to keep learning piano right now? it\u2019s okay to take breaks\u201d. \n\nThe idea was with this question to let her choose. If she said \u201cNo\u201d then I\u2019d say \u201cokay, no worries, take a break from piano and you can set up lessons if you ever want to come back\u201d. If she said \u201cYes\u201d, then I\u2019d say \u201cokay, but if we\u2019re going to continue here things need to change and we need to show eachother mutual respect and we need to set some ground rules for our lessons\u201d.If her answer was inbetween then I\u2019d recommend her to take a break too.\n\nSurprise! She chose \u201cYes\u201d and agreed to the new ground rules! Then we had probably the best lesson we\u2019ve had since she started and it was great to see her genuinely happy at the end. Felt like we made a huge breakthrough.\n\nMay not work for all students like this but I thought it was a great idea from my old teacher and worth a shot! Turns out my old teacher is still teaching me \ud83e\ude77",

That's a bit of an exaggeration but it was really tough teaching private lessons when most of your students would rather just tell you that you're wrong and no matter what you do you can't seem to get them to focus longer than 2 seconds.\n\nI tried so many tactics to get kids to focus.  Some of them just couldn't process words very well it seemed.  I had a number of students that couldn't remember simple things for very long.  I'm not even talking about memorizing pieces.  They would look at a passage that had three notes in it, lets say F# G F#. I would ask them what the first note is.  IF they were able to work it out without help it would take them 10-15 seconds to say \"F\".  I would then have to remind them that key signatures exist.  And again, they would ponder what I might mean by that for 10-15 seconds before either just looking confused and shrugging or then saying a completely different note name because I was implying that \"F\" was incorrect.\n\nThis was after working with these students on scales, working out of books to help them learn the staff better, playing exercises that would familiarize them with the instrument, etc.  A lot of kids were just unable to think it seemed. Hell, I even wrote out a lot of video game music and other popular songs into duets that we could play together because it's either going to be familiar sounding to them or just more fun than playing Lightly Row.\n\nAfter all this there were just a number kids that couldn't be told what to do or just can't process instruction well.  Teaching was enlightening.",

Don't take her hand writing comment personally, it could be out of curiosity in a slightly twisted way, her trying to get a reaction from you because of issues at home and maybe a lack of attention, all sorts of things...so you could make your lessons a place where she could feel good. Obviously a piano lesson is a piano lesson but if you just spend time understanding her more and seeing her as a vulnerable young, emotional human being who needs help, you both would feel a lot better.\n\n Piano lessons doesn't just mean to sit down and play piano for 30 min, you need to make a connection with your student and make them enjoy piano, it could be you showing them some music you like or talking about their week. The end justifies the mean so it doesn't matter how you conduct your lessons, as long as she enjoys the piano and has a positive experience you've done your job. I've had students that had pretty bad weeks and are not efficient in the lessons, I've learnt to just go along with it and try to make it less stressful and it will stay with them longer.",

Sadly, you can be sure her personality formed in response to parental misattunement.  \n\nAt best, her parents are well meaning but completely emotionally stunted, and are probably themselves quite shame-based.  There\u2019s a good chance if you drop her and tell them it\u2019s because of her behaviors, they will shame and criticize her for it, rather than get curious about how they\u2019re (not) attuning to their daughter.  Point being, as much of a pain in the butt as she is, there is a context for how she is, and she deserves some compassion.  That said, one needs to have boundaries to have compassion, so dropping her as a student may be the right boundary for you.  It sounds like you already feel that way.\n\nShe\u2019s not your daughter at the end of the day, and it\u2019s extremely trying to have a student like that, so I could totally see doing that.  My main point was just to put in perspective that she is still a child, she\u2019s not on a good track in life.  \n\nIf you keep her as a student, piano lessons are just an avenue for her to develop some sense of safety and self love- in other words piano lessons as informal play therapy.  For example, when she criticizes your handwriting, you can tell her how that makes you feel.  Then just sit with her for a moment.  Children will push our buttons to get us to feel what they feel, when they don\u2019t know how else to say it, or are not even conscious of how they feel.  Even you just modeling healthy behavior and boundaries will help her.  Again though, that\u2019s a lot of work beyond normal piano instruction, so the healthy boundary for you may just be to send her packing.",

You don't owe them anything.\n\nIf you decide to stick out, it sounds to me like she's really insecure. She doesn't want to make mistakes in front of you, and she wants you to make mistakes to help herself feel better. \n\nA couple things that could help: \n\n-Precede constructive criticism with a compliment. For example, \"You played that passage with beautiful dynamics, but I think a couple of the trickier notes were mixed up. Lets just go over it one more time to make sure you've got it.\"\n\n-Make mistakes yourself and acknowledge them in a light hearted way.\n\n-Acknowledge her comments, but indirectly call her out with followup questions. For example, after a complaint you could say, \"challenge is good, but we definitely don't want to do something that's too hard. Can you point out which part you think looks too hard, and we can try to break it down?\" \n\n-Give her power and choice whenever possible. \"Do you want to do A or B next?\" Play her several songs and let her choose which she wants to learn next, etc \n\n-When my son is not into his lesson or is having a bad day, his teacher plays a game where he gets to control the beat on an elaborate metronome app and she has to improv to whatever insanity he comes up with. They both end up laughing hysterically.  That specific game isn't probably what you want to do, but there might be an activity that will help reset the vibe and end the power struggle for a bit.  \n\n-Be honest. \"It doesn't seem like you want to be here, or like you want to learn piano. Is there something I can do differently, or would you like me to talk to your mom about maybe pursuing a different activity?\"\n\n-Last hail Mary, talk to the parent. \"Your daughter is very argumentative and doesn't listen, so I'm not able to teach her effectively. Do you think this is something that can improve, because if not I don't think it's a good use of your money.\" There's a good choice that this will just result in the parent defensively quitting, or yelling at her kid, which could make the kid resent you. That's why I would advise talking to the kid first.",

One thing I have found as a teacher (not piano) is that most kids just want to be liked; when they behave like this, it's a defense mechanism - \"I'm going to be unlikable and pretend I don't care if someone likes me so that it won't hurt as much when they don't like me.\"   Same goes for trying and succeeding or failing - \"If I don't try I won't really have failed.\"\n\nThat said, I agree that it's not up to you to be this kid's rescuer or anything.

I would likely say explain myself to the parent, say good luck and send them on their way.\n\nAlso usually, when teaching younger (5-13yrs) students I find it is essential to engage the parents anyway (Every week try to talk to them about the student's progress, any behavior problems, good progress points as well, practice tips, etc.) so it is usually not a surprise to the family if there are problems brewing.\n\n\\*Edit added final comment",

After every lesson, briefly tell the parents how the student did.\n\nOne reason for doing this is that it might create more of a path to possible success because the parents can know whether whatever they're trying is working so they can make adjustments. And if the kid does improve (even if in just one area), that feedback can serve as encouragement that can improve the odds.\n\nThe other reason is, if it doesn't work out in the end, then the parents will have had negative feedback multiple times in a row. They'll have a chance to prepare themselves for the bad news. And there's less chance they will be on totally a different page and go \"What?!?!

I wish more teachers would put their students ahead of their own feelings and comfort. I am also a music teacher btw and I have taken both approaches. I can't tell you the impact it has had on both my teaching, my standing amongst my students and to some extent my reputation among their parents. They know I believe in them and their potential, whatever it may be, and that I embrace my role to SERVE as their teacher. I'm not the best music teacher, I have some holes in my own learning. But my students know I truly have their best interests at heart, and it has made a huge difference in the way they approach lessons. Theyre more trusting, less argumentative, more curious and most crucially they feel free to express themselves. Which after all is the goal of music making. \n\nJust my two cents and how I see the world. I wish more music geavhers were not so cynical. Look at the downvotes on my initial comment.

I do agree that the majority of people don\u2019t care but there will still be some who do.  \n\nI will agree with OPs observation that no one will have the same relationship with the music that you do, but I would not say that no one is interested.  They will glean what they want out of the performance and have their own relationship with it, which then becomes a beautiful thing on its own.\n\nAlso, drunk people love the piano.  So there\u2019s that!",

All my siblings and I played musical instruments. We all took lessons from 6 to 18 years old. Played in orchestras. Sang in choir. My parents took us to classical concerts.\n\nThen adulthood hit. All of my family moved to a tiny town in a western state in bumf*ck nowhere. All my classical music friends from adolescence and college grew up, got jobs, and left the state. Music to them is just something they left behind.\n\nNone of my childhood friends plays or sings anymore. My siblings haven\u2019t touched their instruments in a decade.\n\nI still play the piano. Every day. It\u2019s still my passion.\n\nWhenever I mention it as one of my interests (I certainly do not mention it unless it seems remotely appropriate, which is exceedingly rare), most people around just find it weird or think I\u2019m pretentious. Most people would rather talk about Drake\u2019s feud with Kendrick Lamar than listen to Stravinsky or watch a piano concert. And I know even saying that sounds pretentious but it\u2019s not. Kendrick Lamar is really good. I\u2019m not pretentious, I just have interests that seem to isolate me. I\u2019ve learned to keep that entire part of my life hidden from the world.\n\nI often feel like it doesn\u2019t matter anymore, that I too should just grow up and do adult things like my coworkers and other dudes around me: get excited about country music, drive a big truck, drink whiskey and listen to Garth Brooks. I\u2019ve learned to keep it quite off the radar that I my main pastime outside of work is playing the piano/composing (the fact it\u2019s so hard to make it in the music world is for another time).\n\nSometimes I\u2019ll go solo or take my partner to a concert, but she\u2019s not half as engaged as I am.\n\nThe circle has grown so small. It\u2019s like that whole part of my life just went POOF, and with a snap of the fingers, disappeared.\n\nJust want to know if anyone can relate.",

I got a ton of friends, I had free tickets to all concerts, I got to meet, sit by the fire with some of my biggest idols, I got to hear some of the best classical performances of my life. Like Smetana's Piano Trio in G-minor op 15. Listen to the finale and you can imagine the intensity in a live situation. \n\nThe festival spirit is often unparallelled, no matter what the festival is about.

Community symphonies or orchestras? Can you volunteer your piano talents or take a part time job at a local church that needs a pianist? I know organ isn\u2019t the same, but some places need organists too, and there are even fewer organists available than pianists. Often in these religious settings, you play SATB hymns, but have the opportunity for beautiful prelude, postlude, and solo pieces. Sometimes, you can even come in as a guest performer. Choir groups need pianists, ballet companies need pianists, and any time there\u2019s a collaborative concert with performers from multiple organizations, there could be a performance opportunity for you. If there are any performance or music organizations with a board around you, you can likely become involved with those too. Just reach out and ask if they have any opportunities for someone who is classically trained in piano, and you might be surprised!",

When you're young there are a whole lot of interesting areas, music, literature, art, that are presented to you and all your siblings/friends as important, and not only in a vocational sense.  They are presented as \"higher things\". However, once you're out of school, everybody's nose is to the grindstone (particularly if they have families to support) so there's little time for these things as avocations.  On the other hand, for people who pursue them as a vocation (professional musicians, academics, etc.) they become to an extent just another job and lose their magic that way.  \n\nParadoxically, one way people re-experience this magic is to have kids themselves (despite the \"grindstone\" effect).  Strange to say, but often adults connect with one another through their kids' friend groups.  So one hypothesis is that if you had kids, this otherwise hidden world of classical music would suddenly reappear as if by magic. :)",

Music isn't just a pastime or a childhood phase\u2014it's a fundamental part of life that resonates with our deepest emotions and experiences. It's wonderful that you continue to play the piano every day; that's a commitment to something meaningful that not everyone understands.\n\nIt's tough when those around us don't share or appreciate what we love, but that doesn't make your passion any less valuable. Don't feel pressured to hide this important part of yourself or conform to what others consider \"grown-up\" or \"manly.\" Authenticity is about embracing who you are and what brings you joy.\n\nPerhaps there are local music groups, online communities, or even just attending more concerts where you might meet like-minded people who share your appreciation for classical music. Connecting with others who understand can make a big difference.\n\nRemember, following your passion isn't something you need to outgrow\u2014it's something that enriches your life and the lives of those who get to experience it with you. Keep playing, keep loving music, and know that it absolutely matters.\n\nStay true to yourself!",

So, while searching the woodwork for other aficionados may be one possible solution, it may not be easily achieved.\n\nAn alternate solution is to consider branching out yourself by learning new genres of music that are popular around where you live, including perhaps jazz and/or rock or others, and then using your skills, both old and new, to jam with friends. This is exactly what I did. I have many friends who play guitar and sing, and most music jams that they have had consisted of 5 to 10 people all playing rhythm guitar. So I bought a relatively inexpensive digital piano (a Casio Privia) with weighted keys and a small QSC PA speaker, have started learning how to play by ear and have been accompany them. Because so few play piano, my contributions are most welcome by others, and I am able to get my own musical enjoyment out of it. Your mileage may vary, but it's worth considering.",

I grew up playing in hard rock bands , playing 3 chord songs in bars- and all of that was \u201cawesome\u201d  , according to co workers and my friends-  but then when I really became fascinated with music theory and started writing music on the piano it was like I drove my cool car off a CLIFF!  Ha ha!  I guess electric guitar is sexy.  And piano is clearly not.  I want to perform -  I could throw a rock and hit a guy strumming a guitar and singing, just about wherever I go to eat or have a drink-  but I never get a call back about playing the piano/ singing anywhere.  It sounds so much better- it just does .  I bought a Nord grand and 6 high quality speakers, digital mixer, etc -  I can make it sound SO MUCH NICER than 99% of anything I ever hear- which is usually a rounded out, overcompressed \u201cblang\u201d sound with too much delay and reverb .  But since that\u2019s \u201ccooler\u201d than piano, then I guess that\u2019s that.  \nSo I have the FOMO -  I feel like the above \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb is the \u201cstandard\u201d - and people just aren\u2019t as into music as I am.  That \u201cnot very good sounding 3 chord guitar songs > anything on piano because\u2018that\u2019s not as cool\u2019\u201d.  That people have different expectations.  \nAlso similar-  I work with a bunch of gruff , manly dirtball  men.  I feel like I\u2019m just as big of a dirtbag as these guys , but the fact that I play the piano , there is a like an unspoken thing - like \u201coh Mr. HIGH SOCIETY over here\u201d\u2026.   \nSo I think that you are correct.  I think that we are currently going through a different era.  If you are in the States , as I am, there seems to be a kind of a \u201ccelebration of low life\u201d or of \u201clow expectations\u201d or something.  That things regarded as \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d 50 years ago may now seem \u201cuppity\u201d. \nIt\u2019s weird to me, because I like music.  I think about it all the time.  The grandest thing that I ever write will probably never compete with Mumble Rap.  So it\u2019s lonely out here .  I thought about changing my name to THE NAKED PIANO MAN, just to see if I could get a call back. Ha ha.  I\u2019m in pretty good shape, so idk.  Like Jenny playing the guitar in Forrest Gump.

In my perception, this only partially has something to do with growing up. I've been playing the piano for almost 10 years now and wasn't born into a family that's musically gifted and they didn't particularly support my interest in classical music. Thus, I also didn't have friends who played instruments at all, though I dare to say that listening/playing classical music is still a lot more common here in Europe since it was basically born here. I can only imagine how much it must suck to grow up in a very musical environment only to see it slowly fading, since music is something highly therapeutic and very enjoyable. But having a niche interest and not having other people around you that have the same interest is usually the starting point for a lot of people. So the only advice that comes to mind is what the others have told you already. Go and search for your people. We are out there. On the other hand, if you cannot find anyone at all, try interesting other people for your passion. Offer piano lessons, Volunteer at musical festivals, churches if that's an option for you, retirement homes, just everywhere you can.

So it stands to reason that a certain number, the ones who weren't all that keen to begin with, will drop out as soon as they're old enough to confidently make the choice (somewhere between 12 and 18). And then a fair few more will drop out as they start focusing on college, career, and/or kids. By age 40, the only people still playing regularly will be working musicians, and amateurs who love music enough to actively make it a priority.\u00a0\n\n\nThat doesn't mean you're always going to be isolated from the music you enjoy.

It's not a childish hobby, so don't treat it like one.\n\nThird, you shouldn't reject working out. Go to the gym, take care of your body and health; you'll appreciate it in the long run and you'll probably live longer to play more piano. \n\n\nBesides that, consider creating your own. You've played all your life, and you could probably find some people interested in classical music that may not be at your level of playing, but will probably have passion for it.\nJoin a jazz band.

It's not something I discuss with anyone, but you're right. There really aren't many people that care to hear about piano playing, or even listen to me play, lol. I only talk about it with one really close friend, and only because she thinks I'm good at playing for some reason. \n\nJust know that it is REALLY cool to have any hobby, especially one that is different than truck driving, grilling, Sunday football, etc. It's what makes you a more interesting person.",

I learn and play more now than ever before (mix of classical, some jazz standards and pop too). I just turned 65 few weeks ago. I once again have more time and need my daily dose of piano. Not often I need to push myself to practice anymore, it is more like habit and if it helps keep our brains fresh, that is just an added benefit.

I've been playing the piano for close to 60 years, and I still take lessons.  A bunch of us who work with the same teacher get together on a regular basis to play for each other, talk about music, exchange ideas, advice, etc.\n\nAnd one more: look around for others who play string or wind instruments and would like to team up to do some chamber music.

Marched three seasons with a drum and bugle corps, too. We were an extremely large and competitive music program. This was a long time ago, and life moved on. One day, my kids opened a box and found a practice pad and sticks, and as I was showing them how to play, I realized it had been 20 years since I last played with any level of seriousness. I don't know how it had been so long, but when I tried to play, it was all still there in my head, but my hands were gone, and I put things down out of frustration and let my kids goof around. \n\nI remember back when I was in some honors band in high school, and the guest conductor was a professor of music from Michigan. He was wonderful, and we were a really amazing band for the two days we were together. \n\nAt the end, when they do their little speech before the performance, he begged us to keep playing. He didn't care where. He didn't care how. A community band, in our basements, however we could, because music is just such an important part of life, and how little sense would it make to have spent thousands of hours honing our skill just to stop when we graduated. Because once you put it down, life goes on, and you never pick it up again. \n\nAnd that's what most of us did. Nobody I was in band with plays anymore (minus the ones that became band directors). That's just what happens, as our guest conductor knew. I still remember it fondly (perhaps more sunny than it actually was), but damn, I miss it. My life is full now, and there's no room for the time it would take to earn it back. I still listen, and I'll go to the symphony when I get the chance, but I'm a spectator now. \n\nAs for your situation, if you're in a busy town, there may be more opportunities than you think. If there are band programs around, they often have need for piano accompanists for their solo and ensemble competitions. You could reach out to band directors and see, at the very least. They're always tuned into the local scene. \n\nDon't let it go, though. And don't let anyone tell you that you should.",

But now that I live in a suburb and have more non-music friends, I feel isolated in my love for it sometimes. One thing I did that I enjoy is join a local piano club where people play for one another every 6-8 weeks in different locations. I don't know if something like that exists in your town, but you could look into it, or see if there's a music appreciation/concert club that gets together to attend classical concerts together (some orchestras and local presenting orgs may have a \"young professionals group\" associated with them). If these things don't exist, you could start one? Local Facebook groups are great for that sort of thing. You could also see if a local music school has any adult chamber music programs that you could join (if you like playing music with others). I really do feel your pain with this!! I think America (assuming that's where you're located) is becoming more and more devoid of arts and culture. It stems from a lack of education when folks are young, less and less media coverage of classical music (there used to be days when orchestras were featured regularly on TV and folks like Leonard Bernstein were a household name. Now you'd be lucky if the average person has heard of Lang Lang or Dudamel), and the fact that we refuse to pay more in taxes to fund the arts (as opposed to many European countries which have orchestras largely funded by the government, for example). In my parents' generation, there was an upright piano in every home. Now you can't even GIVE away perfectly good grand pianos. People think they take up too much space.  I tried to convince a friend whose daughter was taking lessons to get an upright and she refused. They got her a shitty keyboard instead. She didn't want to commit to a real instrument until she knew her daughter would continue with it long term. I understand that, I do. But it's interesting that generations ago, it didn't matter. Having a real piano was culturally the norm and learning to play instruments was valued. Now it simply is not.   \n  \nBut enough doom and gloom talk. You will always be able to find your niche. Unless you live somewhere really off the beaten path, I'm certain there are likeminded classical loving folks in your age range in your area!!! Good Luck! (and keep at it with your partner... maybe she's more visual and would like a multimedia classical concert or something more semi-staged, or an opera or ballet)",

It also broadens your horizons where you may come to appreciate other genres. I was a piano major in college and had an extremely narrow focus on classical piano. I accompanied choral groups to help pay for college, came to enjoy that, and eventually realized I was not going to be the next Horowitz. In the process, I developed a skill that was very marketable and has kept me busy for the last 50 years or so. I also expanded my skills to include organ and keyboards, choral conducting, music direction, music technology, etc. Sight reading is really the key to this path however. Without that skill, you simply would have to spend too much time learning music. If you put yourself in positions where you have to learn a particular group of pieces by a certain day, your sight reading and ability to learn new music quickly should gradually improve, and with that, your self-confidence. Now at age 75, I still enjoy playing classical pieces and going to the symphony to hear the latest greatest young concert pianists.",

I love it and didn't have any interest in learning to play anything else.

He is considered by many experts to be the best living pianist\". I've since come to really appreciate his clinical and chill interpretations of music. He rarely seems to be in a hurry to finish a piece and he's an excellent pianist for it, whom I use as a gauge for my own playing quite often. \n\nBack then I didn't get it, so I left a bit underwhelmed.",

                    "body": "My country, Finland, is a well-known \"festival country\". It's a small country, so we are concentrating on a couple of big festivals per theme. So there are maybe five bigish jazz festivals each year, there is one huge opera festival, there are a couple of classical music festivals, a metal festival called \"pain\" (Tuska), a hipster festival called \"Flow\" etc etc. \n\nSince we have very distinct seasons, all or most festivals happen in the summer and the slate is wiped clean each year. Winter is the time when the organisations work on next year's festival, handle the bookings of artists, plan the itineraries, the program etc. And then in the summer it kicks off again. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that where I live, everyone more or less knows the names of all these significant festivals and how close they are to you. Finding them is not the issue. Finding one that resonates with what you would like to work with is the hard part. Which festival has the best community, the best program, the best artists, the best overal experience for you as a volunteer? \n\nIf you're from a country with less pronounced seasons, they may happen any time of the year and if the country is very big, the amount of different festivals may be so large that you haven't heard of them all. Then it helps to know how a festival is generally carried out and maybe even attend some as a paying guest one year and then look into volunteering next year if you like it a lot. Internet is certainly your friend, so Googling it is probably a very good starting point if you don't know the names of festivals that interest you already. \n\nAlso, don't discount competitions. There are several large piano competitions all over the world and they need all kinds of help just like festivals. Again, Google is your friend. \n\nLet's say you're from Alaska. Apparently there is an \"Anchorage Chamber Music Festival\" that you would probably have heard about if you lived in Alaska. The main festival is July 23rd to August 2nd next year. There is also a fund raising concert on December 21st. In a hypothetical situation I would just dig out their contact information or find the contact form on their \"contact us\" page and shoot them a quick message: \"Hey, I'm a 19 year old amateur pianist from Anchorage. I would love to work in your festival organisation. Do you need volunteers?\". To which they would probably reply \"Thank you for your message. Could you give our coordinator and head of operations Christina a call? We have lots of volunteers in all kinds of tasks and typically accept applications from January each year\". You have to show that you have something to offer and are eager to work for their cause. \n\nFestival work consist of this relentless work around the year trying to pave the way for the perfect event. Then it culminates in this giant explosion of activity that takes only a few weeks, after which comes a period of sadness that it is over and then everything repeats again. If the festival was succesful. Festivals can lose money and there is no guarantee it will happen next year, so maybe also look into the financial numbers of each festival and try to find one that is successful. The overal atmosphere will be much better if the big picture is something everyone believes in.",

(As a kid, your parents are essentially a captive audience.)\n\nBut at the same time, we've never had more widespread access to instruments and instruction.  For a while I was renting and could play a digital piano with headphones and keep up my practice better than if I would have needed to use a traditional piano, because I both wouldn't have been able to move one into my rental and also would have been really restricted on when I could have played it.\n\nAlso, for those who play, there is a wide variety of music available to them to be inspired by.  This is also kind of paradoxical, though, because it doesn't seem to me like we get as rich of variety overall as when different regions had their own styles and artists would really delve deep into their regional style.",

Imo too much so, because listening back to the recording, there's a lot of stuff I see I could've done better, but oh well.\n\nHe shared a lot of tips on how to practice, make certain sections of music into exercises and vary the tempo. He kinda reminded me of the existence of the damper pedal, since most pianists rarely ever use it as its behavior varies vastly and unpredictably between different pianos (well, he does use it and I think he's right). Many of us also underutilize our arms and focus too much on the fingers, he does a lot of the moving with his arms. For example, for certain fast scales, he doesn't even play legato and instead quickly jumps between positions.\n\nAll in all, he shared more technical wizardry and practice wisdom, but very valuable information nonetheless.\n\nSomething else that i think is really important, especially coming from someone who plays concerts for a living, is that it's never a bad idea to also keep other career options in mind (that can be music-related of course, such as a teacher or musicologist) because the scene is so saturated and making it big is a real gamble, no matter how well you play. He says that many young pianists he hears at competitions play better than many piano legends did at their age. That if the likes of Rubinstein or Ashkenazy were starting off today there'd be absolutely no guarantee that they'd make it.\n\nThe comment that I loved the most, though, is when I started playing the 2nd part of the Tarantella, I apparently did it a bit too rhythmically correctly and regularly, so he stopped me, looked me in the eye, and told me: \"this is a Neapolitan canzona (song), i need more of the taste of the tomato\"\n\nLove it",

She could mostly handle high stuff (my wife in flute or picc), but play mid-register harmony and it was a different story.\n\nBork mostly seems completely indifferent.  I could practice trumpet and he still just looks at me lazily as if nothing is happening.  Though my wife was practicing some altissimo sax stuff earlier today and he certainly seemed concerned.

                    "body": "Cats are very sensitive to sound and seem to like music catered to specifically cats. There also seems to be a difference between different breeds. Human music is/would be very much different to cat music, since music is always catered to how we communicate. Vocal ranges are different for example, but also rhythm of the most liked music often also caters towards our heart beats (or 2x the beat f.e.) research showed. The same applies to cats. Some research however didn\u2019t show any form of cats liking music. Some research showed cats petting/rubbing the speakers with their heads after presenting them with cat specific music. Cat-specific music is music specifically made to mimic purring, suckling, and other sounds in the feline vocal range. \n\nThe hard thing about this is that if it\u2019s about liking music or not, preferences will vary widely between cats just like they do with humans.\n\nCats whiskers are super sensitive to small vibrations in the air and their hearing is also more sensitive than ours. Cats ear shape amplifies sounds between 2.000 and 6.000Hz and they can hear up to 64.000Hz. So they also perceive sound different than we do. \n\nResearch seems to suggest a lot of cats don\u2019t like hard and loud low tones (just have someone tap your eyelashes a few times a second). And music catered to humans often does use a nice amount of bass. On the piano I can imagine this is a bit different, since you play a lot of middle/higher register stuff with the right hand. I can imagine the cat not liking when you constantly hammer the lower registers of the piano. Also cats purring sits somewhere between 25 and 150Hz (but isn\u2019t particularly loud for the same reason). You might just hit that perfectly with your left hand sometimes for your cat to enjoy it. \n\nLast thing, then I\u2019m out: your cat might also think the piano is too loud and try to find solace in your arms. Just saying not everyone has to be what it seems ;)",
