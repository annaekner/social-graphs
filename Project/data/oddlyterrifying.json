I took this pic at the top of the mountain. Behind the pillar should have been nothing, a drop off to the woods below. are we bugging? that really looks like a hand. ",

Why this photo? I like photographing abandoned/broken down man made structures because i think its cool\n\n\n-  it is not a sign, the only signs out there were trail markers and there is no reason a trail marker should have been that close to the edge of the mountain\n\n\ni dont think i have anything to add but i will be sure to check this comment thread to try to continue to answer anything else",

Other branches in shadow don\u2019t come close to this shade.  \n  \nThe next is the shape. You can somewhat read where the knuckles are and the fingers bend in a way that appears natural for a hand to move. You might also consider that most average people struggle to draw a proper-shaped hand intentionally; the odds of observing anything shaped like a hand by nature and coincidence is slim.  \n  \nAnd finally the shades of the fingers. There is a darker-shaded line on what looks like the middle finger that resembles a crease/knuckle. Maybe my eyes are lying to me, but it almost seems like the tips of them are just barely a lighter shade, to signify the existence of finger nails.  \n  \nThere\u2019s just too much out of the ordinary about it to dismiss it from being a hand.",

I\u2019ve spent the last 4 hours looking for other images of it, learnt a lot. But using Google  Search, Maps, reverse search imaging, and Chat GTP 4 to help identify the location and if there is more information online for you. Here\u2019s what I found out:\n\nThere isn\u2019t a specific mention of a \u201cVulture\u2019s Roost\u201d along the Overlook Trail in Panther State Forest.  The foundation you see in the image is likely the remnants of an older overlook structure that used to exist on the trail. Over time, such structures can deteriorate or be removed for safety or maintenance reasons. The trail still offers beautiful views, and it\u2019s a popular spot for hikers seeking a panoramic view of the forest.\n\nHowever there are no specific photos taken of the old overlook or it remains. So it\u2019s difficult to find a confirms photo matching the concrete foundations online. (Except for your image posted.)\n\nSo to determine if that\u2019s a hand or another object, someone would have to go verify this by following the below coordinates of where you took the photo. (I am unable to as I live in New Zealand.)\n\nHowever I believe the photo was taken from this point, looking south east, or close to it, however can you please confirm that would be helpful. Google maps photo in link below \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\n\nMarker if anyone wants to go searching for the mystery. And here are the coordinates from if OP can please confirm.\n\n**37\u00b025\u201924\u201dN 81\u00b051\u201911\u201dW**\n\n[map](https://www.reddit.com/u/copa111/s/cjeJ4FKCkE)",

Here\u2019s what I found out:\n\n*There isn\u2019t a specific mention of a \u201cVulture\u2019s Roost\u201d along the Overlook Trail in Panther State Forest.  The foundation you see in the image is likely the remnants of an older overlook structure that used to exist on the trail. Over time, such structures can deteriorate or be removed for safety or maintenance reasons. The trail still offers beautiful views, and it\u2019s a popular spot for hikers seeking a panoramic view of the forest.*\n\n*However there are no specific photos taken of the old overlook or it remains. So it\u2019s difficult to find a confirms photo matching the concrete foundations online. (Except for your image posted.)*\n\nSo to determine if that\u2019s a hand or another object, someone would have to go verify this by following the below coordinates of where you took the photo. \n(I am unable to as I live in New Zealand.) \n\nHowever I believe the photo was taken from this point, looking south east, or close to it, however can you please confirm that would be helpful. Google maps photo in link below \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc \n\nMarker if anyone wants to go searching for the mystery. And here are the coordinates from if OP can please confirm.\n\n**37\u00b025\u201924\u201dN 81\u00b051\u201911\u201dW**\n\n[map](https://www.reddit.com/u/copa111/s/qllG5kQoY5)\n\n\nSo who\u2019s going up there to take a few more photos of this thing?",

In terror you reach behind your head to try grab it and you can feel... a hand. Suddenly you're yanked down under the water and in panic you swallow so much water and suddenly you're freed and can sit up again coughing and panicking frantically searching for the hand.

On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.\u201d",

If I had just moved the forklift I would have only been out for about 2-3 minutes.\n\nIt was -23F/-30.55C.

Scarring can cause tight skin and hyperpigmentation. \n\nMost Drs don\u2019t recommend this yet, but if you\u2019re willing to do a little research, [there\u2019s a lot of medical papers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918339/) regarding the use of silicone gel to prevent scarring after a burn. When my burn was at a stage similar to what your hand looks like, I started applying it religiously, it keeps moisture in. \n\nAlso keep it away from the sun. I wore gloves or a bandana around my fingers while they healed enough to use heavy sunscreen (about a month). This is to prevent hyperpigmentation. \n\nMy fingers were pink for about 3 or 5 months, but slowly got back to their regular color lol",

I checked the weather, as I always do before we fish, and it seemed like it was going to be a pleasant day. Notice how I said \u201cseemed\u201d? The drive up there was fine. Once we got far enough up the mountain, we started to see some very small pockets of snow, but mostly in the shaded areas. No big deal. We got up there, picked our spot, set up our gear, and started casting. What a great idea this was! About two hours in, it started snowing very lightly. It would come and go. Again, no big deal. After a couple hours, it started SNOWING. Nonstop. More and more, until we could barely see across the cove we were fishing at. Oh, did I mention we were in shorts and t-shirts? Did I also mention we had ZERO cold weather gear with us? No pants, no sweatshirts, no long sleeves, NOTHING. This, however, was our dilemma; we were catching SO MANY fish. I mean, almost every single cast resulted in a fish in the net. It was unreal. The smart thing to do would\u2019ve been to pack up the moment we realized the snow wasn\u2019t going to stop anytime soon. Instead, I drove to the gift shop and actually asked them if they sold pants. They did not. But, when you\u2019re 24, nothing can phase you! So, we ended up staying until 4 PM, and went home with some lovely trout to cook up, and one helluva story! We still laugh about it to this day. We\u2019re almost 40 now.",

A man in the 30s or 40s who ran a local gas station also had a pet monkey. He loved it like his own child and took it everywhere he went. Eventually the monkey died and a local legend said he had the body encased in a pillar in front of the gas station. I guess it was the spot he leaned against while waited for customers. \n\nSomeone bought the old gas station in the 90s and either renovated it or demolished it. Either way, when the pillar came down, a mummified monkey fell to the ground and scared the shit out of the workers. Turns out the legend was true. I personally would have had the only stuffed or buried, but to each their own.",

A few years back we were having some renovations and the workers found a full rats skeleton and they decided to put it in my bedroom bin instead of the outside bin. I got a fright finding that and so did my poor hubby from my squeal he came running upstairs wondering what was wrong lol,  I first was creeped out, then intrigued then grossed out (it stunk for some reason I\u2019m guessing from being under the floor for years)",

Our basements were separated by a cinder block wall but there were holes or somethin that were covered up with plywood.

Cat was *very* good at catching them, brought them to us humans and spit them out. We humans suck at hunting so lizards went into hiding and were never seen again.\n\nSame asshole cat caught 4 bats, brought them inside and released them. Chaos ensued.\n\n\nCurrent cat is useless, I caught her meowing and purring at a crow sitting on the rail with no intention to hunt it and look mildly interested at a bird hopping within paw reach.",

We are on the phone I finish my cig turn around and through the sliding glass balcony door i see there is a huge mother fucker standing in my pitch black living room. Either he hasnt seen me yet or he just doesnt care because when the time comes he knows I will be of little effort. I tell my room mate on the phone \"dude there is someone in the house\". \n\nIts worth mentioning that this was not my first time or even my 50th time doing these, I was very well versed. So it wasnt like I was freaki g out I knew my stages pretty well and I was at the point where the rain just looked like lines of silly string. I had never had full blown visual hallucinations before and to this day still have not. \n\nHe was at work luckily, delivering pizzas. He says call the cops. Im like yeah no not happening. He was then like is the front door open? And I said Im pretty sure I locked it. He says he can be there in 15. So, we had a storage closet on our balcony and I slowly back away from the door and enter the storage closet. Lock it. Perfect time to smoke a joint. If im dying im hotboxing this closet. \n\nMy phone rings. Pretty sure I just shit myself its so loud in this tiny closet. Its my roommate letting me know he is pulling up. I crack open the door wait for headlights when i see them i get out of the closet hang over the balcony and am like im gonna jump down. He says absolutely not.\n\n Im scared. I want to cry. I turn around and this fucking guy is just watching me. Through the door. I say as much and my roomie bolts up the stairs. \n\nHe swings upen the door turns on the light and its our fucking Aliens vs Predator cardboard cut out of the predator. \n\nFuck. My. Life. \n\nWe had a friend who for the longest time was the lead projectionist at a rave motion pictures. He had some really cool perks like watching movies at 3 am in the theatre by yourself or seeing movies before everyone else or getting cool posters and standups. \n\nThat was a really weird night and needless to say we got rid of the cut out",

Sometimes they don't and it's called craniectomy (only for some time). Then they'll put it back in. I'm not sure for the rare cases, I'll let reddit neurosurgeon answer that",

I'm not sure why; if it was a medical decision or if it just wasn't possible. After his frontal lobes were removed, he turned into a monster of a human. We didn't have a relationship for over 30 years.\n\nBut I had to step in and take care of his affairs the last several years of his life. Despite missing parts of his brain and suffering from seizures his whole life, dude was sharp *AF.* He was always the smartest person in the room. He was also relatively healthy, considering. He couldn't walk and had a permanent catheter, but he survived COVID and was always lucid and alert.\n\nAnyways, the little hole left in his head from when the nursing home bumped it was about the size of a pencil eraser. The rules were that he was supposed to be wearing a helmet whenever they moved him, but they never did. \n\nThen the little hole got infected and it turned into a bigger hole and the surgeons just couldn't save him. He had three surgeries and the third one killed him, basically.",

So.. always pee when you can before you get to the show stop at a WaWa or 7-11 what ever and use the utilities. Drink and hydrate/eat before hand. Expect not to be able to get out of a huge crowd for about an hour after the show finishes. Wait till the parking lot empties and then bail. See if you can pick up a outsider vendors t shirt in the parking lot..lol hang out ..meet new people who are still hanging out..I miss good shows. Things have changed so much.

                    "body": "I worked as safety in the ditch (area between the guard rail and the stage) at festivals in Sweden. Mostly medium but some large ones (got my tinnitus guarding Rihanna :/). The pic is a large-very large concert to me. We got extensive training on how to look for issues with people, how to lift, how to act and what to do in case of emergencies, but we were volunteers and young adults. During my\u00a07 years (1-3 festivals a year) I never experienced anything really bad. Mostly people who were weren't enjoying being smashed into the guard rail and needed to get out. 2nd largest stage needed help one year, admin had misjudged Within Temptation and the stage( circus tent) was packed all the way out. We lifted tons of people and sent out so much water. But that was it.\u00a0\n\nI was also told many venues hire the equivalent of bikers for safety who won't give a shit.\n\n\n\n* Don't get further into the crowd than you are comfortable with. Usually it's no problem getting out backwards, people want to be in front of you so they will let you pass.\n* Put a light hand or tap on people's shoulders to get their attention, excuse yourself and \"sorry sorry\". So far in any festival or club I've had no issues with this, but I'm a dude. Both working and visiting.\n\n* Eat and drink properly throughout the day. It's not worth standing in scorching sun to see your favorite artist for 5mins until you faint and we have to lift and carry you to the medical tent where you will be triaged and maybe taken to the hospital. This happens mostly to women but men too. Depending on the crowd we would lift at least a friend if you had one with you. Else we would tell them to go out backwards and around to the medical tent on the side of the stage.\n\n* Never ever or lean down far in standing crowd. People are staring at the stage and not you and will forget you are there until they are standing on a small mound - you. If you happen to see someone go down, get the attention of safety or people around you and have them step aside and help, there's more room than you think. But be careful, you might become a slightly higher mound for someone to stand on. 0 is better than 1, but 1 is better than 2 :(\n\n* If you are up front against the guard rail and feeling this isn't your thing, get the attention of the safety people, they will lift you out.\n* Watch out for crowd waves, they will catch you by surprise and can move you several feet. We usually built a \"finger\" out of guard rails as a wave breaker, but waves can happen anyway.\n\n* Watch out for moshpits, we tried to quell them by gathering 4-6 safety and marching into them. But until then get away. They're fun for the 5 people who know how to act in them, but there's always 2-3 who don't know and will ruin the concert for the 100 others that want to enjoy the concert.\n\n* We would pass out water for you to drink or drench yourself in, as long as we had cups to go around. We would also prepare a bunch of cups so people could just reach down and take or pass out themselves\n\n\nSorry for making it seem dangerous, it can be but most like wont. Try not to worry, be aware of what's going on.\n* People are in a good mood and will 99.99% of the time help you.\n\n\nOn my cellphone so hope my formatting works...",

The first one dropped right on top of us, almost knocking me out, because we weren't expecting it and didn't have our hands up to keep the guy afloat.\n\nFor the next hour we practically couldn't watch the show because we had to keep checking back to make sure a crowd surfer wasn't coming our way. It was terrifying and absurdly violent. Finally I had a panic attack, started racing through the crowd to escape, was body blocked by a man because I almost ran straight into an impromptu mosh pit, and then finally got to some fresh air.\n\nCraziest part? The view from way back where the people weren't packed in was almost better than where we were fifty feet closer to the stage. Totally not worth it to be that close. I'm never going to another crowd show like that, but if I did I'd just get there just before the show got there and bring some binoculars or something.",

I worked in a shipyard in Florida for awhile when I was much younger, the inside of those hills were sometimes like 130F or more. Didn't matter how much water and Gatorade I drank, I'd sweat it all out, not pee at all until after I got home. That first pee would be *dark* from how concentrated it was. I ended up developing kidney stones from it.

Then the skin adapts,  grows, and then the filler dissolves slightly, but not completely. Then when it wears off, you are left looking worse off that before.  Thats when they recommend more filler. And there you go.  You get more, and will even need a little more to fill the space that has now expanded a little. Over time, you grow dependent on filler, and you look even worse without it. It\u2019s a cycle that worsens every time you get more. Your natural facial features begin to distort. Everything starts to look fuller and plump. Every hear of the pillow face look that some people start to get? \n\nTruthfully.

They tell the doctors \"oh this is made of hylauronic acid which is natural in your skin so it dissolves over time.\" and doctors aren't pharmacists so they just believe them, and a lot of people get fillers and it seems like it's gone in a similar time window, so it tracked. but my guess is that information was based on what they thought made sense, not based on any testing, and what's really happening for a lot of filler is it's migrating into other areas of the face. I got under eye filler and only afterward learned there was a study that found under eye filler that migrated underneath the eye socket of some patients even 12 years after they got it done.",

Our bodies are the outward form to be ridiculed, accepted, praised, etc. upon first glance while our minds, souls, values, etc. are the internal dialogue that have to be earned verbally or through actions. \n\nWe all can be judged on our looks upfront before we ever utter a single word. That weight can cause people to want to offset that for themselves or for the perception from others. \n\nHopefully it doesn\u2019t have negative health implications but I feel adding something that wasn\u2019t there originally definitely increases the risk.

But you\u2019re assuming an entire independent IRB, every clinical site who could risk losing their medical licenses to practice independently if they conduct fraud and are usually blinded in late phase 2 and up, every employee including many independent entities like data monitoring committees and data safety monitoring boards which are required by the FDA before you can even start a trial to be in place and independent from any influence of vested parties, every employee (including medical monitors who may be employed by a CRO or the pharma who also have to worry about their medical license) are all in kahoots.\n\nJust because you\u2019re in health care doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t a tinfoil hat wearer. I actually work in drug development specifically in assessing through data and statistics fraud and study misconduct. I compliment on-site efforts and we\u2019re all blinded. I have no vested interest in my work in whether the drug works - I\u2019m paid literally to highlight potential misconduct and fraud. I\u2019ve worked on close to over 100 trials in my 3 years doing this and never once was there intentional fraud\u2026 it is incredibly rare. It\u2019s mostly laziness and incompetence and safety monitoring is the UTMOST importance to me and many others. If it even looks like a clinical site is rounding BP measures, we submit a corrective action, investigation, retraining, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s usually ignorance that speaks to what you say. Certainly don\u2019t trust it blindly, but to assume it\u2019s this big Wizard of Oz entity that isn\u2019t insanely safeguarded is laughable",

For example the nose scrunch when people cannot use their eyebrows or forehead anymore. It could create more stress on other muscles, and while botox for some people can help to relieve migraines I also know people who got worse migraines because of this overcompensation of their muscles.

They dye their hair (beards included!)- sometimes for funsies, sometimes to cover greys, sometimes for both. \n\nPeople stick acrylics on their fingers. The gauge their ears. They get mommy makeovers to perk themselves up after a major body change. They get hair plugs. Electrolysis. They lengthen their bones, and not just for medical purposes. \n\nHumans make changes to their bodies in order to exercise control over their appearance in many ways, some more permanent and some less. \n\nIt\u2019s just that women are traditionally more often scorned for it, despite the fact that some things are specially marketed to them, and usually via predatory tactics that instill fear and insecurity. Then the same society that does that turns around and shames them for it. \n\nNow, because correlation does not equal causation, we cannot say that women who get cosmetic procedures are inherently insecure and fearful and are doing so because of advertising. We can\u2019t say that about men who do, either (hair plugs, anyone?). But there is an element of predatory advertising there that does need to be considered on both sides. \n\nAnother related thing that is interesting to me is how little people bring up the work out obsession instilled into men by society. Not doing well in your life? Lost your girl? Your job? Not making enough money? Not getting laid on weekends? You need to hit the gym bro! No one is going to look at you if you don\u2019t even lift! You gotta get that new protein drink! Don\u2019t forget the shaker cup, you can get it for free if you buy the bundle!

Don\u2019t forget to sign up for our newsletter and join our app for discounts and push notifications reminding you that you haven\u2019t worked out enough to be proud of yourself this week!  \n\nAnyways, people should just do what makes them happy, while also doing their best to have healthy self-esteem. This will look different for everyone, and it\u2019s best that we just extend kindness to each other and let each other live. (Not saying you\u2019re not doing this, just general commentary)",

I mean, like I wouldn\u2019t necessarily fault you for not providing sources just that it\u2019s kinda just shooting the shit unless you do. \n\nBut from your responses and looking thru some of the studies they kinda confirm what I think is likely the case. In the overwhelming majority of patients, most fillers do dissolve in their own especially HA ones. \n\nBut it does seem like that\u2019s not always the case, at least anecdotally. I imagine it\u2019s pretty rare, but either through some sort of immune response, poor technique from professionals, biological weirdness, or even the fillers causing some kinda secondary process that feels like fillers(though I\u2019ve seen reports from folks that have had MRIs done so idk if they are lying or if it\u2019s something else going on), they can stick around and migrate even. \n\nOverall, this does seem to be quite rare especially when the folks performing these procedures know what they are doing and the patients are good candidates but I from what you\u2019ve shared and from what i have heard from folks do think there is a risk. One that\u2019s not typically medically significant but can be problematic and look weird folks should be aware of before getting them. Though that\u2019s true for literally any sort of medical procedures.\n\nThanks again for your time! I wasn\u2019t trying to be a douche bag I was just frustrated with all of these people saying a lot without providing anything to back up their claims. As this is jnoortant information both for folks that are being kinda a douche to folks that are getting fillers and people deciding if they want them",

There are pictures of Skarsgard carrying Jackson at events after filming. My favorite behind the scenes story is that when Jackson was walking with his mom to go film the gutter scene, he spotted Skarsgard in costume for the first time and ran to go talk to him; his mom stopped him and he actually pitched a fit that he wasn\u2019t allowed to go check out the clown yet. He had fun pretending to die and when he saw the prop for his ripped off arm his immediate instinct was to use it to mess with his mom. ~~sorry for the infodump I just really like these movies and read everything I could find about their production~~",

And if the cops call about anything, let them know that you're wary of scams, and will call them back on their publicly listed number. Don't take the number from them, just look up the police station's non emergency line and call them directly to confirm whether or not they were trying to reach you.",

The bathroom wasn't hooked up, so I got up and went out to use the bathroom in their house.\n\nIt's foggy, just like in this picture. Then I see, looming out of the fog, two giant brown shapes, very close to me. Spindly legs, large body and head, considerably bigger than me. \n\nI'm not fully awake, but my brain screamed MOOSE! I was already out of the RV, so I just scooted quickly to the house, keeping my eyes on them the whole time. They were gone when I came back, so I went back into the RV and went to sleep.\n\nI woke up the next day, remembering the terror of the \"moose\" run-in, but now my brain was working enough to remind me we were in rural Arkansas, therefore, no moose.\n\nSo I bring it up during breakfast, and my in-laws explained that their neighbors had two horses that regularly like to escape and wander all over the neighborhood before going back home. She told me if they showed up again, just to shoo them away.\n\nI felt so stupid thinking they were moose, but my brain wasn't fully functioning when I left the RV, so it reverted back to what I remembered learning as a kid.",

I grabbed the shade to raise it, yanked too hard, it shot up and out of my hand...and there was a mama moose and a baby looking straight into the window. There was probably maybe a foot between us, with the window in the middle.\n\nI screamed, because SUDDENLY, MOOSE was not on my bingo card for the day. My mom came charging in trying to figure out what was wrong with me and stopped, saying, \"Holy shit!\" when she saw what was outside.\n\nThe moose were decidedly unimpressed, even when I got out my camera and took several pictures. They finished eating the tree and wandered off. \n\nI sent one of the pictures to a friend of mine in New Mexico, and her first thought was \"Wow, those are REALLY ugly horses.\"\n\nSo she mistook the moose for horses, and decades later, I mistook the horses for moose.",

Just put $10 of gas in their van and sent them on their way.

No way in hell was I approaching a strange vehicle. That was running. With a clear path to exit. Nuh. Uh. \n\nIt's usually something about having to drive for a medical appointment and not having enough gas to get home around here. Like... you drove 45 minutes and crossed the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel with no plan. Either you ain't being truthful, or you already wore out your family and friends. I go with my gut. \n\nSomebody approached me by the fitting room at Kohl's and gave me a fright. She ran off when I tried to give her shelter resources. \n\nGood for you for not getting anywhere near that situation.",

For the most part in the US, getting the gas itself is self-service. The only time I really see workers around the pumps is as Costco, and even the ratio of workers to pumps makes it basically self service with help on hand. You pump the gas yourself, and you can get gas at any time without ever interacting with a worker. Even in places with little conveniences stores like this one, the worker is usually too busy with those tasks to pay attention to those using the self-service stations. But then it\u2019s less \u201cpre-pay\u201d and more just \u201cpre-authorize\u201d because you can still fill up the tank all the way and don\u2019t need to specify a specific amount\n\nSo this makes sense then as just a difference in where things work based on where you live! The fact that many gas stations here, the pumps basically self service and not monitored is also part of why this woman\u2019s behavior is so suspicious in asking her to pump the gas for her and pay at the pump - it\u2019s essentially asking to get her alone right next to her car.",

They would have to break the bones, and after a while rebreak them, and so on.  Totally a nightmare, the little girls would spend months in bed, in agonizing pain.\n\nAnd apparently !  That smell wouldn\u2019t  go away, and showing the feet would not be considered appropriate, not even to your husband.  Whatever care that the women needed to do to their feet, which I would assume would be a lot, considering the smell, was done behind doors, and taboo for the men to see.\n\nTruly horrible stuff made out of nightmares.  If you are interested n this topic I recommend this book.  There\u2019s a movie made which is completely bullshit and barely touches in the important things, don\u2019t watch the movie.",

For girls (who were often named things that literally meant \u201cI want a son\u201d or \u201cmy next child will be a son\u201d) this was the highest perceived honor and their families jumped on the train.

It was just a mixture of odd beliefs, and trying to have your family closely resemble the emperors interests. \n\nAlso, in all fairness, society at the time didn\u2019t need gimmicks to make women dependent on men, as that was already the norm for how life was lived then\n\n(The story was copy pasted from someone else who explained it above, I just didn\u2019t want to type it out again lol)",

But as other people mentioned... think of it more like a cruise ship where the point is being there rather than getting somewhere else. Examples given are for safaris and more exotic places with no environmental impact.\n\nBut I think a lot of the focus and interest is actually more for freight (or cargo) transport since there are benefits like not needing typical insfrastructure like rails, ports, or runways... you just need a flat surface like grass, desert, or ice. The amount of energy and cost for sending ships and trucks around the world is far greater, so at first it might be more niche cases like when you can't use anything else due to terrain.",

It'll be between ocean shipping and air freight both in terms of cost and speed, which makes it an economically viable niche - companies pay for faster transit, since it means they don't need as large of an inventory, which means less financing costs for owning said inventory.",

But ever since I learned they really existed and were used I can't stop thinking how weird it is.\n\nI know it's very dangerous and had no future blablabla but in my head it's almost as if we stopped using a big technology that could've become someting bigger. The simple idea of being in a cabin suspended into the air, slowly moving it sounds like a weird but amazing dream to me\n\nAlso, this is the first time I saw a photo of this way or going inside the cabin, looks crazy. I can't believe some people had such an experience in their life. Obviously in a less intense way but to me it's almost linke if we never put people in rocket after the apollo program. It would seem crazy to think some people had such an experience, and that we stopped doing it. This is the kind of feeling I get about it",

Or ancient Roman lead pipes. \nWe would never approve of hydrogen in airships these days, ever. Helium is too valuable and important to use in medical devices. From an efficiency and safety standpoint airships only work if they're lighter than air, you don't want to be over the Atlantic for days straight and then sink if your engines die. But being lighter than air made them a nightmare to handle on the ground, they're giant kites at that point. Useless in any kind of real wind. \nThe only possible alternative would be like what Neal Stephenson suggested in Snow Crash, a vacuum cell airship. An air ship works by using a lighter than air gas at 1 ATM of internal pressure to displace a greater mass of air. A vacuum cell would be an incredibly light, like carbon nanotube light rigid vacuum flask whose volume displaces a greater mass of air than its own mass. It could then have air pumped in and out of the cells to adjust it's weight. But that kind of material is still science fiction, and it would have to be cheaper than a steel hulled ship. Or for that matter a carbon nanotube hulled ship. So really probably never gonna happen again, besides advertising blimps.",

If they just drop it off, the buoyancy of the airship increases dramatically, and it shoots up into the air. If they load on ballast as they off-load cargo, it becomes a logistical headache.\n\n[Veritasium has a video on it.](https://youtu.be/ZjBgEkbnX2I?si=ktpT3wBEt2Nc0aaQ)",

A Zeppelin carrying 15 tons of supplies and personnel were sent out *thousands of miles* across Africa without stopping, but near the end was ordered to turn back due to a false, garbled radio message that the general there had surrendered. It made it all the way back home.\n\nNo plane at the time could even dream of carrying 15 tons, much less flying thousands of miles into the heart of Africa with it and successfully landing out in the bush. Contemporaneous airplanes could fly a few hundred miles at best. Even today, such a feat would be next to impossible, even for a rugged military cargo plane like the C-130, famed for being able to take off and land on barely-improved dirt runways. The distance is simply too vast. You\u2019d need something like a C-17, and even that would be very iffy unless you got extraordinarily lucky with a viable landing zone.",

Airships have a lot of lift, which is the problem, when you remove the heavy load it will shoot upwards. \n\nThere's no real neat and simple answer for unloading one while simultaneously filling it with enough ballast or removing enough lifting gas that it stays stationary (and you can't do that either if your next destination can't refill it).\n\nLarge airships are also exceedingly difficult to handle on the ground because they are monstrously huge (the Hindenburg was the size of a decent cruise ship), have a lot of momentum and little control authority. And unlike a ship that shares most of those problems, you can't just drive a tugboat into the side of it and push it around.",

A C-5M Galaxy has a 4800 mile range (600 longer than this trip) while carrying 51 tonnes of cargo, and it wouldn't need to land because like most military cargo planes, it would just dump it out the back. The C-5B holds the world record for airdrops at 86.4t, consisting of 4x 19t M551 Sheridan tanks and 73 troops. \n\nAnd unlike L 59, the C-5 would be able to return home after dropping this off, as L 59 had no ability to refill it's lifting gas at the destination and would have been broken up for parts for the army had it actually arrived.\n\nLikewise a C-17 has a range of 2.8k miles at 71t of cargo but can go 7.2k unloaded, going down to 15t of cargo and carrying an additional 56t of fuel would likely see the range exceed 4.2k.",

Early Zeppelins in World War One and earlier didn\u2019t even have masts, they depended on ropes and hundreds of ground crewmen to chivvy them into and out of hangars wherever they were based, which was a huge logistical nightmare and military weakness in retrospect.

Older airships and fair-weather advertising blimps today are far slower, meaning they get blown around a lot more. As a rule of thumb, an airship can safely land and take off in winds half of its top speed. Older airships and advertising blimps using hot air instead of helium might top out at 25 mph, so they can only operate in good weather when the winds are less than 13 mph. A Navy airship like a ZPG-3W has a top speed of 92 mph, hence they routinely operated in storms and blizzards.",

A C-5M Galaxy has a 4800 mile range (600 longer than this trip) while carrying 51 tonnes of cargo, and it wouldn't need to land because like most military cargo planes, it would just dump it out the back. \n\nThat\u2019s what I mean, though. For anything *less* than a C-5, it would be next to impossible. That\u2019s a high bar to clear\u2014*only* the United States operates the C-5, and it\u2019s our largest cargo plane. And I was talking about landing there, not just dumping stuff out the back. I rather doubt that the C-5 has the kind of unimproved field performance of a C-130 or even a C-17.\n\n>Likewise a C-17 has a range of 2.8k miles at 71t of cargo but can go 7.2k unloaded, going down to 15t of cargo and carrying an additional 56t of fuel would likely see the range exceed 4.2k.\n\nHence why I listed the C-17 as a benchmark\u2014but even if we\u2019re talking about chucking the cargo out the back rather than being rugged enough to manage a landing on an unimproved field, it still likely wouldn\u2019t be possible for anything less than a C-17. An Airbus A400M Atlas can shove stuff out the back too, and could be rugged enough to manage a landing, but it can only go 2,400 miles carrying 30 tonnes or 3,400 miles carrying 20 tonnes. 4,200 miles carrying 15 tonnes seems iffy at best. Likewise, talking about former Soviet capabilities, anything less than an An-22 seems like it wouldn\u2019t work. An An-12 couldn\u2019t do it, nor could an An-72. Perhaps an Il-76 could manage, but it\u2019d likely have to shove the cargo out the back, not land there.",

It takes a lot of lift to carry people, their luggage, food/water for them, and the mass of the extra cabin space needed. That means you need to make the airship much bigger which increases the cost (both in the materials and lifting gas) and introduces practical problems of where you can go with it, maneuverability etc. The Hindenburg was only slightly smaller than the titanic but only carried 50 people. An airship that could carry hundreds would be even bigger still.\n\nWhich bumps against the next problem you propose of speed. A larger airship has a significantly larger surface area which increases drag. Combined with the low density of an airship that makes it really hard to push at significant speeds through air. Hybrid airship designs IRL are only a few mph faster than the Hindenberg.",

Easy, low-hanging-fruit helium will be exhausted at about the time we run out of natural gas (more or less, since helium is also found in otherwise commercially useless underground nitrogen pockets). However, it can still be obtained from the air, since it makes up a modest but fairly constant proportion of the gas mix due to radioactive decay deep in the earth. Our atmosphere is akin to a full bucket under a leaking faucet: some is constantly sloshing over the sides, and some is constantly being added.\n\nAnd \u201cinerting\u201d doesn\u2019t refer to the chemical properties of a substance by itself, it refers to the process of rendering something inert by surrounding it with an inert substance. For instance, a fuel tanker will inert its fuel vapors by pumping in carbon dioxide or nitrogen until the oxygen concentration is too low to be explosive. Carbon dioxide is half again heavier than air, thus too bothersome to viably use in airships, whereas nitrogen is slightly lighter than air (but only slightly, as air is about 80% nitrogen).",

They typically wait to pound and grind the remaining skeleton into a powder then feed that powder along with barley flour called tsampa to crows and other smaller birds, but some practices call for mashing the entire corpse into a pulp beforehand. The rogyapas are typically just laborers but the process could be performed by Buddhist monks as well.\n\nSource - did a project on burial practices in Tibet (they also do tree burials in the South East, closer to China out of the Tibetan highlands, where they suspsend the corpses up in the tree canopy enclosed in a cocoon like enclosure)",

So in this funeral ritual, a person will chop up your body into small pieces and feed it to vultures. It seems pretty vulgar but it is meant to be one final act of selflessness. Feeding the earth and it\u2019s creatures one last time. Vultures are considered sacred, in that if vultures refuse to eat the body than it is believed that the body is full of sin. If they eat it, the body is free from sin. The ritual is supposed to help guide your soul to paradise (idk what it\u2019s called in Buddhism). It is supposed to be a very happy occasion, a celebration of that souls life if you will. It\u2019s very interesting. Also, from what I know, it is technically not supposed to be witnessed by outsiders, so I definitely wouldn\u2019t film it if you ever happen to witness one. \nI mean would you film someone else\u2019s funeral as their body is lowered into the ground in a casket? Prolly not, it\u2019s kinda weird imo.",

After days and days, family members or important members of its community would go and take its skull, and plaster it and cover its eyes with seashells. To make it more unusual, they would bury its skull in its house under the floor with other plastered skulls. I did my essay on this. It turns out that a group of skulls in its house doesn\u2019t have any relations with each other at all which is crazy because we would assume that they would all be related to each other.

It is different seeing this again now.  Still hold out hope for her and her parents we get answers to what happened to her.  Just remember in comments that She was a friend to many, one of the sweetest people you could know, and had nothing but a good heart.  Her loss was felt by most if not all of the Mississinewa Class of 1989.  This page was designed to honor her, her sister and her parents by letting them know we would never forget her!",

In fact, you can still purchase human bones online to this day for educational purposes. They\u2019re far more expensive than their plastic replicas, involve a few extra hoops to jump through to obtain, sell, own and ship, and of course some people are understandably uncomfortable with the idea of using human remains in displays, which are three of the biggest reasons replicas tend to be more common, but the process isn\u2019t as spooky as you might think. \n\nThey\u2019re bones donated by consenting individuals in life, similar to organ donation. That\u2019s part of the cool reality of \u201cdonating your body to science\u201d- once tissues and organs are removed and studied for education or transplantation, our bones are cleaned up and used to teach for years to come, with our permission of course.",

All bones (and other preserved organs for anatomy and pathology classes) we get in my university are from unidentified deceased, normally homeless, who don't have a family to claim the body for a proper send off, meaning it's good that at least they can be honored in the study of medicine.. I mean, it's just sad that they didn't have family near when recently deceased, but one can hope it helps a doctor get their degree and help those same people in a similar situation.. all things considered it's better than them just becoming dirt again without anyone ever celebrating their existence in some way.",

Poroidal spinning. inside out spinning. I'm not describing this very well. but then again, I am on competing medications at the moment and no one is quite sure who's winning.
