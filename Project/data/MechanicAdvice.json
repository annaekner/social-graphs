            "text": "In the last few days I\u2019ve seen small amounts of yellow liquid dripping on the ground from bottom of my car.. didn\u2019t know what it was but after looking under the hood, it seemed to be dripping from the coolant reservoir. I thought it may just be leaking coolant, so I kept an eye on it and added some here and there when it was low. Today while I was sitting in the car, I started hearing weird noises so I turned it off and popped open the hood to see this. I took off the coolant cap because there was obvious bubbling in the reservoir, so I wanted to relieve some pressure. After doing so, the liquid started overflowing out of the reservoir. Just to mention, we\u2019ve had this car less than a month and this is the second thing wrong with it. First the alternator and now this. I\u2019m obviously going to have to take it to a shop but I\u2019m curious what this could be. ",

Not likely... but not knowing which car you have here I can't say it is possible.  But if you were lucky then driving it could make a simple radiator repair into a destroyed engine or transmission... You will only make things more expensive by driving it any at all.",

(Turn off engine if it starts overheating which will happen if the radiator doesn't hold pressure well which can be multiple things. One vehicle has oil cooler leaking and has a bad radiator cap that would not hold pressure and these cooling systems need to hold 18-25psi (depending on vehicle) and for every PSI the engine takes an additional 3\u00b0f to boil. For example normally water has a boiling point of around 226\u00b0F (108\u00b0C) at normal pressure. However, pure water in a cooling system at sea level boils at 212\u00b0F, but can reach nearly 250\u00b0F if the system is under 15 pounds of pressure. And a system at 20-PSI 233\u00b0F and at 248\u00b0F if at 25-PSI.\n\nIt's definitely possible you have a blown head gasket, I suggest you don't drive the vehicle anywhere and do these tests, if it's a blown head gasket, get quotes from local shops for a head gasket replacement. Hopefully it wasn't driven far while overheated because it could have also warped the head and or valve cover which means new engine or worse cracked them.",

If you're lucky, this will be one of the cheaper ones to repair, but they are almost always a HUGE pain in the ass so anywhere you take it will likely make you pay up in labor costs. I've personally only ever owned 2 cars that blew a head gasket and it was actually more cost effective to junk the cars and get different ones \ud83e\udd2d. Hopefully that's not the case for you!

Original suspension showing no signs of wearing down.\n\nYea, eventually it will lose out to the rust battle as all cars eventually do (very little rust right now, touch ups done every year), but it costs me so little to drive I absolutely consider it an investment. It would be more expensive for me to pay for a bus pass, bus ticket, or cab for the same cost per use I get out of it on the regular even including insurance costs.\n\nMath shows that I could put $2000 per year into my Yaris and keep it on the road another 15-20 years and still be waaaaay cheaper than buying a new car at these outrageous prices.\n\nNow, I do take meticulous care of my cars and do my own maitnence, oil changes, intake manifold gaskets, knock sensors, brakes, and whatever else I have the tools for so that saves me a lot.\n\nIf I could still get a brand new 2008 model Toyota Yaris, I  absolutely would. Thing's been a frugal nerds wet dream.",

You should not be able to continue driving except until you come to a safe stop. Failed sensor, failed wire, doesn't matter, you should get it checked by service.\nIt shouldn't cause a 4000$ issue because someone thought everyone know what those warning lights are. People ignore them, don't even know what they mean. People drive carelessly. A train would also stop if it had engine problem, this is not an argument, we have sick people on train, let's ignore the engine fire and keep it running.\n\nThe car manufacturers include all kinds of gimmicks, compressors, pumps, alternators, sensors, high pressure lines, cooling pipes, exhaust systems, abs, airbags, radars and cameras, all crammed in a tight space and you need proprietary tools to work on engines. They are designed to fail and you are the sucker paying for it all. They make a very good living off your back, there's an entire industry specialized in it. You think doing regular maintenance and fluid chages is the norm. It should run like a laser printer. How many times you service a laser printer in 10 years? None, change toner and keep running it. This is how reliable it should be.\nAsk then to simplify the design. Not all pumps need to be driven by motor, they can be electric. Pumps shouldn't have brushes, even fuckin power drills are brushless. Make it last 20 years for fuck's sake.\nWhen a hose fails that liquid spills on the motor, wires, causing potential issues. How many years does a hose last when it's subject to vibrations, high temps, pressures? Less than 20 years? Bad, find better design. That should be the mindset. Not that hosed are consumables, change every x km.\n\nI woukd rather have an electric car, know that range is 70% as when it was new, or a module of battery failed, needs to be replaced and decide whether buy new car or repair, than having random crap pop up every 3 months.",

I see hoses/gaskets/seals last 10s of thousands of hours with no failure, time and time again with very little maintenance. Ya sometimes parts break prematurely but a 50$ hose is far better than a $4000 proprietary module that can only be fixed by the manufacturer. You only hear about this stuff because ICE vehicles are the norm and abundant.\n\nFor example, I bought my wife a 2024 RAV4 gas. The most common problem of these vehicles (whether gas/hybrid/PHEV/electric) is the main infotainment/Computer glitching. It can glitch out and render the car useless just by parking in the sun for too long. You know what that part costs, no matter what the error is? $8,000. Older cars that aren't loaded with radar/lidar/tpms/trac control/blind spot sensors don't have these kinds of issues.\n\n\n>Also electronics glitches can be detected with computers and modules replaced\n\nCompletely untrue. If that was full proof then I wouldn't make so much money. Computers constantly fail/misdiagnose themselves/can't see the problem.\n\nYou're arguing with a 10 year mechanic. I've seen it all dude. I have no reason to be biased, if I had it my way I would tell everyone to go electronic and id be filthy rich, having people waiting in line to throw money at me until their stuff is fixed. \n\nAs of right now, electric vehicles are not the \"cheaper/more reliable/less maintenance over time type of vehicle in any way. Sure in the future that might change, electric will get better but it's not that great right now.",

Unburned fuel and water (a natural byproduct of combustion) can mix and form an acid that etches metal and wears away at gaskets. \n\nDepending on how good the manufacturing process was you can have an engine that loses very little oil between changes, or you can have a real oil burner. My ex-wife had a Toyota Yaris, and the owners manual claimed that oil consumption up to one quart per 400 miles was \u201cnormal\u201d. Yikes. I wouldn\u2019t expect an engine to burn anywhere near that much oil simply due to everyday use, but it\u2019s still good to check your oil at every fill-up, and top off as necessary.",

I really hope you didn't pay very much for this thing, its really on its last legs. With substantial repairs, you could probably fix it good enough to get maybe a couple years out of it, but it really is in bad shape. You are looking at thousands of dollars of repairs to get this roadworthy, and you are still going to have a very rusty vehicle. In my opinion, the money you need to spend to fix it right would be better used to get a less rusty vehicle. You could sell this thing as is, for parts, disclosing the rust, and recoup at least some money.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis is a good example of why you need to get a PRE purchase inspection done on used cars if you aren't particularly good at knowing what to check yourself.

Take off the offending wheel, put car on jackstands (do NOT work on your car while it is on the scissor jacks), and pry the backing plate away from back of the rotor, or ask to see if a shop will be willing to do that.\n\nI just got my son his first car, a 2017 pathfinder with mild rust (surface rust, but nuts were rusted well).  I had to use one of them yellow can torches and heat the nuts and then use a harbor freight air tool (and a dewalt 20v impact wrench) to get the nuts off, but I have managed to replace (dollars is part cost : second is hours it took):\nNew front control arms and sway bar linkages($120:10 hrs)\nNew Inner and outer tierods ($108:10hrs)\nNew Front struts, rear shocks and all mounting HW($200:6hrs)\nNew front bearings/hubs and dust shields ($120:9hrs)\nNew front rotors and pads, rebuild front calipers ($118:6hrs)\nNew rear rotors, pads, and new rear calipers ($170:4hrs)\nNew transmission filters, gasket, and drain procedure ($140:5hrs)\nNew spark plugs and PCV ($50:3 hrs)\n\nI was out in my driveway everyday for two whole weeks.\nThe lady who sold me the car was not from around here and her ex-husband gave her the car, and she did not have the $ to pay a mechanic to fix them.\n\nThe pathfinders are surprisingly easy to work on, and the number of hours I listed is to show you how long it took because of hand tools but mostly because of rust-siezed bolts.  But it CAN be done.\n\nMy sons car rusted weird.  Only light surface rust on the subframe,  little to no rust on body (mines a unibody), and a ton of rust on bolts, nuts, and suspensions.\n\nI had to learn how to work on my car because back in 2004 I dropped out of my PhD program (biology) and my wife also got very ill and got hospitalized.  I knew NOTHING about cars and YouTube channels didn't exist like they do now, so I had to learn by going on nissan forums and using Chilton/Haynes manual books.  Things are a bit better with a ton of youtube videos.\n\nAs others have said, it CAN be done.  I am guessing that with your financial situation, you went to the cheapest local garage.  The local garages around here are useless and for thevjob I did, they would probably be wanting ~$4000-$6000 on labor alone.\n\nI got most of parts from nissan online, becsuse Nissan had a summer sales with free shipping over this summer, and when they were still too expensive, I got my struts and shocks from ebay.\n\nI was walking into my nissan dealer parts dept (you order from online with discount and they deliver to your local dealer) almost every other day and the parts guys finally said, \"you trying to build yourself a Pathfinder?  You do know, we also sell fully built cars\".  I told him what I wrote.  On a Saturday end of the day, he insisted that his mechanic throw my Pathfinder on a lift and do a safety check of my work.\n\nThe mechanic said all work looks good, and said I saved thousands.\n\nSo...  I would go around and look for a mechanic that would be willing to tackle the job, AND shop around as you will get different labor quotes.\n\nThings like brakes, they are so easy to learn how to do.  I would go get jackstands from Harbor Freight (some may day their jackstands are shit, but there was a recall and now they should be safe), and a set of Pittsburgh brand socket wrenches in metric and box wrenches in metric, and a bunch of screwdrivers and pliers (they didn't have HF around here in '07, my biggest cost was cost of tools).\n\nYou can also look for a shop that will remove rusted nuts and bolts and replace them with new ones (google nissanpartsonline), so you can drive it back home, and then use hand tools to do you brake jobs.  You still pay them for hourly labor of temoving the rusted bolts and buts, but at leadt you will save labor on rwdt of the work and parts cost.\n\nAutozone does free rental of specialty tools.  You do have to put down 100% deposit which you get back when you return them.\n\nI rented bearing puller slide hammer which made the rusted bearing come out with four taps.\n\n\nAlso, around here, buying parts and bringing it to a local mechanic isn't too much cheaper as they often uncharged on labor to make up for not being able to sell you their parts for profit.",

As long as the frame is solid under the rust, you can scrape off the scale and paint over it with POR-15.  For the replaceable components, it depends on your toolbox and skillset.\n\nThe rust makes everything 10x harder than it should be. Penetrant (Kroil, Mouse Milk, or PB Blaster), heat with a torch or induction heater. Be prepared to have to use a set of bolt extractor sockets, vice grips + hammer (5lb sledge at a minimum), a Sawall, a nut splitter, or any combination thereof to remove the nuts askills etc. For the love of God, don't reuse any of that rusted out hardware unless you clean *all* of the rust off of it, inspect it, and treat it with a corrosion preventative.\n\nFor example, it took me about 4 to 6 hours to *remove* my rack & pinion, power steering pump, outer tie rod ends, and all the associated pressure lines because of dealing with the rust. It involved soaking with penetrant every day after work for a week before I started, and a combination of regular sockets + ratchet, electric ratchet, impact gun and impact sockets, vice grips + hammer, ratcheting wrenches, and harsh language.",

Your suspension components. The main. Stuff first and go from there. I know it really doesn't matter whether you are a man or a woman, but I am a female. I never worked on a car other than detailing a day in my life. I taught myself how to do brake all around rotors inner and outer tie rods, out a new front end on my Elantra GT after being nailed with a deer. I did my own alternator, timing belts, and read shocks, struts, oil, and tranny fluid changes regularly in the last 3 years because it pained me to pay so much money for parts theb some fool to put them on for ne when I did everything myself and am fine. Saved me and my partner 1000s of dollars. And probably from being ripped off, too. Idk how much you know about cars, but I knew enough to YouTube research and give it an honest shot. Ran into shit like learning how to drill put rotor screws that won't come out or are stripped. I was defeated the 1st time. But I looked up DIY how to every road block I hit. Now I'm doing it in no time. This weekend, I dropped my whole steering shaft to open up my power steering to replace the bushing rubber thingy that's in there. $5 part. It is like 3 or 400 on labor if Someone doesn' try too rip me off.  You can do some of it for sure. Ypu have a bunch of rust and some component that def need replacing so you'll need some help but you can def do some of that shit yourself. If I can anybody can.",

If you have any intentions on driving this thing for a couple of years, get it undercoated, perhaps spray a bunch of rust converter on it first to get that process to stop.  Some formulas do both.  A different mechanic might work on it, but ultimately, if you want to save the underneath from rotting out in a couple of years, undercoating is really a no-brainer, but you are nearing the point of being too late.  You can do it yourself even, I tend to use woolwax with an airless paint sprayer but it makes the entire underneath a sticky mess for a while.  It will at the very least help stop the existing rust.  I do see some flaking metal in the back but the frame looks solid.\n\nWho TF cares about A/C lines.  If they break, you don't have A/c.  nothing safety wise is associated with this.\n\nPower steering could be an issue but again, I've driven vehicles without it.  Some older vehicles don't even have power steering, so yeah.  \n\nOn the cheap side of things, bar and chain oil could neutralize some of that rust.  I've made homemade formulations of grease, bar and chain, and used motor oil, and it seems to work okay.",

I'm voting with the northern guys here. \n\nAlso, the only backing plate I can think of is protecting the brake rotor from the inside, if it is rubbing and making noise, it may have taken a rock or something and need to be bent back out away from the rotor.

I agree with these others that you CAN expect labor times to be inflated because everything is going to be more of a PITA, but there is no reason anything on there can't be replaced and no reason that it can't be driven so long as you replace anything that ACTUALLY needs replaced, as it fails. \n\nOne thing I like to do on these kinds of vehicles is intensely pressure wash the undercarriage to remove all loose rust, dirt, salt and other contaminants, and then spray the entire undercarriage with a good rust treatment like POR-15 rust remover, Rust cure formula 3000 or a similar rust remover/converter product.\n\nThat will get you by, but if you can get it cleaned up halfway decent, it might also not be a bad idea once you do to apply some actual POR-15 rust preventative coating that you brush on to all areas where it is reasonably safe to do so. You don't want to spray things that shouldn't have coatings on them like axle shaft boots, rubber lines, etc. \n\nBut there is no reason an actual, experienced and knowledgeable mechanic would refuse to work on this. Heck that guy, find somebody else.",

Even if the drill was dull or they were spooked as many suggested, why is the hole so dirty? It should be fresh Shiney metal. Also if you zoom In, there is a + stamped into it. Doesn't look like a philipps though. Definitely doeesnt look like a drill bit. I think you caught road debris, and the wet around it and dirty hole are from a very small gas leak you now have. Also there is a second mark to the right, not as deep but similar size. \n\nI would also say you have had an oil leak for quite a while.",

I would check all of the vacuum routing and the actuators themselves.  I suspect that it is the actuator itself. You can easily test this by swapping them.  If the left one goes down slower after you swap them, then it is the actuator. They are available.  However, even with everything working correctly, sometimes the headlights do not go up and down in unison.  They do make an aftermarket electrical actuator system that would make everything work as you want it.",

Bad fuel gauges aren't uncommon, and a typical way of dealing with it is to just make sure you fill up the tank every 200 miles or so.  Reset the trip odometer each time you fill up.\n\nThe actual problem is probably with the gauge itself, not the level sensor or any control module.  I don't know about this car specifically, but unfortunately on most cars it's a major pain in the butt to take out the dashboard to service the instrument cluster.  So unless one of the other actually helpful suggestions (disconnect the battery, try flipping it around with a paper clip, etc.) works, I'd suggest just getting used to it.",

How far you can personally go on a tank of gas depends on your car and your driving style and your city driving vs highway driving so that's entirely up to your own needs. Just drive 200 miles and refuel and see how much fuel that took and extrapolate from there.\n\n...or fix it. But definitely don't just get scared of driving. The fuel will arrive in your engine.",

After the replacement, the brakes didn't feel any better than my old worn out pads and they squeak a lot when the tires spin (not when I apply the brakes) and I noticed this part was rubbing against metal where the noise was coming from. How many issues could there be going on here with the squeaking and brakes not working any better? They work fine but I was expecting a huge difference in stopping power with new brake pads. ",

Show them the torx bit. I am sure the tech is going to say he left it there by accident. They will want to put your car on the rack and pull the wheel to check the damage. If you had brakes done on just one end. Ask to have them check both sides to be sure everything is OK. Or all 4 if you had brakes all around. Tell them you won't feel safe until everything is looked at. The damage on the wheel. I would ask them to have the wheel replaced. A used wheel in like condition would be sufficient. A new wheel is not necessary. I have dealt with this very same situation in my years. They may say the damage is superficial. Which it is not that bad. But it did not go in there that way.

Be polite but absolutely firm on the fact that you would like the brakes redone and your wheel replaced. DO NOT let them try to fix the wheel or say they can send it off and get fixed. That bit looks like it did some significant damage and i wouldn't completely trust it anymore. I'm not saying it will break tomorrow but overtime with a hard enough jolt it could break that rim or crack it then you would be responsible for getting a new one. If they do nothing or do not fully remedy it, do not argue with them, just leave and contact an attorney. After the brakes are redone however i would have someone you know or another shop check their work to make sure everything was fixed properly. Whoever worked on your vehicle does not seem to know what they are doing.",

I appreciate the well written and good faith response)\n\n\n)1 I've heard this solution before, but that still involves a force made of fallible people, which is what op was objecting to. \n\n2) while I get what your going for, it unfortunately wouldn't work for a number of reasons in the US. \n\n>Unarmed traffic enforcement\n\nMakes sense at first, why does someone writing tickets need a bullet proof vest and a gun? The reason is that traffic stops involving individuals with outstanding warrants will result in the need to arrest them. If your going to arrest somebody wanted for murder, assault, ECT, it's a good idea to have a vest and gun. They don't always go willingly. \n\n>trained professionals for hostile situations (armed robbery, etc),\n\nThat currently exists as swat/HRT\n\n\n>trained psychologists for domestic disputes,\n\nNo no no no, fuck no. Out of any type of call, domestic disputes are the most likely to result in officer fatalities. They're often extremely tense where multiple parties have quick and easy access to their personal firearms. There's a reason that cops NEVER show up to a domestic dispute alone. Psychologists and social workers are sometimes brought along but sending them in alone is setting them up to die. \n\n\n>It stops the whole \"one untrained man doing 50 difficult jobs\" scenario.\n\n1) there's usually some training lol\n\n2) the problem is when individual needs to be able to respond to multiple situations because those situations can evolve in front of you. It can go from a domestic dispute with a parent and kid, to a murder and barricaded suspect real fast. \n\n>When you realize what people are actually fighting for, you realize we truly want what's best for cops.\n\nI think most people want the best system we can get, it's just we disagree how to get there. Thus is democracy. \n\n>You don't need a gun or a bullet proof vest for 99 percent of the jobs a cop does, but you do usually need specific training in a wide variety of fields.\n\nId agree with that statement, the problem is it's really hard to know which call is going to need a gun and a vest. Does the homeless dude just need a snack and a ride to the shelter? Or is he about to attack you because of a mental health episode? You need the ability to respond to both, or the unarmed social worker that got sent out might get shanked.",

You can get home and around potentially forever on 4 out of 5 although i dont reccomend it but i've seen it dozens if not hundreds of times and have done it myself. it needs fixing though, every day driving you'll be fine, have a little oopsie with a curb you might have consequences.   \n2. you cant just drill it out its a lug bolt and the last person that put it in cross threaded it. if it wasnt cross threaded once the head broke you could spin it out and just replace the bolt.   \n3. the only way to fix it right is to replace the hub, you cant (generally) tap a hub to the next size and make no mistake these are threaded hubs.  \n4. whoever INSTALLED it is responsible not the guy that broke it off (unless they are the same shop/person)   \n5. the rest of the lug bolts are most likely stretched, they're not cheap (not terribly expensive either but often overlooked) but they should be replaced.   \n\n\ni know there are almost a million certified master mechanics here so let the downvoting commence!",

Too much of a chance for a liability lawsuit if shit goes sideways while you're driving. You don't have to replace the hub assembly right off the bat. First, you try drilling the old lug bolt out, and then using a thread chaser kit,  you can clean out the threads. It's hard and time-consuming work, but it usually does the trick. Had to do this myself many times on the job. But, occasionally, things go wrong. That's  when the hub and possibly your rotor would need to be replaced.",

Then try again immediately while the hub is still hot. I don\u2019t know the physics of it, but my assumption is that it came out easier due to the heat. Also I assume the hole bored through the centre allowed the metal to twist/compress a little so it was no longer as tight when previously attempted. (I did not use an impact. I used a breaker bar because I was scared that my weld would break off. (mind you the first time the weld did not hold, but the second time long behold it came out. Almost too easily in fact.\n\nEdit: the biggest complication I see here is that yours broke off pretty close to the hub, and I am not sure if you will be able to weld it without welding the threaded part to the hub. Worst case you could also drill a hole into the centre of the bolt head to allow a weldable area, although may not be as strong considering it would be in the center.",

It turned into one of those stories about time passing much faster than you expect it to when \"You'll get around to it\". \n\nAnyway, a few months wentby and I needed to get the wheel off. Lo and behold, somehow despite installing them by hand and torqueing them with a torque wrench, two of the lugnuts had actually seized completely. I got them off, but the lugs and lugnuts were ruined in the process.\n\n  \nMoral of my story: I could have had a lug and lugnut replace for free, it ended up costing me a pain in the ass wheel removal and two extra lugnuts because I decided to wait around. And yes, this is anecdotal evidence. I don't care, I'd pretty much only run 4 to get me home or to a shop.",

For a shop, it's not a very hard job and even tho it's not the fault of the person who removed it. They should accept responsibility for it and replace it, as it's not that hard. If they didn't want to mess with it, they could've denied doing the work once they realized it wasn't gonna come off. But they used 3 different methods of removal, at that point they were completely aware that it was going to break off.\n\nEdit: ran my mouth without realizing these aren't lug studs, but lug bolts.

Because you can change these out easily compared to wheel studs. It enough of a safety that it\u2019s a rule in its origin.\n\nI tell you my experience as a dealer tech. I was super keen and learned lots. I became their head guy before I was a journeymen. I felt like I have it (Vw at least) all figured out until I went to a reputable independent shop and realized how wrong I was. I didn\u2019t know shit beside special tools, software updates, recalls and guided fault  finding on dealer scan tools. Now, 20 years later I notice this trend in the trade. The only techs that stayed behind at the dealer weren\u2019t good enough or brave enough to leave their comfy lazy situation at the dealer. It was the bums that stayed. I go back to say hi and they all are complaining about pay and diagnosis jobs they can\u2019t figure out. Bitching about who got to do what PDI. Maybe your market is different for you but there is a clear distinction around these parts. Dealer tech stay because then need someone to hold their hand. Flat rate is the devil and does not incentivize tech to do a proper job. Dealer tech count minutes of every hour. Small shops owners  just need you to fix it right the first time. Facts.",

There a list of factors to consider here but maybe this will be to nuanced to consider on a wheel rotation or whatever.\n\nWhat I was taught was:\nWhen a bolt is lubricated - less torque is required to achieve bolt axial load or tension. Reduction of torques for lubricated vs. dry bolts must be considered because Higher torque loads shorten the service length of fasteners. \n\nMaybe what the op is experiencing?",

If the latter, you may need new springs, and whether that's a DIY job or not depends a lot on whether you have the tools and what your confidence level is on working with struts.  I say this because those spring spacers may be compensating for springs that are sagging without them.  I guess if you remove them you will find out.\n\nIf you end up replacing springs you will likely want new bump stops, upper mounts, etc. etc. etc. as well, if those are the original struts you might want to get new struts while you're in there.  Or, if this is a beater car/you don't see yourself keeping it long term, you could buy a set of preassembled \"quick struts\" which come with new springs and all the hardware, making it an easy DIY job again.\n\nPersonally I don't use quick struts because I tend to drive sportier cars, so I want to pick my struts and springs (or reuse the originals) but for a high mileage Impala, quick struts can be a good option to just keep it safe and legal for another 4-5 years.",

Also a close individual and car ran fine for a while. I bought a scanner to check out the codes and stuff. After a couple drives the computer finally figured out there was a misfire in cylinder 3 (after cleared these misfires need some drive cycles to show up, hence why only the EVAP showed up at first).\n\nMy EX-mechanic at the time just told me to ignore it. (He knew something bad was happening and didn't want to do work, the guy just wanted to do easy jobs). Second red flag.\n\nThe car lasted 2 years until the engine got a misfire in all the cylinders and would no longer stay on, went to another more reputable mechanic, rebuild needed. Turns out there was no compression in Cylinder 3 and driving like this for over a year made things worse.\n\nOne has to choose better the people you trust.",

Less than 10k miles later I had to dump 2k into a new head gasket! oil was dripping into a cylinder from what appeared to be scratches on the head that looked like they came that way from the factory(?) My mechanic buffed out the scratches and replaced the head gasket, all has been well for a few thousand miles so far...\n\nThe problem manifested as a cylinder misfire. (It also all of a sudden drank up all the oil a few days before the code came up and put the car into limp mode).",

Replaced every part that had sensor obd2 errors and got rid of a slew of codes. Come to find out after rebuilding the distributor over 25 times to make the ignition perfect and replacing plugs, wires, caps and all I was chasing a bigger issue. \n\nCome to find out I bought a compression tester and found out that clyinder one exhuast valve was bent and ruined prior to testing. 25 Psi in the 1st cylinder, and about 135 or so on the others. It was a big lesson to me that even if your scanning codes and have a watchful eye on what all the auto pranskters like to scam and rig you can still be had on a vehicle purchase because you didnt preform a simplistic compression test on the engine before you bought it. Needless to say I removed the cylinder head and had it machined and the shop replaced the valve and valve seals since I dont have valve replacement tools. \n\nBut lesson learned like my grandfather told me to do first was the compression test! >_< \nBut yeah the year of OP's vehicle seems a bit too new for it to be something any more serious than an Ignition tune up or cam sensors. Maybe a new battery. May be worth keeping said vehicle. But the year of it is too new tbh for any major issues as long as people werent doggin the transmission and slappin the gas driftin.",

I.e., \"I expected the crank to be at this position at exactly this time, but it is a little behind, that last cylinder must have misfired and failed to accelerate the crankshaft properly\". Every cylinder firing accelerates the crankshaft until the next one does the same, it just happens thousands of times a minute, and you generally can't physically detect it except by very precise measurements. As engines get older and wear down, numerous factors can contribute to small, imperceptible differences in how much crankshaft acceleration each cylinder provides. But the vehicle may be struggling to understand that that's normal, and incorrectly concluding there's a misfire. That's what the aforementioned procedure does: tells the car, \"Hey, FYI this slight variance is normal\". \n\nI only say all of this BECAUSE it's 1 and 6, which fire in the same crank position on your engine. 2-8, 3-5, and 4-7 are other suspect combos. Of course, you might very well be actually misfiring, but common factors always warrant some investigation into other possible explanations. \n\nEdit: All of this said, start with the battery. A bad battery can manifest as all kinds of strange phantom problems.",

I\u2019m going to disagree with the majority of these comments and say that it WILL cause your door to come out of alignment. However, with that being said, it would be so negligible that 99% of people would never know. The clearances on panel gaps are usually at spec between 6-7mm. At the factory, we can fine tune these clearances by putting directional weight on the striker plates. By applying weight with a leverage device we can adjust +-4mm. This isn\u2019t very noticeable at all, it took me hundreds of vehicles to see the difference. I would buy one of these if in need. However, you can\u2019t say without certainty that it will have \u201cno effect\u201d on the striker tolerances.",

Even when maintained properly, they frequently fail right around 100-120k miles, generally resulting in catastrophic engine failure.\n\nI am extremely surprised that this engine has survived this long with such poor maintenance, and I can guarantee that the timing system is on its last legs. It **will** fail, and probably in the not so distant future. \n\nProactive replacement wouldn't be economical, as the required parts are quite expensive and the engine has to be pulled due to the complex timing system (three chains and the passenger side camshaft is driven from a rear mounted chain). Plus, you'd still be left with a sludged up pile of garbage.\n\nIf you insist on keeping it, start looking for a replacement engine ASAP, preferably from a 2004 or newer vehicle, as it will have the updated timing components.",

Trans fluid is just 20wt oil with a lot of detergents and additives in it to keep things clean and low friction, allow it to idle for a bit and then change the oil again, swap another quart again. Change the filter every time you change the oil, use a GOOD filter. The second time, drive it for a bit, get it up to temp and go around town if you feel like it, if you see the oil light come on and/or the pressure gauge drop , stop, the filter is likely plugged. You\u2019ll need to change the filter and oil right then and there, or have it towed. Repeat until oil comes out normal looking, afterwards, remove the valve covers and see what you\u2019ve got. If most of the crazy buildup is gone, and it runs good, you have a fighting chance that the motor isn\u2019t permanently damaged in a way that will cause any more harm.\n\nHowever, it could just blow up nearly immediately, though it\u2019s not that common if it\u2019s running fine. \n\nHope you make it out okay, sorry to see this happened to you.",

Then after several quick ~2k miles or less oil changes bring it up to 30 or 40w full synthetic and keep running short interval changes till the sludge is cleaned out as good as its gonna get.

The detergents and dispersants in a high quality synthetic diesel oil will work on breaking down the sludge as you drive it. If you really care and want to try to bring this back, change the oil filter every 500 miles with the cheapest one you can find. Lubricate the seal and put it on hand tight. Every 4th time you replace the filter, so every 2k miles, change the oil as well. A regimen like this should help.",

Some of them have lasted over half a million miles and every day there are people wishing they had one or hadn't sold the one they did have. Worst case if you don't want it anymore go to the sport trac forums on here or Facebook and someone else will save the engine and keep driving her. The only real issues these trucks have with proper maintenance is the thermostat housing needs to be changed from plastic to aluminum, the timing chain tensioners might fail eventually, and the body mounts will need to be replaced after 20 years if they still exist at all. I wish you the best of luck! (Also for a pickup truck, the 02 sport trac probably has the best mpg out of all the other years, and for current trucks it's not bad either)",

I think I ran the treatment twice, second time about a month later. I also made sure to remove the oil pan about 5-6 times to clean the oil pickup.

Maybe even jamming a valve, but that'd tell you the engine is done for you lol. If its not outright missing you could either go the way I stated and do it slow and steady or you could outright throw a quart of ATF in it and be agressive. I fucked up once and topped my 97 camry off with about a half a quart of atf and sent it. Sitting at 315k miles now on it as a daily currently so the atf itself isnt gonna be the killer, it'll be how fast and where that sludge goes that'll do it",

The ones in ATF are designed to remove the deposits, more than prevent them. The ones in standard engine oil are designed to prevent it, and are not as good at dissolving it. There\u2019s a good reason for that as well; the engine oil has to remain at a specific viscosity in order for it to maintain fluid bearing surfaces, if you load it up with contaminants, you will find very quickly it will not be able to do that job very well. If you add a quart of transmission fluid, sure, it doesn\u2019t have the same amount of detergents, but it\u2019s got different detergents that do a very good job of liquifying sludge.\n\nIt\u2019s like using a tide pod vs a cap full of dollar tree detergent, one may be smaller in quantity, but is much stronger for the purpose than the other. \n\nWe actually studied this in school when I went for automotive engineering, the reason manufacturers put out warnings against doing this kind of thing is because you can cause damage really fast if the motor is really bad like this one is, due to the debris rapidly contaminating the oil. Nobody wants liability for that so they put out tons of information like this to combat the use.",

My only worry with getting the crap out quick is how easily it'll be to dislodge something large hidden below all the sludge. I'm assuming the miles weren't crazy high even though the maintenance schedule obviously sucked ass. You in a hurry to see if it's gonna be a daily? I've used marvel mystery oil, if you have hydraulic lifters it helps shut the tapping up. Never really noticed a difference in sludge removal though. You might better off letting it idle up to temp and slowly mixing a can of seafoam or similiar cleaner straight into the crank case at the rate it says on the can and letting it idle and do drain and fills that way. Could probably do the same thing with diesel so long as you dont blend enough in that you thin the oil so much it can lube properly and starts eating bearings and scuffing the cylinders.\n\nEdit: If you go the marvel route just go for the dirt cheap full synthetic walmart brand motor oil. It's still above SAE spec and perfect for something like this where you're gonna be grabbing oil in bulk. Just grab the dirt cheap supertech filters too. This shit is so sluged there isnt any point in better filters, it'll be grabbing plenty for awhile lol.",

But, so long as it has that SAE stamp on it then it's good to go. My daily is a 98 Camry with 315k on it that I bought 6 years ago with exactly 200k on it. It's used Supertech all the way to Mobil 1 through multiple stretches while I tinkered with oil weights and brands differently blend ratios to combat the amount of blow-by you get on an engine this broke in lol. During my low icome phase a few years ago, it ran nothing but Supertech for 2 years and still is here today. And since you aren't in a hurry to get it running, then the slowest path will be in your best interest as far as trying to save it. I am a little confused on why it started running so much differently after the mechanics though. One oil change alone shouldn't have caused enough movement with the sludge off the rip.

Headgasket maybe, but it'd be god awful to drive to the point that you feel like you're driving a 2 cylinder with all the misfires in-between lol. I'd check the plugs, and take the breather tube to the throttle body and see how bad it is around the throttle plate and how worn the plugs are. Then, if those are good, start checking vacuum lines for clogs or tears. If the exhaust is excessively steamy and so hot that it's going to scald you then it may be a headgasket, but that's not a surefire way to know. A n exhaust leak tester that attaches to the radiator will let you know, or a leak down test at a shop will as well. I dont have this Haynes manual on hand, or I could send you photos page by page. But autozone or advanced auto generally have the books on this model, if not, ebay is your friend. They want too much for these things brand new outside of a parts store.",

I'm not a bad or reckless driver. I'm honestly super cautious because one of the times these broke I was on the freeay and I've been paranoid and extra cautious ever since. Yet somehow I'm replacing one of them on average every year. What could be the cause? I do live in southeast Michigan which is known for having some bad roads but I usually drove on roads filled with potholes so I don't think that's it. I do drive about 60 miles each day to work and back so maybe the high mileage has something to do with it but i feel like this has happened more than it should. I'm just tired of having to get this same repair done and also feeling nervous that it's gonna break any time I drive.",

It should be all shiny and smooth like it has been living in a tightly machined socket with a film of grease to reduce friction. Clearly it has been compromised and corroded. That corrosion slowly wears the ball down making it smaller, until it\u2019s small enough to pop from the socket (outside of this picture frame to the left still attached to the steering knuckle) and the Ka-chow you\u2019re getting towed.\n\nYou can shop for better parts. Preferably lower ball joints that have a grease fitting so you can periodically pump fresh grease in and push out any contaminants.\n\nAdditionally, try harder to avoid potholes. That\u2019s a tall order in Michigan, but those repeated jolts and shocks from dropping into and popping out of potholes does a lot of wear and tear on ball joints.\n\nAnother preventative would be periodic inspections. If you lift the car off its wheels you can test the ball joints and hub bearings for play that would be an indication of wear long before they fail and strand you.",

Unlikely related to aggressive driving or northern winter.\n\nThe lower ball joint does NOT get removed with the lower control arm on 08-12 accords. They are pressed into the steering knuckle from the inside of it. Replacing it is a big pain that requires lots of work and specialized ball joint press kit. If you did not explicitly state this to your mechanic and pay big money, that lower ball joint would NOT get done no matter how many times you replace the lower control arm. No sane mechanic would do this lower ball joint job for free.\n\nTo answer your question why this happens: this is a double wishbone suspension, so the lower ball joint is a loaded ball joint. It constantly loads the entire weight of the car on that wheel. Being a double wishbone, steering is also accomplished by this ball joint spinning in its socket. When its rubber boot is intact and it is greased well, it is designed to practically go forever without fail. I've seen 150k, 200k mile accords with lower ball joints tight as new. That is PROVIDED the rubber boot did not get damaged. The moment that rubber boot gets damaged, water and dirt gets in, grease leaks out and dries, and the ball joint start going metal to metal. It constantly spins under the weight of the entire car every time you steer, and it wears itself out very fast. Once it wears it self enough to pop loose from the socket, this happens. As you can see in the picture, your ball head is completely dry and heavily worn.\n\nIn summary, in ANY double wishbone vehicles, keep that lower ball joint boot intact! This not happening depends almost entirely on if you tore that boot from maybe some random road debris.\n\nThis can be prevented via annual inspection of the lower ball joint. Inspection procedure would include inspecting the boot for tears and leaks and using a pry bar to pry around the ball joint for clunk. If your mechanic does this yearly then the issue would have been caught.",

The joint is still fastened to the stub axle/hub.\n\nI see a lot of rust around the joint. \nI've only ever seen this on cars that haven't been maintained. The joint usually creaks loudly when turning the steering and on suspension compression when it's like this.\n\nThat joint is DRY. There is no lubricant in it. No GREASE. \n\nIt's torn out from the press fit into the hub. It's pressed in with a special tool, then secured to the control arm with a lock nut. Either a Nyloc nut, castle nut and split pin or a \"peaned\" metal lock nut.\n\nEither the joint was damaged when fitted by being BASHED in with a hammer and all the grease leaked out and road spray got to it. \n\n(Maybe the roads in your region get salted in winter which would greatly exasibate  the wear factor from having no lubricant)\n\n Or, the joint was a greaseable type, which I doubt, but once again it's hard to tell from the picture, and it wasn't pumped full of grease after being fitted.\n\nOr, the ball joint's rubber sealing boot was damaged at some point by debris on the road  which allowed it to dry out.\n\nRegardless. It's the brown rust stains on the control arm and the joint TEARING OUT that tells the story.\n\nIs this Vehicle a Ford?  Or ford affiliated company such as Mazda?\n\nThis type suspension configuration is prone to this if there's a lack of maintenance and regular inspection a year apart at the absolute maximum. The ball joint on this type of set up is bearing all the vehicle weight for that corner. The top ball joint is not. This is a typical ford set up. \n\nEven getting an oil and filter change WITH a safety check once a year can save your life and possibly someone else's.\n\nAny mechanic doing a minor service should inform you of this extremely important safety issue. \n\nIf you're doing it yourself just a visual inspection, and with the car jacked up UNDER THE BODY and the wheel off the ground to \"unload\" the suspension on this set up....place your hands top and bottom of the wheel and alternatively pull and push with force to try and tilt the wheel back and forth to check for ball joint wear. Also, get a metal bar around a metre long, like a tyre lever, and place it on the ground under the tyre and lever the wheel up and down to check for movement.\n\nWe usually have an apprentice or another mechanic in the Shop to do this while the mechanic who's doing the inspection watches for movement.",

                    "body": "This KEEPS happening? As in, you've had more than one ball joint separation like that before? Buddy, that ain't normal, Michigan roads or not (I grew up in NW Ohio and my dad was born and raised in Detroit, so I'm familiar). I worked as an equipment mechanic out at a cattle ranch in Nevada for 5 years that had 14 miles of rutted out, heavily washboarded dirt roads leading in and out of it. I hammered the living piss out of my Silverado going 50-70mph over that shit like it was a trophy truck down in Baja, and never had a ball joint failure like what you're showing here. A couple of suggestions:\n\n1. Buy OEM quality parts, or go to a shop that does. Cheap stuff will increase the likelihood of failure tenfold, and suspension components are not where you want to try and save money (ESPECIALLY ball joints, which can cause you to lose control and crash if they fail). Pony up the dough for good parts.\n\n\n2. Learn how to listen to your vehicle's suspension when you go over speed bumps, potholes, etc. Parts in good shape should have no play in them, and should make virtually no noise when going over bumps. There's no way your suspension wasn't rattling and banging like hell before this happened if you're driving to the point that the ball joint is physically separating from the LCA like that. Or, giving you the benefit of the doubt, maybe there was no noise - but the quality of the ball joint was so bad that it just said \"see ya!\" and snapped in half without any warning signs. Doubtful, but if that was the case, see #1 above. \n\nGood luck. I hope this doesn't keep happening.\n\nEDIT: Looking at the photo again, it appears that the entire ball joint got pulled through your hub. Some ball joints bolt in, some are press fit, some use a c-clip to retain them in the hub, etc. I'm not sure what kind your vehicle uses, but it's possible that it wasn't installed correctly the last time it was replaced (missing c-clip, for example), or your hub might be shot as well from the previous failures. The bore that the ball joint fits into could be worn out of spec, allowing the whole thing to slide through over time. I'd have a reputable shop check over your front suspension very, very carefully.",

The failure shown in the picture is a failure of the left front lower ball joint -- not the lower control arm.  Lower control arms are typically replaced due to cracked rubber bushings.  Ball joints are typically replaced due to play or complete separation of the ball and socket joint (like as shown in the picture).  It's important to understand that it is common for cheap aftermarket ball joints and lower control arm bushings to fail in under one year.  I saw it all the time when I worked as a mechanic.  Do not buy the cheapest aftermarket part.  Best to pay a little bit more for parts.  Also, some ball joints do not come pre-lubed.  The mechanic has to manually lube the joint through the zerk fitting (if it has one) after installation.  Also, the ball joints that have a zerk fitting are supposed to be lubed regularly (but not overfilled).",

With high mileage and frequent exposure to bad road conditions, it\u2019s likely accelerating wear. I\u2019d recommend visiting a reliable [auto repair shop](https://matrixautorepair.com/) or a trusted mechanic for a thorough suspension inspection to identify any underlying problems, check the alignment, and ensure you're using quality replacement parts.\n\n4o mini",

If you want this car for ever, replace whole front suspension, also check you power steering cooling hoses (small metal tubes behind right wheel), they rust like crazy, and before you know, you have to fill it up every 1-2hrs or worse, change whole power steering mechanism. If you got some questions about that car I can say, I am a whole walking encyclopedia about 2003-2006 Accord's \ud83d\ude01",

That's why the tech/ service writer duo should always approach a repair in stages and inform the customer in phases appropriate to the repair. Any type of internal rattle/ tapping noise should have your:\n1) initial diag charge and/or tear down estimate(s)\nThen\n2) repair cost estimate(s)\nThen \n3) do the repair.\nAt each 'then', there should be a pause as well as a caution communicated to the customer for possible outcomes that could result in further costs as well as what to expect if you as the customer decline further work. Like, if I pull this all apart, I might not be able to put it back together or it wouldn't make sense to put it back together. \nAll in all, this situation should not have happened. It was poor communication on the shop's behalf. If you didn't approve the cost of the additional repairs, you should not be the one paying for it.

It's like 6 bolts and you can look at the valve train and you don't need to do anything else to remove it. So easy to check, idk what problem other than bend valves you could have had that wasn't visible till the valve cover was removed. \n\nAnyway, if Canada is the same, you can only be charged for the ORIGINAL QUOTED job. Even if the garage has put on \"extra parts\" or done more work. You aren't required to pay it, and it's there fault for not getting a Confirmation, not a status text with you saying \"Ok, yes I accept+$1300 of parts and labor.\" Since that didn't occur, you can pay them the original quote and fuck off, and if they complain about the \"extra parts\" teach them the valuable lesson that until confirmation of an extra +1k of work that in the future they get written confirmation to the \"new\" quote before doing free work for you. \n\nAlso if you see this can you say exactly what the shop said was wrong with it for a bill of 7k+ especially what would warrant +$1300 AFTER the valve cover was only off. \n\nThanks, and don't pay for the work you don't owe!",

I would try and negotiate the price, but it is very possible that the additional work was required to perform the repair correctly.

If you specifically told them to only do what was estimated and nothing else, then the shop is liable.

A little bit of fluff is acceptable, like up to $50 or so to cover a forgotten gasket or a few broken bolts or shop supplies, but that should be expected and is the point of giving you an estimate for your approval for a repair. An extra $1300 on the other hand, that's a repair that requires approval. Them not telling you what it was makes me think they broke something and passing the cost on to you rather than internalling it like they should have. Whatever the case, you did not approve the repair, so I would take it up with management. Just because it was required to complete the repair you went in for doesn't mean it doesn't also require approval.",

                    "body": "As a long standing Master ASE Certified Technjcian I\u2019ll state my honest opinion-\nNo engine repair is cut and dry. Nearly all repair facilities have it specifically written on their estimates that the written work is a best case scenario because of this. It is often the case something major can be noted immediately with another issue hiding in the background only noticeable when original repair is in progress. \nYes, some places are shady just like any other industry- and will find unnecessary \u201crepairs\u201d needed. But at least in my personal experience this is rarely the case. Contrary to popular belief- nearly all mechanics have a pretty high level of integrity, and are very proud of their ability. It\u2019s a pretty hard kick to the nether regions when we miss something we\u2019re tasked with repairing. Nonetheless it happens. It\u2019s not illegal, although seems a little unprofessional sending a text rather than a phone call to inform you of the situation. But then again- this is the world we live in where sending a short text is more \u201cconvenient\u201d. \nMy best advice is to ask what the repair was, why it was necessary, and have a better understanding. Ask the person who worked on it who has years of training and experience, rather than the writer who knows how to use a computer and can\u2019t turn a wrench to save his life, nor saw first hand what the problem was.\nYou\u2019ll get the correct answer, and believe it or not- 90% of mechanics/technicians will gladly answer any question you have. What was seen, what was tested, what the components do, how we drew our conclusion, etc. etc.  This is what we do all day, every day. If we\u2019re any good at it- we LOVE to show off our skill set. It\u2019s those specific moments where we feel god-like and our value and knowledge are on display. \nIllegal? No. Immoral NOT to inform you? Absolutely. \nBut in this case they did. Keep in mind auto repair is much different than a cut and dry purchase of an object due to variables. It\u2019s sucks something fierce paying for it, but it certainly beats the alternative of taking the Nike Express.",

Though you are still on the hook  for the labor it took for them to get to that point. As an ex mechanic I had to take my car into a shop to get it repaired at the shop I left when I changed careers. I had replaced a wheel bearing twice and it failed quickly after (even with warranty) it was a press in bearing so uber costs added up going to machine shop to drop off and back and go do it again. I strictly went to the shop for my typical  oil change (cheaper to pay them than do it at my apartment and easier cleaner and less fuss with my community) and told him if it's less than X$ don't call me get it done, that's the kind of person I am tho, also brought them a pack of Gatorade lol",

I'm a dealership mechanic and can tell you right now you did the right thing by standing up to the parts manager's bullshit claim. He doesn't know what he's talking about, as his department (parts department) operates differently from the service department, even if under the same company/dealership. In summary, The parts department's job is to manage and make profit off of parts they sell. The service department manages the services, maintenance and repairs of vehicles coming in, and profitting off of that. The only time our departments intercept is when we (mechanics) request for parts for our car services, and a couple of other smaller things. So I can tell you right now, never go to the parts manager. Ever. For your vehicle service. Even if he is the only manager. Wait until the service manager comes in. Parts manager has nothing to do with the service department unless under specific circumstances.\n\n(Sorry for the lengthy comment)\n\nNow the next thing. If a mechanic finds a deeper issue during their repair on your vehicle, they must immediately stop and report to their next chain of command, who is typically the shop foreman, and sometimes even the service manager.\n\nAt this point, we mechanics CANNOT continue working on your vehicle until we get an approval from the customer to go ahead with repairing the new issue. We can't just go on saying \"oh we found this issue, we need to order the part right now and bill the customer\". That's not how it works. Mechanics don't call the shots. It's the shop foremen and the service managers that call the shots. We are just labourers.\n\nThe foreman/service manager MUST inform the customer first of the issue, then order a service writer (front desk person) to write up a quote, present it to the customer, then ask if you approve or disapprove of the repair and its estimated cost.\n\nIf you approve, then great! We (mechanics) will be informed to go ahead and order the part, fix it, etc.\n\nIf you disapprove, the service manager will tell the foreman, who will then tell us (mechanics) to leave that issue alone and just fix whatever the customer has originally approved. And then you can have your vehicle back, along with a copy of the quote you disapproved. And our service manager will also have a copy of that document with your signature.\n\nYou can even request to have them physically show you the issue. They can take you into the shop and the mechanic can show you what he found. Personally I am always more than happy to educate customers and elevate their understanding on car mechanics.\n\nUnfortunately, if that is how that specific dealership works, I am so sorry you are dealing with that. I would advise you to stay away from that type of business. They are the kind of businesses that will use any dirty tricks to grab your money.\n\nGood luck, let me know if you have any questions.",

It is also charged at warranty rate, so you pay Ford's pricing on parts (maybe 30% less than retail). \n\nAs the dealership also has to authorize this, they usually save it for their customers that have purchased vehicles there. You are now in a position to incentivise them to take this route. It'd take the whole cost of repairs (including the additional, unauthorized work) down significantly for you.\n\nEDIT - If you want \"your buddy who's a service advisor in Alberta\" to email you a quote for what we would have charged for the job, just as a point of comparison, you can PM me your VIN and email.

The day after I arrived, we took my car to drive somewhere, and on the last mile, I noticed some weird noises from the rear left wheel. I figured I shouldn't drive that old piece of junk all the way home with a fucky wheel, so my dad and I drove to his local mechanic (two villages over because yay villages) and we dropped it off. Said something to the effect of \"please have a look at the source of the noise and call me\" and he said he'd call us the next day.\n\nHe did call the next day, to tell us that the repairs were complete and that would be 800\u20ac. I'm like, what? What repairs? I asked you to find what's wrong not fix it with an outrageous price?? At least that's what I said to my dad, who had taken the phone call. I said I did not want to do an 800\u20ac repair on 20 year old basic beater Audio that only cost me 1000\u20ac to buy three years ago, I could buy a whole new Audi for that much. \n\nAlas, my dad said he'd rather just pay for it than argue with the mechanic, and said he'd just avoid that mechanic in the future. And I just figured... well it's not *my* money anymore, and I'm not about to save my stubborn dad 800\u20ac just because he's too big of a coward to confront the mechanic about his shady business practices.\n\nTurns out the dealer quoted for two work hours and a genuine brand new Audi OEM brake caliper. On a 20 year old car. Without consulting me. And given the speed he performed the repair at, I can only assume that he had the part in stock for the last ten years and was glad to be rid of it.\n\nAnd he also fucked up the wheel speed sensor because my stability control got fucky a month after the repair. But that Audi did not need that to begin with so I didn't bother.\n\nAnd he also fucked up the rim on my dad's car, repaired it when it really should have been replaced, causing it to tear apart and rip the tire to shreds while I was the lucky one to drive that car at 100 mph. You know that iconic WWI/WWII braaaaaap noise of propeller airplanes from the movies? Yeah that's what my tire sounded like driving on a sudden flat at high fast. Shredded it real good, glad I could come to a stop before running out of rubber. Barely.\n\nPretty sure that guy just liked to cause problems to make customers come back, and since he was the only mechanic in a ten village radius... must have worked out for him.",

My best guess is that most of the $1,300 is labor or a few select expensive parts mixed in. Due to this, the shop would actually lose out even more by trying to put the old parts back in. Most likely, they will put in a \"discount\", which is really adjusting the labor down closer to cost, and see if the customer will bite.(Semi) worst case, they let him go with no additional charge past the original repair estimate (approved) cost and call it a day. Then hopefully some training for the advisor and tech. Actually worst case would be fights for a lean or court. I doubt it would go that far as the shop would lose super hard in all 50 states. Again, I am really sorry the shop put you in this position OP, and it truly is their fault this thread exists. Hopefully everything turns out alright for you. (Edited for stupid autocorrect fails)",

I told him I was just having issues with my driver side headlight.  After an hour or so, the mechanic came back and gave me a burned out bulb telling me the whole fixture was loose and the entire assembly would need replaced which would run me just shy of a $1000.  He at least asked me if I wanted him to order the part(s) and pay now to which I replied, \"no, I'll need to wait on that.\" \n\nWent home, pulled out the bulb which as it turns out wasn't seated all the way after it was plugged in.  The bulb, however, was the one I put in two days prior.  I know because I bought a new brand and type of halogen.  I had a feeling this was going to be the case because the bulb the mechanic gave me at the shop was not the same bulb I had just bought and used.  After I seated it properly, I've had no issues with my headlight.\n\nTL;DR - Don't always believe the mechanic just because they show you removed/broken parts.  It doesn't mean they are the removed/broken parts from YOUR vehicle.

They are the ones at fault for not having order in the shop.\n\nThey also legally cannot hold your truck in the shop and force you to pay if you didnt authorize the repair. They HAVE to take that financial loss as their fault. If they hold your truck in the shop, call the cops, take them to court if it gets to that point. \n\nMaybe hit the record button on your phone before the meeting starts in case they say some shady crap. \n\nI'll check up in a few days for the update if you decide to let us know.\n\n\u2010------------\nEdit: it seems like people are misunderstanding one of my conversations here. I apologise for this and will elaborate on it. However, this may not reflect other dealership practices or privately owned businesses. I can only speak for the practice in my area, and a few other areas in the countries. This is regarding holding any vehicle in a shop for unauthorized repairs.\n\nWhen a repair is not approved AND the shop goes ahead and fixes it anyway. That is NOT the fault of the customer (you). That is the fault of the dealership/business, and the dealership/business MUST take that financial loss. They legally cannot force the customer to pay for a repair they did not authorize. And they cannot hold the vehicle from the customer for rightfully not paying for an unauthorized repair. That is called being held for ransom.\n\nMost service managers and businesses are understanding and will take the loss. This situation happens weekly/monthly and we take financial losses all the time. This is something most people are unaware of.\n\nHere are 2 things that realistically happen when an unauthorized repair is done: \n\n1) The dealership will let the customer walk away and we take the financial loss. (This is normal)\n\n2) The service manager will order the mechanic to remove that new part out of the vehicle and put the old part back in and we take the financial loss. And the customer still gets their vehicle back.\n\nImagine taking your vehicle in for maintenance which cost you $200-$500 and then they try to charge you another $3000 for something you didnt agree to. Even I don't have that much disposable money, I would be pretty angry. I could take my car to another shop to fix that same issue for only $800 instead of $3000.\n\nIn any case, I am on your side, the customer, in this scenario. If this happens to any of you, I am letting you know you can fight for your rights. If you did not approve the repair, you are not obligated to pay. If they hold your vehicle because you didn't pay for a repair you did not agree to, they are holding you for ransom. Take it to court. Call the police. They are also mediators for situations like this. But I can tell you right now that realistically most businesses would rather avoid going to court, will give you back the vehicle, and take the financial loss, and maybe yell at the person (or fire, depending on the financial loss) who made the mistake of allowing unauthorized work.\n\nAgain, I only speak for my area and some other locations.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. If you are a mechanic, service manager or foreman in this conversation, I am always open to how other business practices work as well.",

It\u2019s very frustrating how ready people in our industry are to tear down others in our industry and then wonder why we\u2019re undervalued and often under paid compared to other skilled blue collar jobs.\n\nSadly, it works both ways in this industry. The dealer will always try to throw an indie shop under the bus. I was talking to another shop last week that is having problems with a recent reman GM transmission. Their local dealer wants the shop to send the vehicle to them for the warranty work. The shop knows the dealer is going to blame them for something. I know I have had that same feeling before and try to keep everything in house because of it.\n\nEdit: you are also right about only knowing half the situation. It could be possible that the job couldn't be completed without the extra parts. If the timing chain tensioner fell apart, the engine can't be reassembled without it. I know that doesn't make up the price difference, it's just an easy example. If the end of a camshaft or camshafts were damaged and the new phasers couldn't be bolted on, it would be the same scenario and closer to explaining the price difference. The shop should have still waited for authorization, but they also know if the customer declined the extra parts and the job went to shit that they would be blamed for it.",

At this point the vehicle is disassembled.  I assume I\u2019m speaking to a journeyman flat rate guy, you know that the customer would have to pay to reassemble the vehicle with a known issue and no warranty on work done or all parts dumped into the back and customer pays up to this point and a tow bill to get it off the property or pay what was recommended. The shop needs to get paid up to this point. Also, a side note: this vehicle is disassembled on a hoist and the garage has a stop work situation until approval right? Couldn\u2019t the customer at least make an attempt to get back to the business before  the next day  or couple days later? A dealer tech, around here, doesn\u2019t get paid unless work is completed. Shitty deal right? Should the tech go home and clock out?pack up the vehicle and push it outside and then tow it back in when the customer gets back to the garage eventually, for free?You guys might be surprised that it\u2019s the tech working on the vehicle getting jerked around by this as well. If the shop isn\u2019t paid, neither is the tech. This only applies to flat rate dealers naturally. \n\nAlso, OP didn\u2019t receive a phone call before a text came in? No written estimate of the updated parts after a concern was raised? OP went into the garage, still zero explanation what the extra cost was? The parts manager could even name the part in question? Also, the service manager was out\u2026what about the tech or service advisor or parts person to explain what happening? Nobody could say anything about this extra cost? Sounds unlikely. OP should post a written estimate of the updated work or tow it outra there and update on what another garage says and how that worked out.",

Again, an estimate is different from a quote. This is also an estimate that was made for internal repairs, not something that could be visibly seen until the work was started. If they put their signature on an estimate, I doubt they have much legal ground. Their question was whether or not it was legal, and it likely was. Regardless of anyone's personal opinions, estimates can change once work has begun and that is completely legal within reason.",

How did it get bent? The same shop didn't mention it when they first put the tires on. What if they bent it doing the rotation?.. \n\nJust some deep thoughts, it seems really hard to prove anything.

If I tried pushing that time constraint, mistakes got made, double gasketing oil filters generally (caught during initial start after fill, so only harm was a small mess).\n\nI ended up quitting a few weeks after my demotion because I could not take out trash, and run errands for the mechanics I worked side by side with days ago like that, even other mechanics felt bad, one guy always would invite me to his bay claiming he needed help to do something, but in reality, he was just making an excuse to put a tool in my hand so I could wrench and do what I enjoy, working on cars, didn't even care that he got the money and credit for it, I got to stop playing shop maid and do some real work.\n\nBut know I run my own business, projected to be turning 100k gross a year in my second year, and honestly just laugh when I think about what the dealership lost when they took away the precursor to my dream job (lube tech lead in to Master Tech)",

It was such a fun job.\n\nNow I hate the fact it was a head gasket that went out at 140k miles.
