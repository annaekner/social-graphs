However I believe SCV (the corp betrayed in the video) is out due to financial instability. But besides a big giant missing these shows never fail to hit, but be prepared for the Blue devils to pay the judges again and win another championship (dci fans know what I mean)",

Tournament was played outdoors on grass on a smaller field than indoors and the young guys didnt even seemed to play that well while playing with/against mostly older players.\n\nAfterwards joked about how they could probably play in the World Championships and do well and that more players of football/basketball should switch to handball and start dominating it.   \n  \nClearly either didnt do the research or just didnt talked about it on purpose that the US National Team is one of the worst to feature in the World Championship and as far away from winning a World Cup as Team Germany is from winning an international American Football Tournament involving NFL players.",

Criticism of the administrative practices behind that World Cup is not racial. The racial aspect is this notion, on every post of a fan group celebrating in Germany, that Qatari fans or other middle eastern fans at the Qatar World Cup did not enjoy themselves or did not have that level of passion. The fan atmosphere at a tournament has nothing to do with the administration of it, and the comment I replied to is solely about that aspect, not any of the things you mentioned.",

Why can't we detach the fans from the governments? Do you just not see people from that region as human beings? Are they all just nameless evil beings because you dislike their governments?

It's fiction, but goes over a wider period of history in Bosnia, centred on the bridge as the main character, if there can be one.\n\nEvents there are too many, the BBC documentary is good, but there are also other good things to look at. \"The New Class\" by Milovan Djilas is an interesting look at Yugoslav Communism, \"Prime Time Crime\" by Kurspahic is good for Milosevic media, \"To Kill a Nation\" by Michael Parenti is an interesting but heavily critical of the West view of the fall of Yugoslavia (all of these looking at recent Yugoslav history really).\n\nAs I said there are many events which you would want to look at to know more, but the Battle of Kosovo (1389) is important for the Serbian mythology surrounding Kosovo relevant today, WW2 in the region was also important. For more recent events re. communist Yugoslavia some interesting moments are problems surrounding the new 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia and the leaking of the SANU Memorandum (both of these of Serbian concern). \n\nI think other writers (more fictional) such as Aleksandar Tisma and Danilo Kis(?) should be fairly interesting too.",

Again, I am not murderous, my parents/siblings/neighbors/friends aren't murderous. Do _I_ need to _pay_ anything?

The Cold War had just ended, and with it came an end to the constant looming threat of nuclear annihilation, the fall of the Iron Curtain and the reunification of Germany. The economy was on the up again and new technologies like the internet were changing the daily life of many people. Climate change was beginning to become a mainstream issue but it was still thought of as a problem for the future. It was a fairly optimistic time with a lot of possibilities.\n\nI'd say the time period in between the end of the Cold War up until 9/11 or the 2008 financial crisis was probably the peak of 'Western' civizilation. Every time period has its own challenges as well and it's not like it was some utopia. Some things have improved, but the general optimism of that era is definitely gone. Of course the experience living in the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa or the post-Soviet states will have been very different.",

It's a fictitious attempt to now suggest you didn't mean to invoke Qatar in any way other than to be disparaging and demeaning to it. That's the entire point of your original comment. \n\nQatar WC was more than fine (outside of Sporting terms, because in that context it was anyway THE greatest WC in history of this sport).  \n\nIt was within a 3-hour journey for 2+ Billion People spread over 3 Continents, never before has such a thing happened.   \nPerfect Timezone for a global event (2014 FIFA data itself showed and 2026 will corroborate it *After* Normalizing for expanded nature of it, i.e. True Global Events held in Americas has NO peer in the world in being worst, because that is how Earth's Geogrpahy it, they can't help it).  \n\nQatar WC also was the safest WC in history for Women travelers and other fans in general too.  \nAlso the teams enjoyed it as well since travel time between matches was cut down and thus allowed them to Rest & Prepare properly (Players like Messi have spoken about how this helped them).    \nSame for Fans, a huge chunk of whom watched 2 matches in a single day and some even more than 2. Something that has never happened to this degree before.\n\nThere were Videos made by British traveling fans who got invited to feasts and parties in random Qatari folks home, whom they met at fan hubs & on streets. It's literally on tiktok & youtube.\n\nYOU are the ones who created this ridiculous comparative dynamic of Football cultures explicitly mentioning A Place. \n\nQatar saw ALL the European teams fans being THE worst in creating an atmosphere in the stadium. It was a theme. Pathetic display. \n\nEven Americans fans were better than them in stadium. African teams had the best fans and then South American and Asian teams. Somehow only Europeans travelling fans were affected, Human beings coming from rest of the Actual World were having a blast.\n\nSo yes your comment WAS racist.\n\nLeast of all the fact that Qatar had a World Cup, you are peddling a narrative that is contextual on there being a regional/continental competition, i.e. Euros.\n\nThat is unhinged subconscious socio-cultural honed attitudes spilling out in the open.\n\nEdit: Just stumbled upon this Pitches in Copa America 2024 stories that's going on. You didn't bother to mention that as representative example, i.e. An actual International competition being managed incompetently of the highest order where Players can not even play properly, let alone every thing you thought was credible for hosting an Event.",

If you don\u2019t, you lose. \n\nI\u2019m not the most sophisticated bettor out there and mostly stick to promos with low $$ in max bets, but still, learning the math and using it is really not that difficult.",

                    "body": "The kind of promo money you\u2019re describing varies from book to book but generally isn\u2019t very restricted. For example, if you get a promo to sign up, bet $5, and receive $150 in bonus bets, you can bet that $150 and withdraw whatever you win. You don\u2019t get the \u201cstake\u201d back w bonus bets ofc, but you can usually do something simple like bet $75 against itself and take the free $68. [Here\u2019s](https://youtu.be/NlShSEX89aQ?si=8kg8qurMfnrGmcPK) a walkthrough of a slightly more sophisticated strategy for one sign up promo. \n\nThese are actually ridiculous and I encourage anyone who despises gambling to take advantage of them. The sign up promos are essentially customer acquisition strategies; the books know that x amount of people who sign up will use the promos and get hooked. If you withdraw the money and close your account, you\u2019re set. \n\nAnyways, the promos I was referring to are the daily ones that the books will put up. For example, sometimes you\u2019ll see a 50% boost in winnings with a max $20 bet. Most of the time though, there will be specific bets (again with limited max bets) that have odds boosts. For example, let\u2019s say that the promo was Argentina. Instead of -300, maybe it would be boosted to -150. They\u2019re usually a little more complicated than that, but [this tool](http://crazyninjamike.com/public/sportsbooks/sportsbook_devigger.aspx) can help with the math.\n\nSome promos are phenomenal. Many still favor the books after the boost. You have to figure out what\u2019s worth it and what isn\u2019t. There\u2019s a daily thread over on r/sportsbook that people contribute to, although it\u2019s important to double check things. Lines change. Promos change. People make mistakes. \n\nRegardless, it\u2019s more of a hobby for me than anything. Apart from the sign ups, the promos aren\u2019t usually that great. But then again, money is money.",

You're fanboying so hard you're making a point that is irrelevant to me.\n\nI didn't say they was wrong or right to fanboy Ronaldo, I'm saying that how you described the scenario is completely different to reality, they absolutely focused on Ronaldo above everything else on that pitch, he was having a relatively average game if not worse than usual and yet almost all mentions of Portugal mentioned him, not the other 10 players on his team.\n\nYou're so blinded by the fanboying that you are rewriting history.\n\n>I wonder if you would of had the same sentiment if Slovakia played the same way versus England.\n\nConsidering I expected Slovenia to get battered, I think it's pretty fair to point out how good their defence is considering they took it all the way to penalties and had a pretty nice chance to win the game towards the end if it wasn't for some great goalkeeping.\n\nBut hey, don't let the fanboying and bias get in the way of a good fictional story.",

But at worst they are seen as hooligans, not mafia criminals like in other countries.\n\nMatchgoing Fans probably view them more favorable as TV only or non football fans. Biggest points of conflict between them and the general public is pyro (which increased a lot since covid) and violence. But they mostly keep the violence out of the stadiums and between each other (and if only because security is to tight, which is expensive and also a point of critics) so it isn't really that visible.\n\nI know older TV-Fans just calling them chaots but not viewing them only negatively, everybody knows they make the atmosphere which is mostly universally appreciated. So I would guess most view them kinda ambivalent and I would guess the younger and the more matchgoing the more they are respected.\n\nThere also were some big things catapulting them in the spotlight of national news which probably had some influence.\n\nOne big point was the escalation with Hopp right before covid, which was handled very poorly by the DFB and the media at first, espescially after later it became clear that the \"spontanous\" reaction and outpouring of solidarity with Hopp and disgust about the fans wasn't really as spontanous and everybody (DFL, Bayern, Hopp, Broadcasters) knew about the banners or at least about something happening before the game. So while I feel like in the beginning the ultras were villified the tone in the media changed after some while. Especially because the DFB didn't react to cases (especially one case a few weeks prior) of discrimination before with the same reaction (or any at all) and Schickera Munich (Group which held the banner causing the escalation) is a dedicated left-leaning group fighting racism in the stadium and was even awarded a prize for this from the DFB before. But still for most non-football intrested people it probably was viewed negatively\n\nAnd Schickeria is not the only group. While in recent years a lot of Ultra groups are leaning or are open to the right there are (nearly) no open right-extremists politics in the stadium. The ultra culture was one of the biggest reason openly right-extremists hooligans aren't the bosses in the curves anymore.\n\nThe successfull protests against the DFL Investor this season probably also did some good work for their Public Relations.",

Incredible as a capo and has vibe around him that when he starts asking for more and more, you feel it in your gut and want to fight for the man.

Not at all who you would imagine to be a Capo.\n\n[He gave a very rare interview to Spiegel this year about the fan protests against the DFL investor deal. ](https://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/hertha-bsc-ultra-zu-fanprotesten-wie-ein-tsunami-in-dem-man-versucht-gegen-den-strom-zu-schwimmen-a-e5780550-85b6-4ec3-b462-ca991d394959)\n\n[Here he is speaking to the players at the beginning of the year after a brutal 6-4 loss.](https://x.com/BlauRadler/status/1715039331222528435)\n\nHertha' Capo from 1998 to 2006 was Kay Bernstein who would later become the club President. There's a genuine feeling building about Kreisel one day running for the board or perhaps even the Presidency. Very well respected figure in German football generally. \n\nPerfect story to illustrate their power over the ultras. Last year after the game v. Freiburg, a mass brawl of 20 v. 20 broke out at the top of the stairs between our own ultras. The riot police came and just got sucked into it as well and kept fighting for 20-30 seconds. The Kreisel comes up the stairs and just casually looks down and hits the alarm button on his megaphone and it was like someone paused real life. Every single ultra stopped fighting and everyone just walked away, it was genuinely insane to see.",

We like this team, it's the first chance we've had to recover from all this investor bullshit. Just keep going, pay a little more attention at the back, I mean 6 goals in Magdeburg, c'mon. Otherwise everything is going to be OK! We're going to be there, so just trust yourselves and believe in yourselves.

I don't think the system is that flawed, this is just a freak outcome where the 1st seed in the group lost to the 3rd seed and the 2nd seed lost to the 4th, then the inverse of that happened, then the 1st and 2nd drew and 3rd and 4th drew. \n\nUsually each group has a whipping boy and/or a titan but in this group the weak teams stepped the fuck up and Belgium didn't do their duty. In reality Ukraine let in three goals against Romania and deserve that to be the deciding factor. Ok, they scraped more points than say Hungary, but I doubt Ukraine gets 4 points against Scotland Germany and Switzerland. Maybe they do? But I think they likely do exactly what Hungary did and beat Scotland and lose the other two. \n\nMaybe a \"best 4 non-2nd teams\" is the way to go, but I'm not sure how fair that is when the groups get seeded the way they are. On paper Ukraine should have come 2nd to Belgium, but underperformed.  \n  \nMaybe a 4 group system of 6 teams is the best, then bottom two of each group go out. That way it isn't wonky across groups, it's fixed in a way that every team plays 5 games against the rest in their group and they go through if they do enough. \n\nI'm sure whatever system is done will throw up weird results. If this was a WC group then two teams are out on 4 points, the same as two that go through on 4. The 3rd place thing actually saves one team (Slovakia) that also got the same number of points as the group winner.",

If our 1994 squad had the same fighting spirtit we would have played the final in 1994. The 1990&1994 had tremendous talent in all areas but they had shit mentality.

The other ultra groups in Italy are just as extreme in their views, and for all the antics Lazio's ultras pull off the other groups do have a larger tendency for deadly violence.  \n\nLazio has never been liked by the press, some would argue so much so that they have had a whole Scudetto stolen from them (and they don't have a bad case for that claim tbf). The club has always been an easy scapegoat in Italy because of the two clubs in the city, Roma has always had a favorable view in the press despite heavy anti-Semitism and racism as well by their ultras.  \n\nIt's not like anyone here is going around digging into local Italian news papers, who may or may not report on what happened accurately. There's been more than one occasion where the press has straight up lied and attributed things to Lazio ultras that were other ultras disguising themselves as Lazio, or things that never actually happened.  \n\nIt's somewhat relevant to note that Lazio has many left-wing ultras now as well, and has had them for some time. You just never see any reports on it.",

By that point, they were generations out from the man who had joined up with the Nazis and operating on a more global scale, with customers who had no idea of the firm's bad history.",

They don\u2019t understand and haven\u2019t been around to watch Yugoslavia football. No, the best Yugoslav talents didn\u2019t all automatically go to Red Star. No they weren\u2019t that financially dominant in comparison to the other big 4. For example Dinamo beat them to the signing of Haris \u0160koro, the hottest player in the leauge a couple of years before the CL. The other clubs (Hajduk and Partizan, Vele\u017e mainly) also had major connections in the state.\n\nIt is wrong to see the corruption in the Yugoslav league as a state thing. It was mostly a battle between corrupt football officials trying to make their clubs better, they were absolutely free to compete against each other. The only true Yugoslav state football projects were Hajduk in the 40s, maybe Partizan in the 50s and the Yugoslav national team in the 50s. \n\nThe other great teams and generations (Partizan in the 60s, Dinamo in the late 60s, Hajduk in the 70s, Zvezda in the late 80s and early 90s) were a product of excellent academies, good recruitment from smaller Yugoslav clubs and some innovative coaching. Any of those generations probably should have achieved the results Zvezda have.\n\nYes, there were definite corrupt incidents (Dinamo was on the end of most of it, how things change). But it wasn\u2019t all Red Star, not even close to it. For example, we lost the title because of administrative reasons to fucking Hajduk.\n\nVery different situation than it is now in Serbia.\n\nI can\u2019t believe I wrote three paragraphs in the defense of Red Star but what can you do.",

We even got relegated at the end of 1993-94.\n\nThe following season, we won the second division title but weren't allowed to be promoted. The season after that, we finished second and this time, the promotion was valid. In 1996, the punishment was unofficially over and we could return to business. So, I guess our debt to society has been paid and I have no shame related to that. \n\nUnlike some other teams who cheated in many league games in a season and were initially disqualified from UCL. For some reason, they were allowed back... and became champions. I'm referring to the 2006-07 AC Milan who, the previous season, was involved in the Calciopoli. Had Milan not cheated, they wouldn't have gotten a UCL spot legally and to this day, no punishment. I guess Berlusconi knew the right dicks to suck to avoid Milan AC to be disqualified. \n\nTo be honest, Tapie was hated by higher ups in France and were waiting for the first mistake to kill his career. I think it helped a lot for what happened. But I'm glad it happened because at least, we paid our debt and there's no doubt. I can proudly say \"yeah but we got punished and now, we're clean\".",

It was a shock, as Fabio Capello\u2019s side had a 100 per cent record until that point with 10 consecutive victories.  \nNow former Marseille midfielder Jean-Jacques Edelie has revealed in his autobiography that the game was not all it seemed to be.  \n\u201cThe only time I agreed to take a doping product was the 1993 Champions League Final,\u201d he confessed in the book that will come out on March 1.  \n\u201cIn all the clubs I played in, I saw some doping going on, except for Bastia, but this was the only time I accepted. We all took a series of injections and I felt different during the game, as my physique responded differently under strain. The only player who refused to take part was Rudi Voller.\u201d  \nThe news is a particular shock to Milan, as among the Marseille stars were future Serie A heroes Didier Deschamps and Marcel Desailly.  \nIt\u2019s not the first time that the French club has been embroiled in controversy, as it emerged they had fixed their title-clinching League game against ASOA Valence-Clime so that they could concentrate on the European Final. The side was stripped of Le Championnat, relegated and barred from defending this trophy.  \nMilan have asked their lawyers to look into the situation and many of the players who lost that day are hoping to be awarded the title with a 13-year delay.  \n\u201cI am shocked and find this news disturbing,\u201d Daniele Massaro told the Corriere dello Sport. \u201cIf these allegations are proved, then it would be right to take the trophy away from Marseille and return it to Milan. The whole thing is simply incredible.\u201d  \nRoberto Donadoni, who is now Coach of Serie A side Livorno, aimed his scorn at the club hierarchy.  \n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the future of that cup holds, but one thing is certain: if it's proved that all the players were on something, then the directors must\u2019ve had a hand in it. I remain stunned by the fact that professionals in this sport can go to any lengths in order to win.\u201d  \nVice-President Adriano Galliani called for UEFA to take action over these allegations.  \n\u201cOur lawyer is looking into the situation and we believe that UEFA cannot help but begin an inquest when confronted with these statements. Of course, if Marseille really were on drugs against us that night, then I think it\u2019s right for the trophy to be assigned to Milan. We\u2019ll wait and see what happens.\u201d",

Man City, Chelsea, and PSG have dropped over 1.5 *billion* since being bought, there is no way that Ceau\u0219escu spent anywhere close to that propping up his favorite team. I'm not trying to make light of how these corruption cases are, but the fact remains that literal fortunes are being pumped into football, companies are making teams, and holding companies like the City Football Group are buying up teams and ruining leagues. \n\nI'm not sure what your last point is? Wealthy population centers with the resources to do things that attract people to go there is just the driving force behind urbanization? Teams from London, Milan, Madrid, Barcelona, Munich, Hamburg, and the Ruhr did well because they had a huge pool of players to pick from before football became much more globalized, allowing them to establish themselves over decades, that's just a fact. Nowadays, however, with enough money from the Gulf you can turn any small club into a powerhouse in a few years.",

Like how much pride can you be when your team barely fields any players from your country let alone locals. \n\nI feel the same about international football who looks more like club football nowadays. You look at teams like France, UK, Germany, hell, even smaller teams like Switzerland who are good mostly because they are rich enough as countries to attract foreigners who are born there. They're like sponges for international talent. \n\nHonestly if my NT looked like France for example I wouldn't even support them. Even international football would look so much more different and competitive if they could only use players that are ethnically from the country they represent. Or at least half. Imagine how some teams would change. France, UK, and Belgium wouldn't be near as good. Switzerland would be a mediocre team. Albania would be good. I think the only team that would still be world class would be Spain. \n\nImagine how much more competitive and nice to watch international football would be. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten to the point where federations throw a bunch of money at good players to be naturalized and play for another NT like other sports do.",

Then Livaja started playing for national team, and we were on a good track to have atleast neutral feelings towards it (heck 3rd place at WC22 made me smile a bit), but everything went back to shit in June, right before national league finals - when Dalic didn't back Livaja in incident vs. fans. With current people leading federation, and especially with Daliban as coach I don't see anything changing in short to mid term future.\n\nFor us, Hajduk is simply first, and above everything. National team runs on #obitelj (family) motto, but they are far from it.",

You lot will never have the chance to win the UCL when you have massive clubs like Madrid, Barcelona, and United retain a bunch of glory hunter fans to keep their funding. You believe you have a better chance in the UCL by selling your best talents to the big teams you cry about? How delusional can you be?!? No matter how much inflated money you receive from these sales, you're never going to be competing against City, Chelsea, Madrid, or United.\n\nThe moment you sold Dias and Ederson, you already signed their fate to the UCL. Dias is the best CB itw, and Ederson plays perfectly for Pep's style. His crucial saves against Lukaku in the UCL final shows it. City wouldn't have won without these two players, and you gave your BEST players to them. And here's the problem. Once City gardeners all these best talents, they will have money to fund their own network of academy players. And we just saw that in their latest UCL group stage win. They will not have a need to buy players from you lot anymore. \n\nYou shot yourselves in the foot. You fed an oil tycoon for the benefit of your own pockets instead of football, don't even smokescreen the smiles you get when you see those oil money dripping into your pockets. If you're going to complain about \"blood money\" entering the UEFA and PL, then you're also the ones who accepted the \"blood money\" when you sold Dias and Ederson.

So many of South America's leagues don't even bother selling all their top talents to these clubs and continue to enjoy football. The fact that you associate football into winning trophies is already proving the common denominator that I've been saying all this time: Benefica fanboys can't distinguish between business and football. You can always run from them and you blatantly choose not to, on the defence that you want to win trophies and have the European stage glory. What a joke. Football is football, you play it for the sake of the sport, not because you want your club to have glory on the European stage. Football winning isn't about glory. I thought we established this years ago but some brainwashing stays behind it seems. \n\n\"If I could decide, I wouldn't accept\" is the laziest argument I could hear from an advocating standpoint. Go to the stands, put your banners up, and let the club know you don't want to sell to these clubs. Go to other fans and ask them to join the movement. Talking about monstrosities when your club is one less than them, accepting their blood money and keeping quiet about it. I don't see y'all having banners saying \"we don't want blood money, we don't want Qatari money\" do I?",

                    "body": "From el Confidencial: https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2024-09-02/chat-canteranos-madrid-video-sexual-menor_3952363/\n\nThe Guardia Civil arrested several players from the Real Madrid youth academy a year ago. They are accused of participating in an orgy with an underage girl and another young woman whom they filmed without their consent. They then disseminated the videos \u2018massively\u2019. The investigators proceeded to dump their mobile phones and have recovered a multitude of conversations between those involved and other footballers from the club's youth teams. \u2018The worst thing is that she was 16\u2019, \u201cbut what bitches\u201d, \u201cthey must be sluts\u201d, \u201cgypsy whore\u201d. These are comments that are dedicated to the girls in their WhatsApp groups and even boast of having beaten them: \u2018You are not aware of the blows (sic) that we hit\u2019 \u2018with the ass and face red as tomatoes\u2019.\n\nEl Confidencial has had access to the reports of the Guardia Civil on the content of the phones sent to a court in the province of Las Palmas, where the events took place. They are being investigated for an alleged offence of revealing secrets and child pornography, punishable by up to five years in prison. The Guardia Civil concludes that they knew that one of the girls was a minor.\n\nAlso that, as this newspaper revealed, they received a tip-off that they were being investigated, which allowed them to delete evidence from their phones days before their arrest at the Valdebebas sports complex. The videos of the orgy have not surfaced, although stills and conversations in which they and their colleagues discuss the images have surfaced.\n\nThe consensual sexual encounter took place on 15 June last year. The four players were on holiday in the Canary Islands and met the two girls. They met at a beach club near the beach and booked a private cabin for which they paid 150 euros. Inside, three of them had sex with the girls. The girls realised that they had passed each other a mobile phone and when they had finished, they reproached them for having recorded them. They denied it, but lied. \n\n They filmed them and shared several videos among friends and locker room mates. Weeks later, the minor found out that the images were circulating and filed a complaint. The Guardia Civil has established as a time reference the chats between 15 June when the events took place and the following three days.\n\nThe most enthusiastic when it came to sharing their sexual encounter was the investigated Juan Rodr\u00edguez Lima. There were many forwards and conversations found on his Iphone 14 Pro Max. The first image was sent to a group called \u2018Whatever Ferr\u00e1n wants\u2019 in which there were 12 participants. There they are already talking about how Juan Rodr\u00edguez is getting a \u2018blow job\u2019. One of the participants focuses on the girl with derogatory comments: \u2018What a slut\u2019, \u2018give it to her hard there\u2019, \u2018gypsy whore\u2019, \u2018where did you get those\u2019. \n\nThe \u2018cabritinhas\u2019 chat\n\n\u2018What sluts they are\u2019, says Juan Rodr\u00edguez himself, who warns the participants that \u201cyou can't tell, just watch\u201d, \u201cthis is epic\u201d, \u201csuch bitches\u201d. Another of the detainees, Ferr\u00e1n Ruiz, takes part in the conversation and exclaims \u2018long live football\u2019, \u2018paradise, gentlemen\u2019. At the time of the events, the players were aged between 20 and 21. The girls were 16 and 18 years old. The messages show how Juan Rodr\u00edguez (now a Tarazona player) boasts that one of the women is underage. He commented on this after sharing the images of the orgy in another chat called \u2018cabritinhas\u2019. In this WhatsApp group there were 13 other people.\n\n\u2018If the worst thing is that she was 16 (years old) HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\u2019, wrote Juan Rodriguez before explicitly detailing what the sexual act consisted of with some expressions that this newspaper has declined to reproduce. In the reports there are photos that were not deleted or that the Guardia Civil has managed to recover in which the players are seen with the girls and a hand slapping a buttock. In the chat room \u2018cabritinhas\u2019 one of the participants comments that \u2018there is one that looks like a tomato\u2019. Juan Rodr\u00edguez explains the reason: \u2018From the slaps\u2019. \n\nExtract from another of the conversations detected by the Guardia Civil. EC\n\nOn the same day of the events, Juan Rodr\u00edguez had another conversation, this time in private, with a contact called Andr\u00e9s, to whom he again pointed out the age of one of the girls: \u2018If I tell you her age, you'll freak out. HAHAHAHAHA. For what a slut she was. But don't say anything. His interlocutor replied that he was confident that she was of age: \u20182005 I hope\u2019. However, the Madrid youth player boasted again that the girl he had recorded without his permission and about whom they were commenting on the sexual images \u2018wasn't even 17. What a devil\u2019. Juan Rodr\u00edguez also commented with this friend on the beatings of the girls: \u2018It's just that the beating we gave her was abysmal\u2019, \u2018Me whipping her, whipping her\u2019.\n\u2018Me always without rubber\u2019.\n\nThis footballer highlighted for the third time the minority of age in another conversation with a contact called \u2018Golf Lima Terraza Brit\u2019: \u2018If I tell you the age, you cry. 06 (2006, the year of birth)\u2019. In addition, Juan Rodr\u00edguez confessed that they had not used a condom: \u2018I always use no rubber\u2019. Although without leaving the jocular tone and the laughter, his interlocutor expressed his misgivings about what he had done: \u2018Are you cool with that, I'm not cool with that\u2019, \u2018Bro, without a condom, with everyone, bua... bro, that would give me a hard time\u2019, \u2018But 06, bad vibe\u2019. In the same conversation, the player's friend wonders \u2018why are girls so dirty?\n\nThe images were shared again in another chat, in this case with five participants, called \u2018Canariasic\u2019 in which all the detainees were present. They commented on the recorded images of the sexual encounter they had had hours earlier: \u2018This girl aint sleeping today\u2019, \u201cWe've left a tattoo on her ass [from the slaps]\u201d, \u201cJAJAJAJAJA bro\u201d, \u201cShe needed aloe vera\u201d, \u201ceverywhere\u201d, \u201ctalcum powder\u201d.\n\nAndr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda is another of those investigated and, according to his phone, he also shared the videos. He did so, for example, with a friend called \u00c1ngel, to whom he sent some images and the comment \u2018Viva el f\u00fatbol\u2019, which they use on several occasions. He sent him \u2018a preview\u2019 of the recording and promised to show it to him in its entirety at a later date. As in the previous cases, the interlocutor also reacted with vexatious comments about the girls: \u2018They must be pigs...\u2019. The player also received congratulations from another friend called Izan to whom he sent the sexual content: \u2018You've fulfilled my dream, you son of a bitch\u2019. The Real Madrid player consoled him: \u2018Next one with you, little brother\u2019. \n\nThe third participant in the orgy was Ferr\u00e1n Ruiz (now in the Girona reserve team) and the Guardia Civil found on his mobile phone that he also shared the videos. In his case, he sent them to a friend called Lara. Laughing, the girl told him that they were \u2018pigs\u2019. \u2018What a filth, I'll kill you\u2019, \u201cI have no words, I'm freaking out\u201d, \u201cAt what point do you start thinking about recording when you're like this hahahahahaha\u201d, \u201cI'm busting my ass\u201d. \n\n\n On the same day, 15 June, when the events took place, this other Madrid player sent the images to a chat room called \u20183 Queridas\u2019. He shares it with two girls who also reacted with laughter and astonishment to the video sent to them by the footballer: \u2018I'm freaking out\u2019, \u2018Surreal\u2019, \u2018I haven't seen anything heavier than this\u2019. That same night, Ferr\u00e1n Ruiz shared the video with a fourth woman to whom he described the violence used against the complainants in the private cabana at the beach club.\n\n\u2018It is that you are not aware - he wrote to her - of the blows (sic) that we hit. She came out unable to walk, with her ass and face as red as tomatoes\u2019. \u2018What a beating (sic), bro\u2019, she replied without reproaching the footballer's comments or what could be seen in the images: \u201cWhat a couple of enjoyment\u201d, \u201cpoor thing hahahahahah\u201d. However, the player asked her not to say anything: \u2018You, shut up hahahaha\u2019.\n\nThe work of accessing the content of the phones has been carried out by specialists from the Cybercrime department of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Guardia Civil. The dump was carried out at the headquarters of the General Directorate of the Armed Institute in Madrid. The information was sent to the Juzgado de Instrucci\u00f3n number 3 of San Bartolom\u00e9 de Tirajana (Las Palmas), which received a total of 8 hard disks with all the information.\n\nIn its conclusions, the Guardia Civil says that \u2018it has been possible to verify that the sexual encounter with the underage victim and her companion was not only recorded\u2019, but that those investigated \u2018went so far as to affirm that this material would have been shared massively by Juan Rodr\u00edguez among his friends and companions\u2019.",

But they were never accused of rape.\n\nEdit: Maybe a point of the confusion is the alleged \"beating\"? I'm interpreting that as slaps, which could be consensual. I'm not seeing anything alleging that they were literally beating them up. At that point the encounter would obviously not be consensual, but the article does describe it as consensual.",

Sometimes it was blatantly obvious that she wouldnt have given the guy she was with the time of day if he wasnt on the team, and I think a lot of times my teammates knew this as well, which was why they viewed these women the way they did.\n\nBut, at least at the beginning, what I dont think they knew was that for the vast majority of them there was never a chance they found a committed relationship, which is what I think most were after. It shocked me how long it took many of them to realize they were forever the hookup, never the girlfriend. And in the time it took them to realize this some would do essentially anything for a chance at the relationship status they were seeking, up to and including gang bangs like we see in this situation. It was always so awkward seeing them around campus in a relationship with some guy not on the team after they finally gave up trying to get with someone on the team.

Currently the police do not offer further comment, but an investigation is ongoing at the hotel.\n\nExpressen has an English article on its website (you will find it on the front page currently). Unlike the Swedish article, it does not currently specify that Mbapp\u00e9 is the suspect.\n\nDeepL of the Swedish article (updated as of 8pm CET):\n\n>**Mbapp\u00e9 investigated for rape after Sweden visit**\n\n>*The police are investigating a suspected rape after football star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9's visit to Stockholm last week.*\n\n>*According to Expressen, the police are investigating the star as a reasonable suspect of rape and sexual offence. That is the lower level of suspicion.*\n\n>*\u2018Fake news\u2019, writes Mbapp\u00e9 on X.*\n\n>Real Madrid player Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, 25, unexpectedly turned up in Stockholm last week. He was seen during the night to Friday at Stureplan, where he is said to have visited the restaurant Chez Jolie and the nightclub V.\n\n>The police are now investigating a suspected rape that is said to have been committed on Thursday in central Stockholm, as Aftonbladet was the first to report. On Monday, the police investigated the hotel where the party was staying.\n\n>**Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is being investigated**\n\n>According to the Express, it is the football star who is the subject of the investigation. He is reasonably suspected - the lower degree of suspicion - of rape and sexual assault. The crime was allegedly committed on Thursday 10 October and reported two days later.\n\n>\\- \u2018This is a prosecutable case,\u2019 says police spokesperson Daniel Wikdahl.\n\n>\\- \u2018This is not a case I will comment on in any detail, but I refer to the prosecuting authority.\n\n>Expressen has sought prosecutor Maria Chirakova.\n\n>She told Aftonbladet earlier today:\n\n>\\- I will not say anything about this.\n\n>**Mbapp\u00e9 denies the allegations**\n\n>The world star denies the accusations and calls it fake news.\n\n>\u2018FAKE NEWS!!!\u2019, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 writes on X and continues.\n\n>\u2018It becomes so predictable, the day before the hearing, as if by chance\u2019.\n\n>According to French RMC Sport, Mbapp\u00e9 is referring to the legal conflict between him and his former club PSG - over unpaid wages and bonuses. On Tuesday, he and the big club will meet in the appeal court of the professional football league.\n\n>It was on Wednesday that a private plane from Madrid landed in Sweden. According to information to Expressen, Mbapp\u00e9's good friend and former teammate Nordi Mukiele is behind the visit.\n\n>The French footballer Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who is currently injured, is one of the biggest stars in the world of football and his visit to Stockholm has been heavily criticised in his home country, where the national team was gathering for the Nations League.",

One of Macron's story, who is a Marseille fan, was that he had exclusive information on Mbappe going to Marseille. The youtubers obviously didn't buy it and in a desperate last attempt to convince them Manu started calling Kyky on his phone, and he answered. Macron told Mbappe to tell them about the deal with Marseille on speakers mode and Kylian just laughed and said that it was impossible and \"not in our DNA\" or something like that.\n\nEdit : [Link here for anyone interested ](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=P4i2pdaQSPo7AFFq) starts at 5:48",

May be suspected.  \n*Example: A wallet has disappeared from a classroom where several people are present. All of them may have had something to do with it, but there is nothing to point to anyone in particular, so no coercive action can be taken.*\n2. Reasonable suspicion.  \n*Concrete, objectively substantiated circumstances exist that indicate with some strength that a certain person has committed the offence to which the suspicion relates. Example: A witness saw a person standing at the place where the wallet was found.*\n3. Suspected on probable grounds.  \n*The suspicion appears justified on an objective assessment. Something is needed to further link the person to the offence, such as a witness or technical evidence. Example: A witness has seen that a person has picked his wallet.*\n4. Sufficient grounds for prosecution.  \n*The prosecutor can expect a conviction on objective grounds, i.e., the court will find beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the offence charged by the prosecutor. Example: The offender was caught red-handed stealing the wallet.*",

So neither the quality nor quantity of evidence (usually evaluated at later stages of the process) is really directly proportional to the degree of suspicion, but I can see how it might seem so. Furthermore, extenuating evidence can be found or established much later than the suspicion takes part, however serious that suspicion might be initially.\n\nGiven that we know only the degree of suspicion, it is definitely not enough for any kind of approximation of likelihood of innocence, regardless of whether we\u2019re laymen or not.

He was fantastic in France, England and in the Belgium nationals, in Champions League too. His general skill with the ball could suit any kind of play and any teammates if you want to attack. Has no ego on the pitch! He always dreamt of coming to Real Madrid! The club where players show their best! \n\nReally the most certain slam dunk we've seen. And it turned out to be a complete flop.

Madrid, who within recent history, at the time, had been leaders in the \u2018galactico\u2019 transfer approach took a massive loss with the transfer (for reference Hazard only contributed 7 goals and 12 assists across his entire time with us\u2026). Additionally he was brought in on massive wages. \n\nWithin the same window of time, Madrid had also begun signing young talents from South America (Vini, Fede, Rodrygo). As evident by our current squad, these players were massively succesful and were afforded the time/opportunity to grow into their roles, wages, etc.; rather than being older, expensive, established superstars like Hazard. Since the Hazard ordeal, Madrid has still maintained a policy wherein we sign top older talents, however the big caveat is that we now typically bring them in on free transfers (Rudiger, Alaba). Additionally, we evidently have maintained a primary focus of bringing in top young talents (Camavinga, Tchouameni, Endrick, Arda, etc.). \n\nEffectively, Hazard\u2019s failure here caused a pretty massive shift in the club\u2019s scouting and transfer policies. It\u2019s very unlikely that, under Perez, you will ever see us make a 25+ year old signing for anywhere near the 100 million mark.",

Sure, they paid him nicely, but we all know other clubs would pay more if they could, Mbappe is the world's most popular young footballer by far. Madrid was not pushing at all to get even Mbappe, they were like \"ok, if it's a good deal you can come\", but the conflict was all in Paris, Madrid was not fighting anybody or taking quick loans to get him. Same with other experienced players, they come if it's not expensive.\n\nBasically Madrid doesn't sign the world's biggest stars anymore, they try to sign young players who will be in the club for many years.\n\nI wouldn't say that it is a BIG change in Madrid's policy. In fact, in their whole history, they have always bet on signing young players and having a stable squad, MOSTLY. Players like Hazard (or Zidane before, or Kaka) were really mostly exceptions, a \"this one we really have to get!\" event, not the norm. Maybe there will be another at some point.",

He played well for 6 months - the latter stage of 17/18, with his best performance coming in the match where we scored a hat-trick(that was the match I believe where we lost the invincible season). He played piss-poor in 18/19 and got loaned out in 19/20.\n\n142 Million for 6 months of good performance and 2 goals against us in the biggest UCL humiliation isn't a good deal. Specially when you consider he went to Aston Villa for 17M\n\nDembele on the other hand - whilst injured yes, was a constant creative threat, tho not spectacular in terms of G/A(that being said he did have a decent G/A out put all things considered). Not to mention the fact that we sold him for 50M.\n\nI don't really know how you can conclude Coutinho when compared to Dembele specially when Dembele was bought for less, sold for more, and actually played decent when fit.",

He wasnt great at dribbling past the defender, though he had the pace to do it; he would usually carry the ball forward, cut back on to his stronger foot, then either cut forward or offer a cross that usually amounted to nothing. \n\nDembele's strength was his finishing ability and his positioning in the box. However, his big miss against Liverpool really cemented his career as a bottler. I think he simply did not fit the Barca style of play at all, so he couldn't really live up to his price tag in the first place. He's not a bad player, even a good player, but he couldnt become the player that you've just described when he was at Barca.",

The one that we saw after he was gifted a second chance and made relevant again by Xavi was the main creator for our team.\n\n> Demb\u00e9l\u00e9's strength was his finishing ability and his positioning in the box.\n\nLol if anything, his wildly inconsistent finishing which has been a constant throughout his career was one of his weaknesses. His overall goal output isn't high and despite that not being his primary role in attack, you can't say that a ball-to-feet player like him had great positioning either. There's a reason why the *Demb\u00e9l\u00e9depedencia* periods saw most of the attacking play run through him whilst on the ball since that was where he'd excel.\n\nYou're right about the predictability at times, especially against buses and crossing into the box, but that was as much of a tactical issue too, since Xavi wanted him to stay wide and 1v1 all the time rather than have more freedom.\n\nSpeaking of such\n\n> \ud83d\udea8 Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 (PSG): \"Luis Enrique gives me more freedom than I had at Bar\u00e7a.\" Via @sport\n\nThis is both something I agree and disagree with, depending on to what extent he means this.",
