But the overall experience from this inconvenience is so small that I don't even see it as a negative. Also, Apple also has a perfect solution for it that just makes sense which is their keyword with power/finger scan button. you don't even need to reach the bottom, it is right next to you.\n\nAlso Magic Mouse while might be a bit inconvenient when charging, is not the problem people need to focusing on. It will tell you when its battery running out days before it will shut off, and after charging it you would use it for month and forget that you even need to charge this thing. Charging is not a problem, ergonomics are. I had most problems with its shape that is not comfortable.   \nAlso it does add to the design to make it more seamless and sleek.

I used for long time with my macbook just normal usb keyboard plugged into the usb-c hub and waking with hitting space just worked (it was used as mac mini, as i don\u2019t use internal monitor when i dock my laptop to docking station). \n\nAlso right now i\u2019m on logitech k380 - there are none issues with wake on bluetooth. And if your concern is putting mac to sleep mode - there is a power menu, keyboard shortcut and option to configure hot corner. Personally - i love the last one, just sliding mouse to the right corner and your mac goes to sleep.",

A charger may have any power limit it likes, but that\u2019s not the fault of the cable you chose to plug into it.\n\n >or cables support USB4 but not display port, \n\nI\u2019m fairly certain there\u2019s no cable that behaves this way. And passive cables CAN\u2019T behave this way. Active cables conceivably could, but I don\u2019t think anyone would be stupid enough to build them like this.\n\n>or support display port but only USB2 speeds, \n\nthese cables exist (I have one), but they are breaking the USB C specification by leaving out 6 of the 15 wires. I\u2019m fairly certain Apple would not sell a cable that does this. \n\n\n>or cables where you can only use one of displayport or usb and fails if you try both, \n\nAs above, a properly-manufactured passive cable is incapable of behaving this way, and an active cable would never be manufactured this way.\n\n>or thunderbolt 4 speed but only 65W or 15W\u2026\n\nThose are not recognized power limits of cables. \n\n\nNow, all of those goofy behaviors can be caused by the things that the cables are connecting. Plugging a 240w cable into a 30 watt charger isn\u2019t going to get you 240w. But plugging a 60w cable into a 140w charger WILL limit you to 60w. \n\nAnd a USB C port that is badly implemented (or is properly implemented, just on a terrible computer) can totally refuse to provide USB connectivity while it is also providing DisplayPort data. But blaming the cable just shows that you haven\u2019t really thought very hard about where the problem likely is. \n\nAlso, for those curious, your PASSIVE 40 Gbps cables will work at the new Thunderbolt 5 80 / 120 Gbps speeds. Active cables will not get this free speed upgrade.",

So paradoxically, the cheaper it was to buy, the better the odds that it is compatible with the speed upgrade, because the passive cables are just wires connecting the ends, whereas the active cables have chips that detect and then rebroadcast the signal down the wires, but they can only do that at the older speeds.\n\nMy recommendation is to try it and see what speed it connects at (I don\u2019t know where to go in MacOS to see what speed it connected at, probably About My Mac, and then Thunderbolt Accessories) and only buy a new cable if it\u2019s needed. But you won\u2019t be able to test this until you have a TB5 computer and a TB5 accessory to connect to it.\n\nMy recommendation would be to buy this definitely-passive inexpensive certified TB4 cable if your current one does not give you the TB5 speed boost (it is certified to the same standard as Apple\u2019s TB4 cables, and works for everything I\u2019ve asked it to do): \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Charger-Thunderbolt-Compatible/dp/B0DCHBVNZ1\n\nI don\u2019t know why people buy cables from Apple. Most of  their cables aren\u2019t any better than anybody else\u2019s (there are a few that actually ARE better, like the 3 meter TB4 cable, but we\u2019re not talking about that here) but they cost way more. \n\nMy general guidance is to buy from Apple ONLY the things that absolutely only Apple builds.

USB4 cables must support the asymmetric modes that do give you the 120 Gbps at the cost of 40Gbps of bandwidth in the other direction. For this cable it is irrelevant.\n\nI find it slightly misleading to only give the higher number, because some people not realize that that is just redistributing bandwidth from 80/80 Gbps to 120/40 Gbps. But lets ignore that. And that is probably why USB4 does not define a logo for that asymmetric mode. For cables it is just guaranteed for all USB 80Gbps cables.\n\nFor USB4 80Gbps hosts and devices and hubs, it is optional to support those 120/40 modes. But we can have that discussion for TB5 as well. Neither USB4 nor TB5 (publicly) define when the 120/40 mode will be used. It is decided by the USB4 driver. And the best indication we have is, if more sending bandwidth is needed than receiving bandwidth. For example if you have 3 DP connections of 4xHBR3 speed or higher. But the minimum requirement for TB5 hosts ist only 2 DP tunnels at 4xHBR3 speed. So a TB5 host might be required to support the 120/40 USB4 mode in hardware. But it might not have any reason to use it ever. And I do not think we have heard how many DP tunnels Apple supports (and at what speeds).\n\nAnd for more complex cases, like for example a PCIe connection (at least symmetrical 64/64 Gbps) + a DP connection (HBR3, \\~26 Gbps sending), you can switch to 120/40 to make that possible without reducing the sending PCIe bandwidth. But that'll cost you PCIe bandwidth in the receiving direction at the same time. So probably, it will not be used in this circumstance. Because as always, DP and USB3 bandwidth will simply cut into the PCIe bandwidth (in sending direction). The 120 Gbps mode will probably only be used if you use DP tunnels and special USB3 bandwidth that exceeds the 72 Gbps that are available on a sending direction.\n\nIntel actually does not define this at all. 1 Manufacturer of a TB5 laptop has explicitly stated that they do not support the 120 Gbps mode (even though all Intel TB5 controllers, which they use, have it), because they do not have the DP connections to make it useful at all. Apple of course has announced the asymmetric support. So you can be sure they support it. But since that is a USB4 feature, that means it is simply incompetent to not also list \"USB4 (up to 120 Gbps)\".",

They are just more informative by adding the generation to the TB logo, where you expect it and are used to it from Intel and all other TB manufacturers.\n\nYes, \"USB4 Gen 4\" and TB5 is not the same. That is why just the number by itself is a bad idea. If they engraved both the TB logo and the 5 on the metal, that could be argued for. But why split them apart like that.\n\nFor accuracy: USB4 Gen 4 is a technical name, not recommended for consumers for the transmission mode of a single wire pair. Or a the group of transmission modes of the entire cable (which could be in symmetric or 3:1 or 1:3 mode).\n\nTB5 is a certification for\n\n* USB(4) 80 Gbps (the official USB name and logo is \"USB 80Gbps\". Because its not specific to USB4 and backwards compatible. Just like USB 5Gbps cables are forward compatible to USB4 20Gbps).\n* maybe 240W support (Intel was not clear if every TB5 cable must support this, I am guessing that)\n* for cables up to 2m in length: guaranteed DP support, even if they are active (USB4 already guarantees this for passive cables, which this one is). Neither state a minimum speed. But Apple gives us the guaranteed DP capabilities of the cable on top of what TB5 might guarantee\n\nAnd that is it. So TB5 on a cable actually gives you slightly more information than the official USB 80Gbps/240W logo would. But you need to know what it means by heart and cannot read it from the cable.\n\nNeither of which spells out the exact DP speed (from what is labelled on the cable itself. Apples specs themselves are good here).\n\n**Note** that USB4 already mandates all non-optical USB4 80Gbps cables to support the asymmetric modes. So the \"up to 120Gbps\" here is nothing that TB5 has to require, its pure marketing. And considering that there have been optical TB cables in the past with less features, it is unclear if TB5 would make stronger guarantees for optical cables that USB4 does not make (like USB2 support, DP support, full USB3 support, required asymmetric support)\n\n**Note** that in the past, TB Logo + \"3\" on a cable meant 40Gbps capable, fullfilling all the TB3 requirements. While The TB Logo without the \"3\" was commonly used to identify 20Gbps TB3 cables that somehow failed those requirements.\n\nSo if you only see the TB logo and do not realize you have to look for a small engraving, this could identify cables ranging from TB5 down to a USB 5Gbps/100W cable.",

                    "body": "I totally agree that devices you buy as that price point should \"just work\". That unfortunately isn't the case. I also get you blaming on the cable because of your experience, but it's better to understand about why things work (or not), so that you can figure out the solution, cuz it's usually not about the cable.\n\nNow, about the TB hub, let's see what's wrong here. TB4 & USB4 uses the same underlaying protocol, however TB3 is different from \"normal\" USB. TB3 cables is made for thunderbolt protocol, not normal USB. For normal \"passive\" cable this is fine, but active cable won't work since it only made to work with Thunderbolt.\n\nSo, my guess is that the cause could be:\n\n\\- Your bad cable is active TB3 cable.\n\n\\- Your bad cable is USB 3 but claimed to be TB.\n\n\\- Your TB hub is TB3.\n\nAnd yes, there are good amount of bad TB cables out there, but it's not because TB has loose requirements, it mostly because of sketchy manufacturers. Simplest advice is buy certificated TB4 cable (cuz TB3 also kinda a mess). You can check the thunderbolt certificated product here  \n[https://www.thunderbolttechnology.net/products](https://www.thunderbolttechnology.net/products)",

I haven't touched a windows machine in 20 years, but this engine wasn't cooperating on anything but the proprietary software made by Cummins that only works in a windows environment.

And the thing is, overall performance is only as strong as the weakest link.  Apple didn\u2019t cheap out on hardware quality; they ensured to have every component equally performing across the board so to speak, down to the keyboard and trackpad. (Please ignore the smallish default amount of RAM they provided, it was still highly performing hardware-wise). \n\nNow, when considering for example Toshiba or HP laptops, they *had* to cut somewhere\u2014sometimes it was the bus speed, sometimes the hard drive had a slower rpm, the video card was just awful if not absent, or the cpu was underperforming. And these were the only options available by \"default\", out of the box.  If you *had* to have \"equally perfect\" performance\u2014on a laptop nonetheless, then you had to go custom\u2014then again depending on which and wether brands offered, and then the price would severely jack up.\n\nAt the same time, Windows had started embedding full-depth analysis of hardware components within the system settings, indicating which systems were performing sub-par, which also led to some brands to get duly-shamed for cheaping out.\n\nAlso, Apple had finally shifted to Intel CPUs for a while, which led to better and easier analysis of the the \"true\" cost vs performance, to which some reviews started pointing at it, that, maybe, considering everything and all, Apple MacBooks weren\u2019t ***that*** pricier after all.",

The fake holes are dimples with black paint in them.\n* Usually, when people think their speaker holes are clogged with debris, the real issue is that the black paint has come out of the fake holes, exposing the aluminum at the bottom of the dimple.\n* Don't use a brush or a vacuum on the fake holes. That will just remove more of the black paint, making it look even worse.\n* If you want to \"fix\" the fake holes that look bright, use a mechanical pencil to fill in the hole. Wipe off the excess.\n\nNot in the video: If any of the *real* speaker holes truly are clogged, just put a piece of tape on them and remove the tape.",

If you\u2019d listen you\u2019d hear that the cadence and lilting is not the typical British accent (I won\u2019t say English, like crappywomack said, there as many English accents in England as their are counties, it seems)\u2026 so if the person is Portuguese who learned English from some Brit, that would explain the unique sounding flow -and pronunciation of some words. Otherwise, it _does_ sound like a generated voice. Then again, if the narrator is the same person as the channel owner, and the channel has been around since 2013 I think, then it clearly isn\u2019t AI since it predates the voice tech.

There are at least five light sources (including the monitor) and AI wouldn't handle that many so well.  There are other images of the same setup on the website including from different angles and in different light.  Since it's an image used for marketing, it's probably Photoshopped to some degree.\n\nThe easiest way to find out about the wallpaper would be to contact the company that makes the iPhone stand and ask.",

Today I took it out as it was Christmas, cardboard and MacBook box looking like it just came from the factory and...boom. My excitement turned into horror when I saw the Apple logo appear. \ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udee0\n\nI submitted a report with photo evidence, hopefully I hear back during next week. \n\nI got this from Czech retailer Alza, so not Apple. Hoping I get a replacement without having to wait for 30 days with the warranty stuff. \ud83d\ude43 And this was a gift to my parents too. :))))\n\nAt least you can laugh at my misery and I hope you're all having better holidays than me haha!",

Took it to a 3rd part shop to get it checked out, they said there was barely anything in there.

Coworkers would make fun of me for buying cheap dress shirts until one day one person also had that same issue! \n\nWELL, the issue was that the edges were sharp. Sometimes you can FEEL a sharp edge but not really care but I guess me shifting around and moving my mouse was enough for it to create that tear. They reached out to the company that did the install but there wasn't a solution as of course desks are made of cheap wood so if you filed it down....you're going to just break that shit. \n\nSO, the solution really was \"don't wear long dress shirts\"",

If you\u2019re lucky, no one is gonna wanna take the additional 15 minutes to unpack just how that happened and chalk it up to an already weakened hinge on an already damaged unit scheduled for repair. \n\nDespite Apple as a company doing their best to make cashing in care coverage harder, the employees themselves tend to be super understanding. When I was MUCH younger I didn\u2019t know that the touch pad wasn\u2019t a real button when the haptics stopped working. I made an appointment, but being an idiot I tried to fix it myself by sticking a knife in the corners and trying to \u201cunjam\u201d what I thought was an actual button. I tore it up bad. Still being a stupid kid, when i arrive, I straight up tell them, \u201cI think the button is depressed.\u201d The genius putting 2 and 2 together after seeing that monstrosity, stops me right there and says never say it again, because he didn\u2019t hear it. \n\nHe told me to expect it back in 2 weeks and gave it one look that told me I introduced him to a whole new type of stupid. He then said he\u2019d make sure it\u2019s covered. He explained the actual mechanics that made it \u201cclick.\u201d Probably to make sure I never had a reason to make a second attempt. He light heartedly mentioned if I hadn\u2019t messed with it I could\u2019ve walked out with it that day.\n\nTL;DR Apple Store employees understand those things costs an arm and leg. If you don\u2019t make a stink they usually do what they can to keep costs down.\n\nEdit: grammar",

Obviously the prices they were selling for new and used was obscene though and I could never justify it. However, when this one popped up for \u00a3950 I bit the bullet and decided to go for it. \n\nIt\u2019s a 16 core model with 96gb of memory, a 2tb SSD and the Radeon Pro 580X GPU. The only upgrade I\u2019m going to be doing is swapping out that 580X for a better card because the 580X is ancient and should never have been an option in a machine of this price. \n\nHere in the UK, these machines typically sell for \u00a32000 at a minimum. Which was a large part of why I felt like I should get this one, I finally get the opportunity to own my dream Mac, and if I regret it, making some profit off it doesn\u2019t sound too bad.\n\nSo far though I\u2019ve been delighted with it. It runs like a dream and is built better than any computer I\u2019ve ever felt. It\u2019s a shame technology becomes obsolete because this is a machine which is still going to feel premium as hell 50 years from now. \n\nAlso, what\u2019s Apple Silicon? Is that some sort of rubber kitchen utensil? Please rush to the comments to tell me all about it and why it\u2019s better than this computer /s.",

Way back when, I shared a rehearsal studio in an industrial building on Mercer Street in Soho with a drummer friend. He found several cases of unused cardboard egg cartons in a dumpster and covered the walls of our studio with them. It attenuated some high mids but did nothing for bass. I learned later that you need a resonator or a bass trap for that, but I digress.\n\nA few weeks later while both of us were getting loaded, the super let fire inspectors into our loft from the freight elevator. When the captain saw the drummer's handiwork he yelled, \"Get that shit off the walls right now!\" And he meant right now. It was an easy job insofar as the drummer had only stapled them to the drywall. While we were working the captain asked, \"Are you boys practicing to be arsonists?\" I thought he was being overly-dramatic but I didn't want to fail fire inspection because we were already in trouble with the landlord because of the drummer's redneck plumbing skills that dumped about a thousand gallons of water on the floor below.\n\nBefore the rubber coats left, the captain summoned us to the \"kitchen\", held up one of the egg crates over the sink and lit the edge with his lighter. It burst into flames in about three seconds. \"See?  I use these things to start my charcoal grill at home.\"",

If you haven't tried it VR is trash but tethered VR manages to make it much worse. I tried Skyrim VR and it was a vomit comet. There still aren't any really killer games, and you have to make a lot of accommodations for tethered VR. Unless you're a rich turbovirgin who can dedicate an entire room to PC VR experience, it's going to suck.\n* You're best off just buying a Quest 2 used, to experience its mediocrity. You'll only  only be out the $200\\~ as inevitability it'll end up unused and unloved. Long term VR stats are abysmal.  I sold mine and got most of my money back. I seem to recall after a year only 1-2% of users still use their VR unit once a week.\n* You're much better off buying a dedicated PC for gaming. I have a [vid of benchmarks](https://youtu.be/Ah69sbogFx4) and while it does alright, Apple refuses to add support for the AMD 7xxx series let alone nVidia, so if you're dual booting, limited to the 6000 series AMD GPUs. At the price point of used Mac Pros, you'd probably get a PC that you could later buy a high end GPU for and run circles around it. Xeons do not have the higher clock speeds of consumer CPUs. Also, even jumping roughly to about 2022 means the Ryzen 5000 series which is oodles faster as a platform for gaming, let alone the latest and greatest\n\nTLDR, VR still sucks. If you want VR just buy a Quest and skip the gaming PC as tethered VR is a pain and there's few killer apps. If you want gaming, get a dedicated PC.",

The reverb often is unbearable and makes conversing annoying. This is because of Surface flection.  Smooth and hard surfaces reflect high frequencies.  this why even hanging pictures and shelving  and tossing an area rug in bare room radically reduces it. \n\nIt will not stop muddiness which I think is what you're getting at but that'd be a problem in a small space (Recording booth) as opposed to larger one. There are much better things to use instead of egg cartons. Thick blankets or heavy curtains or rugs are classic (many older movie theaters used curtains along the walls) or for the classic makeshift booth, old foam mattresses.

I suspect $600-$700 is about what a mature market (like ebay) would give, but note you (the seller) pays lots of fees, plus the inherent risk in a remote transaction.\n\nSo, you didn't do bad.",

Now how good the deal was for them depends how much storage it has, if it had the base 256 GB I think the price is very fair and I would have given you less, but if it had 512 GB or up, I think this is acceptable. Though I must say selling such a machine because you dislike a very easily exchangeable accessory is wired. Well what's done, look forward to your new machine (though personally I would have waited until after the release).",

                    "body": "You sold it at an honest price, in my opinion. Every computer tends to depreciate in purchase value the very moment you bought it. And especially if new models have come out.\n\nConsider that your very same model, refurbished by Apple, is on sale at their site at $1,229 before taxes, but that means that the computer has been checked, revised, parts have been replaced, etc. If you take the profit out of the price (generally 30%) you go down to $850 that you should divide by two if you consider wear and tear. 425 dollars is the actual used value.\n\nWhen it comes to Macs, please do not listen to all those who say you sold it at a lower price than you should have. Selling used Macs is far more difficult than selling used PCs, because after all, the Mac is still a machine used by a market niche. I can tell by personal experience: I have used, owned, changed and sometimes snubbed Macs since 1991.  So, if you need to make a fast sale, it will have to be a bargain for the buyer.\n\nAlso, like every iMac with the new design, unified RAM cannot be upgraded. That is one of the reasons why I still keep my old iMac 27\" as a backup computer -- it is still good but the resale value is zero, because the Intel processors have been deprecated, the design has become stale, you name it.\n\nI have spent a hefty amount of money for a Mac Studio and I am quite glad, for now. But I also have to be certain that it has already decreased in market value. Not an issue for me, as long as it works reliably for an average lifespan of 5 years, possibly 10. That's what really matters in the Mac world.",

Also a laptop is not really a portable sound system, a dedicated bose speaker would always come on top\n\n\u2022 regarding screen i highly disagree. Macbook screens are only good at colours. The response time is atrocious and you cant upgrade the panel, as its proprietary and glued shut (so only replace when broken, for a hefty price). As i said, for an average laptop you can always get an oled panel as upgrade, since the wast majority adhere to edp standard interface. And oled is \nking.\n\n\u2022 i am talking linux, not windows. But win 10 ltsc is pretty decent too when tweaked correctly. This may be a downside for some users, since going hackintosh on amd is kinda problematic \n\n\u2022 many laptops have both iris scanner and fingerprint sensors.",

The base should absolutely be higher than 8GB, but I hear the \u201cthe chip is only $15\u201d argument a lot and I want to comment on that, even at risk of getting downvoted to oblivion. \n\nIt\u2019s not only about the part cost of the chip on the BOM, but also the operational cost of maintaining multiple configurations.\n\nSoldering the chips requires a completely different PCB that has to be built and run through the SMT process. MOBOs that let users drop in RAM do not have to have unique PCB SKUs. They are populated with the same RAM slots (and those connectors are dirt cheap compared to an actual RAM part) and then different chips are installed in during final assembly. That strategy still has some operational burden for custom configs but all the expensive custom part can be kept the same. \n\nThis is partially why the delivery times on anything other than the base model are longer. There isn\u2019t as much of a stocked inventory for customized specs. They probably keep a stock of the common configuration changes (like one step up on RAM, one step up on storage, or the combination of both), but they build these configs at lower volume and sometimes as a one off for the really crazy configurations. That means they have to hike the price to make up for the burden. To be clear, This isn\u2019t just an Apple thing. The Apple specific part of it is making the base model so low to begin with, the overall strategy of integrated memory, and what they choose to set their profit margins at.\n\nThere\u2019s a real operational cost to multiple configurations. Does that justify the premium? The prevailing sentiment around these parts is no. But just keep in mind that piecewise BOM costs don\u2019t tell the full story.\n\nCompanies have to factor labor cost and part cost into profit margins. The profit margins are likely way higher than we want them to be as a consumer, but there\u2019s not much we can do about that. I personally think there are performance benefits to the unified memory approach and don\u2019t condemn companies for not making everything user upgradeable. However, I don\u2019t agree that 8gb is analogous to 16gb all the time. At a certain point you will always be limited by the absolute capacity of the storage. Most people will\nNever find that limit based on how Apple manages RAM, but in some cases (using large sample libraries in music production, for example) the absolute capacity still matters a lot. I ALSO think the price to upgrade is unfortunately high but it\u2019s not all arbitrary. Only part of it is arbitrary.",

Only had it for 2 years, so if i kept using it the way I was, it would've only lasted me like 5 years max before the SSD failed. That's the side effect of underspeccing ram, you use more SWAP (the process of using your storage medium as temporary RAM), which since macs use SSDs (and they have a limited amount of times you can write to them), you can quickly make a computer which should realistically last 8-10 years only make it about halfway thru that lol. \n\nThis is why people are calling for the minimum to be 16, because even though there are people like you who don't need 16, apple doesn't tell you what I just told you about. They just sell it to you, and then you'll find out the hard way (and be out repair costs at minimum). \n\nI agree with /u/GamerNuggy that 12gb should probably be the minimum now, it's a good middle ground that still gives people upward options, while not being underpowered. It's important to remember that Apple intends to have all of their devices usable for *anyone*. And I think with the current computing world, and the shitty devs who don't care about memory management anymore (thanks OOP), 8GB just doesn't cut it as a \"minimum general use case\" spec, for multitasking computers at least.",

Apple only supports their laptops for 6-8yrs, after 6 they go end of life and stop receiving new OS and feature updates, 2yrs later it goes obsolete and no longer gets security updates (which at that point you shouldnt use it online). I do hope they extend this though.

Modern SSD are much more robust than the early ones.\n\nhttps://www.ionos.co.uk/digitalguide/server/security/ssd-life-span/\n\n>  According to current failure statistics, SSDs are generally more reliable than classic HDDs in practice.\n\n> \u2018total bytes written\u2019, meaning the total number of bytes that can be written onto an SSD. Today, SSD manufacturers often state a service life (guaranteed write volume) of 256 TBW. With average PC usage, for example, around 80 TBW can be performed within 10 years. In the usage scenario \u2018moderate, eight-hour, weekly use as an office PC\u2019 (word processing, surfing the net, checking emails, occasional streaming, a few larger downloads, as well as smaller backup and copying actions, but not a high continuous load), the hard drive would have a predicted life expectancy of approximately 32 years.\n\n> However, if you record a large image backup on an SSD every day (e.g., 170 GB on a 180 GB disk), it can actually get tight after a few years. With a view to greater continuous use, a DWPD value is often given for SSDs: The manufacturer Kingston specifies a \u2018Drive Writes Per Day\u2019 value of 0.30 for its DC400 DW SSD model (480 GB storage capacity). The value is calculated using a formula that includes the TBW value (Kingston adheres to a standardised calculation method based on JEDEC workload when determining the TBW value):\n\n> TBW of the SSD * 1000/365 days * Number of years * Storage capacity\nIn this specific example for calculating a DWPD value, the guarantee period of 5 years flows into the \u2018number of years\u2019 (meaning the life span of an SSD that is guaranteed by the manufacturer):\n\nEven if you're writing the entire disc every day, it will probably still do 5 years.

I want my computers to last at least 8, 10 ideally. The only piece of tech that actually tends to wear is either the SSD/HDD or the battery, the CPU/GPU, motherboard, and RAM really shouldn't be damaged unless they overheat. So I really don't see a point in making computers last any less than a decade, personally.\n\nThe thing with computers is that if your usage habits never get more needy, you won't need a better device. If all you do is web browsing and light doc editing, you can pick up a thinkpad t420 and it'll do that completely fine for as long as you don't do anything more intensive. If literally all you need is very basic text editing/printing, and you don't require a modern GUI, you realistically could still be using a PC from the 90s (with an appropriately aged printer of course lol). That's the nice thing about computers, old hardware isn't inherently bad just because of age. The computer isn't the thing that's changing, it's always your usage habits as a user. You're the one growing out of your computer, not the other way around. Once you realize that, then you realize that upgrading just to upgrade isn't really always a necessity.\n\nI feel like I'm at a peak with my computer usage, i don't really envision myself needing anything more than what I currently do (ofc things can always change), so I bought a computer that matches those needs (a 2023 M2 Pro MacBook Pro, 16GB, 500GB), and I honestly think I could've just went with a plain M2 device. This thing is a bit overpowered for what I do, **which is good** because I know that I will have this computer for 6+ years as long as nothing chances it (screen break, part malfunction, etc). And I have a buffer set up (by overspeccing accidentally), just in case I do end up increasing my usage.",

If you are making 3D animations with cycles on blender - well, don't even try to.\n\nFor your purposes, 8GB seems perfect, and it seems that you have an M1 which is made in a period where the pricing wasn't as crazy and M-chips actually had an edge over typical x86\\_64 chips. So you shouldn't regret your purchase.\n\nBut when you offer a professional computer (Macbook pro) with mediocre-at-most specs for well over $2,000 CAD, where your target audiences are people who need like 4x what is actually offered, you can't really expect people to NOT get rightfully upset.\n\nI still think stuff like the Mac mini is a great value because it's almost 3x less than a Macbook pro with nearly the same specs. I have had problems with it like I stated above, but I'd probably also have those problems with the crazy-priced Macbook pro.\n\nPoint is that \"good enough\" is not even close to \"good enough for professionals\", which is the Macbook pro's target audience. Maybe 8GB is analogous to 16GB on a Windows PC, but even then the pricing would still be too high.\n\nI quote Apple Explained: \"\\[Why are they offering only 8GB of RAM on a computer this expensive?\\] The short answer is: Because they can.\" If you want native Unix-Like utilities, more advanced capabilities, AND great app compatibility, you are forced to buy a Mac.

There is really no feasible applications where having just the 8GB of memory pairs well with the computational performance. On the other hand the MBA seems reasonable for 8GB of memory but ideally it would be at a cheaper base price. So instead of the current model where Apple price discriminates by the categories of (overpriced entry level: people that want a decent quiet laptop or are attached to the ecosystem, really over priced with 16GB: people that want the performance and efficiency but also have workflows that demand memory or need to use VMs), we could maybe have a more reasonable discrimination where the 16GB of memory is at least attached to the MBP since those people are already paying for the high performance they need. And then the 8GB MBP would be comprable to a high spec IPad in price, while the \u201cstandard-user\u201d would be like a 12gb MBP at the current base price MBPs. As consumers we have to be aware that when we cave in to the pricing model, we are a small component of what enables Apple to price discriminate this way.\n\nSide note: I actually like the idea of hardware makers limiting the amount of memory for the very casual consumers just so software devs are forced to not bloat the fuck out of their programs, because right now, while memory sizes and speeds are getting better it feels like software is just consuming it without an corresponding increase in features / utilities / speed etc. This way you get a win-win situation for the consumers where the casual consumers aren\u2019t wasting value and the power consumers have more memory usage available.",

The fact that one chip SSDs often fail when used for boot drives is the reason most premium manufacturers (including Apple before 2022) avoid this. I think it is really the combination: lot of swaps due to undersized memory + one chip SSD will be the problem here. I think that this was an none-issue if the base model had 16 GB of RAM or if it came with 512 GB of SSD.\n\nThis is a problem which will only show up in 3-4 years which only makes it worse because it will probably show up when Apple Care is running out for most people.",

They don't have to compete in every metric because they think M series is so much better than the competition that other things don't matter very much. And they're right (although it does seem like AMD might have some parts out soon that do actually compete), M series really is way, way better than the competition, so there isn't really a need for Apple to be competitive on all metrics at all price points. You aren't paying +$200 for more SSD, you're paying to have that on a machine with an M series processor. I wouldn't have said any of this while Apple was still on Intel because I don't think their hardware advantage justified their pricing. Call the past few years a return to form. \n\nAs far as failure goes, when I first switched to an SSD back in like 2008/2009, people were saying \"enjoy your read only drive a year from now\". Jokes on them, though, none of my SSDs have failed and the only one that I actually expect to fail is the cache SSD on my server that I mentioned. Although that might not even fail now because my transcoding is done in RAM now rather than on disk. \n\nAnd for the few people who actually will experience failure, that's going to be a very small number of people and it's not actually the best idea to over engineer a product so that it meets every use case.",

The thing that you have to physically interact with anytime you have to use the computer is not a reason to pay more.    \n\n\nNever mind that there are mice that cost over $100. The MX Master 3 is pretty common, and frequently costs more than $100. Likewise decent keyboards can run 100-250 depending on what you want. Sure, you can buy a cheaper mouse and keyboard, but they usually suck and if your spending hours daily on computer you probably want something that is comfortable and provides features you want.\n\nIf the computer is being used for work (and we're talking about a \"Pro\" laptop) spending 8-10 hours, even more, a day on it wouldn't be unusual. It's easily worth it to spend a few hundred extra for the comfort they provide.",

There was even some speculation as to how one could enable button macros so that the drive wouldn't mount until *after* a series of button clicks, but they never got around to implementing that portion.\n\nIn short, I could find zero articles about active mouse exploits, but have to admit I only spent a few minutes looking our of curiosity.",

Upgrading is expensive, you see, and very often industrial and healthcare organizations will not, under any circumstances, update the equipment even when [cyber-attacks can often kill people.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/02/two-years-later-windows-xp-devices-can-still-make-the-health-care-industry-wannacry/?sh=7b31be83f046)\n\nSo, here are your two failure states for the software:\n\n1.\tSoftware patches break the system. \n\n2.\tExploits (viruses, etc.) compromise the system.\n\nOther people are in charge of keeping the lights on, the building cooled, and so on. Among your 999 other duties, you need the coding on these machines to *never, ever* break. \n\n**Enter: the simple air-gap.** Nothing in. Nothing out. No Wi-Fi connection. Touching these machines requires physically interacting with them\u2014fucking with any of these surgical machines requires, at minimum, bypassing everyone in the building between you and that room, physically entering said room, and laying your hands directly on the machine.\n\nNo firmware patches will break it. No forced Windows updates will screw with it. No zero-day exploits or month-old clandestine viruses to shut off any functions during a surgery.

Long story short, the lady needed to move funds from one account to a new one. Everything she used to set up the new account etc was basically a web app in a browser. But it refused to transfer the funds. \n\nShe sighed, and said \u201cthe old way of doing things it is then\u201d. She jumped to the desktop, clicked an icon, up popped a window and booted ms-dos 6.0!!!! She did some keyboard-fu and logged into the same system in text format. More keyboard-fu and the funds were transferred. She said she\u2019d been with the bank since 1995, and the only difference is the stuff in a browser looks better- but it\u2019s essentially just the same thing talking to the same back end - it just breaks sometimes but the old terminal route always works. It just doesn\u2019t look as slick! There were a few IBM logos thrown in there for good measure lol. \n\nAll the hardware is much newer, but the software behind it still works. Still in use in banks all over the world from when it was first set up. I doubt any one institution dare move away from what they\u2019ve got currently. \n\nThe guys that wrote that code probably retired or died years ago. Even the guys who were apprentices back then are probably in their 50-60s by now. The reality is, there\u2019s probably no one who really remembers exactly how the deep level stuff works to get it all to move over to something newer - just reinstall it on new hardware - which IBM are amazing at maintaining compatibility with.",
