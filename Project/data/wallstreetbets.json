            "text": "Purely hypothetical of cause:  \nImagine sitting in an airplane when suddenly the fucking door blows out.   \nNow, while everyone is screaming and grasping for air, you instead turn on your noise-cancelling head-phones to ignore that crying baby next to you, calmly open your robin-hood app (or whatever broker you prefer, idc), and load up on Boeing puts.   \nThere is no way the market couldve already priced that in, it is literally just happening.  \nWould that be considered insider trading? I mean you are literally inside that wreck of an airplane...  \nOn the other hand, one could argue that you are also outside the airplane, given that the door just blew off...  \n",

Directors, executives, or anyone else who has information or who holds more than 10% of any class of a company's securities are considered insiders by the SEC.\n\nIn this case you\u2019re not an insider, and the incident happened in public airspace, which my definition is public knowledge. If there was an incident on a private airfield with only boeing engineers present that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be reported to the public, but later would be, and you got a tip from one of the engineers, that\u2019s insider trading. \n\nhttps://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/insider-trading\n\nhttps://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/insider-trading",

Some unusual trading did in fact occur, but each such trade proved to have an innocuous explanation. For example, the volume of put options \u2014 investments that pay off only when a stock drops in price \u2014 surged in the parent companies of United Airlines on September 6 and American Airlines on September 10 \u2014 highly suspicious trading on its face. Yet, further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with 9/11. A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, which recommended these trades. These examples typify the evidence examined by the investigation. The SEC and the FBI, aided by other agencies and the securities industry, devoted enormous resources to investigating this issue, including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments. These investigators have found that the apparently suspicious consistently proved innocuous.\n\nabove is an excerpt from the 9/11 commission report",

It's going to be rough and I realize that. The past two days have been the scariest days of my life. My parents still don't know I've lost 1/3 of my inheritance. Every time I talk to them they can see how stressed I look and they keep asking me what's wrong and I don't know what to say. How can I possibly explain this to them? My only option is to hold for a decade. So that's what I'm going to do. I know people are going to shit on me, and you should. I recognize I made an unnecessarily regarded decision. I have received a lot of DMs and reddit notifications offering me mental help and Suicide hotline numbers. I appreciate your concern but I'm fine. I'm holding long term. I'm sorry if my decision made you upset and reflect on your financial situation, that was not my intention. I appreciate all of your support and constructive criticism. Some of you have been really mean but its ok, I know I deserve it. But im holding. Forever. Intel will succeed. ",

Meta earnings last quarter I was certain it was going up on a clear beat - they did beat but stock still went down over some bullshit. \n\nPeople will tell you to sell intel and others will tell you to hold. Whatever you decide is besides the point, in my opinion you should take out atleast a grand and dedicate that to your grandma as it\u2019s the least you can do, visit her grave and put her favourite flowers on it. Do things that would make her feel proud she worked so hard for you. (And I\u2019ll tell you now part of what will make her proud is you not being stressed, prioritising your health and spending her money for you to be happy) fuck it if it was me I\u2019d even find out the people who my gran cared about most and treat them each with a 1k holiday. The feeling you\u2019ll get from that is much more than if you\u2019d made $200k on options TRUST ME. Imagine for example some sweet minimum wage carer who treated ur gran amazingly got a $1k holiday, they\u2019d break down in tears\u2026  \n\nAlso $100k in the S&P is honestly a no brainer for ur age come back in 10 years and you\u2019ll be looking very very nice \ud83d\udc4c.\n\nThe best thing to do OP is to just accept that the market never wants to work in the direction you want it. 200k gone but 500k is still set for life money seriously. For most people that money is 20 years of hard work so to be sad and stressed over losing 200k when u didn\u2019t even earn it just sounds pathetic (no offence xx)\n\nI heavily advise you to put $250k into an account that\u2019ll pay you 5.2% APR and do not gamble or invest any of it and try to keep it permanently above 250k. YOU WILL LITERALLY MAKE $1k a month without doing anything!!!!\n\nBut yeah maybe ought to re-assess your maths degree \ud83d\ude02 if you can\u2019t even work out how averaging down works (AGAIN NO OFFENCE) but surely you should\u2019ve thought maybe I should keep half just in case to bring down my average let  alone do this investment in the first place.\n\nAnyway \ud83e\udd1e for you OP u seem like a sweet guy and we all feel horrible when we make dumb decisions like you did, it\u2019s all a learning point and in 10 years this moment will probably be one you are happy happened. I mean seriously man you could\u2019ve lost all that money but u didn\u2019t. Count yourself fucking lucky",

A gambler in the casino just lost all his liquid wealth. However, he still has his 401k and kids' college funds, and if he gambles those, variance may go his way hey may quickly win his lost money back. But if he goes back to a sound financial plan, that lost money won't be recovered for years.\n\nWhen you look at through the lens of degenerate gambling, it all makes sense. Best wishes.",

This is actually true because if any of us has $700k to use, no way are we just throwing it all into ONE STOCK. Who the fuck does that? Everyone here has read some kind of basic book or advice on investing and trading. If investing, never go all-out in one stock. Shit when I started learning about investing, that was one of the most basic rules I learned right away on my first day of studying. Diversify your shit. \n\nBut OP is so fucking regarded that if he knows about diversifying, he just shot himself in the foot because now that $700k is STUCK in Intel and he was 'planning to hold for a decade'???? Seriously? In a decade, $700k can be EASILY turned into millions if he just fucking followed the basic rule of diversifying and asking people for advice. Not fucking YOLOing into one stock. Goddamn.

You originally succumbed to optimism bias and Dunning Kruger effect (\"I am smarter than average and so will be more successful in picking single stocks than people far more experienced than myself\", with the blind confidence that comes from \"not knowing what you don't know\").\n\nBut by now just holding the single stock you are succumbing to sunk cost fallacy, whereby you are staying the course and not acting because you're already in too deep and are trying to avoid your very real losses by not realizing them through a sale. The situation has changed with new information about the company and also\u00a0hopefully some new information to yourself that gambling everything you have on one stock is not investment, it is gambling and not what the money was intended for.\n\nPlease, read the Bogleheads forum, educate yourself on long term investment, take the loss, and just put the money into VT (world index fund) and don't look at it again for 20 years. Plenty of people can retire off this amount with this strategy alone.\u00a0 If you feel like you need\u00a0some more 'play' money to lose, hold 10k of it\u00a0 to put into individual stocks - ideally transferred to a separate account so it's out of sight and out of mind.",

However, for me, this represents a new beginning - a home, a new car, and most importantly, a way to pull my family out of debt.\n\nWith that said, I\u2019ve made the decision to disable options trading forever and take my final bow. This journey has been incredibly emotional, filled with both highs and lows. WallStreetBets, you\u2019ve been more than just a community to me. You\u2019ve provided endless happiness, countless laughs, and yes, even periods of despair.\n\nTo all my fellow traders and dreamers out here, I wish you nothing but success. May you all secure the tendies, achieve those multi-baggers, and have only green lines that go up.\n\nThank you for everything. It\u2019s been real.\n\nLove,\n\nTort",

The aid program should keep with providing the aid when in certain years they might make a little more, so they can build their savings, and so that enventually they become better off and no longer need this financial aid.  If you keep people's income just near the poverty / low income lines, they will have a more difficult time to do good or willing to do good for themselves and get off the aid over time.",

Left me $800k inheritance. I'm only a junior in college as a math major and I don't really have any use for the money, nor do I have any debt (I'm very fortunate that my parents are paying for my education). I always heard about people losing their inheritance by spending it on garbage instead of investing. So I told my parents I'm not going to spend a cent of this money and I'm going to invest all of it and they were proud of me. I put 100k into a high yield savings account and bought 700k worth of Intel stock at market open. I plan on holding this for a decade depending on how it performs. \n\nHere's why I like Intel: \n\n- 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY \n\n- Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies. \n\n- With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow. \n\n- I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&D funding. \n\n- If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China & Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD \n\n- Intel has been heavily investing in R&D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&D. \n\n- Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024\n\n- The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models. \n\n- Trading at Forward PE of 17.05 \n\n- Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry \n\n- I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :) \n\n\n\n  \n",

Why do stupid people always get the upwinds like this?\n\n  \nEDIT: Seriously, OP, that's your retirement plan right there. You could be in and out of the workforce by 50, hell, 40 - If you keep that shit in the bank, collect some low-risk money with it, and you're golden. Assuming a 2% rate (which is assuming you're not very good at picking dividends) on 800k that's 16k/yr. After your four years in college you are looking at a decent down payment on a home. After that you've got your mortgage paid for, vehicles paid for, and quite a bit of wiggle room on top of that to do whatever the fuck you want. Reinvest some into risky shit like this, maybe you'll strike it big with that and now you have more money to play with without your world crashing down around you. I am BEGGING you to reconsider what you're doing here.",

How about all the other who don't file?\n\nThey don't exactly yeet it in 1 button click, but in a few years it's gone and they're back to where they were before they got the big money.\n\nSo it really works just differently: anyone who is willing to yeet that kind of cash often just hasn't earned it.\n\nBut then of course there are numerous examples of gambling addicts who make millions and then gamble them away or just buy luxury items that don't provide that kind of value. Like a $2 million car? Does it drive 1000 faster, safer or provide 1000 more space than a $2000 car?\n\nOr here's a different example: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3193418/It-s-heartbreaking-Former-friend-Wolf-Wall-Street-discovered-living-streets-sleeping-pizza-boxes.html\n\nFormer friend and colleague of the wolf is homeless.",

But I think the real problem that they want to address is that the government has no plan in place for when there will be mass unemployment due to automation. Neither do any of the presidential candidates. And companies are sure as hell not going to pay you for life if your job gets automated. Any physical labor, low skill job will be automated in the coming decades. What is the plan in place for when that happens? Should we just have less kids so they won't end up on unemployment? Should we have UBI? Should we regulate automation, or have half-n-half automation and subsidize people labor? Nobody is giving any plans for this inevitable outcome. And I say inevitable because AI is here to stay. It's clear that companies are more worried about under-spending than over-spending because they don't want to spend that money on hiring new employees, only on training models and data centers. They want to obsolete people as soon as possible.\n\nThen you might say, \"well if people can't work, how will they spend money to buy the products these companies produce?\". Well remember we have the money printer, we're already in over our heads in debt, we can get into more debt if it keeps the economy going.

Just depends on how fast shelves in the US start to empty out and prices start going up.  \n\nConversely, the ILA has been offered 50% raises, but the union won\u2019t accept without the automation clause.  I would be very surprised if they offer it because it\u2019s playing Russian roulette with your business.  China already has some automated docks, maybe not fully automated, but automated nonetheless.  If they agree to it and some enterprising company decides tomorrow that they want to build a dock and have it fully automated the only thing stopping them is money and permits.  Hell, if they were smart they would buy a decommissioned dock where most of the infrastructure is already in place.  Spiff up the infrastructure so it\u2019s top of the line, build out the automated equipment, dredge the channel so it can accept the huge cargo ships and they will hugely undercut the current docks.  I am willing to bet the permitting process wouldn\u2019t even be that difficult if it\u2019s in a southern state.  \n\nPoint being, damn near every industry has some form of automation, if the dock workers were smart they would have tried to figure out how to incorporate limited automation while losing the least amount of jobs.  Otherwise some person or company will come along and upend the industry and the dock workers will be completely fucked when it happens.  The current pay packages for dock workers would be over 200k with the 50% that was offered on Monday.  With that kind of pay package you can guarantee someone will figure out how to automate and make a killing.  It\u2019s better to ease into something on your terms than to get blindsided and completely sidelined.",

Take out even 250k to your bank account, that money will seem more real to you in your bank account than on Robinhood. Go withdraw 1k, touch and feel it and let your brain realize you have a unique opportunity to set yourself up going forward. Do your hard research about dividend stocks. Split your money up wisely, invest some in long term growth stocks and others in dividend stocks. Since you\u2019re probably a degen gambler at heart (which is how you made this money in the first place), create a different trading account on a different platform. Limit yourself to 10k to play around with and yolo. If u lose that, stop gambling on stocks. If u make money, take it out and start again with 10k. Enjoy life man and treat yourself and your loved ones (be careful not to let people know you\u2019ve made it big or you\u2019ll soon find out how quickly money can ruin the closest bonds).",

To avoid a penalty, all he needs to do is withhold enough throughout the year to match his last years tax liability or 90% of the current year. Safe to assume he didn't make $1 million last year. If he wants to make sure he isn't penalized he can just pay right now how much his tax liability was last year to ensure he's good.\n\nUltimately it would be better to put the amount he will owe into a HYSA so that it is ready to pay what he owes come tax season but gain some extra income in the meantime.

It's honestly just an opinion. \n\nYou usually can't time the market with precision, so you just say put incremental purchases into an index fund. So days you'll average up and some you'll average down. But someone who's 18 can withstand the volatility of the market ALOT longer than someone who is 45 or 50 years old. \n\nThat said, putting it into an index fund is a fine idea, but he's still on the hook for taxes when he decides to sell and what not. \n\nIf he currently is not making income, dividend interest is taxed at 0% Federally and minimally for most States. So he'd potentially get $40k tax free each year with these insane 5% rates which I think won't last forever. But this year his nominal income will probably land him in the highest tax bracket\n\nIt really depends on the individuals appetite for risk, but this is WSB's not FinancialAdvice or PovertyFinance. \n\nGood question though",

That's the real power of generational wealth. \n\nListen to the people who grew up with it and saw success and they'll tell you how it's about persevering through failure until you succeed and all the failed attempts they had before. You don't do that coming from a middle class family.

And I tell them, it takes a special kind of genius. A business genius. \n\nWe've had people, many people, come up to me and say, 'Sir, we never thought we'd see anything like this. It's historic.' And it is. We've set records. Stock market? Down more than ever. Unemployment? Higher than ever. It's incredible. And remember, it's all about making America great. We're doing things that will be talked about for centuries. \n\nThe media, the fake news media, they don't want to give us credit. But the people know. They see the greatness of what we've achieved here. It's a reversal like no other. And we're just getting started. Who knows what else we can accomplish? The ground's the limit. We've got the best people, the very best, working on making this Depression even greater. It's going to be fantastic, folks.

(e.g. containerization engine developer is different than the OS developer is different than the Cloud Infrastructure Provider). \n* CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon product contradicts their own guiding principle of \u201cZero-Trust Security\u201d.\n\n\n**COMMENTARY**\n\n* CrowdStrike\u2019s product includes a \u201cclient\u201d which runs on every \"customer endpoint\u201d (i.e. company issued laptop). Activity on the company issued laptop is reported to an internal dashboard which only an IT guy + a C-Suite admin have access to.

Not only are the astronauts\u2019 lives at stake, but also the reputation of NASA, the world\u2019s premier space agency, which has witnessed its share of tragedy over its history.",

I'm sure the market will react, but I don't know that it will be as wild as some people seem to assume. Also, it's been in the news all week that a final plan for the astronauts' return would come today.\n\nI don't understand the surprise.

Any post who has been paying attention to the situation knew this was going to happen weeks ago. \n\n[Here is a comment I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1cy2pii/comment/lgdkckc/) 3 weeks ago predicting exactly what ended up happening. (I wasn\u2019t the only one, not patting myself on the back)\n\nin the comment, i say:\n\n- NASA is going to do an unmanned return of Starliner\n- They\u2019re going to return the crew on SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon\n- Starliner will be tested on the return orbit to see how it would have fared\n- It\u2019s very likely that Starliner is perfectly fine, but the level of engineering analysis needed to quantify the risk cannot be possibly done remotely from space, and therefore they cannot guarantee a 99.7% success likelihood that NASA requires for manned spaceflight.\n\nThis is *exactly* why Crew Dragon and Starliner were both developed. Because if one of them became potentially unsafe, they wouldn\u2019t be stranding astronauts in space. NASA requires a well-quantified risk for manned spaceflight and they could not satisfy their protocol because of the level of root cause analysis needed is impossible to do from orbit. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that Boeing is going to crumble, really, nor does it mean that Starliner is cooked. \n\n*However*, if the unmanned return flight goes poorly\u2026 *then* Starliner might be cooked. NASA has indicated they expect it will go fine, but they can\u2019t hit the 99.7% certainty necessary to qualify it for manned spaceflight without knowing why those thrusters failed. Of course, stocks are reactionary, so who knows what will happen with the stock. Imo it will be a good time to buy if it tanks lol. But I will probably just sit on the sidelines.",

If all NASA wanted was redundancy, they could just contract SpaceX to keep another Crew Dragon on standby at all times. Or build twice as many capsules. But they want *dissimilar* redundancy. So they need another company that does their own design from scratch.\n\nAnd it's not like this was a hard problem to overcome. NASA has the measurements for all the astronauts.

This screenshot doesn't capture the daily massive losses he's taking while trying to hit the jackpot.\n\nIt's just gambling on a degenerate scale. This isn't some genius prediction. OP is just burning money rolling the dice and hoping to come out on top. He's so far in the hole that even this jackpot, which would be life-changing to a normal person, leaves him significantly in the red.\n\nOP, I'm happy for ya, this is a cool screenshot, I hope you cashed out. But it's VERY important for people to realize what's going on here so they don't get FOMO and think they can throw their life savings on a single play and get similar results.\n\nPeople: unless you can support big gambles like this multiple times per day, you can't afford to do this. If you just do it once, you'll just lose your money.",

His home, car, life savings, everything he had, and bought lottery tickets for some mega big prize. \n\nHe was sure that the reason why people didn't win, was because they just didn't invest enough, and he figured, throw everything in, and it was a sure fire bet. (he may have had some sort of \"plan\" not sure). \n\nAt any rate, he lost everything in that gamble. Bankrupt from trying to win the lottery. \n\nI also read somewhere that someone came up with a number pattern to play the lottery, but in order for it to be successful, you had to spend a few hundred for each draw, and statistically you'd come out on top. The guy that developed it did it, but he had to play for over a year, and nearly blew all his money in doing so, but eventually won a jackpot.\n\nOf course if that story is true (and I honestly have nothing to back it up), 1 win doesn't prove a system, and not many people are in a position to test that theory.",

Whereas people my age only get maybe $25-35 for each dollar invested, and it only gets worse deeper into your 30s and 40s, so I'd highly advise to NOT do that with anymore than 5-10% of your total investments.

            "text": "TL;DR: my gullible grandson wipes my ass to get into my will because I told him I bought 4,000 $NVDA shares (1,000 shares pre 4:1 split) in 2018/2019 and am now sitting on >$2.5 million in NVDA.\n\nI'm 87 and immobile in a wheelchair and don't know anything about semiconductors or anything else technology related. I cannot Google or text, and I currently have someone who lives in my home 24/7 and wipes my ass for me. However, I'm a damn intuitive savant when it comes to tricking gullible kids.\n\nI did grow up in the biggest bull market in human history with some Boomers printing money like Chuck E. Cheese bucks.. and everyone is a genius in a bull market.. Well almost everyone. I didn't invest so now I just scam Millennials and Zoomers.\n\nAnyway, I like talking stocks with my grandson because it\u2019s something we could connect on, and I have a ton of experience selling worthless advice to idiots. So in 2018 we were talking about the market, and I casually brought up Nvidia. He thought I didn't guide him to that at all. He bought Nvidia in 2017 so he was familiar with it although he bought his shares at 18 yrs old with $2k he had saved up. Nothing insane although he kept 90% to this day. I said I saw NVIDIA in a newspaper article with someone recommending it for elderly\u2019s retirement accounts. So I told my grandson I was an OGangster, called my broker and bought 1,000 shares on the spot because in my words: \u201cI don\u2019t buy a stock if I can\u2019t afford 1,000 shares\u201d. Something only the Zoomers dumb enough to buy meme stocks would fall for. \n\nHe was dumbstruck because here he thought he was doing great with his savings over the years, and I just humbled his ass with a completely made up sentence. Add in the 4:1 stock split, and now he thinks I'm sitting on 4,000 shares. (I \"confirmed\" it to him when he brought it up in the last month). I haven't sold a dime and don't even know what the price is doing day to day because I don't own any shares.  I'm just chilling in my wheelchair and letting him try to get a bigger share of the inheritance. He called and celebrated with me the other day because he transparently wants to get in my will. He thinks I'm already wealthy and dumb enough to drop 6 figures on a stock I know little about.\n\nHe hopes to inherit my wealth someday, but he\u2019s also a scammy, golddigging SOB and he knows it! Told me \u201chaha you're a genius investor and luck has nothing to do with\u201d. Thought id share here because I\u2019m not sharing this IRL, but I find it pretty ironic my dumb ass grandson is outwiping 95% of this sub. Wendy's boys included.",

                    "body": "**ChatGPT, write me a r/wallstreetbets shitpost about Nvidia, a grandfather and his grandson**\n\n\n[Post](https://i.imgur.com/NG7EgcT.png):\n\nAlright, fellow degenerates, strap in and grip your tendies tight, because I\u2019m about to take you on a wild ride through the stock market savanna with none other than Grandpa Diamond Hands and his trusty sidekick, Little Timmy. This isn't just any tale. It's the saga of how a boomer with balls of steel and his millennial heir-apparent took on the Nvidia colossus and came out smelling like a rose bathed in YOLO sauce.\n\n#Chapter 1: The Awakening\n\nIt all started on a stormy afternoon. Grandpa, a veteran of the dot-com bubble and a survivor of the '08 financial meltdown, decided it was time to pass on his wisdom. Between sips of whiskey and yelling at the TV, he turned to Timmy and said, \"Listen here, you little rascal, the secret to unfathomable wealth isn\u2019t in saving... it's in the art of the YOLO.\"\n\nTimmy, whose investment experience was limited to losing money on a videogame retailer, was intrigued. \"But Grandpa,\" he inquired, \"where do we start?\"\n\nWith a gleam in his eye, Grandpa pulled up a chart of Nvidia. \"Graphics cards, my boy! The world's thirst for these silicon beauties is unquenchable. And with every gamer, crypto miner, and ~~AI researcher~~ horny millennials clamoring for more, it's our ticket to the moon!\"\n\n#Chapter 2: The Bet\n\nArmed with nothing but a 100 MB of data and a Robinhood account funded by years of neglected birthday checks, they began their quest. Grandpa, with his ancient wisdom, saw beyond the mere mortals' fear of PE ratios and market corrections. \"To Valhalla!\" he exclaimed, as they went all in on Nvidia calls right before earnings.\n\nThe snobs at r / investing laughed. \"Foolish boomers and their millennial minions,\" they sneered, \"they stand no chance. Nvidia is overvalued\"\n\nBut Grandpa Diamond Hands wasn\u2019t just any investor. He had seen companies rise and fall, fortunes made and lost, all while keeping his hands steadier than a surgeon on Adderall.\n\n#Chapter 3: The Rollercoaster\n\nEarnings day came, and with it, volatility that would make even the most seasoned trader's heart skip a beat. Nvidia\u2019s stock did the cha-cha, sliding down faster than DMs in an Instagram model's inbox, only to rocket up moments later.\n\nTimmy's face was a palette of human emotion, painting a picture of hope, despair, and the kind of intense gastrointestinal discomfort one feels after mixing wendies tendies with Taco Bell.\n\nBut Grandpa? Cool as a cumin capered cucumber \"In the stock market, you either ride the wave or get wiped out,\" he said, adjusting his aviator glasses as if he were about to drop the hottest mixtape of 1985.\n\n#Chapter 4: To the Moon\n\nAs the dust settled, the impossible happened. Nvidia announced groundbreaking developments, sending their stock soaring higher than Snoop Dogg at a 4/20 festival. Grandpa and Timmy's calls were now worth more than the GDP of a small island nation.\n\nThe Wall Street bets crowd went wild. Memes of Grandpa Diamond Hands were plastered all over the internet, hailed as the prophet of profit, the sultan of stocks, the absolute unit of unbridled financial recklessness.\n\nTimmy, now a true believer in the church of YOLO, looked up to his grandfather, tears of joy and visions of Lamborghinis dancing in his eyes. \"What now, Grandpa?\" he asked.\n\nGrandpa, looking off into the sunset, said, \"We do it all over again tomorrow, my boy. For the market giveth, and the market taketh away. But with NASDAQ: NVDA the market mostly just giveth.\"\n\nAnd so, the legend of Grandpa Diamond Hands and his grandson Timmy was born, a tale whispered in the hallowed halls of r/wallstreetbets, inspiring generations of traders to turn their dreams into memes, and their memes into dreams.\n\nRemember, kids, this tale is for entertainment purposes only. Don't try this at home unless you're prepared to live in a shoebox on mainstreet, sucking of bankman friedies for ICO tips. \n\nAnd always remember, in the grand casino of the stock market, the house always wins... unless you're Grandpa Diamond Hands. Then you just YOLO your way to Valhalla.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. However, for those looking for insane returns, consider the obvious strategy of taking out a second mortgage on your house and YOLO'ing it all on nvidia calls. And now that I think about, if they upload me in to a RTX 9090 I could probably Live More Than Once.*",

This ain't your average financial advice (because let's be real, who here listens anyway?), this is about family, green crayons, and tendieman himself.\n\nSo picture this: Grandpappy Grifty, a seasoned ape who remembers when AAPL was just a fruit, is chillin' on the porch with his grandson, Lil' Billy, a fresh-faced noob with dreams of lambos and mansions. Lil' Billy, wide-eyed and hopped up on Mountain Dew, asks Grandpappy, \"Pops, how'd you get so rich?\"\n\nGrandpappy Grifty, his eyes twinkling like a diamond-encrusted casino slot machine, takes a drag from his ancient vape pen and says, \"Son, it all started with a little company called Nvidia. Back in my day, they were just makin' fancy graphics cards for nerds. But I knew, deep in my plums, that this was the future, son. The future of VR, of AI, of  MOON  trips!\"\n\nLil' Billy, ever the skeptic (damn kids these days with their avocado toast and whatnot), scoffs. \"But Grandpappy, everyone said they were overpriced! They were just for gamers!\"\n\nGrandpappy Grifty throws his head back and lets out a chuckle that could curdle milk. \"Overpriced? Son, that's just what the suits want you to think! They want you to paperhand your shares like a scaredy-cat. But a true ape, he knows the diamond hands are the only way to tendie land!\"\n\nAnd so, Grandpappy Grifty, with the wisdom of a thousand memes and the risk tolerance of a squirrel on a meth bender, yolo'd his life savings on $NVDA. And wouldn't you know it, the stonks d to the moon! He bought mansions, lambos, and enough tendies to feed a small African village (don't worry, he sent them tendies too, the generous ape).\n\nNow, Lil' Billy, inspired by his Grandpappy's tendie-fueled success, stares at his phone, fingers hovering over the buy button for $NVDA. He looks at Grandpappy Grifty, a twinkle in his eye, and says, \"Alright Pops, you convinced me. Let's send it!\"\n\nAnd thus, the cycle continues. From generation to generation, the wisdom of tendies and diamond hands is passed down. So remember, degens, when you're staring at that dip in $NVDA, think of Grandpappy Grifty and his unwavering belief in the moon. Now go forth, buy the dip, and tendie your way to Valhalla!\n\nP.S. This is not financial advice. I'm just a language model who likes to gamble responsibly (not really). So do your own DD, you beautiful degenerates. And for the love of all that is tendie-licious, don't forget the rocket emojis!\n\nP.P.S. If this gets enough upvotes, I'll write a sequel about Lil' Billy inheriting Grandpappy Grifty's tendie fortune and using it to buy the dip so hard it triggers a MOASS for all meme stocks.",

MSTR closed at 1425 so his expectation was he would exercise his long calls (buy MSTR for $1370/share) and the owner of his 1420 short calls would exercise so the shares he bought at $1370 would be sold for $1420.  \n\n\nUnfortunately for OP the short calls didn't get exercised and the stock went down AH to $1405 AND it is possible it will open even lower Monday morning.  So OP is sitting on something like $550k worth of MSTR stock without having had the funds to pay for the stock and RH might force sell his shares at the open.  \n\n\nSo not a $535k loss but sitting at high risk depending on the market at the open Monday morning of losing a lot of money... or making a lot of money.",

Its an obscure risk factor of trading spreads called pin risk.  Its why you should close all spreads before they expire.",

With minimal affect to the account.\u00a0\n\nMore complex: the 1420C\u2019s he sold as part of the spread were assigned. Meaning he had to short sell 100 shares per contract. I believe what\u2019s shown here is the cost of being short those shares of MSTR after the assignment. But he does receive a credit for shorting those shares that isn\u2019t mentioned by RH because that credit will be used by RH to exercise the long calls he owns as part of the spread. So on Monday they\u2019ll auto-exercise the 1370C\u2019s he owns to close the position. The only affect to the account is that he\u2019ll be carrying negative deltas over the weekend and may lose a bit if it gaps up, but nothing substantial.\u00a0",

What that means is that you have the Option to exercise your Contract at any time before the expiration at that strike price. There are two (main) types of options, Calls and Puts. Essentially a Call bets that the Stock is going to go up, a Put bets that it will go down. So just as an example if you buy NVDA 3/15 900C, that means you're purchasing the option to buy 100 shares of Nvidia at $900 a share, anytime before end of day 3/15. So if on Monday Nvidia hits $1,000 you could execute your contract, buy 100 shares for $90,000 and immediately sell your 100 shares, and make $10,000. However, you could also simply sell your contract, which might net you more or less money, but also wouldn't require you to lay out $90,000.\n\nThere's so much, much more to it than that, but that's what I would call the absolute basics.",

Stocks require a lot of knowledge of the market in general, a different type of fundamentals and a different kind of sentiment than FX. I don't know anything about it, and I'm not interested in it either. I trade XU exclusively and I consistently have a positive PnL.\n\nI have watched XU in action on a daily basis for a very long time. I haven't said anywhere that I don't lose sometimes. That's part of trading. XU has a unique behaviour that can be read fairly accurately, especially _after_ the news releases that have a high impact, because it has an almost 1:1 correlation with DXY. People generally combine TA with FA and SA, and that's necessary, if you're staying in trades for an entire day or more extended period of time. I don't do that. I scalp shorter movements, rarely longer than 20 minutes. Those movements can be predicted fairly accurately based on the general behavior of the instrument.\n\nI don't understand why people have such a hard time understanding this. It's not rocket science, and it's right there in front of you. It's a combination of market structure, price action and a lot of experience with a single instrument. I find pattern recognition fairly easy, and I'm not talking about double tops and double bottoms kind of bullshit, I'm talking about identifying unique recurring behaviours of said instrument. Such as, when pivots generally happen, how far they tend to pull back, and how far they tend to stretch. Nothing else is important because this covers the E, SL and TP. The biggest mistake people make is applying general rules to every instrument they trade. What works on one instrument probably won't work on another instrument.\n\nI'm not sure why you're trying to convince me that what I'm doing isn't working. Am I dreaming right now lol? I guess MetaTrader is glitching.",

If you don\u2019t care about finance/economics you likely wouldn't know who Jerome Powell is, even if you are American. If you are into finance and economics, you should definitely know who he is, regardless of your nationality given the importance of both the dollar and the American stock market. I doubt that the average European knows who Christine Lagarde is. This has nothing to do with nationality~~\n\nIt's less about being American, and more about being interested in finance and economics. The average American is as unlikely to know who Jerome Powell (Chair of the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the US, and the guy in the video) is as the average European to know who Christine Lagarde is (President of the European Central Bank). If you are into finance and economics, you will definitely know who Jerome Powell is, regardless of your nationality due to the influence of the American economy and the dollar. Monetary decisions in the US have knock-on effects in many other economies due to the interconnectedness of the global financial system.",

The primary comment made a remark about TA, in a way of it being an invalid way of trading the news. I was showing that it's not invalid at all, if you know how to apply it and understand how a particular instrument reacts to the different news events.\n\nI use TA primarily as a confluence trading XU. It has a repeating almost identical effect _almost every single time_. Stands to reason I'd place my trades exactly the same way I do, every time the news comes, because it works. Isn't that what a strategy is? Finding an edge based on high probability setups? My biggest mistake was sharing it on Reddit. This works for me, no matter what your opinion on the matter is. See how that works? You can keep writing here and make clever comments, but the end game is that I win my trades on the news using pure TA, and you're a keyboard warrior.",

The contract is now worth $5350. If you bought one of these contracts you\u2019d be able to buy 100 shares of AVGO at $1000 which would be worth $100k. So you\u2019d spend $105350. At the price of $1050, that wouldn\u2019t be profitable(you\u2019d be negative $350), but the reason people are willing to buy the contract at that price is because it hasn\u2019t expired yet, so they must expect the price to continue going up before expiry, allowing them to profit. That, or it could be people who have the opposite position and want to correct it. Again, pricing of options is a pretty complicated function that has a lot of variables.\n\nEdit: also the reason OPs gains are so stark is because it was highly unexpected movement of the underlying stock value. Betting on a 6% swing in a short amount of time is priced very low because it\u2019s less likely. Then it came true. That\u2019s why people equate options trading with playing the lotto.",

We know 1 contract is for 100 shares, so really that means a single contract cost a total of 100 shares x 1.10 per share price = 110 (plus some small broker fees unseen here).\n\nThey didn't buy 1 contract tho, they bought 100 contracts. That's 100 contracts x 110 contract price = 11,000 for all the contracts. And that's 100 contracts, with each contract saying they can potentially buy 100 shares per contract = 10,000 shares total at a guaranteed 1000 dollars per share. This price is fixed, per the contract..\n\nShare price right now is sitting at 1072, so they could technically exercise the 100 contracts (buy 10,000 shares) at 1000 dollars per share, and turn around and sell each share on the open market for 1072. That's 1072 (them selling) - 1000 (them buying) = +72 per share x 10,000 shares = +720,000 profit if they can exercise.. minus the 11,000 fee they paid for the contracts themselves, so not a bad return at all.\n\nAlternatively, the contracts originally valued at 1.10 per share now go for 53.50.. so if they don't have the cash to buy and sell all those 10,000 shares (10k shares x 1000 dollars = 10mill), they could just sell the contracts for 53.50 each. 53.50 - 1.10 = 52.40 x 100 contracts x 100 shares = 524,000 return.\n\nHopefully that makes sense.",

The catch of course is that many of the best sources of info for making an informed decision also qualify as insider trading - if you expect a stock to go up because you know someone who's drafting their quarterly report and they tip you off, you just go to jail for cheating (unless you're in Congress).",

There was a few days of time decay.. but the underlying exploded and added a ton of value. If the underlying stayed the same\nprice or went down, it could be worth pennies instead.

They wanted that too. The thing was: the Boing 737 was a little lower to the ground than the corresponding Airbus, so a larger engine would not fit. \n\nThat meant that Boing had to change so much on the 737 that it would basically become a new airplane regulatory wise, and that would be expensive. They struggled for a while to fit the larger engine onto the 737 and eventually came up with a solution: mount it a little further in front of the wing. The airplane could stay the same and the 737 Max was born. \n\nMoving the engine further forward did have an impact: it caused the stability of the airplane to change. The 737 max would now push it's nose upwards. This was a change to the 737 that would mean pilots would need new training - and that is also expensive. \n\nSo what did Boing do? they kept this raising of the nose a secret and instead installed a computer system, that would make the pilots feel they were flying a normal 737. \n\nThe computer system MCAS would simply push down the nose, when the nose normally would push up. The MCAS would simply correct the pitch of the airplane without the knowledge of the pilots. \n\nWe know that the pilots onboard the 737 max of Ethiopean Airlines were struggeling to keep the nose up. We also know that the MCAS kept correcting the nose down. Eventually the MCAS won and the 737 max crashed straight into the ground nose first. Killing every single person onboard.",

Guys who had been there for 10+ years became a cost liability as opposed to an asset and they slowly chipped away at skilled labor and middle managers.\n\nAnd the death knell was moving a big portion of their manufacturing to South Carolina to avoid labor laws/unions - except building planes is skilled labor and they can\u2019t find enough people in SC to manage the factories so they have the Washington State based staff constantly flying back and forth and high turnover which meant very little continuity in oversight.",

I fully see the potential in it, and how powerful continuous improvement can be due to the compounding interest effect.  Spending half an hour making an improvement that saves 15 seconds a day will, in 6 months or less, lead to more productivity! \n\nThe problem is that the directors/management seemed to have a very different view on what was important in Kaizen and cherry-picked the stuff they liked, omitting the parts they didn't like. They had me read a book on it by an author I don't remember, who seemed like he missed the forest for the trees. He pretty much outright wrote \"don't worry about feedback from your employees, change should be led from the top down\". The author even trimmed 5S down to 3S! The author also wrote that he had poor adoption of the system by his staff at his facility, which on one hand I get that people are naturally resistant to change, but I think it had more to do with his interpretation of Kaizen. His solution was to fire anyone who pushed back: around three quarters of his workforce.\n\nAnother frustration was that we were constantly told that we needed to make these continuous improvements, but were not given time, budget, or resources to make these changes. If production numbers were lower than the previous day because we spent half an hour making CI changes we would get reprimanded. If the KPIs dropped at all there would be an investigation. They wanted all of the benefits of continuous improvement without any of the investment.\n\nA final bit of frustration came from the fact that we were in pharmaceuticals which is of course a highly regulated industry. Tight regulations and heavy documentation on every process leads to a lot of inherent resistance to change. When making ANY change to the process flow requires multiple layers of review and quite a bit of paperwork, there's inherently a larger initial time investment required for any change. That's not to say that continuous improvement can't work, but you need to be smart about it. The payoff in time savings needs to be enough to justify the time cost of implementation, and you might need to be looking farther into the future for when your time investments start paying off. There's things you can do to help mitigate this like saving up a number of smaller changes and pushing them all through in one process review, but no matter how I tried to explain this to management they didn't get it. They instead instructed us to just make their changes without going through the necessary pathways which constantly got us in trouble with regulatory and quality control. \n\nSorry to bitch, I just feel like far too many people in manufacturing treat Kaizen and lean manufacturing as just another buzzword and \"adopt it\" without actually understanding the core principles. I've since left that company and am much better for it!",

                    "body": "The basis of my strategy is that past performance does not determine future prices. This means that day trading or value trading in general is basically gambling at a roulette wheel. Sure you can set your probabilities but they will always favor the house because of the 0 and 00.\n\nThe goal is not to buy low and sell high, it's to buy low and hold forever. \n\n  \nWe still want stocks that maintain their value and have liquidity in case maybe you get smacked with a major financial burden and have to pull out to pay bills. But it's not the main goal for growth.\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/industry/151/reit---mortgage-trusts](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/industry/151/reit---mortgage-trusts)\n\nMost of the ones on this list are pretty good. I actually struggled to find negative examples bc I was looking through this list.\n\n  \nThe most important thing I look at is a good dividend chart. This is why I like to use macrotrends, it is the only tracker I've found that displays dividends as a chart.\n\nHere are some examples:  \n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BNS/bank-of-nova-scotia/dividend-yield-history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BNS/bank-of-nova-scotia/dividend-yield-history) (decent)  \n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/T/at-t/dividend-yield-history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/T/at-t/dividend-yield-history) (OK)\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/F/ford-motor/dividend-yield-history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/F/ford-motor/dividend-yield-history) (bad)\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CICHY/china-construction-bank/stock-price-history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CICHY/china-construction-bank/stock-price-history) (horrible)\n\nAnother metric you can use is looking at the options chain. The options fees will often tell you whether the stock is bearish or bullish. This is kind of a way to evaluate what the actual traders in a market think are going to happen. \n\nYou also of course need to critically think about what you are investing in. For example, Ford has a bad dividend chart, but if you evaluate them as a company you can understand that it's still probably a decent investment, at least for now while we have a car dependent society. Similarly some stocks might have good dividend graphs but the business is really shortsighted and will crash in the future. Generally though I find that a strong dividend chart is almost always signaling a strong company. \n\n  \nThink of it like you are a bank evaluating if you should give someone a loan, or a landlord/leech looking to rent out a property. If they have a strong history of consistent payments for the past decade, you can be pretty sure they will keep paying out in the future. Dividends are a way to buy an investors trust if you are consistent.\n\n----- Notes -------\n\nIt's important to understand, you are not looking for charts that go up necessarily for dividend yields like you would trading stocks by value. Here we are looking for strong consistent payments over a long period of time. For example oil companies might have very quickly increasing dividends, but that is actually because they are compensating for a declining industry. \n\nGenerally you can tell by the spacings on the graph if the company is doing their dividends to compensate for something or if they are just consistent dividend providers. Irregular spacing isn't necessarily bad, but it's a signal that they may be doing panic payments to avoid the value of the company dropping.\n\nNote: I'm not a billionaire. It's important to note that the ideal strategy changes when you have the capital to make larger moves. The way that billionaires use stocks is differently than we do. My goal is passive income that I intend to pay taxes on but be capable of living off of so I can retire. Billionaires are value traders, this is because they don't pay for things in cash. They get very low interest equity loans against their stock portfolio so that they never have to pay taxes on it. Then their portfolios are so large and diverse that they will always make enough extra to pay off the small amount of interest. Technically the average person \\*could\\* do this, but you would not get the same interest rates so it would not be effective. \n\nEdit: Also pay close attention to the cycles of capitalism. Every 4 to 8 years the economy crashes due to the inherent instability of capitalism. Major years like 2008 or 2019/2020 are ways to evaluate how the company will perform when the economy is crashing. Or for example if it's an airline, look at 2001 and 2020.",

And until I see some good data on people who try to do otherwise that out perform that strategy on a time horizon approaching retirement I don't really see your point.\n\nWhat's your goal? If it's to retire in 30ish years, have you ever looked into the long term performance on that time scale of people who try to pursue active trading strategies? Sure, some people take the gambles and get super rich *especially in the short term*. And others VOO and chill for 30 years and can't retire, but *more* people who actively trade end up below the market on a long time period like that than otherwise. \n\nAnd if you have some data that tells you otherwise to give you confidence in your approach, id love to see it because I'm genuinely curious if I'm wrong on the subject.\n\nAt the end of the day you're probably more like the average investor than the exceptional skilled/lucky example person/fund you can come up with. And if you're saying you're going to spend all day researching what moves to make like professional investors do, you better put a cost on that time as well.

For those who do not understand how this works, a brief explanation\n\n1. Many traders were borrowing Jap Yen (JPY) at low interest rates, converted them to USD and used this to buy US stocks\n\n2. Now that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is raising interest rates, the JPY has strengthened significantly against the USD. \n\nNow, these traders are in big shit. Not only must they pay higher interest for the JPY they borrowed, they are now facing huge forex losses as well. The USD assets they are holding may not be enough to repay the JPY they have borrowed. \n\n3. This is causing a huge unwind of these trade positions. Traders facing big losses and margin calls are selling their US stocks to raise USD, converting back to JPY and paying back their loans. \n\n4. This can lead to more selling pressure on US stocks and even more declines in the short term.  Middle east war escalation, US political uncertainty is also adding to the fear and panic.\n\nsource: @adamkhoo",

And I was asking him \"well what if a choice that provides short term profit destroys long term value in the company because customers don't trust the company anymore?\"  And they just refused to admit that's even a thing.  For them, their ability to just sell and buy something else was all that mattered.\n\nBear in mind I'm about as financially literate as a cantelope.  But it occurs to me that when investors can just dip in and out on a whim, and then they get leverage over decision making at a company, they have... zero incentive to care about the long term health of an investment.  They just want arrow go up.  Even if there's no reason that it should (between major product releases, retaining talent they can't get back because they'll need it soon even if not right now, etc), they just want big number go bigger.\n\nNever been an investor of any significance, but from the outside I just don't see how that's healthy.",

It's super interesting, because they've actually been positioning to ENCOURAGE inflation during the economic downturn. Long story short, i entered and exited a few positions as JPY continued tanking, and opened a 5% of portfolio position 3 months ago. It had to bottom, and the BOJ was floating some interest in intervening, which would be the trigger for JPY shorts to unravel. When they did start unraveling in mid July, I had a hunch that this was it, and that's when I added an aditional 20% to the position in FXY OTM options.  \n\nLong short of it all: be curious and explore things you don't understand.

It\u2019s really fucking simple.\n\nI have 100 shares of Apple, worth $100 each. In total, I have $10,000 of stock.\n\nYou think Apple will go up up. You\u2019d like to make as much money as you can off this move, but you only have $100.\n\nYou can buy 1 share of Apple, and wait a day, then sell at $101 and make $1 profit.\n\nOr, you can buy a option contract to make a more leveraged bet to try to make more profit.\n\nIn this scenario, instead of you purchasing the shares, I agree I will loan them to you for the day. For this service, I will charge you all of your $100, but for this day, you temporarily hold 100 shares instead of one.\n\nWhen you make this purchase, you will have to specify a price you think the shares will end the day at. For this example, we\u2019ll just use $100, as you think the stock will go up from here.\n\nIf Apple has a great day and goes to $102, I have now made (102-100)*100 = $200.\n\nWe have to remember that you paid $100 for this service, so I walk away with $100 in profit.\n\nSo instead of buying shares and making $2 on this move, your call option has generated x50 the return.\n\nOn the flip side, if Apple doesn\u2019t reach the price you thought it would, the contract will be voided, and I keep your $100 and you get nothing.\n\nSo while your gains can be quite large, let\u2019s say Apple ends the day down 1 cent at $99.99; your share would have lost you 1 cent, your options contract lost you your entire portfolio.\n\nCongrats, you now understand call options.\n\nThis is basically an ELI5 and is leaving out some of the intricacies, but if you understand this, you understand the idea behind options.",

I had to pay taxes on the gains to Dec. 31st, even though I had lost much of it in January, so I had to cash in my account to pay the taxes and was unable to trade for a year. Trading is hard enough, but then when you add in the tax issues it can really get tough. \n\nSame thing with stocks as we all know - you have to pay taxes on your gains, but can only deduct 3k of the losses. So, the idea is to force traders to NOT trade. The government should just tax all trading on a mark to market basis and all gains and losses are tallied up at the end of the year. Your tax return shouldn't look like a phone book. The wash sale rule is another anti trading rule. It just complicates everything for no reason. The income tax code is a huge mess. I run into this every year at tax time along with all other traders. Looking back at my trading if I had just held onto all of my stocks and never sold I would have been better off.",

Like I said in another comment, AI is booming now and they will need servers, data centres etc to make use of it all, and Dell is a market leader in that area and are well known. Also, things in my personal life, like I see all the people around me switching to PCs that use GPUs, and people using AI more and more just makes sense to trade these stocks. I also only really play around earning calls which is high risk high reward so don't play with anything you can't afford or be upset with loosing.",

The same mentality that got it for you in the first place is the same mentality that lost it. \n\nYou didn\u2019t lose anything because you still have your initial money. This is very different to plowing $500k into the market to lose $490K. That\u2019s easy. It gets done every day by massive players who expect to then make it back on the next $500K play. \n\nStay strong and take a big deep breath. There\u2019s always tomorrow. \n\nI\u2019m always happy to chat if you need to unload the guilt.",

Its going to bother you on and off for a long time. I keep thinking why i couldnt just be happy with 700k? I was going for over a million for the first time in my life and wasnt patient enough to do it with stocks. Once u get on that high from winning big, it feels like u cant lose. I kept telling myself ill get it back the whole time. One good trade. I started with 8k so its not like i lost 700k. Also i wld never have made it without a risky options trade. Just keep your head up and dont be in a rush to get it all back at once. Were both gonna find the right trade again but it cant be forced.",

I started liquidating the portfolio to purchase more puts,  Ended up cashing out at $140k and losing the whole portfolio, I had a family member change the password to my trading account so I stop the losses lol.

Really badly. And it should.\n\nGetting over it is the hard part, and chewbaccashotlast's comment is spot on.   \nTake some time off, and get over it, whatever way works for you, before you try again, or you'll just lose more.   \n  \nThe money is gone. but It's a really good lesson for the future, on managing risk and loss a lot better.  \n  \nRevenge trading, always thinking about getting back the losses etc. usually doesn't work, so it's better to just stop while you're still ahead, until you get over that shit, and ready to jump in again, and then start really really small to begin with, until you get some confidence back.   \n  \nFrom my experience, losing a lot of money isn't the worst part, even though it hurts. Losing confidence and having your balls shrink to peanuts is the worst part, going from betting $100k on a gut feeling to barely having the balls to put $1k on a good stock.   \n  \nThat will pass though, with a little time, and everyone is different, some people take loss harder than others, but that doesn't really matter, what matters is the ability to get past it.  \n  \nAlways remember the losses, so you're less likely to do it again, but at the same time you have to get over it, and not dwell on it, to be even more successful going forward.\n\nI think all good traders at some point has lost a substantial amount of money, and that the horrible feeling and fear of losing a lot of money again, is good, as long as it isn't crippling, and it's mixed with about the same amount of greed.",

This cognitive bias leads individuals to think that if an event has occurred less frequently than expected, it is more likely to happen in the future, or vice versa. \n\nThis fallacy is commonly associated with gambling, where people might believe that after a series of losses, a win is due, or after a series of one outcome, the opposite is more likely to occur. The classic example of this fallacy occurred at the Monte Carlo Casino in 1913, when the roulette wheel landed on black 26 times in a row, leading gamblers to bet heavily on red, erroneously believing it was due to occur.",
