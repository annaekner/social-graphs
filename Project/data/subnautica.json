Give me back the distant roars and the terror rather than just a jump scare machine. I do not hate below zero, but the original game was gold. Let me feel alone on an alien world again; Subnautica can be a buggy and chugging mess. the pay off of being scared and hearing monsters in the distance, feeling truly alone above a deep dark abyss, that makes up for its short comings.

Bases are more customizable with an overhauled building system. New tools allow for greater adaptation to the world.\n\nUncover Diverse New Biomes\nFrom towering underwater cliffs to lush coral fields, this aquatic alien world is brimming with vibrant and breathtaking biomes, each teeming with diverse ecosystems and unique creatures. But something isn\u2019t right. The world is out of balance. What happened here? What happened to you? And more importantly, where are you?\n\nStudy Mysterious Lifeforms\nUncover a rich world full of mysterious lifeforms, from the smallest fish to the largest Leviathans. Scan creatures to learn more about them. Use your Biosampler to take samples for study. As you learn more about this world, evolve your genetics to adapt your body for survival.\n\nSurvive Terrifying Depths\nThis world is vast and deep. Venture beyond the safety of shallow waters, descending into a dark unknown. Wonder and danger lurks around every corner. To survive this planet, you\u2019ll need to push beyond your boundaries and unlock the secrets of this strange world.\n\nAbout the Team\nSubnautica 2 is being created by Unknown Worlds, a fully remote studio that traces its roots back to the 2002 Half-Life mod Natural Selection. It is the same studio that created the original Subnautica. The team is scattered around the globe, from the United States to the United Kingdom, France, Iceland, Austria, Australia, Canada, India, and many more places.\n\nGame Preview\nSubnautica 2 will be a Game Preview game meaning it will be in active development at release. You may encounter bugs, in-development features, and performance issues. We will be adding additional biomes, creatures, craftables, and narrative as we proceed. Join us in Game Preview and help shape the future of Subnautica 2.\"\n\n\n-From the xbox store listing.",

The pacing of progression, both equipment and knowledge was absolutely phenomenal. I felt like in Below Zero you already had a bunch of cool stuff and/or the process of getting new stuff wasn't as exciting because I already knew most of it existed. In fact the whole game just had way less mystery than the original. I wonder how they could possible correct that in Subnautica 2 or that ship has just sailed and it will just be about a new story with like 80% the same gear.",

Would have liked to have had Robin and Ryley as the player characters but ah well. \n\nOther than that it looks insane, and I believe it's a strong candidate for GotY 2025\n\nAlso no PS5 compatibility?

This could be as simple as \"you'll have to start a new save because your old save is incompatible with some technical updates we made\" or it could be as serious as \"we literally changed what the entire story is about so the stuff you've already experienced basically never happened\". \n- If the studio closes, loses funding, changes direction, etc. the project may be abandoned and you're stuck with a half-baked game that will never be finished. That's pretty unlikely to happen in this case but it has happened to other Early Access games in the past (like Kerbal Space Program 2).\n\nFor what it's worth: I'm usually very cautious about Early Access games and it's pretty rare that I'll buy in to them, especially when they're just starting out like Subnautica 2 is. My normal rule is that I don't buy in to an Early Access title unless the game is already playable and fun enough to be worth the asking price, even if development suddenly stopped on it  tomorrow. In other words I don't normally buy based on future promises, I buy based on what state the game is in NOW.\n\nThat being said: Subnautica 2 may be an exception, I haven't decided yet. The first Subnautica is one of my all-time favorite games, and while Below Zero wasn't quite as strong it was still a good game that I didn't regret purchasing. So in my opinion the studio has a proven track record and has earned some goodwill with me.",

I do think feeling lost and in danger was critical to the first game having a lot of the tension that it did. Below zero just isn\u2019t that scary because you\u2019ll eventually find the next thing if you just drive around to it, and if you die, well you\u2019ll just go back again, no need to re-navigate and remember, very little risk of getting lost on the way.

We've been using our ps4 as our livingroom's entertainment center hub for years now, even after the disc drive stopping reading discs of any sort. Thankfully we have a roommate with a laptop should we ever want to watch physical movies on our tv.\n\nEDIT: Apparently some people were getting uppity about me calling GoW an RPG. So yes, upon reading the definition further, an RPG game must basically give the player the ability to affect & or change the story in some way (Skyrim, Mass Effect, etc) as they follow a character(s) through their narrative plot.\n\nGoW does not qualify as an RPG because you are forced to follow a singular set path of story, and your actions are only visually interacting within the defined tracks of its narration. Thus I have fixed the wording of my original comment to exactly what I had originally intended to point out.",

The second game takes away that feeling of emptiness and lonesomeless by adding two NPC helpers, wich works in the same way a forced multiplayer subnautica would. It gets rid of the fear. Of the mystery. The tension. It worked surprisingly well in sons of the forest, but that's because it's less of a survival horror and more a sandbox with lore",

Even if there are biomes with nothing in it, even if there are areas with no blue prints, I still can't wait to explore every inch of the map purely for the sense of adventuring in what otherwise feels like a living, breathing world.  \n\nI hope it retains that feel.  The feeling that this area, this biome doesn't exist because of story progression, item location placement, or some other meta reason, but rather an area exists simply because that's how it is on that planet.\n\nAlso, I love how you can clearly see the increased graphical fidelity but the art style itself seems true to Subnautica.  I don't know what other games are lined up for 2025 but if Subnautica 2 releases in 2025, I hope it lives up to the hype and potentially even snags a Game of the Year.",

Part of what makes SN1 so memorable for me is the relatively minimal handholding and the natural progression/storytelling. Yes you do have to read the logs to get some clues, but you find the logs by exploration in the first place, and at some point game just stops telling you places to go and the only answer for progressing is: go deeper.\n\nBZ has a map, which makes sense story-wise as Alterra has extensive activities in the Arctic, but I don't like that. I also do not appreciate Robin's overworld dialogue, where she states incredibly obvious things like \"I should go find the drop pod\" in the prologue. I like the feeling of getting lost in the first game, and not repeatedly being pointed where to go and what to do even until the late game.\n\nAnd the worst part of BZ's story imo is the lack of taking into account player's progress in all of the possible storylines (Sam's story vs. Al-An's story). I cannot believe that you can clear the game without finishing Sam's story when that was what brought Robin to the planet in the first place, and there's nothing stopping you from doing exactly that except the generic comment to finish all business on the planet before proceeding to the ending point of no return.\n\nI think a fair compromise, as it seems the characters of SN2 are doing an expedition to an alien planet, is to include a mapping system to the game, The Long Dark-style. You manually draw your map as you explore by finding optimal vantage points and perhaps expending resources. It would satisfy players who prefer playing with a map while also encouraging exploring on your own. It would also be fun if your current position on the map isn't marked, but could be added through an upgrade chip or something.",

Think our Early Access update model, expanded. **No season passes. No battle passes. No subscription.**\n* The game is not multiplayer-focused. Co-op will be an entirely optional way to play the game. You\u2019ll be able to enjoy the game as a single-player.\n\nAs always, we are so proud and incredibly grateful to have such a passionate and engaged community, who love the Subnautica games deeply.\u00a0\n\nThanks for keeping an eye out for any news about our progress on the next game.\n\nWe\u2019re so excited to show you what we\u2019ve been working on and hope that you love it as much as we do.\n\n\u2013 *The Subnautica Team*",

But the fact the devs are stick with \"Games as a service\" has meaning - and leads many people to hold fast to their skepticism.\u00a0\n\n\nVote with your wallets people, we Dont need subnautica to turn into \"suicide Squad\" in terms of how this releases.\n\n\nEdit: another thing to not - typical with \"Games as a service\" this will mean the modding community might be defunct - which with the lack of confirmation of no mtx/online only would make sense as to capitalize on the content that would normally be modded being turned into mtx. Again this post has only Raised my skepticism",

Neither of these is an ideal scenario, so while the initial comments suggest this isn't the former, it would be nice to know it also isn't the latter.",

It makes sense that Subnautica would do the same. From UW's perspective, BZ was probably somewhere between static and live service for Subnautica. People associating every worst association they have with a single industry term need to get a grip.\n\nLet's please have a modicum of chill, I feel like Subnautica doesn't even have a notoriously young playerbase.",

The service being continuously updated games that improve the player experience (and usually *totally* free to the player, see the dock update and large room update for SN).

Also this is game where you will be literally 90% in water, swimming, why tf would you wear this insted of some sort of suit to help you swim faster and protect you(especailly since everything is wanna kill you and there  are biomes with extreme temperatures). And tbh, when you like game only because there are good characters(not like well-written just with very sexy forms) is really wrong...",

When the meteor struck it exposed a magma chamber that was building up pressure. This probably formed the playable area through hundreds of thousands or even millions of years of volcanic activity. Reason I put it slightly above the edges of the crater is due to the mountain island which is above sea level but not by much. This would probably also be why the biomes of the crater are so condensed as everything around said crater isn't able to support any life outside of mega fauna and microorganisms. \n\nTL;DR\nWe're on a volcano.",

This was followed by the emmense pressure of the water rushing back, and pushing the disturbed ocean floor together with so much pressure that it almost instantly solidified. The stirring storm in the water then caused the looser areas of the ocean floor to get collected onto the main body of the crater, creating the formation we land on in the game. Over the course of either hundreds, or thousands of years, the biomes were formed in and on the formation.",

The players have long asked for a 5th class to be added to the game (the one that's suggested the most is the medic class) and the Devs have refused to do so, explicitly saying it would mess the current synergies and place the game in the never ending cycle of balance \u00a0because one class would eventually be seen as the weakest. We'll see about subnautica 2. It can be implemented well or bad. Though, for me, part of the feeling of subnautica is derived from the loneliness that you got from being stranded on an alien planet. BZ already missed the mark in this regard. So, idk, but designing a single player experience and a co-op are very different things...",

I have concerns about multiplayer negatively impacting the solo experience. \n\nIt's not theoretical either, I've personally experienced it with multiple games but most recently with Eldin Ring. I was having a blast playing a Dex build turtle knight when the game first launched. Then they nerfed my weapon because a small but very visible and vocal part of the community, Invaders, were complaining that the bleed damage was OP among other complaints related to the MP portion. So suddenly an optional portion of the game, after all I can play without internet, impacted my character and made all the upgrades and work I had put into that equipment worthless. Either I had to grind for hours to find an alternative weapon, respec and learn a new build, or deal with being a nerfed build and the frustrations that would bring. Ultimately I walked away from the game because I didn't want to waste more effort building another fun solo build just to have it repecced for an optional component of the game I don't participate in. Then life happened and I my haven't been back. \n\nAnd since this game is EA, I have serious concerns with the fatality/difficulty balancing. It's always a concern with EA games since seasoned players get bored and ask for harder fights. Hell the meme of EA games is - it's too easy make it harder! And Multiplayer \ud83d\ude2d. But my experience with EA MP optional games like Grounded and Valheim is that it makes solo play pretty terrible. And if it stays a SP game balanced for that, the people who asked for MP won't be satisfied because it won't be challenging or fun enough them. So ultimately yeah, I think MP for Sub 2 is bound to fail wothe the SP or MP crowd. Best to leave MP at to modders imo.",

By that I mean the crowd asking for multiplayer and the crowd complaining about it are 2 different subsets of the playerbase with each one being vocal at different times.\n\nI also recognize that some complain because if the game is now coop then dev time was spent implementing that and by extension takes away from the single player experience because less time/effort was put into single player. Now yes some time was spent on coop but that just doesn't seem like the case any more, sure games from 10-20 years ago fit this description but now a days the optional multiplayer show a lot of love to both sides because well there's a reason they're putting multiplayer in, not just because it's the current trend.",

But there's just certain aspects of the game that were designed solely around having a partner that don't feel right alone. You're restricted to 2 weapons instead of the usual 4, ideally because your partner would cover the 2 weapons you'd be missing. Every button or door that requires a partner to operate can still be operated in solo, but the activator that your partner would use is still just there reminding you it was designed to be used together. \n\nMost importantly, the story is written around the co-op partner (Carver), fighting alongside the protagonist (Isaac) and the two develop a mutual brothers in arms bond when they started out as enemies. Except if you play solo, you basically end up missing all of this development they're supposed to have and instead it's dropped on you in maybe, 2 or 3 cutscenes throughout the entire game. Dead Space 1 and 2 didn't really have these issues. (imo)\n\nAgain, I don't agree with the takes Subnautica co-op will be bad just because it's co-op, and most of the points that make DS3's co-op flawed most likely won't apply to Subnautica's gameplay in general, but it's not impossible for a game to be worse off with co-op introduced when the original was perfected as a single player experience.",

                    "body": "Those are bad examples. Valheim, for one, I'm 90% sure wasn't designed to be solo player, it was designed to hold servers with a large number of players, but that being said, I've played it solo as well as multiplayer and I don't think the solo experience is any worse than multiplayer, this \"the world feels empty\" you speak of is purely subjective and your own minority sentiment\n\nAs for grounded, that one I'm also fairly certain was designed to be played with between 2 and 4 players and the solo play through is the one that's optional. I agree that the solo gameplay of that game is not nearly as good but only because of scaling, there's nothing in the mechanics that requires more than 1 player to succeed. It's simply too difficult, but anyway it's a bad example because it wasn't intended for solo play. It was designed to be playable solo but it was created with the intention of being one of those \"fun with friends\" games\n\nWe have no reason to believe SN2 is going to be one of those \"fun with friends\" games. Whereas Grounded and Valheim are more like coop games with the option of ~~multiplayer~~ singleplayer, it's been drilled pretty hard here that SN2 is going to be a solo player game with the option of multiplayer. Do you see the distinction?\n\nA better example I can think of off the top of my head is The Forest and SOTF. Those are similarly designed to be solo with the option of coop, and I believe they succeeded at that: those who wanted to play solo did so and had a blast, those who preferred to play coop did so and had a blast, neither side complained about the game being designed for the other, \"unplayable solo\" etc. And we have good reason to believe SN2 is going to be more like that\n\nEdit: another good example is Green Hell. It's absolutely a single player game (no spoilers but the story makes that clear), but they provide the option of playing with friends. It doesn't change the game or the story in any way; additional players simply exist alongside you and you do the same things you would be doing if playing solo. There's nothing in Green Hell or The Forest/SOTF that makes it more fun or rewarding or better played as multiplayer VS solo, whereas in Valheim and Grounded there's things that make it fun/played differently when coop rather than solo (though they're totally playable solo; it's just a different experience)",

Subnautica was a bit of a shining beacon in that its story and the way it was told mixed with the ambience of the entire game made it something special.\n\nMost other survival crafters feel like the world exists solely to cater to the crafting system they've made. Subnautica instead felt like they started with the world and story and then came up with a crafting system that suited that.\n\nPlus the idea that it has a beginning, middle and end. The fact that you fly away at the end and leave it all behind felt bittersweet and I loved it for that.\n\nArk by comparison just felt kind of impenetrable, admittedly k wasn't playing solo, I played it with my wife and we both lean towards spending more time getting sucked into the story than spending 8 hours building gigantic dildos all over the landscape.",

I don't think they rewrote the whole game or converted methods cause at that point why not just just send the whole bloody game itself and too many things can go wrong.\n\nLet's say we have two games with each having there own data.\n\nThe person who created the save file is the host. The game data is extracted and then sent to the joining player. Now we have an identical game state so we have something to go on and use.\nOn player connection, we instantiate the player objects and keep the reference of the player. \nNext up inputs. We just need to send the inputs of the player and the game changes to each other. These things can be replicated just by using the player input as we would know who the host and joining player is.\nNow the only part which we have to do so is tell the engine this happened. As the input would be using the player object, we would inject the data into the player object which would then think, a input happened so let's do whatever the input and player properties conditions are meeting.\n\nTo make it proper multiplayer we just have to send the game updates at a certain rate and we could have a jerry rigged multiplayer.\n\nThis may or may not be the method they did. Only thing to note would be that doing this in such a manner could expose the player to hacking and having their system compromised.\n\nWhen multiplayer games are designed, only certain areas of the memory processor , windows etc are allowed access by the os just like in a non multiplayer game but it has network access. \n\nWith the jerry rig method I thought of, it would be exposing the whole computer as you are communicating using an external network solution outside of the game to transfer updates of the players so anything could possibly be sent. \n\nFirst external network solution which is simple enough to do so, next up game state inject, so something like cheat engine which could be used to do so as it's the same or just update save file itself. Next up diverting inputs to the correct player object which will be the only hard part and last thing we would need to do so.",

Don't take me the wrong way, I really hope I'm completely wrong and SN2 is an amazing single player experience and I can completely ignore that there's people out there having fun in a way that's different to me, my concern is just that my experience will be compromised to facilitate the MP side of the game.\n\nMy concern comes out of love for a game that stood apart from the crowd, not a hatred of people who enjoy other games in the genre.",

Going through the lost river felt like multiple biomes in one, going through the crystal caves felt like you were in the crystal caves. \n\nSeeing this biome makes me think that the crystal caves could have been inside of that biome which would have made the crystal caves more diverse. \n\nI think in BZ lacked in some of the smaller details and this was one of them. Finding Reaper bones and seemingly hundreds of different plants and having different areas with different colors that are all distinct made it cool. The map was large, but the diversity helps give an understanding of where you are. If it wasn\u2019t for BZ being so small I think it would be way easier to get lost or not recognize where you are because the biomes felt less diverse, and everything looked the same. \n\nI loved both games, and am no BZ hater, but I do think the first game had better characteristics.",

If you are in or behind the smokestacks, the Sea Dragon will not shoot fireballs at you. These wouldn't be near the castle, however, so you'd need to be quick about taking cover inside.\n\n- Make the sea dragon swim like a squid, expanding its tentacles outwards before bringing them together and bursting forwards for a huge distance quickly. It would do this to attack you if you got close.\n\n- Make the sea dragon clow bright orange like charging an attack before shooting a *single* big and fast fireball that does a ton of damage to vehicles. It would do this infrequently so long as you are out of melee pursuit range; just infrequently enough that you can repair and start to escape.",

I appreciate that Below Zero tried to shake things up by introducing a more traditional narrative, but I think that it was just never going to appeal to the people who liked that aspect of OG Subnautica. \n\nBut you're right--it would've been more well-recieved if they didn't completely abandon the original storyline.",

Often, actual threat being too high is a negative.\n\nThreat perception is a bell curve. If a monster isn't actually threatening enough, it will be underwhelming and people won't be scared of it. But if a monster is *too threatening*, it actually ceases to be a perceived threat, because once it kills them once or twice, death stops being a threat and starts being a nuisance.\n\nWhere Subnautica balanced its threat throughout the early game was perfect. It made enemies that were high threats if engaged, but easy to avoid and easy to escape from, and it placed them in areas where it was hard to see their locations.\n\nBelow Zero failed on this. The enemies are too hard to avoid or escape from, resulting it you getting a perfectly accurate analysis of their threat. For some, like the Cryptosuchus, that results in you going \"oh, this isn't really a threat\". For others, like the Chelicerate, it results in you dying to it, and realizing that death is just an annoyance. Both are bad for threat perception. Combine that with them being easy to see, and it just has none of the tension from the first game.",

Early access was very important for the first game because it was much more technically advanced than anything they had done before and they needed that feedback. But I also feel that it is less necessary to listen to outside input on creative decisions. Art is is subjective. I want them to make their vision even if it's not my vision.",

I liked having the single map and being able to triangulate using in game mechanics instead of the first having to look up a map. \n\nI like both but prefer 1 to SBZ however I DO like the seatruck idea but dont like the awkward length but I guess thats the trade off.  I didnt like the cyclops in the first in terms of maneuvering but being in the clumsy sub while being attacked is a rush for sure and really cool. \n\nAll in all I agree, take the best parts of both and BOOM BANGER game",

Yes, presupposing superhuman capabilities that would allow for variable pressure differences on this level, I suppose cabin pressure would no longer play such a big role. But there are two issues still: titanium composites that can withstand these pressures (which we\u2019ll say is a non issue, since following your example, Alterra made it and Riley can use it), and Riley\u2019s biology if he were able to survive in this environment. In order to make this work, Riley\u2019s bones would have to be as thick as tree trunks for one, and we\u2019d need to figure out a way to allow for the internal pressure inside Riley to get up to a thousand atmospheres without his blood boiling. I suppose that increasing the thickness or material strength of the cell walls would work, but then you\u2019d also need a way to keep all the water from evaporating out of your body, which would also immediately kill you. Since this conversation started on the topic of realism, what would you suggest is a method by which Riley would be able to survive with that high of an internal pressure?",

And as soon as it gave me a compass, I started a pen and paper map. I would wander to the edge of a biome, look back at lifepod 5, note the distance and reverse the compass heading to then measure it out and dot the map. Then I would move to the next point that the biome edge seemed to turn, take another note. Then do a connect-the dot- when I got all the way around a biome.\n\nI made it pretty far, and it got a lot easier once I got the seamoth. But it became quickly clear that I was taking way longer away from base than most people, and I struggled to manage food and water. So I decided I wanted to play without hunger and thirst, but the switch lacked the console commands to switch mid game. So I started my game over. That really killed my motivation so I ended up shelving without finishing the game. I estimate I made it about 1/3 of the way through the story.\n\nThen, starting a few months ago, I came back to Subnautica after a Steam Sale let me get it on PC, which had better load times anyways. I played on survival until I got a fish farm and water filtration setup, then would turn off hunger to go mapping again. \n\nThe map was in pretty rough shape after being stored improperly, so I swapped to digital, which was a better idea anyway since I could keep everything on layers and toggle off the artsy ones. Towards the end of the game (around the time I started trying to map the edge dropoff, I swapped off the in game compass and used the F1 coordinate system, as well as shifting the map to start at the technical (0,0) point. I kept my own names for biomes, and didn't consult an actual map of the game until after I finished the story. \n\nI used a map at the end to add a lifepod I had missed, and accurate locations for all the large wrecks. But it's been a massive labor of love to put together. I don't think I would have enjoyed the game nearly as much without the entire mapping process to get me to slow down and appreciate the ecology. It has truly been one of my favorite gaming experiences as a result.",

Just make it so long that it doesn't make sense to resurface but requires you to use the big ship to go REALLY deep.  \nAlso maybe disable base building at the very bottom due to pressure or some other reason so you'll once again be required to use a big ship.\n\nAlso imo the cyclops seemed a little crammed in the deep sections of the Subnautica 1 map, I think it would work a lot better in just giant open water. \n\nBut since it seems that this is the direction anyway, I'm really looking forward to see another big submarine!  \n(Especially if we get co-op, I've always dreamed of using something like the cyclops together with another player <3)",

You can outfit the vessel with lockers, a bed, a mod station, etc., but it always feels like you are jerry-rigging a ship that wasn't designed to be a mobile base. All this plays into the survivor-aspect of the game.   \n\n\nThe Atlas, on the other hand feels like it was designed especially for the underwater world of SN1, wich detracts from the dread and loneliness. But it also diminishes the feeling of accomplishment when it comes to the survivor's ingenuity and resourcefulness, to adapt whatever you find to the hostile environment you are stranded in.",

Heck I already think the cyclops is a little useless mainly due to its maneuverability, and speed limitations. Given Unknown worlds tendency to make bigger vehicles slower, I highly doubt the Atlas would be any faster than the cyclops at best. Also the Cyclops already had more than enough space to make a decent base, so what do you need more room for. Also also I highly doubt they'd make it nuclear reactor powered like some hope. It would probably just burn through more power cells.",

After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It\u2019s been three minutes. You can\u2019t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It\u2019s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird\u2019s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the \u201cCummet.\u201d You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.)",

So, by the time I need to get into the Aurora, I just sprint along this path I laid out. But the foundation plates start bobbling and making noise, and to my horror, it alerts Sammy and other nearby Reapers. I decide to just sprint for it even though the loose platforms are drifting farther and farther away. Then I have reaper after reaper jumping onto the platforms behind me in a graceful fashion. Then I eventually slip and fall into the murky water where I am quickly snatched up by a Reaper and swallowed whole.\n\nI dream this at least 2x a week.",

Gel sacs are unique of the fruit/veg I've seen in that they never rot in your inventory. I will hold my hands up to never having noticed how to get Bulbo trees into my base so they could well be even better than gel sacs and marblemelons.   \n\n\nSo if you tried to live on lantern fruit alone you would also need to have other means of producing fresh water, which will take time hunting for ingredients and/or a lot of energy.

Ensign Lloyd heard roaring and saw the shadows of giant, snake-like monsters out of his window. He then saw a giant dragon-like monster swim from under his pod, grab one of them, and swim back below his pod. But that only lasted for a short moment. Soon after, a massive impact hit his pod from above, pushing it downward, collapsing dirt around it. Out of his window, he could see dirt shifting, as the dragon-like monster, also trapped by the rubble, strugged to get to him. But soon, even that stopped, as it had suffocated within the dirt.\n\nBut that wasn't even close to his biggest issue: he felt the temperature rising... there was lava beneath him. But the pod didn't fall into it; the world wasn't that merciful. Slowly, the temperature within the pod rose. At first, it was just mildly uncomfortable. Soon, he couldn't touch the metal parts of the pod. But not too long after, the pain started. His flesh was being baked alive, slowly, and agonizingly. It lasted minutes, but felt like a lifetime, as the heat slowly cooked him alive. By the end, the heart attack felt like the greatest mercy, as his boiling blood caused it to wear out, and the darkness finally welcomed him.\n\nHis body remains there, mummified and cooked, trapped within layers of dirt in a fully intact pod, its titanium shell managing to maintain its integrity. No one will find him for nearly a century, until Alterra-sponsored archeologists attempt to excavate the path that the Sea Dragon Leviathans once used to hunt for Reaper Leviathans. His current family had long since passed away, and his grandchildren wished they had never learned his fate.",

The ghosts push the pod a few times but, miraculously, it doesn't break. Eventually, however, supplies are running low and there appears to be a leak in the flotation system. The pod is slowly sinking, and there's not much left to eat.\n\nSurvivor 24 checks the depth below them. Void, nothing accessible. They check communications to find out that a rescue ship was shot down. Consuming the last of their food and water, they settle in to try and rest. Soon they will need that energy to swim.\n\nThe pod strikes something. Checking the instrumentation it doesn't appear to be a lifeform. Depth check shows 900 meters, not endless void but close. Climbing out of the hatch, Survivor 24 finds that the lifepod has struck a small island? It's little more than a large boulder with some moss and ferns, but it's not a sinking lifepod. Taking the fire extinguisher and anything salvageable off the pod Survivor 24 leaps onto the floating boulder. It bounces like a buoy from the impact but otherwise seems safe to float. Breathing a sigh of relief, 24 checks their communicator for any sign of life.\n\nThe noise was subtle, at first, but soon is distinct. Dozens of little legs scamper onto the rock as its other inhabitants appear, spider looking crablings skitter towards Survivor 24. They hold a silicone-handled knife warily as they watch the creatures approach. Then, at once, they pounce. A dozen crabs becomes two dozen as the survivor screams, bloody and fighting back, but there's too many and nowhere to run to. Overwhelmed, the body is picked clean, and the skeletal remains soon are dumped into the depths by a rogue wave. The knife is lodged into a crevice, near a rusting blade of similar design.",

Make it so that by the time you get in, they've been skeletonized by smaller sea life. Go back to the basics, you don't need giant red and white sharks with claws on their faces to die horribly, just the slow intrusion of water as the bilge pumps run out of juice. Of course the PDA can be of their last moments, faces pressed against the bottom (now the top) of the pod, trying desperately to breathe the last bits of air as the water keeps rising.",

Enshittification is real. Even companies with a good track record seem to lose their way. I just take everything they say with a grain of salt.\n\nSecond, it doesn't really fit the type of game. There are already other games out there for playing with your friends online. I don't see the point in retrofitting this one specifically. It's like saying, yeah, pizza is good, but I also like hamburgers, so can we make pizzas with the option to look more like hamburgers? What's the point? Just decide what you want to play, and choose the game that matches it, and the developers should stick within the initial concept. They can create a separate game series if they want something different. \n\nThird, it's literally impossible for the inclusion of extra features, even if optional, to not impact the default experience, even if indirectly. Even with perfect design principles, at the very least it will still cost money to develop. Multiplayer is no trivial thing. They'll have to spend a shit ton of money and work time on it. Which could be spent to make the single player game better/bigger.\n\nForth, but not least, I am worried about a larger trend in gaming. The pipeline single player game -> multiplayer -> online account+connection required for single player -> subscription models -> lootboxes and item stores. That's where the big money is, and that's what most companies want to transform their games into, if they think they can get away with. It sends alarm bells whenever I hear about changes which go along those lines.",

Im just speaking based on the games I\u2019ve played. Unless you have a slightly altered version for co op or solo, it\u2019s gonna be broken in one of those modes. Some games remedy this by increasing the difficulty based on the amount of players present. Unless something like that is present, I think it will disturb the flow of the game. Which makes sense if you think about it, more people collecting more resources means things get done faster. So unless they increase the cost to build for co op, it\u2019s going to be a lot easier than solo",

Basically regardless of them saying this, that it might make the single player experience worse because certain things might not be made the same because of how it might need to be balanced for co-op - or straight up development time being eating up for all these multiplayer features that makes the solo experience worse because of the co-op they didn't want.\n\nAll hypotheticals and of course on social media everyone just boils arguments down to a single sentence with a gotcha response like this meme and says \"checkmate\" when they're not REALLY addressing what these people are afraid of. It's just addressing what Reddit has simplified their issue into. But no one can anyway, because as I said - it's just everyone making up whatever they the consequences will or wont be that we have zero control over anyway.\n\nI'm not worried personally and am pro co-op for sure as I would LOVE to play this game with a few friends as it offers a unique survival experience. But I wouldn't want what makes subnautica itself to go away for it, so I can sympathize with these people's fears.",

A massive vehicle designed for a crew of 2 - 4 players.  \nIn order to operate it properly, you must be in coop. Otherwise it's just a clunky mobile base unsuited to a solo player.  \nIf one player can operate it solo, then why would you bring friends aboard? Why would they want to be aboard?  \n  \nThere will very likely be features of this vehicle that need more than one player to make the most of them, and this will be by design to encourage cooperative play, not because it's technically impossible to bind the controls and automate the processes so that a solo player can do it.  \n  \nTo get the most out of this fairly major feature of the game, you will need to be in cooperative play, and since it wasn't designed to be soloed, I (as a player who will probably never play multiplayer) lose out on a chunk of the game I might not have otherwise.  \n\n\nThe game will *not* be designed 100% for solo play, and so I will not get 100% of the experience I might have otherwise.\n\nSure I can complete it solo, but I won't have an experience *curated* for solo-play.\n\nThis is what bothers me about the idea most.",
