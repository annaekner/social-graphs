                    "body": "There's actually an objective way to tell which win/loss ratio is more impressive.  \n\nThe normal way to calculate win rate is wins divided by total games, which is wins plus losses:\n\nWR = W / (W + L)\n\nHowever, to calculate which one is actually better, calculate what the win rate would be if you had one extra win and one extra loss.  This would increase your number of wins by one, and your number of total games by two:\n\nAWR = (W + 1) / (W + L + 2)\n\nSo if you three wins and zero losses, your win rate would be:\n\n3 / (3 + 0) = 3 / 3 = 100%\n\nbut your adjusted win rate would be:\n\n3 + 1 / (3 + 0 + 2) = 4 / 5 = 80%\n\n(I used 3-0 instead of your 1-0 to make the numbers easier to keep track of.  In your example the AWR would be 67%)\n\nIf you won 997 matches and lost 3, then the calculation looks like this:\n\nWR = 997 / (997 + 3) = 997 / 1000 = 99.7%\n\nAWR = (997 + 1) / (997 + 3 + 2) = 998 / 1002 = 99.6%\n\nThus, an AWR of 99.6% is much more impressive than 80%.\n\n(To make the numbers easier to keep track of, I avoided 1's and 2's since they both appear in the AWR formula.  For your examples, a record of 1-0 would have a WR of 100% and an AWR of 66\u2154%.  A record of 999-1 would have a WR of 99.9% and AWR of 99.8%.  Thus 999-1 is more impressive than 1-0 because 99.8% > 66\u2154%)",

Get 20-ish battles under your belt, likely winning the majority (like 70%+ where the average is sub-50%), and the resulting WN8 calculation pushes you to the very top of the rankings for that tier.\n\nSo purely relying on the WN8 was not viable, since while 'usually' having three WN8 2000+ on your team was a recipe for utter and complete dominance, a match where it's 3 vs 2 could swing wildly in results because 'their' 2 players are ones with 20,000 battles between the two of them, and our 3 players have 8,000 battles total.\n\nThe 'fun' part was serving on the recruitment team for my clan, and getting to interview and test some of these 'wunderkinder'. FFS, some of them were just so bad. Good to great solo-players, fucking incompetent in team play. I learnt very quickly that someone with a 65% WR over 6000 battles (mixed pub and clan play) is often a staggeringly better player over the 90% WR over 500 battles (pure pub or clan play).",

It\u2019s basically a calculation that determines how significant the difference between two percentages are, based on the difference between those percentages and the size of the data set. The more data you have, and the larger the margin is between the data points you\u2019re comparing, the more statistically significant it is. If I say data is 97% significant, it\u2019s (sort of) like saying \u201cmathematically, there\u2019s a 97% chance that the difference between these data sets actually indicates a real correlation.\u201d\n\nHave you ever seen studies where they say \u201cthere\u2019s an margin of error of 4 points\u201d, or something like that? That\u2019s sort of the same thing- they\u2019re saying, based on the statistical significance, the data could be misleading by plus or minus those many percentage points.",

You can do the same thing but this time, in favor of 100% being more impressive.\n\nYou have to win 1,000,000 out of 1,000,000 games to have a 100% win record, yet you only need to win 666 out of 667 games to have an ~99.9% win rate.

Centuries, or 100 runs in an innings, are a major milestone in cricket and it's utterly wild that someone could average that over a whole career.

Sure you can load it down to hell and send it, but the vehicle has a liability to break down. It may look like it could tow a house, but is really on the brink of collapse just getting through town. Plus trucks are already top heavy enough why increase risks of failure? Not to mention the strain on joints and ligaments that kind of constant stress can cause.\n\nThis family member was sedentary for so long that they had to resort to surgery to lose the weight, like literally would have faced multiple joint failures if they had gone down the path of exercise. I have still yet to see this person move faster than 3-4 mph in a dash. \n\nI may be 166 pounds but I can still leg press 500+ pounds, why I would put that in my workout I have no idea but I can. If I did have that in my workout it would be a one day a week thing not an everyday till I die thing\u2026.",

On occasions I get an intense strain in my left knee so it's likely permanently damaged, but I can still play sports without pain when I drop some weight (down to say 325-350) and build strength. I also think this knee was injured previously, as I've been through a few physically damaging events in my life.\n\nI am in no way recommending that people live at this weight, it's an added obstacle that diminishes quality of life. You have to be constantly thinking about the stress you're putting in your body and refuse to engage in activities that could cause you damage. \n\nI had a panic attack due to the negative influence of society (my friends and family) about my health. The short story is that I had an acid reflux issue that felt like heart distress and this caused me to panic most nights, except I didn't know I was panicking because it was a new experience for me. One night the panic didn't stop so I went to the emergency room. The entire hospital staff was extraordinary and attended to me even at the end of the night shift. I regret stressing the healthcare system due to this incident taking place. They told me my heart and respiratory systems are well above average health. \n\nSo I'm making this post to remind everyone that while statistical averages are a guidepost that humanity should use for correcting course, outliers exist. Treating everyone the same, within any context, will produce negative outcomes. In this case, the negative outcome was myself having a panic attack and the healthcare system being stressed. \n\nI take responsibility for not speaking to a doctor about the pain I felt at night sooner, so that the acid reflux issue would have been taken care of sooner. However, the fear of sudden death from obesity would still be present in me now because of society's influence, had I not received the test results given to me at the hospital. This would have undoubtedly led to some other issue in the future.",

But Outward Bound is all about pushing limits so I decided \"why the fuck not\", so after one of the beefy guys walked across with a pile of girls proving it could be done, 3 girls hung off my shoulders while I walked across weighing about 3x my normal weight, say I was 75 kg, and each girl was 50 kg, so basically I walked weighing 225 kg or 500 lbs. Granted I didn't walk very far but that's also often true of those 500lb people. I can't say it was easy, but it was *much* easier than I expected.",

Speaking of how much protein is needed, the American recommended daily amount, which most countries went along with, was based on an experiment where participants were nearly starved for months.

This means the blood can \"back up\" behind the heart, increasing pressure on that side.\n\nBlood entering the left side of the heart comes from the lungs, so \"left sided\" heart failure causes backups into the lungs, causing pulmonary edema.\n\nBlood entering the right side of the heart comes from the body, so \"right sided\" heart failure causes peripheral edema (typically manifesting as swelling of the legs/feet, since those parts of the body are furthest from the heart and require the most power to move blood out of).",

There are several points I\u2019d make on this, most of which are anecdotal, so do take them with a grain of salt.\n\nFirst, you\u2019re probably eating good food with lots of protein in it. It\u2019s hard to eat food like that in large quantities, even for fat people. Most fat people are fat because they consume highly calorie-dense and carb-filled food (cakes, sugary drinks, lots of bread, etc). Carb-filled food like this, at least for me, makes me _more_ hungry. If I eat cereal for breakfast, I am hungrier than if I ate nothing at all. This is why I now never eat breakfast, and why I try and eat good, healthy, protein-rich food as much as possible (sounds obvious, I know).\n\nSecond, I think fat people essentially have a different threshold for satiation than normal people. The point at which I feel full is after far more food than other people I know. This also gets worse as you get fatter and get used to eating more, so it becomes a vicious cycle.\n\nThird, I think most fat people are addicted to food. Most people have predispositions to addictions like this - often this runs in families. For some it\u2019s alcohol addiction. For some it\u2019s drugs. For some like me, it\u2019s food. For me, I can\u2019t understand how on earth someone could consume a bottle of whisky in a single night. But I can understand how someone could eat 4000 calories. You may have your own addiction, but it\u2019s probably not food by the sounds of it.",

Even a fat person would have a hard time if all they had was healthy food to eat. No one is bingeing on carrots. It\u2019s junk food that makes a fat person fat.",

When I was 19 though, I got in a bad car accident that gave me a chronic disability. In my early to mid twenties it was relatively manageable. By my thirties, I just stopped getting out of bed. Suddenly having a huge loss in activity didn\u2019t influence my brain though, and as I\u2019m always in pain now eating often helped as it releases endorphins. \n\nIt took over a decade for doctors to finally diagnose my condition and when they did, we realized there was a surgery that would mildly improve my quality of life.

But when it's mixed with a heavy dose of performance enhancing drugs and an abusive diet rich in saturated fats, the detriments quickly outweigh the benefits.\n\nHowever, it is still possible to go through that life style and live a long and healthy life, as long as you're surrounded by professionals and earn enough money for treatments to compensate.

In the cases where it doesn't solve the actual problem (like in your case) it still helps tremendously in other areas so it's not like you lost weight for nothing. You will most likely feel a lot better and be healthier in ways unrelated to your knees. Plus, being less heavy might also help you avoid knee issues in the future as well.\n\nModern medicine still involves quite a bit of trial and error, so the treatments that fixes the most issues will get prescribed the most often. As I said earlier, maintaining a proper weight helps in so many ways, both now and in the future, so it's not like you wasted that time and energy because of the misdiagnose.",

Yes, you use your anaerobic system when you\u2019re actually lifting the weights, but your aerobic system is what actually produces the energy needed to get you to do your next set.\n\nBad cardiovascular health = more time waiting in between sets (wasted time in the gym) and you will not be able to do as much volume when lifting.\n\nLook at the training programs of Strongmen or Powerlifters. Yes, they are huge men with lots of fat and muscle, but they still do cardio. They aren\u2019t doing cardio to lose weight, they do cardio to get stronger",

Most people don't get to a point where drugs have essentially taken over their lives. And that's honestly great!\n\nBut the thing about drugs is that once they do take over your life, it is truly herculean to quit them. It's so, so much easier to just relapse. To just give in. So much becomes better instantly if you just give in.\n\nNow imagine going through hell every second of every day when the end of your hell it's right in front of you, staring you in the face. Tempting you every single second.\n\nNow imagine actively choosing to be miserable and angry when you could be happy and cheerful. And doing so because it's \"better for you\" and that someday you won't feel this awful anymore.\n\nNow imagine waking up every day for months, maybe even years, realizing that today is a new day where you'll have to choose to be miserable and angry. Because you know that even one slip up means starting all over. Your brain is incredibly flexible, except when it comes to addiction. It craves whatever it is you're addicted to and will absolutely force you to go through withdrawal symptoms again even after a single slip up.\n\nNow imagine that you never have to go through hell b because you never started down that path to begin with. Are you wise not to? Absolutely. But does that take herculean effort? In my opinion, no. Fortitude, personal pride, etc yes. But effort? Not so sure.\n\nThat's why I applaud people who are able to kick am addiction. It's fucking inspiring.",

Often, it is the symptom.\n\nUntil we accept substance abuse as a real mental/neurological illness, this notion of blaming the addict won't go away.\n\nDon't get me wrong, not every addict is running from some deep pain or trauma. But once you regularly use hard drugs, it becomes difficult on a primal level to quit due to the damage done to the dopamine pathways in the brain. Basically, flooding the dopamine pathway through drugs makes the receptors less sensitive. To the extent that the dopamine release from regular activities is not enough to be registered to generate that response of pleasure or satisfaction. Given that dopamine is critical for motivation, it is not surprising that as time goes on the addiction becomes the entire personality for many addicts.",

Quitting something that you've developed a habit of, especially if it's an unhealthy habit, and *especially* if you've developed a physiological addiction to that habit, is a *massive* challenge.  \n  \nBut it's not all positive.  People who have successfully quit using drugs are often seen as untrustworthy.  Not that you don't *want* to trust them, it's just that relapses happen even to people who have been clean for years.  A friend or family member could be 10 years clean.  Then, all of a sudden you start noticing things like money missing from your wallet, items missing from your home, and your friend or family member starting to stay out later than usual or going out at odd hours.  \n  \nSo it's not like being someone who has quit using drugs is all unicorns and rainbows.  Friends and family will be proud of you and strangers will be impressed and inspired, but your reputation is still almost irreparably marred.  Think of how well Robert Downy Jr. is doing now.  And good for him.  I sincerely hope to see his continued success.  But if he starts behaving strangely in the public eye, you can't tell that people won't start to think \"relapse\".  Even if that's not what's happening at all, people will assume it is based on his past.  Hell, even without behaving in any particular way at all, rude interviewers still ask him inappropriate questions because of his past.",

Quitting Meth or Heroin or even alcohol really is a big achievement. \n\nAddicts NEED their drugs. Their body suffers if they don't get it. Obviously they don't actually \"need\"need it but they and their bodies think that they do, sometimes on a cellular level. Withdrawal can have a huge range of symptoms. It's not just headaches, fatigue and grumpiness. Drugs like Heroin or alcohol can literally give you flu-like symptoms. In extreme cases it can even cause seizures, cardiac arrest, dehydration and death. Even excluding those extreme cases, the intense fevers, runny nose, full body pains, hallucinations, hot sweats, etc it is too much to bear for most people. \n\nYou have to understand an addict's mindset. To them the drug is just as important as food, water and air. They know it's bad for them but when they try to quit it's true torture. They're used to feeling euphoric off the drug. Now, not only are they not feeling the euphoria they are actively suffering instead. If people could stop the drug and go right back to normal instantly a lot more people would have a much easier time quitting. \n\nNever trying drugs is an achievement too, what with peer pressure and exposure in the media, it gets to be very tempting. However, at the end of the day, not trying drugs just comes down to saying no. Quitting drugs is a genuine physical and mental challenge most people will never relate too. Quitting drugs isn't saying no everyonce in a while. It is actively saying no every minute of every day for the rest of their lives.",

How I got there didn't matter, those were dark days.\n\nSo I made a plan: knock out the guard, take his keys, unlock my cell, and escape. Killing ANYONE who objected.\n\nThe fateful day came. The enemy opened the cell. Tried tricking me by saying things like \"Thank you for your stay\" and \"We hope you come to Hotel Fremont again\". I am extremely smart. I don't fall for it.\n\nWhen I step out, I immediately dispatch the guard. Dressed in a suit, his blood will blend in with the nice bell-boy jacket he's disguised in. I hide the body anyway, no need to take risks. I am extremely smart. I then move like a ninja, an American Ninja, down the multiple floors of cells in this prison. The sounds of torture can be heard in many of the cells: men screaming, women moaning, people giving out secrets easily with \"yes, YES!\". War is hell.\n\nI make my way to the final entrance. There are many, finely dressed people. Ha, they expected me. I pull out my shooter, a simple tool. An AK T-Dog sold me back with the boys. The good days.\n\nI take out the man behind cover, his head hits the counter as he falls, hitting a bell and making an alarming \"ding\" as he collapses. I mow my way through the rest, Call of duty style. Killtacular. \n\nI didn't encounter much resistance. But then again, they didn't expect me. I am extremely smart. Now I am deep within enemy territory, hiding among refugee camps. Disgustingly full of drugs and people talking about \"mayors kicking them out of the park\". I understand the code.

Most people aren't forced into addiction by someone forcing them to take narcotics. But they also didn't choose a life that led them to this moment. Nobody sticks a needle in their arm to inject a strong narcotic on a dirty street who doesn't suffer from something we probably can't understand if we never thought about doing literally anything for a moment of relief. Of course there are people who could handle massive abuse or other traumatic events without drugs. But judging others always means \"I would have act better than you, had we both the same life\".\n\nthat's probably usually true, especially now that we have the opioid path to it. but a guy next to me smoked a lot of pot recreationally and felt like he'd try anything once. He's employed now, so heroin didn't take him out, but I remember him returning to college the next year saying he tried heroin. I'm not a user of anything, never was, so reddit sending me this post is curious. Same guy talked about how it was excellent but that the next day, he felt like he was standing in the wrong place, no matter where he was, he felt like he should've been a few feet away. \n\nSounded terrible. I think his love for weed bailed him out. But when another roommate said \"would you do it again?\" He said \"definitely, only thing I wouldn't try is crack\".\n\nHe came from a good home, had good grades, but smoked a lot of weed - strange guy. From what I've read, he's lucky to have been able to do that once and not again.",

Getting addicted is not a result of lacking self control. You can experiment with drugs because your interested and have no reservations about doing it, that's not a situation where you are letting your self control go, its deliberate. People also can have very different addiction experiences. Somebody could be severely physically addicted but not very mentally addicted and vice versa, this would result in the willpower required to quite being drastically different between people. I think what I was talking about when I said more willpower would be in the category of high functioning addicts which was my experience (I'm recovered). To be a high functioning addict I would say often (its nuanced and every experience is different)requires a good deal of self control because you are constantly exerting willpower strategically to moderate side effects etc. Also, maybe you dont want to quite, then it has nothing to do with self control, you're not fighting an urge, its just what you're doing.\n\nI would agree with you 100% on the personal responsibility aspect also. Its kind of like fat acceptance (the kind where you're not encouraged to improve, not fat shaming), dont give people that are struggling an excuse to stop trying because its too stressful to confront your problems!",

The job is also a lot more dangerous than most people would think, for some reason people love punching the medic.",

                    "body": "Kinda. Sleep is complex,  but there are techniques which are used in order to (temporarily) increase the amount of restful sleep per sleep. \n\nYou have to account for your body's recovery, which is deep sleep, and also your brain's ability to function, which is that sweet sweet REM sleep.\n\nSo, simple way to look at it, you really have two batteries you're keeping charged. You have your body's battery, which charges pretty quick but needs to knock you out and fully discharge all that errant activity, so you drop fron N2 Theta/Alpha concurrence (like deep relaxation) into \"He's dead Jim N3 Delta phases.  In the middle of that you jump back up and start a phase of REM, charging that brain battery, then drop back into Delta, finishing the charge/recovery of the body.\n\nAs sleep progresses longer and longer, you hit longer, you hit less and less phases of Delta, less body healing sleep, and go into longer and longer periods of REM seperated by more and more heightened total mental activity until you wake up.\n\nThis is why when you go back to sleep right after you wake up from a dream you can sometimes continue on that tangent. Delta knocks it out completely, but theta leaves it hanging, you end up mostly in beta and alpha stages as your brain gets \"fully charged up.\"\n\nTypically what suffers from sleep deprivation is REM sleep, and deep theta and delta states are shown to be achievable quickly through practices of meditation. \n\nThere are techniques which supplement sleep in this manner by combining that meditative aspect with deprivation of the REM cycle (typically by getting somewhere between 27 minutes of sleep and 53 ish.. thereabouts, it's very body dependent, you basically want to be all the way asleep and be all the way awake before a REM cycle) In order to compress the next REM cycle and skip the between 1 and 2.25 hour phase of REM into the first hour and a half of sleep time. \n\nSo, you charge your brain battery better at the cost of only getting your body battery to 60%. Then, provided you are well trained in meditative practices, you can secondarily charge that body battery while remaining conscious.\n\nThe time difference is primarily a factor of how quickly you are able to sleep and how quickly you are able to reach that deep meditative state, but you can effectively shorten your required sleep for cognitive function by a few hours. In my own experience, from 8 hours to 5. \n\nThe Deep sleep hurts a lot more if you're working hard every day, but it's less of a factor if you're doing mostly office job type stuff. Basically if you don't use that battery as much maybe it only discharges to 80% and a single phase of deep sleep is enough to bring it back to 100%. \n\nIf not, you can still shorten that required period to that aforementioned ~5 hours of sleep + ~1 hour meditation.\n\n6 hours over 8 is pretty okay, but I wouldn't recommend it long term as, while practiced perfectly it should have no repercussions on health, it is very involved and easy to become more sleep deprived with methods like these.",

Delta is what you need for your body to physically recover, along with basically no alpha involved. \n\nWithout that deep sleep level, your body physically won't take the stressors, without the REM stuff, your body won't mentally recover and won't be able to operate as well (this is oversimplified as heck). \n\nMore sleep !== more delta, it just means more REM stage, so you still end up feeling kicked like a mule and tired after a long period without sleep.  Even though you're mentally clear, the stuff that feeds the brain is not, nor is the stuff that you need to move during the day to function.",

But for our ancestors, that length of time made very little sense, as we\u2019d be at our most vulnerable in that situation. So, they\u2019d be in packs and supposedly take turns sleeping in a shift fashion and for a much shorter duration, but more frequent. While one sleeps, the other keeps look out.\n\nWhich makes sense, but seemingly goes against much of the info today regarding circadian rhythm and daylight hours. I had a period of my life for a few years where I basically did this due to the nature and hours of my work. I\u2019d get 4-5 hours a night (if lucky) work early for 3-4, then sleep in my car for another 2-3, then back to work for the rest of the day. At the time seemed to get by and feel fine doing that. But I was younger and not sure I could today. \n\nAnd supposedly Nikola Tesla and others would have multiple micro sleeps throughout the day, rather than a single macro sleep. Possibly hyperbole, but there\u2019s anecdotes that Vince McMahon would do exactly as described in this thread. Effectively not sleep throughout the week and have one \u2018catch up\u2019 day where that\u2019s all he did.\n\nSleep is a thing I\u2019m highly fascinated by, as we seem to know so little about it really. We all need it, we are all affected by it and so many struggle with it. Don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really got it figured out at all!",

In my opinion, there is a difference between when you don't go to sleep or when you can't sleep due to being in war for example, where lack of sleep will have far worse damage than in normal life.\n\nCheck some personal experience from people who sleep every other day, usually they are okay and they liked it. We don't have long term data but we sure know that we don't know everything. There is lot of questions in terms of our sleep. Da Vinci and Nikola Tesla, both had little sleep and they were living long life, especially Tesla.\n\nSome of these people develop funcion to have micro sleep in chair, for 5-20 minutes, and that refresh them. Some people need to sleep more and properly because they do hard sport or work in hard manual job.\n\nThe same with food, if you start doing regular long fastings, then your body start to use nutrients in far more effective way.",

Here's a rundown of some of the most reliable options:\n\n\nMagnetic Tape: This traditional medium is still widely used for archival purposes. Modern magnetic tapes can store large amounts of data (terabytes) and have a lifespan of 15-30 years under optimal conditions. They're cost-effective for large volumes of data.\n\n\nM-Disc: M-Discs are designed for long-term storage, with manufacturers claiming a lifespan of up to 1,000 years. These discs are made from a rock-like material that is more durable than the organic dyes used in standard DVDs. They can be read by most DVD drives.\n\n\nArchival-grade Gold CDs/DVDs: These are specially manufactured to withstand corrosion, offering a longer lifespan than standard discs\u2014up to 100 years. They use gold as a reflective layer, providing greater longevity but at a higher cost.\n\n\nSolid State Drives (SSDs) and Hard Disk Drives (HDDs): While not traditionally associated with long-term storage due to their moving parts (in the case of HDDs) and data degradation issues (in SSDs), technological advancements have made them more reliable. However, they generally offer shorter lifespans than magnetic tape or optical media, especially without regular use and in fluctuating environmental conditions.\n\n\nSynthetic DNA Storage: An emerging technology with the potential for extremely long-term storage (thousands of years) in a very compact format. Data is encoded into synthetic DNA strands. Although it's still in the experimental stage and currently expensive and slow for data retrieval, it holds promise for future applications.\n\n\n3D Optical Data Storage: This is another emerging technology that allows data storage in multiple layers of a disc or other medium. It has the potential for high density and long-term stability but is still under development.\n\n\nFor most practical applications, magnetic tape and M-Discs are among the most reliable and accessible options for long-term data storage. However, the choice depends on the specific needs, including storage capacity, cost, and longevity requirements. It's also essential to consider strategies like redundancy (storing multiple copies of data in different locations) and periodic data migration to newer storage mediums to ensure data preservation over time.\"",

He returned with an unexpected story. \n\nAfter a few hours of electrical work, he flopped on his backon the sofa with his feet hanging over the end so he wouldn't soil the fabric. He watched television and felt a little drowsy and relaxed. She knelt at the end of the sofa, removed his shoes and socks , and massaged his feet.\n\nNever in his or anyone's imagination did anyone expect that, but he felt good and relaxed. After a while, he noticed she pressed his feet against her cheek and moved on to kiss the soles of his feet, slowly, taking her time. The room slowly darkened and he dozed, and when he awoke, she was sitting nearby dozing herself. \n\nNothing else happened and we didn't know what to make of it, but if it brought her good moments, then wonderful for her.",

I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.\"",

Perfect for picking locks or caressing my collection of rusty spoons",

Like, at its most acceptable, we took the \"I'm interested in you, but we aren't going steady yet\" part of every relationship ever and slapped a new label on it to make it acceptable to have them drag on for way longer than they used to. But it is unfortunately also just another victim of social media language rot. Because it became trendy to call anything less than a fully cooked relationship a situationship. I've had different friends call everything from a dude they flirt with at work but have never actually gone on a date with or hooked up with a situationship, then to the definition above, all the way to using it to describe people they have been casually fucking for YEARS at this point. \n\nBut what it absolutely is not, is having a choking dude, a spanking dude, and a regular FWB all on tap.",

Okay we'd never been in a war, but there was a LOT of weapons handling, and range days, obviously.\n\nOne of us passed some remark to the girlfriend about \"but you don't know how to use a gun.\" And she took immediate offense like \"what?!! I can use a gun!! Why do you think I can't use a gun?!!\"\n\nWe were saying \"we're not saying you couldn't learn. But if one was put in front of you now. A rifle and a box of ammunition, you don't know really how it *works.* You may not even be able to figure it out.\"\n\nI think people just think you point and click the trigger. The procedure of loading and making ready they may be able to figure out given time. But when the magazine's empty and the bolt locks open? Would they be able to figure out that you need to drop the magazine, insert another and drop the bolt hold open? Unlikely. Would they then know there was a round in the chamber? Or would they cock it again and eject the first round? \n\nYou need to be taught how guns work and how to use them. A lot people, especially here in the UK, have never been *near* a gun. I genuinely don't think they could figure out something like a military service rifle without a lot of time. They couldn't just pick up and use one.\n\nIt's not even that they couldn't shoot straight, they couldn't even make the gun work.",

One said the sights were off because the guns were probably frequently rented and abused.  They then proceeded to move the the target closer and close and closer until eventually running out of bullets.    \nThey leave and return with 2 more boxes of ammo and one of the range employees.  The target is still sitting at about 15yds when the employee picks up the same gun the first time shooters were using and puts 2 shots dead center in the target.  The employee then very nicely says he's been shooting for years and that you have to crawl before you want then advised they set the target to 5-10 yards.  The first time shooters immediately said they play a lot of games and spend a lot of time in the arcade so they knew what they were doing.  Needless to say, they eventually got tired of missing and moved the target to 10 yds at which point they got a few holes in the target. \n\nIn my humble experience, it seem like non-shooters swear handguns are stupidly easy to accurately shoot.  Movies and TV shows make it look easy, but it takes real practice.",

Your second time you will probably jerk the gun preparing for the kick before you actually pull the trigger. With some practice you can get pretty consistent from short range, depending on the type of gun\n\n2. People don\u2019t realize how much worse their shot will be in real life. Playing the game operation is tricky sure but now imagine trying to play it with the clock of a wild animal running straight at you. Your success rate is going to get a lot worse\n\n3. It is so much harder to hit a moving person. Imagine the operation board is now moving around in circles. Now add into it that any competent human is going to be taking cover. Now you basically have to hit headshots which is not nearly as easy as people think. Go to a range and try and hit only headshots. If you don\u2019t have a decent bit of experience, it won\u2019t go well. Now imagine that head is bobbing up and down and moving around in quick sudden movements\n\n4. Scopes dont work like they do in the movies. You have to dial them in to match the range. If you thought someone was going to be 100 yards away but then they are 50, your scope won\u2019t work. The crosshairs won\u2019t be where the bullet goes. So many people think you can just put the crosshairs over the head and pull the trigger which first off is a lot harder than you think and second of is like the very last step of shooting",

The more difficult shots are between 20 and 43 yards away. \n\nSome of the harder shots for me are the closer ones, because they start moving fast in relation to the further out ones. \n\nIf you can wrap your head around the idea of Kentucky windage and that you're shooting a cone of projectiles, skeet shooting at a basic level comes fairly naturally. \n\nIn my area, if you pop into a place and tell the people that you've always wanted to try but never been able to, You will have an excellent!

                    "body": "Even in the US it depends a lot on your location.  Of course different states have different gun laws, but even within certain states it varies quite a bit.  I live in upstate NY and most people in my circle don't own firearms, where I am at least.  Out of all my friends, family, and acquaintances only two have guns, and none have concealed carries. One of them just has older family heirlooms (including guns from the revolutionary War!) and never shoots them. My other friend is an enthusiastic hunter and goes deer hunting though\u2014always hooks me up with meat too!  My dad had firearms because he was a hunter, but my mom sold them after his death because we really needed the extra money; I always wanted him to teach me but unfortunately the day never came. \n\nIf you were to go further out into the sticks away from the bigger metro areas in my state (and probably most states), you do start to see gun culture become more defined.  An ex of mine had family from the middle of nowhere in my state, close to the catskills. The closest grocery store is a Walmart 45 min away by car sort of place, and if you forget something at the store, you better hope the gas station 20 minutes away has it!  Everyone around there owned and shot guns.  Before going there I'd only shot a bb gun me and my brother were gifted when we were younger.  (Although I have trouble aiming because I'm right handed but my vision in my right eye is significantly worse than my left, so if I wanted to learn I'd have to shoot left-handed, which feels very unnatural).\n\nBefore really being exposed to the rural way of life in areas of the country like this, I didn't \"understand\" gun culture. But seeing just how different people's lifestyle is in places like these, I completely understand why people value firearms so intensely.  They're a key tool to survival in a very different lifestyle.  If someone were to put you in danger, no way would a neighbor or police officer be able to witness or get there fast enough.   Killings nuisance animals that threaten your pets, crops, etc.   Hunting to sustain yourself.  Taking away a person's gun deprives them of much of their security and independence for those that want to live on the fringe.  \n\nI remember talking to this kid in the UK at a pub who was grilling me about America's crazy attitude towards guns. He refused to believe a gun buy back wouldn't work in the US.  I think a lot of Europeans, (and perhaps even urbanites in the US itself) truly do not grasp just how expansive and sparsely populated a lot of the USA is. How firearms are not just baked into our Constitution, but for many people, their self identity and way of life.  \n\nI think culture wars and division between rural and urban folks has been exploited for reasons of greed and power by the media, corporations, and selfish politicians.   Gun owners have always been passionate, but that passion has been boiled into extremism.  Like, the NRA has gone from being a reasonable organization on gun safety that actually used to advocate for reasonable legislation, to becoming a corrupt political tool over the past half century.  And no doubt, the same thing happens culturally with left leaning urbanites too in some ways.  Divided and conquer they say.   \n\nIt sucks because I know we have the resources to solve the problems with guns in the USA that improves safety while respecting the second amendment.  But our political environment has become too corrupt for any major changes to occur.",

John reloads the guns for the others (which he was trained to do because he actually went to child soldier camp). Someone has to drive. Someone has to reload. Someone has to try and slow down the pursuing Terminator. It works so well and creates believable tension.\n\nIt can go the other way, too. Sometimes you wonder why the military guys depicted only carry like two magazines and then do not even try to conserve ammo. Or - lets come back to the zombie settings - how our survivor group that just came by an overrun military checkpoint does not have a trunk full of spare ammo for the guns they hopefully just looted. In the USA of all places.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWether these things are important details or not obviously comes down to the genre.

Movies are already cut down a lot, and scenes where nothing happens are the first to go. It can be interesting to see how an assassin has prepared for quick reload and that utilize counting themselves, but then that kind of has to be the theme of the movie or something to make it worth spending time getting continuation right between countless of shots.\n\nThe same is true for the characters eating, going to the toilet, sleeping, etc. Just assume it happens. Games are also often choosing to make reloading move a number from the \"ammo\" pool to the \"magazine\" pool, and not just waste whatever was left in the magazine like in reality. Some games are realistic in that regard, but then the whole game usually is as well, and attracts a different crowd altogether.\n\nSo it's not that the producers necessarily are bad at this, they just don't care to get it right because their target audience only want the shooty parts.",

I work with a lot of first time and novice shooters. Maybe because I know to look for it- but it's always surprising to me how many NCOs *don't* recognize it when it is *sooo* obvious. Almost every time a shooter is having trouble and they just look wrong holding the rifle - get a little in front of them so you can see their face, focus on their eyes, and watch them try to take shot. It'll be obvious they are canting their head way over trying to get their dominant eye behind the sight (often) or having trouble getting eyes closed/open properly (occasionally).\u00a0\n\n\nThe fix is have them swap their hands around. It is far far easier to shoot \"wrong\" handed than wrong eyed. It's really not that hard. Make that one change and bam they are suddenly doing much much better and back in track.\n30 years ago we used to keep eye patches on the range to get people through it to help them use the \"correct\" eye when they couldn't close just one- which I believe was really a problem of cross eye dominance.\u00a0",

I outright disagree that they're 'awful' for you - the non-sugar ones, I mean. \n\nIt's nonsense to say that aside from water, only tea or coffee is acceptable, as both of those two contain substances that also aren't good for you. Why are they behind your arbitrary line of healthy? Non-sugar soft drinks, especially if they don't contain caffeine, are very much within spitting distance of tea and coffee health wise.\n\nYou call them gross chemistry experiments as if you're one of the ignorant people who're blissfully unaware that everything is a chemical - even water - and natural chemicals are not any inherently healthier for you than 'artificial' ones. Would you eat cassava? Cyanide is a natural poison, and for example cassava is full of it. What about cherries? Their pits contain enough cyanide to kill a man with perhaps just a single pit, would you risk eating cherry jam that might have cracked pits it? Would you risk swallowing a whole one that's perhaps slightly cracked? This is to say nothing of modern medicine which literally saves lives and is largely based on the synthesis of new chemicals.\n\nAnd of course it's not a matter of putting good things into your body to magically counteract bad things in your body. But nevertheless health is a holistic concept, and although you make some minor bad decisions from time to time in terms of what you consume, that shouldn't not inspire you to make healthier decisions elsewhere. The juice example is a powerful one, because juice is, for most people (especially those who do eat fruit) less healthy for you than the very soft drinks we're talking about thanks to sugar. So therefore what I'm talking about is less about 'have a healthy piece of fruit to counteract the bad soda' and more 'make up for putting bad stuff in your body by drinking less bad stuff like juice'.",

Many knightly fights ended in a surrender and prisoner/ransom situation assuming both knights couldn't retreat.  \n\nIf you want to talk about absolute insane fights that likely happened and nobody really recorded you'd be looking at Halberdiers fighting eachother during a push of pike situation when two pike squares get so close together and its their job to fight eachother and break up the pike squares.  They would be wearing minimal armor instead of full plate, and be absolutely surrounded by people dying and literal tons of pikes poking every which way.  \nAdd a century or so onto this and you end up with guns being involved and smoke everywhere.  \nDepending on the nation/military doctrine you'd also have more than just Halberds.  You'd also have giant two handed swords, rodolleros from Spain with sword and shield, and all sorts of other people trying to be creative/inventive in an impossible situation.",

IDK\n\nSo I like this idea and going to jog with it. \n\nTwo \"knights\" from different parts of the world, maybe waring countries IDK, hear of each other. They secretly communicate and settle on neutral ground for a confrontation. They arrive solo, no squires and whatnot, maybe even share a meal. There's no animosity in the coming confrontation, it's all hubris with a tinge of respect. Maybe they can't verbally communicate due to a language difference but they still have a pleasant evening telling each other the stories of their great battles even though the other probably doesn't understand. Either way, passion is universal and both can feel the pride the other has in their actions without needing words. \n\nThe morning comes. No sneakiness in the night. They may even get their gear on together. They both pack their horses knowing that they'll be riding away from this fight. One of them is wrong on that account. No heavy armor, basic leathers maybe. Something like Aragorn minus the mythology. They meet at a designated spot and proceed to have the most epic, grueling sword fight in all of history. No one sees it. No one knows the winner. There really isn't a winner because the one not dead only makes it a short trip before dieing themselves. Or maybe they die filling in the grave IDK I like the idea though.",

I tried getting into it out of interest in historical weaponry and combat art, but quickly fell out when I realized that the HEMA tournaments are dominated by big guys throwing their weight around more than doing any real swordplay. \n\nMost matches I saw went like this: Two guys briefly cross swords/polearms before tumbling into a grapple led by the bigger of the opponents- who will proceed to hilt smash the opponents heads until submission. \n\nI have considered that perhaps that\u2019s accurate representation of how a lot of medieval fights went, but it\u2019s certainly not as flowery or interesting as the fencing/martial arts that the sport\u2019s name conjures to mind.\n\nEdit: Since many seem to think I have misunderstood what a martial art or HEMA is, I will just say this- if you went to a karate competition to see karate, you would be disappointed to see them doing judo or other martial arts for the sake of winning the tournament.\n\nPersonally, I think HEMA would be more interesting for me if they adopted a competitive model more like fencing- with scoring focused on technique and skill, rather than a winner-takes-all  medieval tavern brawl, but to each their own, I suppose.",

If you didn't run you were more likely to win and even survive. \n\n\nBasically if you lost you could lose super hard.

The thing is that things like Kendo or \"traditional\" fencing are primarily sports, while HEMA is mainly conceived around using the techniques from various historical fencing treatises, and most of those describe techniques that are pretty banal and practical. I'm not saying there's no HEMA clubs that are just smashing each other with metal sticks, but I am saying that HEMA clubs devoted to historical realism will probably also produce fights that look like they're won by just pummeling each other with the hilt of their swords, for example, because that's a legitimate technique to defeat a helmeted opponent. The sort of fancy swordplay people see in movies, even realistic movies, is ALWAYS less informed by historical martial arts and far more by the long history of how theater and then film always liked to portray sword fights.",

What that means is very often illustrated with shoes as the example: often the cheapest shoes to buy *today* will wear out so fast that they end up being more expensive *over time* than a more expensive pair up front.\n\nAlso, some advice on \"high-end\" shoes - there are fashion brands which cost a fortune but have no better quality than much more sensible brands.  I won't vouch for every recommendation in this buzzfeed article but at a glance it seems reasonable:\n\nhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/jenae_sitzes/long-lasting-shoes",

Every day, before going into work, he'd stop at the Dunkin Donuts across the street and buy a coffee and donut for himself and his cocktail spaniel. He'd go into his shop, set up his coffee and donut, and for his dog, his would be under the counter where the dog would hang out all day. I remember once bringing a pair of shoes to him to see if he could resole them. He got pissed. \"What do you want me to do with these? They're garbage!!!!\", and he explained how with the newer shoes (this was the late 60s) and the materials used and construction, the only thing to do was throw them out. And this is why we have issues with landfills.......",

When the durability of the laces go down by the same factor as that of the shoes, I guess it zeroes out.\n\nTo your point of more expensive products for more durability: I think there are many products where you can pay four times as much up-front and have it last ten times as long if you take care of it, but at the moment a vast majority of people prefer buying cheap crap more often (for several reasons, from being able to follow trends to not having an economy which supports the alternative, not to mention brands pushing heavily for the financial incentives in the current system), and that means the scales at which quality products are produced are so low they end up being very expensive. I firmly believe that if most people started selecting quality stuff to have it last a lot longer, the economy of scale would kick in and quality products would end up at a much more reasonable price, to the benefit of everyone. Just look at price to durability ratio for products produced in the 50s, 60s and 70s. Acceptable pricing, and people still have the products. I still hope we will move back in that direction some time in the future.",

Their lifespan is listed as 300-500 miles. \n\nSo, I guess I've worn them down pretty hard. Especially because I wear them practically every day for work, and occasionally through rain and some snowy/icy conditions (not great for the shoes, I'm sure, but it happens when you're going through a busy day).

                    "body": "As a serious answer, yes, but the limit is different for different people and different regions of the body. Hair follicles go through cycles of growing, and then going dormant. Usually after one or more of those cycles the follicle will release the hair during the dormant stage, the hair will become loose and fall out, and then start growing again in the next growth stage.\n\nThis is the general case, and is why wild animals do not need to be trimmed and still have a limit to their hair growth, it falls out either individually like described, or seasonally if their coat changes with the weather.\n\nHowever some follicles, still have that first growth/dormancy cycle, but they do not release the hair regularly during the dormant stage, so the hair gets longer and longer indefinitely. (That's not to say that loose hair never falls out, but it's \"rare\" in that it doesn't effect the overall length).\n\nOur own head hair is the most obvious example of this, but we have bred a few other examples. Most sheep do not release their hair naturally, it gets longer and longer until we shear it for wool (and the instances of escaped sheep that are recaptured with literally hundreds of pounds of wool and dirt are a good example of why this trait doesn't appear in wild animals). Additionally the non-allergenic dog and cat breeds do not shed their hair, which is why they don't cause allergic reactions (and why poodles will just get poofier and poofier until you trim them).",

Like what if some PC or phone manufacturer put some code on every one of their computers that would just compute this stuff in the background. Maybe not possible on a phone without people noticing the power draw. But if it was on desktop computers, there's some minimum power draw as long as it is on. And as long as you don't spin up the CPU too much, people wouldnt' even notice. But if you had millions of computers all working away in the background trying to solve the problem, would that actually make solving the problem possible?",

It's like if every grain of sand on the planet was itself a planet, then each grain of sand on each of those planets as yet another planet, then you pick one of the grains of sand on one of those planets.  In principle there's nothing stopping two people from picking the same grains of sand, but in practice if you tried to even just count all of those grains one by one you'd take more time than the universe has to offer, even if you went at an unfathomable speed.\n\nCryptography based on that concept is used all over the place.  It's what secures bank wires and credit card transactions.  It's behind the *s* in https you're using to view this page.  It's also behind Bitcoin, the \"first\" cryptocurrency (technically there were a couple older attempts, but Bitcoin is the first that had a couple key properties and took off).\n\nSince Bitcoin went from nothing to being a worldwide phenomenon its value has spanned many orders of magnitude.  A quantity of bitcoins that could have been bought for $100 at the beginning is worth millions to billions today (depending on where exactly you set your values).  In bitcoin ownership is based on knowing private keys, which are those massive numbers.  If you can guess the private key that secures what I assume is the most valuable Bitcoin address then you can take those coins.",

                    "body": "There are two algorithms at play most of the time when we talk about quantum computers and cryptography:  Shor's Algorithm and Grover's Algorithm.\n\nShor's Algorithm is best known for solving integer factorization:  given a number with two factors of about the same size, find those factors.  This is the problem that older RSA encryption was based on.  Shor's Algorithm has been demonstrated as early as 2001, but the demonstration involved finding the factors of 15.  It was notable *how* they found the factors, though obviously the size of the problem wasn't anything to shake a stick at.  21 has also been factored similarly.\n\nShor's Algorithm can be modified to instead solve the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP).  Traditional logarithms like Log10(1000) ask \"how many times did we have to multiply 10 with itself to get 1000?\"  DLP instead asks \"how many times do you have to do this action before you get to this result?\"  We might think of the action as turning one face of a Rubik's cube, then rotating the whole cube, then we want to know how many times you have to do that to get a given cube state.  Modern Elliptic Curve Cryptography is based on a similar concept, though the action involves doing some math on an elliptic curve.\n\nShor's Algorithm takes a problem that would normally take O(2^(N)) time and makes it take *about* O(N^(3)) time.  That is to say, instead of requiring on the order of 2^256 operations (10^(77)) it takes on the order of 256^3 = 16.7 million operations.  Your computer did more than 16.7 million operations just to display this page.\n\nHowever, quantum computers large, stable, and low-noise enough to actually run this algorithm have yet to be demonstrated publicly.  I would expect the first quantum computer of this magnitude to be developed by a three-letter agency, but one *probably* doesn't exist yet.\n\n************\n\nThe other algorithm is Grover's algorithm.  It is structured as a dictionary lookup:  what entry in this dictionary has a given definition?  Here \"dictionary\" is taken very coarsely--rather than being a data structure on disk it's a transformation of inputs to outputs.  This sort of function is used a lot in cryptography where it's known as a cryptographic/secure hashing function, like SHA1, SHA256, MD5 (broken now), etc.\n\nWhere Shor's Algorithm takes a completely intractable problem and makes it nearly trivial, Grover's algorithm just gives a leg up.  It takes the time complexity from O(2^(N)) to O(2^(N/2)), so instead of taking on the order of 2^256 operations (10^(77)) it takes 2^(128) (10^(38)).  This makes it much easier to defend against.  If 256 bits was secure, just go to a 512 bit hash and now you're right back to 256 bits worth of security.  If you tried to do that to defend against Shor's algorithm then you'd need to go to keys that are about 10^25 bits long, which is itself completely untenable (tens of billions of petabytes per key).\n\n*****************\n\nThere are a couple of different attacks one could perform against Bitcoin.  The simplest is to just try to break ECC.  For this you need someone's public key, which is paired with their private key.  Shor's algorithm will let you compute their private key from their public key.\n\nHowever, in Bitcoin public keys are also kept secret most of the time.  Elliptic Curve Cryptography doesn't require this, but it's an extra layer of protection.  Typically only a hash of the public key is made available, so to even start Shor's algorithm you either need the holder of the keys to announce their key (typically only done just as they spend the coins) or you need to run Grover's algorithm on their public key hash.\n\nOne might also attack the network itself, trivializing mining.  Mining is based on hash functions, too, so if you could trivialize the mining process you could mine every block and thereby control whose transactions can be transmitted (but you can't force a transaction to occur).  This would also take Grover's algorithm, or more likely something much, much better.",

You have 10 billion possible combinations that the passcode could be. \n\nWith a classical computer, it will have to test each passcode one at a time to try and find the correct one. If it can do one passcode per second, it would take 10 billion seconds, or 317 years to try every combination. If it could test 1 million combinations per second, it would take 10,000 seconds, or almost 3 hours to test all possible combinations. For larger, more complex passcodes, modern rcomputers would take literally thousands of millions of years to guess every passcode. \n\nA quantum computer can solve these types of problems much faster. Rather than testing every possible combination one at a time, a quantum computer takes advantage of something called 'quantum superposition'. You don't need to understand what that is, but you can look up 'Schrodinger's cat' to learn more. Essentially, quantum computers are able to 'check' many possible combinations at the exact same time to find the passcode extremely quickly. \n\nOne thing to note however is that quantum computers are only really better than traditional computers at these types of problems. A quantum computer can't solve simple arithmetic faster than a traditional computers.",

When I was 11 I was reading technical manuals on how to properly configure modem init strings and set up Com/IRQ ports so I could play my games... and my nephew is a teenager yet cannot seem to figure out how even a simple file structure works despite having access to Google, Youtube tutorials, etc. \n\nHow the hell am I ***STILL*** the tech guy in the family?\n\nPersonally, I blame the trend to lock everything down and pin customers into a walled garden in most newer personal computational devices like tablets and phones. Even if I wanted to help, there's only so much you can do within the confines of a locked down software environment that's designed to fail. I could root the devices, sure, but that throws a whole ton of \\*'s into the usability which I'm not prepared to troubleshoot (or take the blame for) if something goes wrong. If they felt even a modicum of ambition to actually take over the role of administration for their own systems, I'd be more than happy to - but everyone seems complacent enough with what they're given by the companies trying to fleece them.",

Ironically, the much-disliked Ribbon interface was a high point of that, where you could reach any function by a sequence \"Alt + sequence of letters and numbers\" -- uniquely -- or look for it visually and click it until you'd remember the sequence. By contrast, classical drop down menus never received a method of resolving non-unique keys, and not all entries would be accessible in that manner. E.g. if a menus contains (nonsense example for demonstration)\n\n    Edit section\n    Insert S&ection\n    Delete S&ection\n\nthen pressing `e` would jump between Insert and Delete, but never select either, while Edit would not be accessible by any key, because the explicitly marked keys take precedence. Additionally, coupling the accelerator keys to the text made it locale dependent.\n\nBy contrast, the Ribbon would resolve non-uniqueness by adding numbers (`Alt+E,1` and `Alt+E,2`) and make sure that every item has *something* assigned. At the same time, each item that had a simpler hotkey assigned (e.g. `Ctrl+B` for bold, or `Ctrl+Shift+F` on a German keyboard (for \"fett\")), would show it as tooltip.\n\nSadly more recent Ribbon-like UIs like Paint 3D, and most notably the browser versions, have backpedaled on that progress... The universal availability of Alt-sequences is no longer present, and hotkeys are not reliably shown as tooltip.",

The reason we make the same mistakes over and over again (I'm looking at you local chinese restaurant with the amazing general tso's that always makes me sick) is that our brains minimize trauma over time but idealize pleasant memories.  I'm no psychologist, but I imagine this has something to do with loss.\n\nI spent almost a year in my bed at a 10 on the pain scale, it was so bad that if I had to roll over, I would literally pass out from the pain.  It was at the height of the opiate epidemic.  I couldn't get pain meds without a pain management doctor, I couldn't get a pain management doctor without an MRI to prove I really had herniated discs pressing on my spinal cord, and I couldn't get an MRI because MRIs are expensive and my insurance was playing a waiting game hoping I'd either die or let my policy lapse before they had to pay for treatment.\n\nMy point is, those memories have faded.  I \\*know\\* I was in the worst pain imaginable, and I take care to avoid flare ups, but I can't \"remember\" the pain, relive it, the way I can something like my wedding vows.\n\nIf I was guaranteed no permanent damage from the 10 minutes of immeasurable pain, including PTSD (which is literally a failure of the aforementioned brain mechanic), I would take it in a heartbeat.  The memory of the pain would fade away, but the memory of the pleasure would age like a fine wine until I found myself volunteering for another session of the worst pain possible.  \n\nOf course, if tapping out is an option, obviously no one would make it.  It would be like the people who volunteered for waterboarding to prove it wasn't torture.",

Add up the genocides and serial killers and hate crimes and just general nastiness.  Add up the factory farming and the puppy mills and the deforestation.  Really think about all the pain and suffering in the world.\n\nNow compare it to helping out your fellow man. Donating something, volunteering.  Not only does the amount of times these things happen tip heavily on the bad side, but even the quantification doesn't even compare.  We aren't humanly capable of doing something as good as the worst thing we've done is bad, if that makes sense.\n\nExistence is just an absolute hell on earth when you start taking score.",

Humans aren't meant to existing those kinds of extremes.\n\nCuz you're 100% right that experiencing pure, perfect bliss will total eff up your scale for what pleasure is. Speedballs? Yeah, that's as close to touching heaven as you'll ever get while alive. And knowing how that feels ruins a lot of other shit. Even years later. It takes SO long to reset your pleasure scale and you'll ruin your life cussing that feeling. \n\nOn the other hand, the worst pain ever? That'll do some serious damage. Won't get into details, but suffice it to say, I know pain. At least in the emotional sense. Although if you've ever had severe dental problems, then you're probably familiar with agony too. And the body has mechanisms to manage the kind of physical pain that's too excruciating to endure, releasing endorphins, going into shock, falling unconscious. \n\nBut emotional pain, that's a whole other animal. Or bodies don't know how to deal with that, so it just ends up being trauma. And anyone who's ever dealt with ptsd can tell you, not a fun time. \n\nHumans aren't meant to experience the absolute limits on either end of the pain/pleasure spectrum, and doing so well only screw you up in ways it takes YEARS to heal from. \n\nThankfully, we're also incredibly adaptable and resilient, so healing is possible (and thank God for that). But as someone who's been on either end of the scale, I'm definitely just walking away, coz I don't want either option",

ADHD and depression always get in the way of things.\n\n The last time I was at the hospital it felt like a net positive experience, which is crazy seeing as I was there because of an emergency testicular torsion. That was **horrible** and very painful. I was in surgery within 30 minutes of getting into the ER. Then, I woke up. I didn't feel anything special, other than... bliss. Everything was so quiet and nice. I just laid there, snoozing and relaxing. Didn't have a care in the world. I wasn't restless like I always am. I was just existing and it was nice. Haven't been that relaxed and mellow for ages. I'm willing to bet that was the morphine or whatever other opiate they'd injected. I didn't feel any sort of high or non sober. \n\nDoes that about describe what you were chasing when addicted? Because if so, holy shit, congratulations on kicking that addiction. I'll do anything to **not** have any sort of access to anything that can provide that. Even if that hypothetical substance could be non destructive and non addictive, it would still terrify me. That feeling is literally the meaning of life, and if I could have it any other way than the hard way of basically making good life choices, odds are I'd simply stop living. Scary shit.",

And most people don't just have a bunch of illegal drugs lying around they can try easily to even try to recreate it. People aren't mindless pleasure seekers who will drop everything because something feels good. There are a lot more environmental factors and barriers in place that prevent things like this from happening. \n\nThe first time I tried MDMA, for example, it felt amazing. It was literally all I could think about for a couple days, and if there was more lying around the house, I probably would have tried it again immediately even though you're not supposed to do it more than once every few months. But that passed pretty quickly, and it wasn't that hard to reassert control. And after a few weeks, the exact memory of how good it felt had pretty much faded entirely. I was more or less just left with the knowledge that it felt great without feeling any particular temptation to do it again, more than I'd like to have a really great meal or watch a really great movie. \n\nNow, \"maximum pleasure\" would be some orders of magnitude beyond that. But if there's not a clear connection between that experience and getting that experience *again*, and no permanent brain chemistry changes, the memory will fade in the same way. I don't really expect people would just try random things to get that same pleasure. That seems about as logical to me as binging movies to recapture the feel of eating a great steak. And specifically, I've never heard of someone having a great experience on drugs and then trying to have sex to recapture the feeling of the drug, for example. So I'm not sure that it follows people would try other experiences to try to recapture a one-time experience that can't be replicated.",

The good side is that companies have strict laws about how they can process your data, how to get consent, what can even be consented, what can move across borders, etc. It\u2019s really refreshing knowing that even if I agree to let a company use my data, that it probably wont end up in a completely unrelated database a few years later. In many countries this wouldn\u2019t be against any law at all, or at worst a fine. In Switzerland it\u2019s criminal.\u00a0\n\nThe downside, of course, is that certain \u201cfreedoms\u201d are curtailed as well. Street photography is difficult because you have to get the consent of easily recognizable people even in public to publish any photo.\u00a0Or they can ask you to delete any photo you took of them and you legally have to comply.\u00a0Celebrities love it here because they can just walk down the street, but if you have a blog you have to be really careful.\u00a0\u00a0Dashcams are similarly problematic.\u00a0Switzerland also gets accused of being a tax avoidance haven where it\u2019s difficult to pry into people\u2019s assets, and while that\u2019s not as true as it used to be, some of that comes with the privacy territory. Another downside is these companies which can\u2019t monetize data as easily sometimes just don\u2019t provide services here. Oh no\u2026 anyway.\u00a0\n\nActual privacy protection doesn't seem to really be all that high priority for Americans or many countries. They could demand similar laws, but would have to give up some of their own freedoms and get fewer \u201coffers\u201d and \u201cgood deals\u201d in exchange for their data.",

The privacy you're speaking of set sail for many people back in 2007, most people nowadays aren't even aware of the concept of privacy anymore. Since then people have been willing more and more to give up their privacy for the sake of convenience and entertainmnent, easiest example would be tiktok. So many people installed the app without a question and now use it, the majority doesn't care about how much info tiktok reads from your phone. \n\nWhen the average user installs an app and the app requires access to your camera, contacts, phone calls, media gallery and what not, not many people will think \"Hey, why does this app that has nothing to do with contacts or phone calls require access to these things?\", heck most people won't even read what they're clicking.\n\nThere's a reason why I don't use a single social media app aside from reddit but at least reddit doesn't know my real name, they have my e-mail and that's that. So whenever you're about to install an app on your phone, you should ask yourself is you really need it. On the conspiracy sub \"My phone is listening\" is a topic that comes up on a regular basis, but this can also be caused by a single app that you're unaware of.\n\nAnother good idea is to not use \"Sign in with google\" or other accounts on websites for two reason, why do you need google to know you're using the website and why do you want to give that website your google account? The only reason why this exists is for convenience but this convenience yet again makes you give up more privacy.",

While the tech has advanced much further in the past decade since I was part of that, it was already scarier than the average person knows & I'm tied by NDAs, so I'll stick with the stuff that is publicly known & regularly reported on. If you were exposed to a fraction of what I was, you'd rewrite your comment from the other side.\n\nOver a decade ago, Facebook was caught creating ghost profiles for people that never even signed up, based entirely on data they got their hands on through various methods, which included being mentioned or tagged in posts/photos by people they hung out with that did use the service. They said it was so that the moment you signed up, it would know about your social network & be able to recommend friends to add, but was proven to be much deeper than that.\n\nIf you use bogus identifying data on optional products, they can still build the equivalent of ghost profiles & even figure out who you are, if they even need to know that. They don't need to know your name to nudge you towards perception altering content based on what you have let them learn. Best practice is to avoid traditional social media.\n\nAlso, there are tons of required things a person has to do that collects & sells your data. An example is grocery shopping. Unless you have the wealth to not need to shop grocery weekly ads, you have a loyalty card that tracks your purchases. Your credit card also likely tracks your purchases. Your smartphone tracks so much more, including listening to your conversations to push recommendations & search results to you. Your computer collects data as well as your browser & many of the applications you need to use.\n\nSo, the only way to even attempt to avoid the majority of everyday data collection is to be wealthy enough to buy a large piece of land & live a simple life on a farmstead with no internet or smartphone. You also have to wear a mask when you grocery shop, paying only in cash, but even then we can now ID people from their gait, so it better be a mom & pop shop & you drive roads with no other homes (Ring doorbell cameras track), no ATMs, and no business large enough to have security cameras. You basically can't take part in modern society & avoid privacy issues.\n\nThe more you learn about this topic is an interesting curve. You go from unaware, to somewhat aware & taking a few basic precautions, to then learning more & taking more advanced precautions, & that continues until a tipping point where you learn how bad it is & then you back off to lower level precautions because you know it is impossible to avoid...or you mentally break & turn into a \"conspiracy\" nut that removes themselves from reality & takes every precaution even though they know it is a losing battle. I put conspiracy in quotations because it's confirmed at this point.",

Life, sometimes it happens and up until that point you had an 820 FICO, perfect credit. But then you lose a loved one, and are injured through no fault of your own. You have some financial issues due to this. \n\nUp until yesterday, you were low risk, perfect credit. Then someone you love dies. \n\nWell, you better not get injured, and have to take time away from work. Because you will PAY. \n\n7 Years. They come after you for that long.

Likewise I sit on an IKEA dining chair instead of an office chair.  As for Billy bookcases, love them and the downlighters make for a cosy ambience on a Winter's evening.  There is a certain 'right of passage' moment when you buy your first bit of furniture you don't have to assemble yourself, but as I'm a fan of unfussy design, I love it.

                    "body": "I think I know the reason for the odd market position of IKEA: People who dont have money normally scrounge together furniture from family and garage sales, etc....they have a mishmash of stuff. people who have a small bit of money that they want to spend on furniture often go to IKEA and because of the bland design and low prices, they end up getting a whole house or room full of furniture that all matches and works well together. Wealthy people usually have matching high end furniture but its costs 20k to furnish a house that way so its very uncommon. Thus, people who shopped at IKEA tend to be halfway to the \"high-end\" look, and IKEAs designs over time have picked up a positive association from this. Now bland stuff is considered cool.\n\nAlso, the increasing trend towards furnishings and finishes being disposable. Many people actually prefer their furniture to get ruined because they want to buy new furniture after a short while. They will actually pay more for furniture that is temporary....just like people pay more for luxury cars that break faster. The manufacturers have no intention of changing this because the fact that they break is good news for the type of person who buys them.",

Yes, Ikea is expensive, because its mass produced, flat pack, mdf furniture. Its dirt cheap for them to make so they make a killing off selling it for a lot more than its really worth. A smaller, local furniture maker, who uses real wood and puts time and care into hand making furniture, would spend more on materials and time and would have a harder time selling their stock. They are actually luxurious but would have to sell cheap.",

No receipt or anything needed. Also spare wheels for their office chairs, replacement drawer slides, hinges etc... All free.\n\nBesides that you can get those right angle reinforcements. Not sure if Ikea has them but definitely on amazon or any hardware store. Super cheap and will reinforce connections A LOT.\n\nAlso if you disassemble furniture often, you can but machine screw wood inserts. Makes the assembly much stronger, can use higher torque on fasteners, and can reassemble them without stripping them.\n\n\nI understand the majority of people aren't going to do anything of the sort but I just want to point out that there's loads of things that can be done, and most of then are super easy and rewarding to do if you're just a little bit DIY inclined. \n\n\nYou can pay much more for furniture than what Ikea cost, and still get similar or even lower quality...

My computer desk is modern because as nice as an antique desk is, they were made for writing, not for typing, and that's not what I'm doing on it. Though next to it is a small antique half height couch table that my computer and 90s stereo sit on - don't want it on the floor, don't want it on my desk, but next to it at half height is perfect. And the 90s stereo is just something I picked up at a customer's house basically for free and been using as computer speakers. Someone's grandfather died and they had to flip the house, so I come in with the crew and take all the really fancy things to sell for good money. And then the actual garbage disposal crew has less heavy furniture to remove, and the customer has the peace of mind that nothing they throw away is worth anything, and they can sell the house. \n\nIkea stuff is essentially single use. You buy it, you use it, you move, and it's half trashed by the time it arrives at your new place, you move again, and it's just falling apart. But if you just need something that looks decent and fits in your house, just buy Ikea! Or anything else! It's your house, do what you want with it!! The antique shit that's built to last is going to be heavy as fuck and you'll have to pay two people to carry it and build it with 200 year old assembly techniques that predate the idea of written manuals. If it's even built to be taken apart and moved, sometimes it's just a solid block of wood that you get to try and fit through the door. Fuck stairs...",

Doesn\u2019t make big bubbles and the bubbles don\u2019t last.\n\nMost places use CO2, which is how carbonation gots its name, and that forms carbonic acid in a drink. The carbonic acid formation means lots of gas dissolves, which means bubbles last longer. It also makes big bubbles. The only way to offset the acidity some is to use a hard or alkaline water.  But that in turn means less bubbles.\n\nSome places use Nitrogen, which is the most common element in air. Guinness is a nitro, and there are Pepsi cans that use nitro. Some bars might use a nitro carb for their sodas if it\u2019s what they are running to pressurize their beer lines. Nitro makes very small bubbles that in turn last longer and are harder to pop, creating a lot of thick and creamy foam.",

One day I decided to display it out of the box, cause I liked the character and show (Bender from Futurama).  Turns out it's fucken $70 online. I won't sell it or re-box it because I don't care, but it does make me happy knowing that molded color plastic is worth that much. \n\nI have shamelessly bought versions from other series (Trailer park boys, mandolorian, spider-verse, solar opposites). I do agree largely that they will be trash when my time comes, but it makes me happy now and why tf wouldn't I do that?",

Once you've wasted enough money on something, you have two choices when confronted: admit you've made bad decisions, or double down and become loyal to the corporations who took advantage of you. Most people aren't comfortable admitting their own weakness.\n\nI'll admit that I recently re-joined an online game that I vowed to quit, after a 5-year break that seriously enriched my life. But lately things have been rough, I've been tired and weak and stupid. Since January I've probably spent almost a hundred dollars on this game, if not slightly over. I was weak; I am *still* weak and I'm using this game to distract from all the bad things in my life, but the time and money spent only makes things worse. I AM AN IDIOT but at least I'm not in denial.\n\nCollecting habits skyrocketed during the pandemic, out of boredom and loneliness and stimulus checks giving some individuals a confusing amount of money that they didn't know what to do with. I started collecting Swiss army knives. I use them so I don't feel entirely guilty, and generally they use cellidor plastic which isn't horrible for the environment. Sometimes they use nylon which isn't so great. Victorinox is a *little* more eco-friendly than most major corporations, focusing heavily on material recycling and green energy, but they're still a major corporation that does plenty of immoral stuff and I'm not blindly loyal to them. Even if I use their products, the spending habit hasn't been very smart. Collecting is rarely a smart decision and defending it is silly.",
