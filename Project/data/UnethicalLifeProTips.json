Second, this takes time and energy and might be more trouble then it's worth for some people but always get an itemized bill and dispute stuff you weren't charged for. Often they will charge you for an entire package of something even if they only used part of it. Make a list, dispute one or two at a time and ask for a new itemized bill after each. Worst case your bill is likely going to go down and you gain some time before having to pay, best case if you was enough of their time on disputes you hit a point where it's not worth their time anymore and they just negotiate a chunk of your bill to get you to stop. Keep in mind you mileage will vary on this and you could end up spending a good chunk of time on the phone or mailing letters but fuck it, why over pay if you don't have to",

You then know that they love you for you! Then get braces as a married adult and have a glow up. They will love you just the same but now they got a more hot looking spouse! That's what I did. I didn't get braces as a teenager because I was told my jaw would need to be broken. I went back to a different orthodontist in my 20s. He told me I didn't need my jaw broken. Just needed 4 teeth pulled. I got them and had my glow up. My husband treated me just the same after the braces. He said I looked good but his love for me didn't change. I always wondered if I had gotten braces as a teenager, that I might never have met him. Some other guy would have dated and married me because I would have been better looking. Sometimes what you think was a mistake you made in your life turns out to be the best thing you ever did.",

Ozempic has lower doses of semaglutide and was developed specifically for type 2 diabetes patients.\n\n>One other difference is that Ozempic is typically covered by health insurance, while Wegovy is often not covered.\n\nhttps://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/ozempic-for-weight-loss-does-it-work-and-what-do-experts-recommend/2023/07#:~:text=Ozempic%20is%20not%20approved%20for,it%2C%20establishing%20a%20new%20normal.",

I'm not talking about manipulating or controlling people to become only what you want. lol. Most people do want to lose weight or improve their style they just don't know how or can't do it on their own. Date them, and then, instead of complaining they're fat, go for walks with them. Then start jogging with them, a bit at a time, and when they start to see improvements, they'll find that motivation to keep it up. Got a guy that dresses like shit? Take him shopping. Pick a shirt and tell him he looks sexy in it and it makes you horny. Dude will buy 5 of those shirts on the spot. lol. Trick is, of course, to not do it in a complaining, nagging or insulting way.\n\nI imagine most of these people will remember you chose them before they got hot, feel like you really love them just for them, and love you all the more for it.",

But the reality is that very few come in for ozempic for a, b or c. But rather they want it for weight loss, which isn't approved. Therefore it will cost them 500 bucks a month.)\n\nI am not joking with you, in my limited experience as a medical student and medical assisting, it feels like half, if not more, of all patients come in looking for a glp-1 ag. I appreciate them doing more to make the drug more available. The data we have currently is overwhelmingly positive.

When I realized it was pointless to get mad at them, I found a way to make them work for me.\n\nUsually when someone is tailgating me, it's because I'm also unhappy with the driver that's going too slow in front of me. Since I won't tailgate the slow driver in front of me and force them to move over, I move instead and let the tailgater pass me. I immediately move back into the lane, ending up right behind the tailgater, and I let them clear the way in front of us by tailgating every car slowing us down. It's been working for me for years. Now, when a tailgater pulls up behind me, I think \"Hell yeah buddy, go get em for us!!\" and I follow behind them like the little dumb sidekick cheering on the big bully. \n\nIt's exactly the same concept when I'm walking in the city, getting pissed that slow walkers are blocking the sidewalk. If there's a fast walker dodging folks, I follow right behind them in the path they've cleared.\n\nThis tactic won't be for everyone, but it's been an awesome strategy for me for years and I feel like I've hacked the system. Learning to be genuinely excited when a tailgater pulls up behind me (and being free from literally all resentment toward them) is a really weird and positive bonus.",

Now I have a Tesla Model 3, 100% torque available instantly. It\u2019s like a rollercoaster launch.

I was going well below the speed limit as the road had not been plowed and it was quite slippery with low visibility. There was a single set of tracks down the middle of the two lane highway, where previous cars had passed by, all following the same path. I was doing the same, when a huge Dodge Ram came flying up being me. \n\nIt tailgated me hard, obviously wanting to pass. I wasn't sure how I was going to safely pull over, so I slowed down even more. The frustration must have killed his last remaining brain cell as he decided to swerve around me in the 2 foot snow. As soon as he got back in front of me, he lit up his rear fog lights, absolutely blinding me. Thankfully I was going pretty slow by that point as I deviated from the track, the snow cushioning me to a stop resting nearly sideways on the icy road. \n\nIt took me more than a couple minutes before I felt I could see well enough to continue driving.  I'm not saying that this is the same thing, but it was absolutely clear to me that he was fucking with me.",

HR or IT requests equipment back, people send it back, everyone is happy.\n\nIf something is missing or there's a variance, a decision needs to be made about whether it gets pursued. Pursuit costs the time of potentially several resources. If the object in question is a years old asset, then it has already run through the depreciation table from finance's perspective. This means it has already provided all the value they expected it to provide when they originally budgeted for it and now it has zero expected value.\n\nIt generally isn't worth any resource time to pursue something that has no value. And so, generally, it doesn't get pursued. \n\nExternal factors can influence this. Potential of sensitive data on a device can up the value of recovery. If the employee was let go they may go to lengths to recover. If the person is otherwise suspected of stealing equipment they might try to recover to make a point. There might be one person in HR or IT who just likes personally crusading on this kind of thing. So in that way, YMMV. \n\nBut overall it mostly comes down to whether the resource cost of investigating and recovering is equal to or exceeded by the value of the item that needs recovering...and 9/10 times outside of large equipment it really doesn't.",

The equipment usually isn't worth stealing or it's not worth risking your job. It's going to cost more in man-hours to do any investigation than it is to just write it off as lost and move on.\n\nI worked at a remote office for a while. They didn't even ship back desktops when people left and we started having a storage problem. We started repurposing them for other things in the office and eventually just asked IT and they let us have them. \n\nOnce you hit a certain size as a company - and it doesn't have to be very big - what IT cares about changes.

One summer Friday night I was trying to sleep because I had opening shift Saturday morning at the bank. It was after midnight when some guy starts doing donuts, ripping around on what sounded like an obnoxiously loud 2-stroke dirt bike in the empty parking lot right behind my building. It was summer and the building had no A/C, so everybody had their windows open to get some airflow. If it was loud and annoying to me, I figured it must be for everyone in my building hearing it. \n\nAfter a while of this I\u2019d had enough. I went out on my balcony and in a loud, clear voice I yelled, across both parking lots \u201cEXCUSE ME!! YOU\u2019RE KEEPING THIS WHOLE BUILDING OF PEOPLE AWAKE, and SOME OF US HAVE WORK IN THE MORNING. PLEASE DO THAT SOMEWHERE ELSE.\u201d \n\nAfter a moment of silence the dude actually said a feeble \u201c\u2026sorry\u201d back and he rode away. We\u2019re in Canada, so this was all a very polite interaction.  I never knew of other residents heard me or appreciated it, but damn did I feel like a hero in that moment, at least for myself. Pretty sure I couldn\u2019t even fall asleep after my triumph, I was so high off the thrill of it.",

He never sat but I saw him with ice cream later.\n\nI also saw them two different times in which the kid was trying to drag his mom somewhere and when she didn't go he threw himself on the ground.

Finally it was my turn at the gate and I looked at the drunk guy as I said to the agent, \"I'm sure you know you do not have to allow an intoxicated person to board their flight...\" \n\nAnyway, some guy told me to take his seat by his wife in case I ended up seated next to the drunk guy.

You can dress sexy but you have to wear a hobo looking coat over. You act a little crazy in public especially if somebody is looking interested. One of our favorites is, very seriously try to bite your own ear. If you have any doubt that it works, go try to do it in the mirror. Especially if you put a little growling or snarling in with the trying to bite, people will leave you the hell alone. Mumble to yourself a little and rock back and forth, same deal. People are looking for the easy target. Someone that looks crazy is not an easy target. You never know what crazy is going to do once you engage it.",

For years, I worked for companies that expected us to just take it and kiss the ass of applicants. This company is privately held and not like that at all. The most satisfying moment I have had was when a couple came in and were being rude and aggressive with my leasing. agent. I heard them from my office and got up to go see what was going on. They continued and I simply said, \u201cWe are declining your applications, you may leave now or I can call security to escort you out.\u201d The look of shock on their faces as they took in the fact I was armed with pepper spray and already had my phone out indicating I was serious, made up for many years of dealing with bullshit. It\u2019s hard to hire a good leasing agent, shithead applicants are a dime a dozen.",

I get sick of these generalizations: French are snooty, Canadians are nice, Americans are loud. In all my travels, I\u2019ve only been mistreated twice, both times, by coincidence in Spain. And I attribute this to two Spaniards who were just having a bad day. No, they didn\u2019t mistreat me because I was a \u201cMexican\u201d but because they were just two guys who were human. That\u2019s it. I didn\u2019t go home and say that \u201cSpaniards are jerks\u201d because that\u2019s unfair because so many other Espa\u00f1oles were cool.\n\nWant to know my secret? Easy: be respectful. Be courteous. Know good morning, good evening, please and thank you in that country\u2019s language. (I butchered saying \u201cthank you\u201d in Hungarian, but the smile I got from the server warms my heart to this day.) KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY YOU\u2019RE VISITING! (Let a Pole know how impressed you are with Jan Sobieski and you have a friend for life.)\n\nThe only time I was ever \u201ctargeted\u201d for being an American was in 2019 when I got a ton of inquiries regarding our then-President Trump. Lots of good natured teasing, but nothing nasty or mean. And people just wanted to know my experiences living under that administration. That\u2019s it - simple human curiosity. I never interpreted these comments as anti-American. Why?\n\nOk, I\u2019m stepping off my soap box. If we are responsible travelers and stop attributing poor behavior by a some people as a criticism against an entire country, then we\u2019ll fewer of these posts in the future.

We have a lot of Mexican people here (and salvadoreans, and columbians and brazillians, etc.) who have been living here for years, and call this their home, even if they still have thick accents - so to ask someone from any South/central American country, how they like our country seems kind of weird and even slightly racist/ignorant in itself. Like these people have probably been here for years and have jobs and families and we are asking them how they like our country as if they are all brand new. Where as Spain is much more rare. We dont share a border with them or even a continent. I have lots of friends that are salvadorian and have been here most of their lives. If someone asked them how they like it here, i think that would end up being very awkward too. Some people just might be kind of afraid of saying the wrong thing and sounding ignorant, so they say nothing. That doesnt excuse the idiots who bring up trump and the wall though",

I was, and am, a very liberal and peaceful person, and I HATED Bush, but it still felt gross lying about it when the stakes were so low.

Taking cues from them as to what \"manliness\" is led to my intake of intensely stupid ideas, such as \"being super clean isn't manly.\" That, combined with old habits born from years of depression and apathy, influenced me to get back in the habit of not washing up unless I felt that I had a specific reason because I had started bashing myself for being \"too clean,\" when really I was originally just maintaining basic levels of cleanliness and they were being disgusting just to puff up their masculinity; which, looking back, is a rather moronic thing to stake your manhood on.\n\nThen, the girl I was dating at the time found out that I was doing that stupid shit and jumped down my throat about it, which was totally justifiable and I hold zero grudges against her for, because I was being pretty damn dumb and it was causing her problems as well. Nowadays I'm a lot better about it, both because I take more pride in myself and I'm not around a bunch of old dudes who think it's gay to be clean or take care of yourself.

There\u2019s also a Redd Foxx comedy bit from the 70s about men who don\u2019t wash their ass. As a group in America, Black people were more on top of that bit of hygiene decades ago and we still get so many white Redditors that talk about men not realizing they really need to scrub that area every shower every day.\n\nI\u2019d be interested in the breakdown though. I do have white family from poorer regions that were more like Black Americans in the south and they\u2019re bigger sticklers on hand washing and cleanliness. I think it\u2019s due to having small farms and animals around. Like they won\u2019t let you wash your hands in the kitchen sink, which makes sense if you just got in from slopping the hogs.",

Never once did I step into a bathroom in the men's houses that was too dirty to do my job. The woman's houses on the hand were always disgusting. Blood everywhere, shit, piss, and the hair omg the hair. I'm still unsure how women aren't all bald. \n\nAnd they always always got so offended when I'd have to go to the house manager and say yeah. I can't work on the bathroom faucet because someone has bled and it shat upon it. \n\nLike even if you live in filth. If you know somebody else is coming maybe clean up?",

As it turns out, the air has aerosolized bacteria due to the toilet flush.  The petri dishes under the dryer were exposed to a much larger volume of air so they picked up more of the bacteria.  If HEPA filters were used on the dryer's air intake then the dishes from under them had significantly less bacteria (clean air displaces the room air which has the bacteria).\n\nSo, it's not the dryer's, it's the air.",

I told her if she didn't add the gratuity back then she could wait on them herself. She thought I was kidding. I got my things together and told her that I quit. She literally asked me \u201cwhat am I supposed to do about this by myself\u201d and if I could please just stay until we got the food out. I laughed and flipped her off as I walked out.

I actually did this. I quit a shitty job at a pizza store because me boss was a choch when I was in high school. I didn't see anything I got up and left. Everything in the food expired and customers demanded refunds for food they placed, it cost the owner a TON of money to fix it and they never fully recovered, but I left the key there. I didn't say a damn thing to anybody. The owner had an interest in ensuring the viability of their enterprise, not their employees. Contractually, sure, id get fired for it, but id quit, ya see... They called the police on me. Police said they couldn't do anything because I didn't do anything. Guess what! You know what one job that was criminally illegal to quit was called? SLAVERY!! The 13th amendment against indentured servitude precludes the possibility of making it illegal to quit a job.",

The server tips out a portion of their sales which is then split among other staff; I've seen tipout range from as little as 2% of total sales to as high as 6% of food sales and 10% of bar sales. Generally, the more \"high end\" the restaurant is and the more support staff involved, the higher the tipout is. I've never once worked in a place where chefs/BOH get any portion of a tipout, they are paid considerably higher base wages to start (e.g. $2.83/hr for server, $15-20/hr for line cook, a salary like $60-80k for the head chef).\n\nAlso out of the seven, I only worked at a single restaurant that put tips on paychecks and made people wait for them.

It\u2019s likely to blow back on you more than it is to hurt your manager, who had no way of even reasonably knowing this was happening unless they were supposed to be present for that shift and weren\u2019t.

If you ever have to explain an arrest on your record, this one gets the most sympathy, because you were, \u201cdown on your luck\u201d and most folks believe these laws are kind of dumb.  You could further the narrative with a story about how you triumphed over homelessness by \u201cpulling yourself up by your \u201cbootstraps\u201d.\n\nEdit:  To clarify, this may not work immediately.  However, some cities simply fine the homeless, i.e trespassing, curfew violations, loitering, disorderly conduct, etc.  When you get enough of these fines and do not pay them, a judge issues a bench warrant and your next interaction with law enforcement results with you being taken to jail, while you wait for a hearing.",

If they ask you your name, only give them a nickname (\u201ceverybody calls me Chipper!\u201d) Also stop by the front desk and ask random things any local would obviously know (where is the courthouse, etc.), or have a map of the city and ask them to point out a good restaurant or other such things. Always get their name, and always be friendly and happy!\n\n-have a fake conversation every once in awhile on your phone saying stuff like \u201cno, I can\u2019t go to the game this week, my boss has me stuck in (whatever you city is) for x weeks.\u201d Be sure hotel staff is around when you say it.\n\n\u2014keep a very strict schedule \u2014 of course you need to leave every day at the same time \u2014 you\u2019ve got to be at your clients at 9am sharp! \n\n\u2014have a room number ready to say if someone asks you. If you can dodge and deflect before answering, great, if not give the number, then grab your phone and look at it, saying \u201cDang, I\u2019m gonna be late!\u201d Then take off. \n\n-when you leave, get the eye of a service person, wave and say thanks, then stop by the bar again and grab a banana/muffin and coffee for later. Grab your phone and say \u201cleaving right now, meet you at the car.\u201d\n\n-learn the names of hotel staff and greet them cheerfully every morning \u2014 people love happy people who know their name. (Do I sound like I\u2019m repeating myself?)\n\n-when you do come into some cash, tip the service workers (practically no one else does), and tell them how awesome they are. If you do this NO ONE will ever question you. No one in the service industry would bust someone they like, they might even tip you off if someone is looking into you. They would bust in a heartbeat an asshole they don\u2019t like.  \u2018Course that is a general rule for life!\n\nGood luck!  Please update us!",

A few years ago I went to visit one of my buds down south and I was staying at a place and he liked to come and fetch me in the morning and have breakfast with me at the buffet.  No one ever said anything.  So one AM we are going to get together and me calls and tells me he will meet me at the buffet.  Odd cause I was just out there, but I go back out and have another waffle and some more oj and wait.  I go back to my room after a bit, still no sign of him.  He calls back and tells me he is waiting, so back out.  No sign of him.  I have some more eggs and toast and top off my coffee.  He calls again asking where the heck I am?  I tell him I am in the buffet in front of the tee vee.  There is only like one other person in there so I am not hard to find.  Hmm, he is in the buffet in front of the tee vee and no, I am not there.  We go back and forth a few times and he finally figures out that he is at the place across the street.  He finally came over and we had one more light round of food and coffee and headed off for some kind of an adventure for the afternoon.",

I\u2019m not sure if Aldi is in Canada, but I still hit up their dumpsters all the time for food. Most other large chains are good and there is very little risk. I\u2019ve been dumpstering food for over a decade at this point and the most trouble I\u2019ve had is an employee telling me to fuck off, which even then rarely happens. \n\nSome gas stations, such as ones that serve hot food, have pretty good dumpsters as well. GetGo is always good for me, there\u2019s usually pre-made stuff in their trash. \n\nIf you\u2019re near a Little Caesers, you should 1000% try their dumpster. The amount of pizza they throw away is crazy. Also bakeries can be good because of how many day-olds they throw out, or just baked goods that aren\u2019t recently fresh that no one will buy. Chipotle dumpsters have been good to me in the past as well. \n\nIf you\u2019re in a large city, it doesn\u2019t hurt to go to busy shopping districts and look around in the city trashcans on the sidewalk. These sometimes have take-out boxes of food that somebody ate some of, but didn\u2019t save the rest. \n\nYou\u2019d be surprised as to how easily you can get by on dumpstering food, as long as you keep track of which spots are solid, respect the area (don\u2019t leave trash everywhere when you\u2019re done), and are willing to dig around. Otherwise, when I\u2019ve been homeless before and extremely broke, I\u2019d go into pizza shops right before close and just be straight up with them about my situation. I\u2019d ask them if there was anything leftover that didn\u2019t sell. Being respectful and kind can go a long way. \n\nRegardless, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re in the position \u2014 I hope things get better and you figure something out.

Parents will buy the starter decks for their kids $5/pop even with the info that the money cards in the deck are fakes.  So long as the fakes look dece, their kids aren't going to care, so they don't care.\n\nIt's an easy money maker if you're already doing a garage sale.  In about an hour you can put together 40 decks in various tins and boxes using ~$5 worth of fakes and ~$30 worth of bulk.  Then you just toss it all in a big box that says \"Pokemon Decks, $5 each.\"  I usually get a lot of pokemon paraphenalia when I buy the bulk cards, stuff like dice, stickers, tins, boxes, sometimes playmats, lunchboxes, plushes, etc.  If they buy 4 decks, I'll toss in some low-level paraphernalia to go with it (like dice/coins/a card tin).  If they buy 10 decks I'll toss in some of whatever bigger paraphenalia came with the bulk-- playmats, lunch boxes, plushes, etc.  Every time I do a flea market or yard sale I bring more of them and I still sell out-- last time I did one was like a year ago, I brought 120 decks and still sold them all.\n\nMy advice when buying fakes is to go with rainbow rares, they tend to look the best-- a lot of other fakes are printed too dark, or the foiling is really bad.

We both maintain healthy lifestyles, dress smart, modern etc. I paid for Tinder for 6 months, got multiple Likes, and due to paying for the service, got a 'larger cast of the net'. Eventually met a the person who is now my gf of 18 months.\nMy buddy point blank refuses to pay for Tinder. I've seen his options/Likes on his app, and they are certainly not the calibre of women I'd want to be in a relationship. One thing that is a significant difference is that I mention I'm a single Dad of young children straight away on my profile, as that filters out the time wasters who don't want to be in that sort of relationship. My buddy on the other hand doesn't mention it until he gets a date, and has had multiple women reject a second date due to not wanting to get into that dynamic.\nIf you've lost weight, get a female friend to give you some advice on new clothes, haircut, even if you'd suit a beard. If you haven't got a close female friend, use Tiktok or a similar app and there are hours of people giving fashion, conversation, cologne, and body language advice that will help a lot.\nYou always have to remember: If she's willing to swipe, then you're not creepy. If she's willing to meet you, there's potential (shes willing to give you a chance), and after the 3rd date, she likes you.",

This way you don't lie or mislead anyone.  \nIf she's deep in a conversation with you, she usually won't mind.\n\nI've had quite a bit of success that way. The reason for this is that if someone on Tinder sets their age to 20-30, not only will they not see me (40), but I also won't be able to see them since I fall out of their age requirement. Meanwhile I noticed in reality that younger women love me. So this is a win-win situation, at least for me.",

I have been taught that other than breaking into data systems hacking also means an act of using an artefact or a system in another way that it was intended to gain an alternative goal. That is why we have things like hack labs in Finland which have nothing to do with breaking into computer data systems.\n\nPS2. The users (people) are not the system. Tinder is. Tinder is a manipulative social experiment ment to make it more difficult for people to find partner and keep them in that system. Yes this system needs people but people are not the system.

If you know where they work you could post the montage on the social media of the company. \n\nIllegal: You could anticipate their arrival and see if they stop at the same spot every time.

Obviously don't include your personal information or any way to prove it was your friend, have someone who is a friend of a friend wear a mask, go in the bar and leave them right when it gets busy, and tape to street posts all the way down to the bar.\n\nCall up pretending to be an investigating journalist and say you have reports that some nefarious things were going down and ask them if they had any comments before your undercover minor that managed to buy booze at the bar came back to the studio with their footage. \n\nCall the fire marshall and report over crowding/blocking exits. It may not ruin them but I can tell you from experience it will hurt them if the marshal shows up in real time to address it, especially if they ARE overcrowded or blocking exits.

We asked politely for them to put our game on a single TV so we can watch.\n\nThey were busy, I get it. But 5 minutes pass and no game. We ask a different person to please put our game on. 5 more minutes, no game. We ask politely a couple more times with no luck. At this point we have missed the first quarter. My friend speaks to the manager and he basically tells us to fuck off and no one cares about the game we want to watch.\n\nWe all had glass vials of those potent stink bombs and we each crushed one in the doorway on our way out.\n\nI can't imagine how badly that place smelled. It was a stupid, petty thing to do and definitely ruined the day for a bunch of innocent people.

If the water meter is in an in ground box, after you shut it off, pour this stuff in. If you can find something heavy to cover the lid with, it\u2019s gonna take an act of Congress to get through it. This post fix stuff is like spray foam in a can, but it is used to set fence posts and mail boxes. Take it out of the packaging, roll from the bottom to the top like a burrito, pick up both ends and swish it in the bag for 15 seconds, slice a corner and pour. This will expand to fill a two foot deep hole that has a 4x4 board in it. \n\nBut this shit gets rock hard and will expand around all the nooks and crannies inside the water meter box. If you can set something like a cider block on top of the lid to contain the foam, then you\u2019ll have it nice and hidden. If any pops up, maybe get a drywall knife to trim it off.",

My first thought was to fill the bag with the liquid ass, then run the hose down your pant legs, through your sock, and out the sole of your shoe. It would be relatively hidden, and wouldn't necessarily be seen. And if anyone does see it, it would be easily dismissed, because who the hell is going to yell at a guy with a fucking catheter in?\n\nBest part is, if anyone thinks the smell is coming from you, just act embarrassed about the whole catheter deal, make up some medical excuse, act as if your system failed (and thusly caused the stench), then leave in a panic. I think u/moochir was on to something here.\n\nIf extra tubing is needed, you can find [extra tubing](https://gvmdist.com/products/plumbing-accessories/hose-tubing/chem-flex-hose-cvt125-1-8/?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIg7y06u7ziAMVn0X_AR3aJw5VEAQYCCABEgIduPD_BwE) at most hardware stores. The system should be easy to rig up. And you could rig up a secondary system as well for yet another smelly substance, or even for applying twice as much liquid ass twice as quickly.\n\nBonus points if you can get the health department to come in an investigate on the same day.",

I believe what the procedure is to go to your local police station and request an officer from the Geheime Staatspolizei \u2014 the officer may or may not be a party member but if not, don\u2019t worry, there are plenty of good SS men who work there too!  One of their detectives will open a file and investigate. They\u2019re rather overworked at present with all the false denunciations from angry neighbours but when they eventually get around to it, they will find the Jews, box them up and see that they are resettled east somewhere! (In case it wasn\u2019t clear, this is a partial joke riddled with sarcasm. I neither support nor advocate for Nazi policy but, my understanding is that this is broadly how someone would have reported someone for harbouring Jews in Nazi germany. The book I reference however is a good read if you\u2019re curious. I had to read it in undergrad.)\n\nJokes aside, perhaps start reading up on rebuttals to the clean Wehrmacht myth. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_clean_Wehrmacht\n\nAlso a good book to read is ordinary men. It tells the story of an order police battalion\u2019s role in the mass shootings of villages worth of Jews. The battalion likely had relatively few party members in the unit. \n\nFinally, can the police help?  I hear holocaust denial\u2019s a crime in Germany.",

On Reddit, just go try to post in a topical subreddit and disagree.  You'll either be so heavily downvoted that you're not part of the conversation or permanently banned.\n\nFor example:\n\nI have been banned from 2XC for 'off-topic' comments for arguing that that OP asking why all men support rape isn't true of all men.  'not all men' being a banned off-topic phrase.  Before being banned I was accused of being an incel, sent a Reddit Cares, comments were downvoted all -20 or below, etc.  I was being respectful, citing sources and engaging in dialog (with people who were more interested in getting their one-liners off and then blocking me).  I was immediately muted from mod mail on appeal.\n\nI've been banned from GCJ for 'transphobia' for suggesting that harassing children streaming the Harry Potter game on Twitch wasn't helping trans people and they should, instead, donate to the Trevor project which actually helps trans people.  Why this is transphobia, I'll never know.  I was also muted from mod mail when I asked about it.\n\nI was banned from AskWomen for 'incel posting' for arguing that loneliness carries health risks in women and so simply telling women to avoid forming relationships in order to protect themselves is not good advice.  Attempted to contact the mods, they simply quoted the 'no incel posting' and muted me from chat.\n\nNo matter where you go, you cannot disagree with extremists or you're immediately cast as the enemy.  There is no room for discussion or debate, if you're not yasslighting the OP then you're either too ignorant to be allowed to speak or an opposition member.  Either way you deserve all of the harassment and eventual ban coming your way.\n\nIt's disgusting that adults act like ignorant children the moment they're given a little anonymity and power.",

They're largely filled by people who have effectively specialized themselves at doing this.\n\nYou get used to spotting them if you're a good exec. They're not exactly phd candidates and the bullshit unravels quickly under scrutiny. This is actually part of why MBA layoff tactics have statistical backing.

It keeps things running smoothly.   \n  \nAnd then there was the time one of our third party tools went down while I was on vacation, and we were at risk of losing ~$15M in sales for the week or so they said it'd take to fix, and people were scrambling for a solution. And I got texted by our Director as a last resort and asked if I could please get on a call, and in under an hour, I was able to give my team clear instructions over the phone on how to circumvent the issue and get our internal tool to temporarily handle what our partner company would normally do, and we cut the losses down to less than $2M in lost sales. In under an hour, I saved the company ~$13M.   \n  \nSo they let me pretty much do whatever I want now and leave me alone because they know if everything suddenly breaks down, I'm the one to call.",

If you have a niche skillset you can apply to the job, use it. \n\nHowever, no skill in the world is going to move you up any ladder, unless you have the most important skill of them all; the skill to make your work seen.\n\nI've seen so many bozos, and have a few friends, one of them might be the most fucking skilled techie on the face of this earth working his fingers to the bone and barely making ends meat. \n\nSame as a dude in the company I used to work for, different department. Was a proper guru. He automated half of his day, then automated everything that was not getting done on time. Basically scripted other jobs that he was picking up slack for. How fast you reckon he climbed the ladder? Surprisingly fast; he climbed it like a cartoon character on a falling ladder. Was still doing the motions when he was laid off. His manager though! Got a fucking sweet-ass office for taking initiative. Basically sold it to corporate that he made a whole floor redundant. Some people knew, but nobody who had a vested interest was going to champion their cause.\n\nThe wizard, whilst sawing off his own branch was even kind enough to meticulously comment on every section of his code, like even the most glaringly obvious parts had ready documentation. His comments needed serious tidying up.\n\nThe moral of the story; don't do other peoples jobs unless you're getting paid to do them. Never do more than you're supposed to, unless you know you'll be able to present them your managers manager. Your manager isn't gonna promote you to do his job anyway.

We\u2019ve worked together for the last eight years and she will be CEO by end of 2024 - but when we first started working together, I was just a Manager and she was just a Director.

I just kept taking on more work to help out where needed and then getting promoted as recognition for that work. But I need to prioritize my mental health to avoid falling back into anxious / depressive / codependent habits - and it\u2019s constantly a battle to do so at this level, which means I burn out quickly due to the level of stress and complexity and frustration I deal with on a daily basis. \n\nIf I could do it all again I\u2019d take my skillset and go become a therapist. I think I\u2019d find it much more fulfilling.

This involved things like designing a rocket capable of carrying 3 people to space (with the intention of going to the moon), so they announced this intention and the expected launch day.  Then russia would weld a third chair into their existing 2 man rocket and launch that before the US.\n\nThis is why when people post that stupid meme that claims russia really won the space race it is stupid.\n\nBecause by the end of the race the US could send human beings to the moon and back, and Russia could launch satellites.  Russian government officials cared more about looking good than actually being good, and it backfired at every step.

I picked it open, went inside and got a few hours of sleep. Because that job really sucked. I was stuck in the parking lot all night. Did not have access to the dealership buildings. Some posts are like that. The client kind of hates you so they give you really shit working conditions.

We had an appointment for a showing, at the time we were very seriously considering getting an apartment even though we weren't financially solid yet. \n\nA strange old dude showed us the apartment but wouldn't rent to us because we slipped up and mentioned we'd been living in the shop. Understandably we did not seem like reliable renters. \n\nWe did notice that he just walked in to the empty apartment, it hadn't been locked. \n\nWe went back in the evening, walked in and confirmed the apartment was both empty and unlocked. We showered there regularly for the next couple of months until it was rented, then checked around the building for others... this was 2001 I can't recall if there were others but having the use of that empty apartment really improved the quality of our lives for that brief period.",

I remember onetime I accidentally walked in on some teenagers smoking weed and having sex. They were in the living room and ran into the bathroom when I opened the door.

Anyway the person comes up and goes \"Yeah, that was me. I basically just went to the pool in this unoccupied house because I had a booty call and didn't want my wife catching me cheating, here are the text messages leading up to this.\" pretty much like this ULPT is suggesting as he knew the house was unoccupied, and eventually he did get deemed guilty for minor property damage (tearing up a pillow to cover a camera) but that screen door definitely was just unlocked as it wasn't torn when shown on camera, so charged for trespassing and not breaking and entering with intent to rob.",

We had a psycho once who tried to tube our home sale.  He was mad because he wanted all our tall trees cut down. We didn't do it.  So he stood on he curb during our open house and all our showings and put all his junk from the garage out curbside five minutes before open house beginning.  \n\n  \nThe other thing you can do is to get a neighbor to call the cops and tell them there are suspicious people in your yard whenever they are seen on your property.

Time to retaliate with a well executed multi-layer plan.\n\nFirst things are going on the offensive. Get in touch with some of the neighborhood kids, pay them to do normal childhood pranks on them (Toileting Papering, egging, ricing their front yard, bologne on cars, bird seed on the roof, the works....) Nothing that would get the kids in trouble \"IF CAUGHT\" but enough to be a pain.\n\nNext thing I would do is some research into these peoples past lives, find the names of ex lovers, wifes/husbands/gf/bfs. Send letters, gifts, flowers, to these peoples addresses pretending to be the lover, ideally set up re-occuring deliveries or send the letters a few days after anytime you notice that the husband or wife is home alone. Try and send these letters to their work as well.\n\nIf they have a child, prank call them from a blocked number pretending to be the police or school, saying theres a problem, their child is safe but they need to report to the station/school ASAP... Im typically for leaving children out of it, but fuck em, this is unethical life tips....\n\nThis only works if they aren't apart of one of the super religious groups. But schedule a shit ton of meetings with missionaries from the Mormon or Jehovahs Witness churches, you can legit schedule meetings online or via phone and all you need is their name and address. Ideally schedule these for as early as possible on the weekends.\n\nPost Craigslist/FB Marketplace ads using a fake allias for anything \"Free\" but it has to be picked up between 5-8am on Saturdays and Sundays only. State in the ad to pull into the driveway and honk the horn before ringing the doorbell.",

I would get letters in the mail that someone complained about something and in the letter, he would say a date that the property was inspected. Except it never was. Never showed on video. I ignored it. I went to court 4 times in 8 months over the same thing. Nothing was ever wrong, because I brought it up in the first hearing that I'd get letters saying it was inspected on this date, but I have proof that no one was ever there. He started showing up. Never found anything wrong. After the 4th hearing, the judge told me that the district attorney is in the office on certain days and I should make an appointment to see if they would take a case for harassment. Everything stopped. Never got another letter. I don't care what the neighbors whine about when there's never been anything wrong.",

Id suggest going to or calling their office and explaining the situation. Considering they've already inspected the property several times, if you can convince the people in charge of the department that all the calls about your house are bogus, malicious, and made with due to a ongoing dispute with your neighbor, they will likely change the way they handle the complaints going forward. Usually the offices are small and understaffed. If you open a dialog with them, they will probably work with you to some extent. They may not be able to ignore every call they get. But at the minimum they can delay response time to the calls and cut down on the frequency of inspections severely. \n\nBut I'd definitely open a dialog with them and keep them in the loop about this dispute with your neighbor. \n\nId also try filing complaints with the police, even if they dont do anything about them, to atleast create a paper trail. You will probably need cameras to prove they're trespassing or breaking and entering, put them at every point where they might gain illegal entry.\n\nAnd you'll need to lock your fences and put up no trespassing signs, so its an actual crime if they knowingly attempt to circumvent the locks and enter. If you dont have fences/gates in some areas, put up temporary barriers of some kind, that require some vandalism to circumvent, with cameras aimed in those areas.\n\nIts a grey area whether its illegal to walk in someones back yard when the gates are unlocked and no signs are posted. Technically its illegal, but cops might not bother if its a civil dispute with a neighbor. They hate getting involved in civil disputes. But circumventing a locked gate or vandalizing a barrier is different.",

This guy had a large house and he lived alone, needed some extra money, so he rented out part of the house to a couple on a month-to-month handshake.  These squatters know who their targets are and they know the laws for eviction.  They were eating all the food, partying, running up the heat and AC, and just generally trashing the place trying to get the owner to leave.  Somehow, he managed to stick it out and was able to finally evict ~~him~~ them, but he only got a couple of months of rent out of them and they caused tens of thousands of dollars of damage to this guy's house.  I'll have to ask my brother what happened after.  I think the guy is happily paying for more house than he needs alone.",

            "text": "A few months ago I came here asking for tips to help get a man named Quentin out of my son\u2019s life. I\u2019m super grateful for all of the ideas, and many kind words.\n\nAs of today, and for the last three months, my son is happy and healthy. We found a transitional living house for him with five other young men and two house managers (and a dog). He\u2019s learning to adult: learning to cook, clean, and get a job. It includes therapy, gym every day, yoga, skateboarding\u2026 truly a dream come true.\n\nThe house is about 40 minutes away from where Q lives and my son feels he has friends, is purposeful and feels adult, and is learning and busy. They will also do job training.\n\nBefore this happened, I took as much of your advice as was possible. \n\nI contacted the manager at Q\u2019s workplace and the motel he occasionally stays at. I told them Q was allowing a disabled teenager to stay with him and giving him (and other teens) alcohol. Manager is local small business owner and took my information seriously. I also went to motel and pointed out the sign that said al guests must have ID (my son does not). I told manager I hoped he was abiding by rules or I\u2019d contact corporate.\n\nI also starting calling non emergency PD line when he was camped after park closing time, and leaving his dogs during the day. PD would move him along.\n\nSomeone had the great advice of being his best friend and showing up all the time. So I did. Q wants to see my son, hey here I am, too. I\u2019m at the park, I\u2019m at your work, I\u2019m near the motel. I even prepared fliers to let others in the park neighborhood (with a playground for small children) know about the tent, camping, and unsupervised, unneutered pit bulls.\n\nQ got increasingly upset. He said I was stalking him and he was going to call the police. I said, politely, please do. I\u2019d love to tell the police more about what you\u2019re doing with my son and other vulnerable young people. I told him, you want to be in my son\u2019s life, I\u2019m in your life. Up to you.\n\nI really felt bold after all of your advice nd encouragement. I was willing to keep going for the long haul. In the meantime we found a lawyer and I started tapping into resources to find my son some kind of job training, because he really wants to help and feel grown up. For a few weeks he was working at a drugstore through a program through a local agency. That was huge for him, stocking and cleaning and helping people. It also kept him busy for about a month and kind of removed Q slightly.\n\nQuentin either got sick of seeing me, or afraid of losing his job. The location of the motel he had been staying at occasionally stopped letting him, so he had to start using another location much farther away. Farther to walk to work and harder to deal with. I think he realized my son wasn\u2019t worth the trouble I was causing, and just stopped contacting him. \n\nThank you so so so so much for all of your ideas. I was so focused on trying to fix it from my son\u2019s end as his mom I had no idea how to actually deal with Q. You all were fantastic. Huge thanks from the mom of a happy, healthy, busy and purposeful young adult son. ",

It will already be more difficult now that he's 18 and you've started setting him up as you have but the longer you wait the more difficult it becomes.\n\nHe may do well where he is but at some point he may not. The bigger picture is what happens when you aren't available to keep an eye on him even from a distance. I have a family member that never went this path and should have. The \"kid\" (now in his 40s) managed a year away at college and even lived in his own a short time. He's worked regularly since he was 18, mostly through a job service for disabled people. He lived on his own in an apartment disability services oversees for several years. But, you hand him money it's gone, and he's so easy to take advantage of because like your son he's just a sweet guy who would do anything for a friend. He's now living with his mom again but she's in her 70s and won't be around forever. Unfortunately, she's buried her head in the sand about this fact for the last 30 years and has never done anything as far as legal guardianship or conservatorship and it's really biting her in the butt now.\n\nOn the other hand, I have a good friend with a 21 yr old son on the spectrum who can do quite a bit, but drs have said he'll never drive and he has terrible executive function and needs every detail of instructions spelled out step by step. He doesn't work, but idk if his parents have tried to get him in job training. But, they did get guardianship /conservatorship when he turned 18 because they knew he couldn't manage on his own.",

I have colleagues who work for organizations who help those without homes to stay with their pets (often their family.) Since I wrote the first post, one of these dogs has had puppies. I also tried to help my son realize that he wasn\u2019t responsible for the dogs and it was a hard life for all of them\u2026 until it became clear how in danger my son was. I guess I mention it as another example of how the adult in the situation was not being responsible, and how the untended dogs were not safe for themselves or other unfixed animals who might come into the park. For me the state of the animals is also sad and one reason my son was so compelled to \u201chelp.\u201d Which is a negative. I feel for them thought and never wanted to harm or scare them.",

The keys had a deposit (it was something like you paid $5 to get the locker, and got $2 back when returning the key), so while our clients (tour group) were taking their sweet time showering/changing/buying trinkets, I would sit around the lockers and wait for people that left their key behind on the locker and went home, I would walk around, get those keys and return them for the deposit \ud83d\ude02. I would make like $10-12, but hey, for a young kid going back to a country where dollars definitely had more value, it was a nice chunk of change, especially since I got to do it a few times a year. Just now I started thinking \"how come the staff (aka cast members , I worked at Disney myself later) didn't stop me?\" Well shit, I guess I was just accidentally making their jobs easier by not having to go grab keys later? Hell, I am sure they couldn't take the deposit, you can't even accept tips at a lot of positions at Disney world (source: my dad was a concierge at an upscale Disney resort where guests often passed Benjamins as tips, and he was supposed to reject them, which he did most of the time... When it was too obvious lol)",
