            "text": "My 4 year old is having a meltdown because he wants to watch \u201cThe girl who wears all black - black shoes and black socks and black clothes\u201d.  She also broke her picture?  Picture frame maybe?  Not sure if this is a TV show, movie, or YouTube video.  Any help would be appreciated!  He\u2019s pretty sharp so if I show him your suggestions he\u2019ll say yes or no right away. \n\nThanks so much!\n\nAlso - it\u2019s not Marvelous, I suggested that, he\u2019s saying this girl wears all black \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEdit - he\u2019s now saying she has a \u201cginormous stage\u201d and she was singing with people but she was not playing any instruments. \n\nIMPORTANT EDIT #2 - he says this is a real person, not a cartoon. \ud83d\ude36 I believe this could be a music video!  Female dressed in black on a stage singing \u201cloudly\u201d into a microphone.  Other people are on stage playing instruments but she is not.  I\u2019m guessing a band behind her. Fast song.  Somewhere a picture or picture frame breaks? \n\nEDIT 3:  MORE INFO - he says she is singing on a stage and also in her bathroom.",

I\u2019d really like to find it to see what she was talking about.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what I very vaguely remember:\n\n- It was about children in the apocalypse possibly\n\n- There was some kind of junkyard\n\n- There were robot insects maybe\n\n- At one point they stumble across this pristine factory that looks very out of place in the environment\n\n- There\u2019s a scene I remember vividly of a kid on a sofa eating cheese puffs, but then a girl comes up and says it\u2019s not real. He then takes off a headset or something and he\u2019s in a giant hamster wheel powering the factory.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s all I remember. I hope it wasn\u2019t just a dream I had.

Also, a similar concept is featured in the\u00a0Star Trek\u00a0episode \"Miri\". Predating all of these, and notable as the decline into savagery is the entire subject of the book, is\u00a0Lord of the Flies\u00a0by William Golding.

He is also super vocal and has been talking a ton since he turned 1. \n\nWe keep his [bath toys](https://www.shopdisney.com/toy-story-bath-set-461072272021.html) in the bucket they came in. \n\nEvery night while he\u2019s in there, he dumps out the toys, and puts the bucket on his head (kinda looks like a robot)\ud83e\udd16 , and says \u201cI\u2019m ____ _____.\u201d In the past, I\u2019ve thought he says \u201cHank evil\u201d \u201chey evil\u201d \u201cvery evil,\u201d but I can\u2019t figure out the character. I do think the second word is evil. \n\nI\u2019ve asked him to repeat it a bunch, and every time I ask where it comes from, he just says \u201cfrom the pumpkins.\u201d This leads me to believe it\u2019s some character who puts a pumpkin on his head. \n\nHe watches a fair amount of TV, usually but not always Disney plus including a lot of the Muppet Babies (my first guess would be the Halloween episode), Bluey, PJ Masks, Paw Patrol, Super Kitties, Mickey Mouse, Dora, and a few other shows. Always cartoons or animated, and could be a movie too. \n\nHere\u2019s the [vocaroo](https://voca.ro/1aDwbaKVCi4x) of our conversation tonight. \n\nUPDATE: here is an even clearer audio [vocaroo](https://voca.ro/1jJNTnDhvgdr).  \n\n\ud83d\udea8 MORNING UPDATE: \ud83d\udea8\n\nThank you to all you sleuths who\u2019ve helped already. \n\nThis morning he was watching Boss Baby in the living room and I rudely interrupted to have a very frustrating, but productive conversation with him about some of your suggestions. \n\nHere\u2019s the full [video](https://imgur.com/a/4DsTiit), [(Part 2)](https://imgur.com/a/CR6hQEI), [(Part 3)](https://imgur.com/a/8QTyGDN),  [(Part 4)](https://imgur.com/a/X1HIXhv). Keep in mind he is 2. No he was not choking, his water could wait. \n\nAn important note I\u2019ve learned: if he says \u201cno\u201d it\u2019s a definite no.

Keep in mind he is 2. No he was not choking, his water could wait. \n\nAn important note I\u2019ve learned: if he says \u201cno\u201d it\u2019s a definite no. If he says \u201cyes\u201d it\u2019s a \u201cmaybe, if I\u2019m currently paying attention to what you\u2019re saying, but I might have stopped listening\u201d so take any \u201cyes\u201d with a grain of salt. \n\nHe\u2019s also clearly not as familiar with the streaming services landscape as I\u2019d like, but he\u2019s getting there. \n\nSome key points: \n- It\u2019s not Wall-e\n- It\u2019s definitely a character from something. He did not invent this. \n- it\u2019s not some derivation of Jack Skellington\n- Not any of the main shows he watches \n- He said it\u2019s a movie \n- He said it\u2019s on Netflix \n- it\u2019s a boy, who gets scared and runs and flies. Might have wings. \n\nSO I EXITED BOSS BABY and started scrolling through Netflix with him. Here\u2019s [that convo](https://voca.ro/17bDlAhPgCc2). \n\nTLDR, it might be something from the minions. He pointed to the main guy (Steve Carrel\u2019s character).",

The man repeatedly claims he\u2019s keeping them safe from the outside world (ironically actually the case) but they begin to think they\u2019re being held captive for nefarious purposes. Both girls are unaware of the state of the world outside because they were put in the bunker by the man prior to either of them finding out about the aliens. One of the girl might have died during the escape, I can\u2019t remember. One of the first things that happens when they escape is this random women pulls up to the building they ran too when they escaped the bunker hatch nearby, and she stumbles to the house (more like a shack) door trying to get in. This is when they realize something\u2019s not right. I think the women is clearly fucked up in some way so they don\u2019t let her in and then she\u2019s merc\u2019d by the alien creatures. I think the creatures are on all 4\u2019s and like super fast, can\u2019t remember though. The setting is like tall grassland cornfield Kansas type place. Pretty interesting movie.

I guess I just want to know if I made it up or not so I apologize for what I\u2019m about to describe to you: \n\nAll I remember is that the characters are all in some kind of cabin in the woods. I think it was snowing outside. \nAnyway, in the cabin was a mom with her two kids, late teens/early twenties I think. (I\u2019m 95% sure they were her kids, but maybe I misremembered that) There was also a man who I assume held them captive. \nHe ordered the kids, who were siblings (whether biological or step-siblings I don\u2019t know), to MAKE OUT. The kids looked up to the mom like \"Mom, we don\u2019t wanna do that wtf\u201d but I think the mom told them to do it because she didn\u2019t want them to die. The man had an axe by the way. So the siblings make out and the mom watches and looks disturbed and I think even angry? And now this part I\u2019m unsure about but someone kills the siblings mid-act. I just don\u2019t remember if it was the man or the mom. I\u2019m leaning towards mom, though I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because she was ordered to.\n\nI must\u2019ve watched this around the early 2010s. But the movie could\u2019ve been released from anywhere 2000-2013. Obviously it\u2019s some kind of horror/thriller. That\u2019s all I remember. \n\nEdit- Some other small things I vaguely remember that might help: When the two were made to make out they were lying on a couch. There was a big fireplace in the room. It was a place with a lot of snow. I\u2019m now leaning a bit more towards the mom being the one who ended up using the axe on both of them. I think the mom was also blonde with short hair possibly.

A mom, a dad, an older brother and a little girl. One or two men break into their house and kill everyone but the little girl. She survives because she hid, my gut tells me she hid under the stairs but I also recall her hiding under the bed or in a closet? After the killers leave she runs into the forest, and she survives off of a piece of bubblegum or something crazy like that when she is found. I think it ends with her in a hospital, her voice is hoarse and she can't talk so she communicates by writing on a white board. I believe she may be communicating with her family's killer in that last scene. \n\nHere's some more context: \nThis was in the early 2000s, perhaps between 2006-2011 as my older sisters was the one watching it and she lived with us during those years. \n\nI've tried asking her if she recalls this movie show and she says she can't remember but it sounds familiar. Perhaps I may be confusing two different movie/shows with each other or combining them in my memories but alas any ideas would be very helpful!",

Apparantly the doppelgangers are the \"worst part\" of the parents. The ending is that they drive home and the daughter and viewer is not sure if they are their real parents. Apparantly at the end the dad gets killed.\n\nMy dad said it was released in the last couple of years. He estimated 3, but could be a bit more.\n\nAny help would be appreciated, thanks in advance! :D",

MODS please give the solved-reward to u/Individual-Voice5432\nThis ends a 30 year old itch for me! Brilliant!\n\nEDIT: I did *not* intend to mark this as solved! MODS please undo the solving, as I simply stated that I *would mark it if I recognised the scene. There are other promising hints, and I need time to look into the specifics and gather more suggestions.\n\nI don\u2019t remember exactly how old I was when I watched this movie, but think I was about 11yo in 1995. The only thing I remember is a scene in which a woman participates in a live performance or theatre play in the form of a spider with a human face. The spider is either painted on a board, like the type of funfair contraption where you stick your face in a hole, and it looks like you have a different body, or it might\u2019ve been a 3D spider \u201ccostume\u201d mounted vertically as part of the scenography. In either case, the woman had her face stuck in the hole, acting as a spider in a performance, and at one point a man sneaks up from behind and pulls her pants down and starts to eat her out, disrupting her performance . At this point in the movie my dad told me that I wasn\u2019t old enough to keep watching, and switched it off. The movie could\u2019ve been from the early nineties, but is more likely from the 70s or 80s. I\u2019ve been thinking about this for nearly 30 years.",

The way I remember this movie a man with wings for arms wakes up outside a city and goes in the city and everyone in the city says it's a miracle. While his stuff is going down a festival, a traveling circus something shows up. There is a scene where the spider woman puts on a show and then the aforementioned scene I and the op have described happens and then I don't remember anything else about it. I must have blacked out. \n\nThe way I remember the scene is the man puts the unpeeled banana in the woman peels it and eats it.  They do not show anything in the shot however so you kind of see the side of her butt and you see his face.\n\nThe whole class reacted and the teacher stopped to defend the movie as very European and admonish us as being mature enough to see it with our freaking out.\n\nIt is possible the teacher had second thoughts and chose to stop the movie at this point.\n\nI actually really want to know what happens to bird arms and spider woman\n\nEdit upon edit\nIt was shown in school because believe it or not but in the past we used to do all kinds of crazy things and we are far more Puritanical now than we were in the 80's other than being a little nicer to minorities sometimes.\n\nHuman Optimus Prime let me know\n\nA very old man with enormous wings is the movie",

The only lyrics I can remember are \"wave goodbye\" or something that sounds like that. This phrase is repeated lots throughout the song, along with some rock/alternative music and instruments.\n\nHope someone knows what I'm talking about :)",

It wasn't some word which could be used in both the English and French language like \"concierge\". I had to actually go onto a French to English online dictionary to find the definition. Or it was oftenly used in both languages and I'm just stupid. The word was about as long as 8-11 letters like \"consequence\". It started with a C, and the next letter was a vowel. So no words like \"check\". The vowel definitely wasn't \"Y\", and probably not \"i\" or \"U\". I don't think it had any accent marks either, or it had little to few.

I was 12 to 13 when I went to this concert with my \"friend\". This friend was into music ala Blood on the Dance Floor and other bands similar to them. The concert had a lot of different bands, but this particular one is what stands out. \n\nThey were absolutely horrible, and I can't remember their name or their music for the life of me. I do remember how they looked however. One of the band members, possibly the lead singer, wore a white, almost circus conductor looking white jacket. He was blonde and had some sort of Norwegian or Swedish accent. I had given him a pin of Germany from Hetalia and he wore it during the concert. There was someone who had a channel dedicated to interviews and videos of concerts of bands like this, and my friend and I tapped on his shoulder while he was recording as a joke. This is how I know footage 100% has to exist somewhere. \n\nI also remember the drummer having long hair. I believe the band had four members. My friend and I actually chatted with the band before and after their turn in the concert and they were very pleasant, even if their music was awful. \n\nI would give anything to find this band again so I can hear just how rancid their music was once again.",
