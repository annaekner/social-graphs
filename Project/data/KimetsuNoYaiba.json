His physical body is his best attribute, like Tanjiro's nose is for him. Inosuke also carves up demons that gave Tanjiro trouble, in terms of durability.

How fun would it be, I thought, if I could make the player identify with the main character in the game and get completely lost and immersed in that world?\"",

When the heart stops, it also halts the circulation of oxygen to the brain. Within seconds, brain cells begin to die. Within minutes, brain damage occurs, leading to impaired functions, loss of consciousness, and potentially death.\n\nSo, while dying of poison, dying of blood loss, his brain becoming impaired as brain cells rapidly die, he was still able to maintain his focus.

All in base. Rengoku has complimented his swordsmanship in the databooks \n\nAnd he was still cut by Gyutaro, although keep in mind Gyutaro did not pull out his sickles until the last moment when Tengen leapt at him, so it was a surprise. \n              Gyutaro went for the head, but Tengen deflected it a bit so it scratched him, and that was enough to weaken him the entire fight and bring him near death if he didn't stop his own heartbeat \n \n(which I don't see any other hashira doing either to be honest beside gyomei possibly, sanemi might be pushing it as holding in your guts for a bit, and completely stopping your heart for a decent amount of time with your muscles, then resuscitating yourself are 2 different  levels of muscle strength)\n\n Anyone else who's even scratched by Upper 6 like that by any of his attacks, especially the surprise attack that caught even the 2nd most experienced hashira Tengen ( which will be pretty much everyone beside Gyomei ) \nthey will die 100% in due time, within minutes or less, and quickly their fighting ability will be rendered useless and they won't even be able to breathe. Remember how quick it worked on Tanjiro someone who is not resistant to poisons as Tengen or Inosuke.\n\n (Also, Tengen at moments fights off Daki and Gyutaro by himself keep in mind, alongside keeping the boys and civilians safe. The fight was won with 0 CASUALTIES. ZERO. Not even any of the 3 wives kicked the bucket). \n\nPut some respect on his name.\n\nAlso literally every hashira level slayer who fought an uppermoon had help beside zenitsu and rengoku. And Rengoku died protecting the gang, so having help against an uppermoon is very common\n\n( and no Kaigaku is not stronger than Gyutaro either, he was not even experienced with his BDA and was a brand new uppermoon. Though it's still impressive Zenitsu beat him without too much trouble.)",

We see Tengen get his blindspots attacked (Luckily, Tanjiro was there) \n\nAlso the poison was sapping his strength and with only one hand, when he perfected his musical score technique, the narrator stated that Tengen was capable of finishing Gyutaro off but the poison was taking its toll. \n\nTengen is in my opinion top 3 base Hashira.

The only reason he can be considered one of the weakest is because he is one of only 3 Hashiras who never unlocked the Demon Slayer Mark (others being Shinobu and Rengoku). The rest got a major power boost while he (and Rengoku and Shinobu) never got that same power boost. Infact, he (and Rengoku) never got a chance to unlock it since Tanjiro only got his during the Upper Moon 6 battle, and he had to get it in order for others to get it. If we were to rank the Harshira without the marks, I'm sure Tengen would at least be top 5 (others being Gyomei, Muichiro, Rengoku, and Sanemi)\n\nAlso yes, I am putting Rengoku over Tengen but that is mostly just on word because a good portion of the Hashiras couldn't believe that Rengoku lost to Upper Rank 3, including Tengen (and most likely weren't thinking of the idea that Akaza was holding back) while Tengen didn't even believe that he could even beat Daki and Gyutaro alone.",

Characters don\u2019t just over one love or technique they acutely have to fight and work toward a moment where they can use those moves. Fights in something like Dragon Ball would often watch like a professional wrestling match with ebbs and flows. Each person gaining an advantage and positioning themselves to use their speciality over their opponent. Fights after the popularity of Naruto were more focused on characters just using those moves with nothing in between. Or you have something like a Shikamaru fight where he just stares and thinks for a whole episode. Many series were more inspired by the Naruto formula but KnY and JJK have gone back to the multi episode pro wrestling style of fighting which is what I prefer.",

All in base. Rengoku has complimented his swordsmanship in the databooks \n\nAnd he was still cut by Gyutaro, although keep in mind Gyutaro did not pull out his sickles until the last moment when Tengen leapt at him, so it was a surprise. \n              Gyutaro went for the head, but Tengen deflected it a bit so it scratched him, and that was enough to weaken him the entire fight and bring him near death if he didn't stop his own heartbeat \n \n(which I don't see any other hashira doing either to be honest beside gyomei possibly, sanemi might be pushing it as holding in your guts for a bit, and completely stopping your heart for a decent amount of time with your muscles, then resuscitating yourself are 2 different  levels of muscle strength)\n\n Anyone else who's even scratched by Upper 6 like that by any of his attacks, especially the surprise attack that caught even the 2nd most experienced hashira Tengen ( which will be pretty much everyone beside Gyomei ) \nthey will die 100% in due time, within minutes or less, and quickly their fighting ability will be rendered useless and they won't even be able to breathe. Remember how quick it worked on Tanjiro someone who is not resistant to poisons as Tengen or Inosuke.\n\n (Also, Tengen at moments fights off Daki and Gyutaro by himself keep in mind, alongside keeping the boys and civilians safe. The fight was won with 0 CASUALTIES. ZERO. Not even any of the 3 wives kicked the bucket). \n\nPut some respect on his name.\n\nAlso literally every hashira level slayer who fought an uppermoon had help beside zenitsu and rengoku. And Rengoku died.\n\n( and no Kaigaku is not stronger than Gyutaro either, he was not even experienced with his BDA and was a brand new uppermoon.

Mitsuri did not land a single solitary hit on upper moon 4. Sure, her purpose was to stall for time, but personally, I don't feel like she would've even been able to land a meaningful strike even if that was the main body.\n\nThe only upper moon that could realistically be killed by a few of the hashira is Gyutaro. And even then, the dude nearly killed a hashira, 3 of his Shinobu wives, and 3 extremely skilled demon slayers.

The databooks literally have tengen topping everyone in running speed. Hate to break it to you mate. But running speed is a factor of combat speed. \n\n>obanai is literally most skilled hashira in swordsmanship\n\nSecond actually, but that's irrelevant.

They're not sometimes named unlimited budget works for nothing. Put aside the anime, and read the manga. And in the manga, we don't see anything from those three that put them above tengen in base. We have these 5 simple facts. 1. Tengen is the second physically strongest hashira. 2. Tengen is the second most experienced hashira. 3. Tengen ranks 1st in sense. 4. Tengen ranks 1st in running speed and 5. Tengen ranks 3rd in swordsmanship. \n\n>sanemi feats in base against um1 obanai feats against muzan\n\nThose feats were with the slayer mark and transparent world.

A lot of English translations will add synonyms of words and extra descriptors to try to make it sound more like the tone. However sometimes translators infer a different tone than what the panel indicates which can create unintentional changes.\n\nEven though everyone in Japan has to take mandatory English classes, it is still not a strength for them. The poor grammar could just be the translator for that dialogue being too literal or not seeing an issue with the English grammar. Or it. Could be intentional... just hard to tell.",

For women it also meant birth was less likely to have complications. (Underweight with narrow hips could lead to more stillbirth or even death for the mother in child birth prior to modern medicine.) Another reason why everyone used that ridiculous white powder and makeup. It was to prove you don't work the fields to show a sign of status.\n\nIt is only a relatively recently in terms of human history trend of women needing to be super skinny, men desired to muscular/tone and everyone tan. If you look back at even the early movie stars of Hollywood you van see how some of the male actors were considered incredibly hot but all of them have basically an \"active\" build. Not overweight but no ridiculous hypertrophy. It was the late 70s to 80s fitness craze in America that promoted excessive hypertrophy of male stars and  emphasized the skinniness of female stars as the beauty standard.\n\nNow being in shape is the sign of status because it often means you have the ability to take the time out of your schedule to train. Can afford the proper nutrition and equipment/memberships. Your single parent working two jobs doesn't have that kind of time.",

For me, I speedran the manga in a day so that I'd forget most of it and thus be able to enjoy the anime as if I was watching for the first time, so this is probably gonna sit on my shelf for a few years now until it finishes airing LOL\n\nThat said if you have finished the entire manga it is 100% worth getting since it's not too expensive and has a ton of cool stuff including bonus epilogue content (which I'm dying to read and barely holding off lol)",

Be warned like most of the book is talking about the final battle so if you're anime only or like speedran the manga so you'd forget the details then probably not worth the purchase? If you'd like I can send you pics of the other Hashira's and their opinions about the others. If you have read the entire manga though absolutely worth the buy esp since the end of the book is filled with bonus epilogue chapters which I am SO tempted to read but am holding off on them lol (I'm one of the people who did the speedrun thing)",

The majority of the DS EN cast also voiced the majority of the 7DS EN voices. \n\nI did notice, though, (all of these are the EN versions btw) that Sanemi's VA is Gojo's. \n\nYahaba (the arrow demon who had the arrows in s1) is Toge's voice.\n\nThe Spider Mother Demon's voice is Maki's as well.\n\nThere's a few others I recognise but they're from 7DS and not Demon Slayer.

If his personality was supposed to be a mystery I think he still would have been developed differently. Maybe by other slayers gossiping about him or something like that.  \n\nOverall, I think the anime devs made a good move with that choice. I felt a little resolved watching the anime, it told me that the stone hashira is just a quiet dude that carefully observes other people's character from afar, and he demonstrated his highest degree of devotion to kagaya by accepting the orders he was given, and being first on the scene he was told would come to pass.",

So I think him being the one to scream out Muzan's identity and the fact that beheading doesn't work on him was quite realistic and fitting. \n\nAlso, him screaming in a slightly panicky way, when he is usually so calm and collected, was important to display the urgency of the situation, especially when the other Hashira were stunned and overwhelmed with grief. He needed them to focus on who their enemy was in that moment. Example: Sanemi was so wrathful he was about to pounce without knowing who he was facing.",

Things you know tanjiro couldn\u2019t possibly do when he fell into the castle. This isn\u2019t a typical MC gets stronger than everyone manga, it\u2019s a knock down drag out fight where tanjiro just happens to get two of the most powerful tools to kill muzan, STW and sun breathing. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is this, the current hashira fighting, Gyomei, Iguro, Sanemi, Muichiro, Mitsuri, Giyu, and shinobu. By the time he fights akaza we know he\u2019s not as talented as any of them. While he\u2019s training sure he moved to the next level but he never turned the tables and started beating any of the hashira\u2026 the only argument I\u2019ll entertain is Shinobu because she doesn\u2019t have a feat outside of crafting.\n\nAll (most?) of the hashira consider tanjiro to be a very powerful swordsman who would have the skills of a hashira.

Kocho got hers for her knowledge in medicine as well as taking the roll after her sister muchiro tained untill vomiting blood and was promoted for his dedication as well as his strength and lineage. The flame hashira rengoku took the spot when his father retired. I don't recall hearing about the others promotions and I took a guess on kochos and muchiros but the only two promotions that have series details is the love hashira and wind hashira the rest they never really explain...

Sukuna which was extended substantially while keeping the pacing consistent, in SV Arc ep.7 and ep.9 felt inconsistent even the manga was more extended both narratively and pacing-wise. There was also missed opportunity to expand Mitsuri fight in ep.11; also we haven't seen Zohakuten utilized like how Mahoraga did. \n\n My 2nd criticism is the these anime-original dialouges are not the way I like them; in the HT arc we got alot of repeated dialouges; Let's defeat Muzan; he's looking for Nezuko; etc. A single scene of Kanao talking to Tanjiro is more important than all these interactions that don't add anything to the series.\n\nRemeber unlike many who cares only about flashy fights, I care about execution more; when I read the manga Gyokko death felt fine, but in the anime due to the pacing issues it was underwhelming to a high degree.\n\nI saw also many animators pointing such issues with the storyboard.",

So in a way, he created the style out of a dance. I don't recall exactly how Sun Breathing was created, if it was explained, but that couldn't that have a reference? And Inosukes Breathing can be similar, the breath of Instinct, to live, to defeat, to hunt, his reference was life. I know I'm half talking out of my ass, forgive my doing so, but I don't exactly get what would set Hinokami Kagura aside from Beast Breathing and Sun Breathing.",

My fianc\u00e9 thinks the same way.

I'm so convinced that I feel Kanao was never part of the story and she was a wasted character. \n\nWhat I mean was that I wished Kanao had a bit of more satisfying character arc about her healing from her trauma and start on how to feel emotions so that way she could have started to understand herself properly.  \n\nBut instead we got the opposite her entire development is dependent on Tanjiro and was based on one sentence of what he said just sucks entirely.  \ud83d\ude15\n\nIt feels like Kanao was just written to be the love interest and that's all.",

She's a cool character but I will still be disappointed that I find her to be wasted potential to this day. \n\nAnyways though can't wait for Douma vs Kanao to be animated soon and I got admit Kanao roasting Douma had to be one of my favorite moments in Infinity Castle Arc! \ud83d\ude06",

Mitsuri whole character is based on her not fitting the ideals of what a typical Japanese women  in that time period is supposed to be and learning to overcome it. I think they\u2019re are female demon slayers but considering that society still expected women to be the primary caretakers of the home. I don\u2019t think many women stayed or participated in the corps for long. Also there are multiple support roles in the demon slayer corps outside of slayers. We see it with the wisteria houses and the clean up crew which was shown to have a lot of female members. Also I think it was slightly touched upon that to demons women were way more nutritious compared to men due to yk reproductive system etc",

There's plently of women out there whod take up the sword, but I've found women are generally less willing to put themselves in situations that can cost them their lives. I know i wouldn't.",

She is an outlier and a representation of exceptionally strong women who can go toe to toe with the men, but in this case, demons. \n\nShinobu is physically unable to decapitate a demon, but she is an hashira because of her intelligence and speed. Her katana is actually a giant syringe and her speed allows her to be quick enough to inject demons with poison. \n\nGiven this is the Taisho Era (1912-1926) the progressive and liberal society we live in today where women are free from the restrictions of *just* domestic duties hasn\u2019t taken hold yet. Therefore men take on wartime, hunting and protective roles while woman take on care-giving roles due to our child-bearing nature. So women in military positions were far fewer and in between. The show shows most female demon slayers taking on administrative leadership/care-giving/hospitality roles, which is more accurate to the actual role a female would play. \n\nHowever, the show would suck if there was no female hashira (I am a feminist) and since there is always those few exceptions in a society we have our two beautiful and lovely female hashiras. \n\nI will say in most anime\u2019s, they do not make any limit or distinction to male and female biological strength, with many females being considered \u201cthe strongest humanity has to offer\u201d in MANY different shows. However, I think demon slayer tries to keep some historical and cultural accuracy despite being entirely fictional.",

Misturi and Shinobu are outliers and shouldn\u2019t be taken as the norm. There\u2019s reason why men have been the ones fighting wars for the entirety of human history. Again there are outliers (Boudica is a good example!). Anyway, Mitsuri has been shown to have been born (or at least developed) her strength. It\u2019s unnatural for anyone else. While Shinobu is one of the fastest Hashira (might be below Tengen bc of ninja stuff). Shinobu also has to use poison since her body limits her strength. So to sum up, Shinobu and Mitsuri (and later Kanao) are all outliers. They\u2019re gifted and shouldn\u2019t be taken as the norm. \n\nHowever\u2026men may just be easier to animate.

I always find it sad when someone with an actual argument gets ignored. \n\n\nSure these dimorphisms predate organized society, but so do a lot of things about humans. Just because a trait evolved before the modern human, it does not disprove the necessity of these traits or that there was a reason for it. We can infer that Homo erectus very likely had gender roles just by looking at the rest of the animal kingdom. There is an actual point to gender roles in the animal kingdom. \n\n\nI am sure you can agree humans are very very new on the evolution time line. Life has been evolving for millions of years before we arrived at modern animals. Many things evolved and were decided before we ever built the first sharp stick. Such as the females having the ability to bear young while the males don't. This was decided even before the Cambrian era. Our primate ancestors probably lived a life that selected for the traits we have today. \n\n\nGender roles do exist in nature when looking at creatures more similar to us. Gender roles do exist in animals that take care of their young together. The easiest example are birds. Many of them have roles each parent plays. Also, I'd like to strike down the idea that gender roles are only when the man hunts and the woman cares for the young. Emperor penguins have the role of the man takes care of the egg while the woman hunts for food. The men have a specialized pouch that evolved before modern penguins for this purpose. In every animal where the mom and dad both take care of the young gender roles keep popping up over and over. \n\n\nLife is easier when everyone has a defined role. Evolution tends to select certain trait more than others. Such as the meme , everything keeps evolving into crabs. This can be seen all over the animal kingdom because some strategies are more viable than others. And one thing that continues to evolve are roles. I'm no longer talking about gender roles but just a role in general. In large herd animals you have soldiers, watchers, and leaders. In colony animals you have scouts, gathers, and mothers. For the naked mole rat only the dominant female gives birth. You can argue modern gender roles are a construct and I will agree. But roles in general especially when it comes to rearing young is present throughout the animal kingdom.",

Mitsuri's whole thing is flexibility, then Kanae and Kanao's flower breathing feels like a style that takes advantage of their flexibility\n\nKeeping biological conventions allowed for more interesting writing",

                    "body": "You\u2019re confusing gender roles with life history strategy. Gender roles do not, evolutionarily, exist. Evolution does not have foresight.\n\nFurthermore, so-called \u201cgender roles\u201d (aka differing life history strategies across sexes) in nature are nowhere near as rigid as humans like to think they are. That example you gave, about emperor penguins? *Both sexes engage in solitary parental care, and both engage in hunting to feed themselves and their young.* The only reason that the males tend to the egg over the dark winter is because the females have expended too much of their body mass creating the egg to survive. They return to feed first because they and the chick will both die otherwise.\n\nIn many species of fish and arthropods, multiple male \u201cgender roles\u201d exist; these are defined by differing reproductive strategies, and are typically recognized as different polyphenic morphs. Some of those morphs serve as adolescent forms of other morphs, the individual\u2019s reproductive strategy / \u201cgender role\u201d changing as they mature. Sexual dimorphisms occur when the genes which control a trait in one sex are different from the genes that control that trait in the other sex. Polyphenism occurs when the genes which control a trait change depending on the organism\u2019s environment. The dimorphism is evolved because different traits are favoured by different life strategies, not because they \u201cfulfill a role.\u201d\n\nSentinel behaviour, what you called the \u201cwatchers\u201d of herding animals, is specifically a task which all members of the group must engage in equally. Any individual who slips out on their turn is liable to punishment by the group. Which animal serves as the \u201cleader\u201d, if there even is a decisive leader, is often the parent or grandparent of the other group members, and leads by some ratio of dominance and recognized life experience. And herding or pack-forming species do not have dedicated combatants, with the exception that juveniles are too small to fight. A behaviour or group dynamic may be evolved, but in these species who performs what \u201crole\u201d is almost entirely environmental, aka not evolved. Honey bees are eusocial insects, and they have different roles the colony needs to fill, but unlike the caste systems of ants, they differentiate roles based on individual age and the proportion of workers which meet those relative age categories. If all of the older workers are removed, the young workers will transition roles early. If the young workers are removed, the youngest of those who remain will revert. \n\nYes, you are correct that human sexual dimorphism existed in our hominid ancestors before they reached the level of sapience by which we modern humans define ourselves, and that there was a reason for this dimorphism. Males and females persisted under differing evolutionary pressures. *But we do not know what these pressures were.* We weren\u2019t there when our hominid ancestors first descended from the trees. As a student of human biology, surely you are aware of how fraught the field of human evolutionary history is. There is SO much bias to sort through in any historical data / studies because we humans have spend so long thinking we were the centre of the universe, that we were somehow separate from the rest of the animal kingdom, that we were the ultimate life form to which all other organisms aspired to become. *We are not.* Biology influences culture, but culture does not influence biology. The \u201cgender roles\u201d we humans have given ourselves are only marginally reflective of actual sexual dimorphism, and usually only the visible elements of it. What they are actually reflective of is the worldviews (and interests) of those who hold power over a society.\n\nAnd honestly, I think you missed my point entirely; the person to whom I responded was quoting heavily biased ideals of biological essentialism to justify bigotry. He invoked the concept of directional evolution, which as I\u2019ve stated above, does not exist. Nothing evolves \u201cto become\u201d anything; natural selection is a sieve, it simply selects out that which is not well adapted for the current environment. The \u201cgender roles\u201d he was citing, and I was disproving, we\u2019re that males are universally dominant, competitive, and mate-seeking, and that females are demure, need coercing, and are choosy. This is not the case. Hyenas have a matriarchal hierarchy, where the most competitive females are on top, but even the lowest-ranking female still stands above even the highest ranking male. Many \u201cmonogamous\u201d female songbirds will cheat on their mates. Nothing in the evolutionary sciences is absolute except for the fact that evolution selects for what produces the greatest reproductive fitness *right now,* and damn the future consequences.",

He's more wise, practiced, and experienced than the rest of the slayers, and he generally has had a longer time to hone his physique and skills. I was thinking that most demon slayers don't make it to adulthood, and only a small percentage of them make it to hashira level.\n\nMuichiro is the youngest hashira ever and became one incredibly fast, so he isn't as experienced due to that. His body isn't even fully developed yet. He is a literal child and already has incredible power, and we saw him have immense growth when he solo'd Gyokko. >!Imagine if he lived to see Gyomei's age. If it wasn't for him getting literally eviscerated by UM 1, then his mark would have killed him anyway. Iirc, anyone who has a mark dies young. Sanemi most likely would be Gyomei's level once he has a few more years on him. And if Gyomei didn't die during IF, then he'd be a retired master, which brings me to my last point!!< \n\nWe have an even smaller percentage of hashira that are fortunate enough to stay alive, retire and make it to old age, and become teachers and masters, like Urokodaki. Despite all the numbers and odds being stacked against them over the years, the DS Corps has never been eradicated. Ubuyashiki wasn't lying when he said they are eternal. In a perfect world, a larger percentage of slayers would make it to hashira level and have longer life expectancy if large-scale, organized training regiments were more feasible.",

I was thinking that most demon slayers don't make it to adulthood, and only a small percentage of them make it to hashira level.\n\n I think most of the reasoning behind this ultimately lies in natural talent.\n\n And I'm with Shinjuro here, but a sad reality of the DS universe is that despite you can put all the effort to improve yourserf, the harsh reality is that not everyone have the potential to reach the same level if they didn't born with the talent. The other slayers who trained with Gyomei for example give up because they couldn't succed where Tanjiro could.\n\n In that regard I think DS is one of the few shonens that have such a crude message of only people who born with talent can go so far, and while hard work is requiered it doesn't mean you can catch up with a prodigy just because you put effort on it.",

Shinobu in some sense had the luck of her older sister being a Hashira but she studied poisons etc for years to be able to conquer her weaknesses and Genya cannot master a breathing style leaving him short in so many ways when his brother is so naturally talented.

Remember that breathing is kinda like martial arts in nature after all.\n\n Training kids also suppose a logistical advantage in the sense that by starting the body preparation early, they could take more adventage later on during the years a slayer peak on their abilities.

Kyojuro also trained since kid and he was close to peak at his early 20, even Akaza comments that he would have reach a perfect level in few years.\n\n I think slayers are kinda like athletes in the sense most of them probably would have (with much luck) a useful time spam of fighting until they\u2019re on early to middle 30.",

He sliced the giant rock and killed the hand demon despite the lack of experience.\n\n The whole thing with learning the Sun Breathing is a talent on itself, and Tanjiro is the only person in the series who show mixing breathing styles on a more creative way.

He killed Hatengu himself with Yorichii\u2019s sword (I am not denying, negating or ignoring the help all the others participating did - let me complete my point below). \n\nIts just an unprecedented time of the Corps as Tanjiro becomes Marked and simultaneously elevates both his own training/skills AT THE SAME TIME HE ENGAGES IN UNPRECENDENTED UPPER RANK BATTLES WITH EVERYONE ELSE (Hashira & Corps, plus leveling up the Swordsmiths). \n\nI read through the Fandom Wiki too and started taking notes a month ago as I re-Watch the series as my comfort TV: I have asked myself pointed questions as to why Kagaya made the mission decisions he did for both Tanjiro and the Corps from Akaskusa (Muzan & Tamayo/Yuchiro + Susamara/Temari Demon + Arrow Demon) & the Mt Natagumo/Rui & the Spider Family to now (where we are in the anime right now). \n\nE8 (this Sunday) Kagaya will say something very important about what his doctor told him six months ago. That means a lot as to the decisions he made - including what to tell the Hashira and what NOT to tell them. \n\nThe point is that it\u2019s amazing given what little the Hashira actually knew in total (that we the audience are fully aware of and Gyomei knows the most about - and Amane knew the absolute most) by this point and by the beginning of the Final Battle Arc. \n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s fun to nerd out on how this learning applies to Tanjiro\u2019s battle skills in each moment, and to understand better what that has done to influence everyone around him. \n\nNezuko\u2019s evolution is fun to nerd out on in relationship to this & the Final Battle. \n\nMuzan was so blind.\n\nSorry for my poor spelling. I don\u2019t feel like correcting all of it.",

                    "body": "I mean, Mitsuri lasted longer against Upper 4 solo than Tengen lasted against Gyutaro solo (I'll get back to being marked). Muichiro lacked the cutting power but could reach Gyokko unmarked. Tengen himself admits to being inferior to Rengoku, Muichiro and Gyomei. If all breathing styles are inferior derivatives of sun breathing then derivatives of the 5 styles are themselves further degradations as they are even further removed from sun breathing. \n\nMarked Tanjiro in Season 2 is able to behead Gyutaro. He further succeeds in beheading Hantengu in season 3. Again, marked. Muichiro, as we have established with him reaching Gyokko, is unable to react to the fan attack. But Hinokami Kagura is fast enough to outpace the reactions of 3 emotions. And this is Season 3, not Season 4. Now, Mitsuri with the mark fails against Zohakuten. But Muichiro succeeds against Gyokko. Assuming that the mark is an even powerup scale for all demon slayers and factoring in inate talent based on the fact of how fast Muichiro achieved hashira status, we can reasonably assume Muichiro is stronger than Mitsuri. Yes, Gyokko is a weaker upper moon, but Muichiro was also nerfed by poison. \n\nNow, Shinobu is the weakest hashira, as she cannot behead a demon. So we can reasonably assume that Muichiro > Mitsuri > Shinobu. Now, it's been stated that Gyomei is the top of the top. So now it's Gyomei > Muichiro > Mitsuri > Shinobu. \n\nTengen admits he is inferior to Muichiro, Rengoku and Gyomei. So Gyomei > Muichiro > Tengen. Now, where does Rengoku, Sanemi, Obanai, and Giyuu fit? Sanemi and Giyuu are able to match pace with each other and break each other's swords simultaneously. This suggests a rough parity. So Sanemi \u2248 Giyuu. Now, Muichiro is able to maintain pace with Obanai and Sanemi. We ultimately don't know the outcome of this fight though. But Muichiro doesn't have a mark in the fight, so this at least suggests that if Muichiro is keeping pace with both, then marked Muichiro is greater than unmarked Obanai and Sanemi. \n\nNow, back to Tengen. With his musical score technique, he is able to keep pace with Gyutaro, but as stated by Tanjiro, he will lose out before Gyutaro does. This means Gyutaro > Tengen. Especially if you factor in Daki which would probably be able to compensate for having both hands. Now, Gyutaro is weaker than Gyokko and Hantengu. So obviously Tengen would lose against those. \n\nNow, we know Rengoku and Giyuu are stronger than Shinobu. Because she is the weakest. If Sanemi is roughly equal to Giyuu, then Sanemi is roughly equal to Rengoku. So Sanemi \u2248 Giyu \u2248 Rengoku > Tengen. Therefore Tengen is undeniably weaker than Gyomei, Rengoku, Muichiro, Sanemi, and Giyuu. He is stronger than Shinobu. In that gap we have Mitsuri, Obanai, and Tengen. This seems to further verify that the closer to sun breathing the stronger you are. \n\nNow we have to finally get a little more speculative. Mitsuri before her mark appears is able to cut the dragons to pieces. Tanjiro fails this with the mark. So we can assume the dragons are stronger than Gyutaro's neck. (Tanjiro cut a boulder in season one, thickness isn't an issue) \n\nSo unmarked Mitsuri is stronger than S3 marked Tanjiro. Therefore, all Hashira above that are definitely above S3 marked Tanjiro. Tengen loses solo to Gyutaro. Mitsuri loses solo to Zohakuten even with mark. So Hantengu is def stronger than Gyutaro. Muichiro is stronger than Tengen and Mitsuri, as established. Muichiro could not beat Gyokko unmarked. So unmarked Tengen cannot defeat Gyokko and therefore Tengen could not beat Hantengu. Mitsuri unmarked cannot defeat Gyokko because the stronger Muichiro can't. \n\nFlame and Water have always produced hashira, so derivatives should also be superior over derivatives of the others. To boot, Mitsuri without any training is above sumo wrestler tier. Tengen's strength is from training. Based on this, there's enough evidence to suggest Mitsuri edges out over Tengen. Not enough to certify, but it's safe to make the assumption. So now, as things stand he can only be stronger than Shinobu and Obanai. Obanai has far too little to go on, but unmarked pre-Gyomei and Sanemi sessions, Tanjiro could cut his haori. So it's safe to assume he can at least put steel on target with Obanai, even if not lethally. Which means he definitely can beat Shinobu. This puts Tanjiro above at least two hashira. At that point, I am willing to bet on Tanjiro beating Tengen cuz he can keep pace with one hand Tengen without a mark. So with a mark he def can probably beat one hand Tengen but now he he can follow the movements of superior Hashira. Therefore, why I claim as I do.",

Did he nearly behead Upper 3 while getting a deep fisting through the solar plexus? Listen, Tengen is my favorite character in Demon Slayer. I love his personality, his arc, the fact he gets a happy ending, his appearance is great, his fights are exquisite.\n\nBut I am not going to pretend that he is in the realm of the ultra greats. It's fine if he isn't the greatest thing since Yoriichi. It's fine if he can blitz Kokushibo no diff. \n\nThe Tengen hyperwank is perhaps the worst side effect of the Entertainment District arc because now people think Tengen and Gyutaro miles eclipse Muichiro, Mitsuri, Gyokko and Hantengu all because Gyutaro and Tengen got better serviced in their story and action. The 5 main forms are inferior to sun breathing. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the derivatives of THOSE forms are further inferior. \n\nInosuke never compares to Tanjiro or Zenitsu. Does that mean he is a bad character? No. But it is a testament to the fact that the further removed from sun breathing you go, the inferior the breathing gets. \n\nAgain, experience doesn't mean shit if you don't have the oomph to back it up. Look at Muichiro. He got beat by Gyokko. Did he learn sun breathing in his flashback? A new skill? No. He came back and killed Gyokko because he was stronger.

All it does, AFAIK, is let him track an opponent's bloodlust. This gives him several benefits, like being able to predict/sense where an opponent is going to strike, being able to easily perceive an opponent's presence (even if they're trying to sneak up on you), and - according to Tanjiro - it allows Akaza's attacks to accurately track and seemingly cling to his opponent's vitals. Unless I'm forgetting something, nothing about Akaza's BDA is stated or implied to actually amplify his physical stats depending on his opponent's battle spirit.!<",

That it chips off bit by bit. And proven by the crows who give the time tanjiro was relative to that same muzan. Infact it would be a muzan who\u2019s even faster due to tanjiro being alone AND tanjiro being way more debuffed by the hashira lmao poisoned longer. Can\u2019t use stw due to stamina and he already had low stamina.  A healthy tanjiro would be massively stronger. He definitely slams we can break this fight down bit by bit if you want.",

The circular design saves you from scrapes that may be caused by pointed guards, and the spokes connecting it to the katana make it slightly lighter and probably even more durable than if the circular piece was filled in. TL;DR: Tanjiro's sword guard is plain but extremely effective at its job.\n\nThe coolest looking in my opinion is probably Muichiro's, Rengoku's, Sanemi's or Obanai's.",

Yoriichi's sword !<.\nBut I also think that the guard hints to the secret of Tanjiro and his \"destiny\" we'll call it. His guard, to me, looks similar to a simple depiction of the Sun. Essentially just a point with rays going outward from it.\n\nAlthough I may be thinking way to much into this...I think it's a clever way to hint to him being >! A Sun Breather !<.",

In the same shows, you will have somebody who's 5 ft 4 and 60 kg.  Being overly particular of H/w in anime is silly.  He's around 7 foot and strong af. No other real comparison needed",

There is either no way gyomei is 250 kg, or there's no way he would be as small as he is drawn.  Idk what else to tell you lol, other than maybe he also had high density like mitsuri. \n\nBrock Lesnar is a big man, Ronnie was a big man, and they are both smaller than gyomei in both height and weight. Andre was slightly taller, but nowhere near as muscular, and is still too small.",

But at 130 kg you're already beyond \"fit for my bodyweight\" shape and well into lifting and bodybuilding weight.  A quick look on Google for \"7ft 300 lbs\" shows body builders at like 8% bf full body flexing.  A search for \"7 foot 250 kg\" brings me wheelbarrows. Thor bjornsson, a competing world strongman, is 430 lbs at 6'9\".  What real people can you direct me to with bigger numbers? You just keep discounting all the biggest people I can think specifically of like \"yeah there are bigger people out there\", but that crowd is already extremely small, no pun intended. \n\nI just do not see the realism in the 250 kg number. I think that if a 7 ft dude clocked in at 130 kg, he probably looks pretty fit and strong. I think that if you're going above that, you are probably bodybuilding.  Gyomei is probably around 200 kg with his build. I could believe \"he looks like a strongman\".  The recommended weight for a 7 ft guy is around 100 kg, so I would expect 130 kg to be bigger than \"lean and healthy\".  Maybe you're looking too much into the definition of the word huge in the way that I used it, it's a very subjective definition, but I think 130 kg is huge on pretty much anyone",
