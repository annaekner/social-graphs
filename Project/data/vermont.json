But at least where I live, we had a bunch of people from the South migrate over the course of a century or so after the war in order to get those good manufacturing jobs as subsistence farming became economically unviable. So I always know there's a chance that people flying those flags migrated here from their shithole home states and then tried to make our state more of a shithole. But at the same time, it's always fun to bring up the fact that a lot of stuff around us is named after officers of the 4th Michigan Cavalry Regiment which was responsible for the capture of Jefferson Davis after the war as he was trying to flee to Mexico; or the fact that Benjamin D. Pritchard is buried about one county down from us.",

A certain amount of that comes from the fact that there just historically _haven't_ been a lot of people of color in Vermont ... as much of an accident of history as it is anything else ... the place was settled by white people and there was never a concerted effort to \"import\" people from other places.  In a place that isn't too keen on outsiders, a person of color is easily identified as someone \"not from around here\" and draws a fair bit of unwanted attention. \n\nThat said _most_ of them just want to be left alone to do their own thing with as little governmental intervention as possible.  They're \"good fences make good neighbors\" type people who are perfectly happy to pay no attention to what's happening on your side of the fence, so long as you stay the heck away from their side. (Unless you get your car stuck in a ditch, then every neighbor around is showing up with tractors and yank straps to help you out).\n\nThese folks probably aren't flying flags and drawing attention to themselves, but they're also not voting for social programs and increased school funding.\n\nThe liberal veneer that Vermont has, largely came out of the 60's and 70's where lots of hippy-dippy folks were looking for a place to live their alternative lifestyles and they found abundant, cheap land available in VT.  They were young, politically active, voted like their lives depended on it and made a lot of impact on Vermont's political landscape.",

They want respect for that.\n\nUnfortunately, even when it's true, a lot of the invective hurled against them is the opposite of the respect Southerners want. Like they say down there, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. So that's another piece of the puzzle.\n\nEven though flying the Confederate flag is misinformed and racism is indefensible, I just don't think we're gonna get 'em past it by yelling \"fuck you\" at pickup trucks.

Looking back on it, I think southern racists didn't feel the need to express hate overtly because the systems in place did such a thorough job in constraining black opportunity.\n\nI think for me it feels like the past 15 years have just exposed more truthfully the hate that's always been behind these symbols in one form or another. And I completely agree with you - anyone who doesn't see it now is making a choice not to see it.\n\n(Oh, and General Lee was a brave man who fought for people's rights to choose their own government, and he would've won if the Union hadn't had so many more bodies than the brave freedom-fighters in the south.

The core of my point is that this liberal handwringing of the confederacy more often than not is just a rhetorical exercise in purification. Confederacy bad, America good. When the confederacy is just mask off America. \n\n> White people talking about home grown problems and how to deal with them is a GOOD thing. \n\nYes! And that includes analysis of the overlap between america and the confederacy (which is basically a circle imo) and that an important piece that\u2019s usually missing.\n\n> These bizarre, delusional, racist ass homegrown Vermonters should be discussed, and there absolutely should be brain storming on how to confront these douche bags because every single one y'all ignoring them comfortably in your privilege let's the people of color around you, the immigrants around you, the LGBTQ people around you know that they aren't safe and you don't care.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to oppose obvious white supremacists waving confederate flags but it\u2019s not so easy to unpack how these attitudes bleed into policy by well meaning liberals. An example would be how Bernie Sanders wants to use Bibi as a fall guy but will not challenge Zionism itself, which is the root cause. We will never get anywhere without soberly confronting root causes. Something I don\u2019t think these liberals that handwring about visible confederate flags are capable of. \n\n> Is the US a neoliberal, imperialist sham? Absolutely. The US destroying my country is why I ended up here in the first place, but that doesn't mean you stop talking about racism inside the US because the government uses racism as a tool of colonialism and imperialism.\n\nI feel you. I\u2019m also from another country that has been by and large fucked over by the us. \n\nIf you got \u201cwe should not talk about racism inside the US\u201d from what I\u2019ve said then I\u2019m not being clear because I think we need to talk about how the confederacy is just an old tumor inside of a larger creature that seems to have a knack for creating many similar tumors within itself and we should be examining the whole and the root causes rather than just isolating one symptom.",

And because it was \"illegal\", records of slaves were not recorded, or may have been listed as \"servants\" etc. For instance, Ethan Allen owned slaves before he lived in VT, and when he was in Vermont, he had several black \"servants\". Yeah, sure. So it's likely there was quite a lot of slavery in Vermont, and though it may have been more along the lines of indentured servitude, it's still not something to be proud of.

People would be telling you to just dispose of them and would shame you for calling them crackhead motherfuckers. \n\nJust funny the different views at times, that change based on situation and subjectivity. Humans are strange in that way. There's a part in \"The Courage to be Disliked\" where the philosopher uses an analogy of well water. Well water largely stays the same temperature year round but if it's summer time you think it's colder and if it's winter you think it's warmer. \n\nI apologize for my overly active brain activity \ud83d\ude43",

Then it goes in the sink, sprinkle on some kosher salt and give it a quick scrub with a chain mail scrubber to get off anything really stuck on and then rinse it off. At that point it\u2019s clean, and if it\u2019s looking a little dull I\u2019ll just wipe the inside with vegetable oil and leave it on a low burner for an hour or so. This pretty much keeps it in perfect condition to cook. It\u2019s no harder than cleaning any other pan really, just scrub it with coarse salt instead of soap.

The dude looks like hell and is the oldest president ever and is super unhealthy. And we all know the toll a 4 year term takes on each and every president.\n\nThe scary part right now for me personally, well just one of the many, is that Vance will become president by default during trumps term. And that is something to be afraid of. I think he would push the project 25 narrative much further than the orange idiot would. But I could be wrong.\n\nEither way I'm pretty disappointed in 51% of American's right now. But the difference is I'm not going to throw a tantrum, riot in the street, or storm the godamn capital. I'm going to be pissed, annoyed, let down and dumbfounded over the next few days, but I will move on and just keep working and living. That's the difference between a normal American and maga.\n\nEdit for clarity - trump would be the oldest president ever should he make it thru the next 4 years",

This class, not surprisingly, began to vote for the party that best represented its economic interests: the G.O.P. Working-class whites, however -- and here's the surprise -- even those in areas with large black populations, stayed loyal to the Democrats. (This was true until the 90s, when the nation as a whole turned rightward in Congressional voting.)\n\nSo \u2026 the argument is that the land-owning aristocrats in the south moved from D to R. Which is exacatly what that says. And the white working class and black population stayed with the Democratic party. Which is exactly what is supported by the southern strategy.\n\nThe bulk of the previously-Dem population moved to the Republicans because of their focus on \"State's rights\" (and (sometimes-not-even-)crypto-racism). And the working class population did not.\n\nIn any case: fundamentally the nature of the parties changed.\n\n\n\n(You're also replying to something with 32 various scholarly citations with a (pathetically short) 366-word article talking about a single book.)",

This was helpful: \nhttps://www.ohs.org/blog/pork-cake.cfm\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is I think the recipe you have will make a better cake. Salt pork is perfect for this type of thing as it\u2019s basically a slightly sweet pork belly. Not to mention, I think the instructions included in this recipe are really just about how to keep your batter wet/cake moist so if you combine with the above recipe, it should be a great cake. \n\nWe\u2019ll see!

            "text": "I know this is going to get downvoted and people are going to be mad, but I have had an extraordinarily bad time living in Vermont.\n\nI live in Bennington and work in Sunderland. From the start, people (particularly in the northern areas) were cold and standoffish with me. Now, I lived in the Czech Republic, so cold strangers is nothing new to me, but people in VT seemed downright judgmental. When I hold the door for people a the Stewart\u2019s in Arlington, they don\u2019t say thank you. When I get a drink at Ramunto\u2019s in Bennington, people stare at me like I\u2019m some murderer. I\u2019ve made a couple friends, but generally people are rude and make me feel unwelcomed. It\u2019s as if they\u2019ve never seen a new face before. When people in Manchester hear that I live in Bennington, they treat me like I\u2019m som kind of criminal.\n\nI\u2019ve experienced a lot of theft as well. Again, I\u2019ve lived in places like Detroit and Milwaukee and never had anything. In Bennington, some random person crashed into my car my car while it was parked and totaled it. When I got a new car, someone smashed the window, stole my stereo, and left cigarettes ashes everywhere. I know this can happen anywhere, but nothing as extreme has happened to me before. It\u2019s extremely isolating. \n\nFor the past year, I\u2019ve been vaguely sick all the time. I\u2019ve felt dizzy and like I couldn\u2019t breathe properly, and my bloodwork was all messed up. Come to find out that there was a hole\nin my apartment roof and the ceiling was covered in black mold. I had to go stay at a motel for a couple weeks and some asshole broke into my car and stole all my clothes. \n\nTo add to all that, you can\u2019t get anything without driving at least 30 minutes to an hour. Want Wendy\u2019s? Drive to Troy. Live in Arlington and want a reasonably priced grocery store? Go to Bennington. \n\nJust a gripe, but people take their local town politics WAY TOO seriously. The people in Manchester spent a full two hours debating about the color of open signs outside of businesses. Like, who the fuck cares?\n\nI moved to VT for work and I fucking regret it. My health is compromised, I\u2019m down a full car, much of my belongings have been stolen, and I\u2019m just sad. If you\u2019re in your 20s/30s and you\u2019re thinking of moving to VT by yourself for work or something, just don\u2019t. Take a vacation and go skiing if you wish, but don\u2019t commit to moving here. I understand that all this shit could happen anywhere, but the fact that it\u2019s only ever happened me in VT says something.",

Those are good places to start. If you're expecting people to welcome you with open arms just because you're a new face, don't hold your breath. \n\nIf your job allows, maybe look further north. Franklin County and the NEK have some of the kindest, salt of the earth people I've ever met and I've lived in many other states. Like anything else though, you get out of it what you put into it.  Make an effort to get to know your community and maybe you'll see that it's not as bad as you think. \n\nI don't mean this to be rude, but why would you move to a very rural state then complain about the lack of convenience?  That's what most of us love about Vermont! There are plenty of other places to live in the USA where everything is easily accessible, it doesn't have to be that way here as well.\n\nHoping it turns around for you and you're able to find some positives in your life.",

Same goes with having to drive 30min to everything - 5 minutes on google maps could tell you this. Local politics too serious? These people actually really care about this place that they call home - it's ok that you don't care for it and don't call it home, but don't hold it against people who are passionate about it. Be happy that there aren't more serious issues to deal with than open sign colors. I don't have a response for all the thefts and whatnot - but it does seem you have been disproportionately impacted by theft which raises some questions. Sucks that your apartment was moldy but that happens everywhere in the world, and it sounds like your landlord took care of it which can sometimes be easier said than done. \n\nFinally, very, and I mean VERY, few people are moving to Bennington/Sunderland for work. They just aren't. So the infrastructure isn't really built for young newcomers to the working scene. \n\nI get it, it sucks, you're unhappy, but I think you're blaming the fact that you and Vermont aren't compatible on Vermont. Believe it or not there are plenty of people happily living here and working on improving many things - and the entire state doesn't really owe you anything in terms of changing for you.

It went into eugenics for awhile and wanted to be independent.   \n\nIt has an issue with drug use and crime.  It's only increased and gotten worse since the pandemic.  There is no answer to this so far.  \n\nOn the national level, Vt is usually seen as having covered bridges everywhere, the leaves are in perpetual state of changing leaves, there's a covered bridge around every corner, Bernie Sanders is from there, and there's Champ on the discovery channel people know about.  Knowledge seems to end there.  Weirdly enough I have found VTers more friendly on vacation out of state than actually in state.  I guess because of how small the state is and running into others.  \n\nVT was once a republican stronghold and over time due to the Eisenhower administration managed to put in the highway system making Chittenden County  have far more left moving in.  Ironically, the democratic party platform has the same beliefs as the 1956 party platform, giving credence to intellectual claims that the democratic party is actually more of a republican party platform of the 1950s and the Republican Party is far, far right.  \n\nVT seems to have its democratic stronghold which has led to more gentrification and overall numerous people moving out of state from the cities.  It has areas largely impoverished and decaying.  The quality or spirit has declined.   One county caters more to the rich and not to those that have lived here for generations and doesn't do much to help them. The very principles aren't applied to their own state, like making a living wage to be in VT, affordable housing program to an instate and first time buyer.  \n\n Most can't afford to live here and they move out of state.  Most of the state's character has largely turned more into a state of renting out giant 1800s homes into 5 to 6 apartments with slum lords and people that don't live there.  Overtime, towns themselves, similar to other states in NE, are rich and mostly empty, but that changed once the owner realized that it wasn't that bad to live in the third mansion remotely for some time as opposed to a few days a year.  The prices went up and zero has been done to address it.  That goes with rent and also housing.  \n\nOutside of Chittenden County, we get more into rural areas, where such an such person stayed on a plot of land that was likely stolen by Native Americans and has led lived there for several generations.  They are largely foreclosed in thinking, belief system, and unaware of an outside world think populist MAGA.  Like other states, in the US, one isn't really accepted if they have to move around a lot.  Most don't have much of an open mind.  It isn't necessarily all, but is most, dependent on demographics and location.  \n\nVT might be a microcosm of everything wrong with the US and its issues happen elsewhere.  I'm largely convinced its not fixable at this point.  A lot needs to change.",

It sounds like it might be time for you to either substantially change your circumstances here, or to plan to thrive somewhere else. The community here is not interested in change and as the state ages and young professionals and families feel less and less welcome, I am not optimistic that things will get better. And ignore the negative voices on this thread. Less than a year ago I saw this online community mocking a woman who was snowed in with young children and just looking for someone she could pay to help plow her out. The same people who think they are ruggedly independent will desperately expect someone else to solve their problems for them the moment the shoe is on the other foot. They also seem to think driving out young professionals will somehow help their housing crisis rather than just a result in a resource poor community where it is impossible to get any help for anything other than exorbitant prices, just further pricing out those who can barely afford to be here.\n\nGood fortune to you and if you choose to leave, know that you didn't fail.

I worked really terrible jobs and suffered a ton of health issues, went through horrible living situations and eventually just left. I say this because like Vermont people love Maine for the beauty and peace and it has plenty of that, but sometimes a place isn\u2019t a good fit and you just have shit luck.

They actually might have some that city folks DON'T HAVE. People in New England, especially Vermont, are miserable! BUT the catch is, i.e., my neighbor and I may act like this, but if I needed something, they would help! And likewise. I've noticed that people have less etiquette these days, less people saying thank you for small things like holding the door. And welcome to the New England, and the US where people care more about the color of a sign that anything else. People in manchester may have nothing else to care about than that. Want good food I suggest you make your own. I work with guys who refuse to buy meat or chicken from the store! The fastest food I know and like to eat is deer, not any grocery store food. (And i havent hunted yet). Wendy's is garbage! Another point about new england, is that Vermonters, Mainers. Hampshirites, CT people, Rhode Islanders, all act like A holes. Maybe some more or less.And people in northern communities think it's just a flatlander ting.  And there's def a lot of towns, or town bars, where they haven't seen a new face before lol.

But between Brattleboro to Burlington, it's a real life style choice. That said I've met many people that flee Tristate New York, Hawaii, California, Miami for a batch of reasons that don't sound that different.",

It can be hard at first to meet and get to know people but once you find community it's gold. VT does certainly hold true to a lot of the things folks say about it but in a less exaggerated way. We do generally really love to be outside in any season/weather in any sort of way. You have to get outside to make it through the winters (if not the cold in our warming climate, then the darkness) but honestly it's so beautiful in all the other seasons that you simply spend a lot of time out of doors. We have our challenges like anywhere else and some that are all our own. It is a small state, and this has both benefits and drawbacks. \n\nAs far as observing townspeople spending two hours arguing over the look of business signs, there are indeed folks who seem to have an awful lot of free time to dedicate to such causes, but at the same time it is crucial to care because if you don't, then who will? People debate the little things because they also dialogue and collaborate over the big things. That is how the work of living gets done in a place like this. \n\nBut I'm from the northeast to begin with (Northern NY) and VT truly feels like home, so I am a bit biased.",

As someone who lived in vt 50% of the time for 11 years and now full time for 3 years, I don\u2019t know many people outside of VT though we meet people wherever we go to festivals etc.  Even growing up and living in CT we never spent enough time in CT so all the people I know in CT I met in VT.  lol.  In VT we have a core group of transplants in our resort community who are like family. Some are locals, many are weekenders, and some are people my husband has met working and going to school in VT.  I have cousins who are natives. We spend time on the cape in the summer.  The thing is that in Connecticut and Massachusetts no one cares where you are from when they meet you.  You don\u2019t have to defend why you are there.  But in everyday life meeting new people in VT who are locals or natives there is always an undercurrent of \u201cwhy are you here?\u201d.  It\u2019s gotten significantly worse Every year for the past 10-15 years. Ever since Covid it\u2019s really bad.  It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s such a beautiful place and I love it when I am at a big house party or pot luck or when I\u2019m at the mountain and I run into any one of the hundreds of friends I have there. That\u2019s when I feel like it\u2019s my place and there is nowhere I would rather be.  But it\u2019s draining the rest of the time.  Even well meaning nice people who are in the community make me feel defensive about belonging sometimes.  It\u2019s sometimes subtle and other times it\u2019s not.  My car had CT plates for a long time even though I lived in VT because we were back and forth and had a house in CT.  It was like wearing a flatlander tatoo on my forehead. I was going to the hair dresser who I go to every 12 weeks and the woman leaving ahead of me made a nasty comment to my hairdresser when she was leaving.  In particular I feel it in the grange getting community dinners, at the Nearby grocery store and general store.  But living in an area where 70-80% of the houses are second homes creates a feeling of being invaded by tourists too.  So I always feel like I need to drop a hint I\u2019m local.  Like when I pay with my debit card I\u2019m wanting to fumble with my license so they see it says VT.  It\u2019s just mentally draining to feel you have to defend your right to exist all the time.  Mostly people are nice but\u2026they don\u2019t really want anyone new to be here even though in my head I\u2019m not new.  In CT or MA no one would act like that.",

Vt has become overrun with people working remote since covid.. most of the farms I grew up working/ hunting/ fishing are dead and being subdivided or covered in solar panels.. Every single off leash dog walking path has mandatory leash signs now.. Saw numerous out of stater's flip out and start screaming when they saw off leash dogs in the last 6-8 years and lo and behind now leashes are mandatory.. ON EVERY SINGLE TRAIL IN THE COUNTY! We have to Bushwhack far from marked trails to let our dogs run in the woods now. Too many people move to vt and post the land we grew up hunting/ fishing/ 4 wheeling.\n\n\nNew people in vt have a tough time because so many that have come before you have incited change and chipped away at the wild west existence we grew up enjoying in the 90's.. you may be well intentioned but you have to prove that to us before being accepted as a local and if you don't step on any toes and keep showing up at local events for SEVERAL years maybe, just maybe we will contemplate indoctrinating you into our inner circles and tightly knit friend groups that invite one another to go do things in small units..\u00a0\n\n\nVt is trapped in the 50's in lots of wonderful and intolerable ways.\n\n\nVermont is quiet, peaceful, ideal for the outdoorsy lifestyle and if people know and trust you they will take the shirt off their backs with the only question being what else can I do to help.. but for you outsiders it's a bewilderingly hostile infestation of rednecks and hippies who don't know you, don't won't want to and hope you move away soon.\n\n\nFor all the people out there who don't like VT I request that you spread this message as far and wide as you are able\nIt's a bad place to move to.. VT wants as many of you as possible to stay in Massachusetts or wherever.. It's rainy and overcast in the summer, spring is aptly named mud season, gets overrun with leafpeepers in the fall and becomes a frozen wasteland in winter. It's lily white, racist, taxes are almost as high as the cost of living and the traffic is worse than it ever was. It's like nobody is in a hurry to get anywhere and the pace of life is just all slowed down like vt is under a rock.\n\n\nMake sure you never go there to verify how horrible it is.\u00a0 Take my unbiased word that it's hell on earth.. Nothing grows there.. the hunting and trout fishing is abysmal.. the food is way too locally sourced and fresh, the farmers markets are just loaded with crunchy hippies, the skiing sucks because there are too few people in the lift lines to socialize with and the trails are erie and unsettling because they are nearly empty on weekdays. The people are just way too chatty and overfirendly with each other. The cheese is just awful.. The beer tastes so good that you will become an alcoholic.. the lakes are just too damn clean because of the godawful no gas motors laws (the nerve on these people), the legal lack of billboards makes it so that you have no idea what the state of consumerism is like. The anti GMO laws are just stupid.. The cops are just way too present and friendly with people.. There are 4 wheelers and dirt bikes driving legally all over the roads (many of which are still unpaved)\n\n\nYou don't want to come to vt and most of vt doesn't want you here",

We can't assume anything about you really from this post, but if you are making decent money at a professional job and finding that many lower income folks are being \"cold and standoffish\" to you then there may be something in your behavior or how you present yourself that makes them feel as though you are looking down on them. Struggling vermonters have a hard time with \"outsiders\" who are in a better place than them for a variety of reasons and may play into this. \n\nNot saying it's an excuse or anything, but something you may want to be mindful and thoughtful of. OR just remember so that you don't take it too personally next time. \n\nAs an example, I live in a very small rural town that is mostly blue collar folks. I work in Burlington doing a professional job that pays pretty well. When I stop at my local general store after work wearing my professional attire I am treated 100% differently by the patrons and the staff who don't know me well than when I show up at the same store on Saturday morning in dirty carhartts, beat up boots, and an old hat on. I don't take it personally - these folks aren't really used to interacting with a dude in business casual attire and assume we have nothing in common. It may seem standoffish but they just genuinely don't know how to interact with me. Some may even assume I'm looking down on them or think I'm better than them. But if someone I know well comes up and says \"hey whaletacochamp - gonna be working the woods this weekend?\" anyone within earshot drops their guard because they know I'm \"one of them\" - i just happen to also have a white collar job. \n\nVermonters are a nuanced bunch.

Plenty of people feel uncomfortable in certain places; I\u2019ve had to work in Detroit several times and found it to be a repulsive, decrepit wasteland, but some people find that it energizes them, and that\u2019s okay too. \n\nLiving in Vermont means planning ahead, and it always has. In exchange for that, we get locally-owned stores, we get communities that care for one another*, and we don\u2019t have to look like the rest of the country. I travel for work (which is the only reason I can afford to live here), and there are few places in the US that actually look tonally distinct. For all of Vermont\u2019s zoning woes, the small towns of Vermont do genuinely have their own look. Sometimes that means we argue about sign colors and \u201cOpen\u201d flags, but it does mean most of Vermont doesn\u2019t look like South Carolina and Pennsylvania and Ohio and Iowa and Arizona, full of strip malls and chain stores. If you\u2019re near this stuff, like Bennington, or Williston, or Springfield, you might as well live someplace else.\n\n*Bennington has always been rather unpleasant. I did a couple promotional projects for the town years and years ago, and even then people seemed to prefer being angry over improving their town\u2019s image (at no cost to them, I might add). The general tone seemed to be that if Bennington were to become more pleasant, the townspeople would have no scapegoat on which to blame their lack of success. Bennington is the [\u201cdrowning in shallow water\u201d meme](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.knowyourmeme.com/memes/drowning-in-shallow-water), made into a town.",

The average age is older, which is going to mean that the majority of people are either married or in some form of domestic partnership. Therefore, most social events are going to cater more towards the married or married with kids crowd. From there it's a feedback loop: the social atmosphere caters more toward married couples, this means the single folks are left lonely and destitute so they move out, more younger married folks move in because, \"oh look at all the cute couple things we can do\".",

                    "body": "True Vermonters of old didnt have to think about the difference because there werent any \"others\" here. The fundemental Verrmonter philosophy was live and let live. Imdont care what you do, just leave me alone to do my thing. We'll cooperate when we need to, and we'll work hard when we do. \n\nShort history lesson, this ended in the 60s and 70s. The so called hippie commune movement invaded. Being as they were, Vermonters lived and let live. You wanna be a hippie, have at it. Slowly, the state has been swollen with ex-urbanites who moved here with the idea that Vermonters liked hippies because they shared similar values. They really didn't. Vermonters are real independent, you're respnsible for yourself types. You all probably didnt onoe that Vermont to this day has voted for Repubkucan governors and presidents more than any other state. There were few democrats prior to the 1970s. Point is, the folks that have moved here iver the last 50 years or so, as compared to the population that comes from stock that lived here earlier, were wealthier, more 'eastern educated', and considerably closer to the hippies that started then in migration than the so called Vermonters. But hey, live and let live right?\n\nNow it's the folks from somewhere else, for the most part who are in the driver's seat. The Vermont of today is a society not exactly of the Vermont tradition. You'll hear the powers that be talk about keeping our historic past, conserving our agricultural heritage, rehabilitating our important structures, keeping our landscapes open. That's all well and good, problem is that the people deciding what to 'protect' have no idea what this 'past' they want to save looked like. Invariably, they're protection efforts result in creating a Vermont that is nothing like it was and guaranteeing it will be nothing like Vermonters ever would have planned for. But, live and let live, right?\n\nThis has left a good number of Vermonters less than excited about getting to know the new folks in town, as just by looking around its pretty clear they didn't get to know Vermonters. Vermonters seem gruff and a little uninterested in strangers. Well, that'll happen when you're alienated in your own towns. A few examples of things Vermonters look sideways at. \n\nFor many decades Vermonters kept billboards off our roads. Despite the income many landowners could have made directing folks to ski areas and vacation lakes, the landscape was more important. Then in a matter of a decade, there are solar farms at least as landscape damaging as billboards just everywhere. \"I like them it makes me feel proud!\" Vermont is one of the cloudiest places on the continent. Just saying, Burlington has more cloudy days than any city in America but Portland, OR.\n\nNo development, no development, no development. Zoning restrictions and an unpredictable permitting process in a place where construction labor and material cost are always high. Oh my god a housing crisis! How did this happen? Greedy rich people?? Meanwhile, to \"save family farms\" the state spends millions to buy development rights from family farms injecting cash to the farm but removing the development potential the land had. Hasn't saved farms. Gave old farmers retirement money and lowered the value of the land which has been swallowed up by ever increasingly large agri-business farms. Fewer farmers, more milk, less land to develop, higher costs for purchasing land to develop for housing, and more of a housing shortage. Vermonters shake their heads. \"But we're saving farmland and Vermont's historic agricultural economy!\". Fun fact: Manufacturing outpaced agriculture as bigger portion of the state economy in 1830 and never turned back. Think mill towns making wooden bobbins from the timber industry. \n\nThe conservation of the metal i-beam skeleton of the old moran plant on probably some of the finest waterfront land IN THE WORLD. How about the circ? You know the one in Essex. That was supposed to go from Colchester to where it is now to I-89 just south of the Big Box exit. Not 35 or 40 minutes from Colchester to Williston, but 10. Stopped by environmental lawsuits. It had over 80% public support, was nearly totally funds by the feds, and all the land for the right of way was purchased. Who brought the suits? Out of state in migration attorneys, chief attorney - yup, Peter Welch. Ever seen the file cabinet sculpture down near Redstone Park? It's like a 60 foot tall stack of file cabinets. It represents the amount of paper work the Southern Connector Plan, also stopped by lawsuits, made before being scuttled. You know the southern connector. That skateboard park down at the end of Pine Street? \n\nThese and many dozens of other \"Flatlander\" bungles have made Vermonters very skeptical of the new neighbors indeed.",

That applies to folks from here, and in all parts of the globe we all share.  I do agree also that it really doesn't matter where you are from, as long as you understand where you are, and who you are with.  What you personally believe, may not be what the folks around you believe.  Vermonters that i grew up with were very tolerant to different kinds of attitudes, we didn't care what color your skin was, or where you were born.  It only mattered how you acted and treated everyone around you.    I have travelled around the US, and Canada, a little bit of Mexico, the Middle East, and South East Asia.  For a \"xenophobe\" as some like to call us, i think i've done well.  But Vermont will always be my home, and i want to protect it from becoming just another place that got run over by \"progress\" for the sake of it.",

I love Vermont and Vermonters, a lot of us are trying to keep the dream alive. Politics are an issue but a lot of Vermonters are still trying to meet their neighbors and forge community connections! I think the effort put into talking to the locals is already a facet of integrity and strength. Lately it feels like out-of-staters bring a completely different culture to the tender yet resilient state of Vermont. \n\nI like out of staters if they don't judge us and wanna be friendly and curious about our way of life.

I have made it known to everyone in the park that if they need help hauling or paying for trash removal, to call me up. I would rather come help then look at a disgusting mattress for weeks before town road crew gets harassed into finally dealing with it. \n\nThe beers cans is an obvious reason. They do not want to get a DUI. So they throw the can out the window so they don\u2019t get an open container violation.  They know someone will eventually pick it up anyway. Not saying it\u2019s right, but the reason people litter is more nuanced than just being inconsiderate or bad people.",

Like asking things that just blatantly show that the tourist asking a question already has a definition of vermont and vermonters in their mind which is so off base that it's actually insulting. Or asking something that indicates that they are a Karen who is going to flip their shit when they get here and realize just how hard it is going to be for them to have all the amenities they want and need.\n\nSo my point is that I would ask the tourists to at least try and use their brain before just hopping on reddit to have us do their thinking for them. But I also ask residents to not assume everyone coming here/asking questions is such an idiot either. \n\nWe are often treated like a playground for rich tourists, and as such the entire state gets treated like \"the help\" by these particularly boisterous tourists who unfortunately give all tourists a bad rep. I think a lot of people are just touchy about tourists because of this and I don't blame them. This is a once in a lifetime event for us too, but also a lot of us have no choice but to attempt to go about our normal day meanwhile our state is going to be overrun by people who have the privilege to be here on a day off getting mad at us for not having the infrastructure to support them for a day.\n\nThis is honestly a psychologically complex thing and I think \"be nice to tourists\" and \"fuck all these tourists\" are both oversimplifying a very complex and emotionally charged issue that requires more finesse and emotional intelligence than either of those mindsets possess.",

She had a great day playing in the mud and we got to witness the eclipse together.  \n\nWithout your post I wouldn\u2019t have bothered to drive up.

They come to see the moon block out the sun with their naked eyes (or telescopes) and all the little, incredible details that are associated with that show. 98% totality is the preview to the main attraction.

Man I wanted to pass him so many times but Rochester gap isn't great for that and at my one chance he was also only doing 2 mph under the speed limit and it felt like a dick move. Also as another example of what an absolute moron this guy was, when we got on 89 and the 2nd lane opened (1 lane closed due to construction for a bit as you get on the interstate) with no one else on the interstate but us, he immediately pulled into the left lane. Not passing anyone. No one in front. Just me behind who was about to pull into that lane to pass....\n\nAlso this doesn't have anything to do with passing but when I got back to WRJ and got off 89 by the McDonald's there was a truck in front of me who came to a complete stop before entering the roundabout which was completely empty.

I have gotten to the point that I just expect the actions. \n\nPeople driving 35 in a 50 (2A to Williston is really bad for this), People running red lights and not paying attention to the no turn on red signs (the amount of near collisions at 5 corners, or the multitude of people who plow through the red light at mall intersection.), the amount of people in downtown Burlington go around a stopped school bus, it's just ridiculous the amount of bad driving here. \n\nI understand 45 in a 50 isn't bad driving, but the reaction certainly is. \n\nThe worse thing is, I've run into so many people who seem to want to speed up the moment I try and pass them... thankfully my car gets up and goes when I need it to, but for fuck sake, why couldn't they just go the speed limit before I try and pass them? \n\nTLDR: yeah, driving in Vermont can be shit sometimes.\n\nEdit:  and don't get me started on the wrong way drivers lately. \ud83d\ude12",

The bike needs airflow or the temps climb to 225f and then the frame gets hot enough to cause a burn. Once the fuel in the tank gets hot it starts missing and doesn't want to idle. If I shut it off or it stalls it doesn't want to restart.\n\nSo, I lane split at a relaxed 15mph. Most traffic didn't care  at all, a few cars made extra room (thank you), and a couple vehicles angrily honked at me as I passed. \n\nSorry I'm not stuck in traffic with you. I don't want to cook as I straddle an infernal combustion engine and I don't want to be run over as the driver behind me gets distracted and plays on their phone. One of the most dangerous places for a bike to be is sandwiched between two multi-ton crumple-zoned protective cages.

Why is it worth endangering lives to save a few seconds or minutes? \n\nAnother recent experience: I took a left onto 22A. Looked ahead and saw a passing vehicle coming right at me- I hadn\u2019t seen it, and it hadn\u2019t seen me, because of the size of the truck it was passing. Fortunately it was able to complete the pass. It wasn\u2019t super-close, but it also wasn\u2019t not close.\n\nBottom line for me is that the risk vs reward of passing is generally poor. Yes, there are plenty of times when passing is pretty safe and low risk. But there are plenty of times when it\u2019s not, and people try to pass anyway. That\u2019s the crap that scares me.",

As I came abreast of him a cop came around the corner in the incoming lane. I had plenty of time but I stomped it any way. The cop had his blue lights on almost as fast as he saw me so I had to pull over almost immediately after passing the old man. The cop came up and asked why I was passing to which I told him the old man was traveling drastically under the speed limit. The cop then told me he was going to have to write me up because if it was anybody else instead of a cop it would have been a very dangerous situation.\nI told him yup, I 'll be seeing you in court for this one. \n\nHe wrote me a warning.",

The funniest thing I keep hearing is the wealthy educated liberal class tell the working class to suck it up and get a better job or more education. Some people love what they do and do it despite the fact that they barely make it (farmers) and have a completely necessary job. Others don\u2019t do well with education. It\u2019s the lefts version of let them eat cake. I really can\u2019t believe someone would actually say that. Most people don\u2019t want to spend every waking minute working to support a family they don\u2019t get to see as a result. Having a mortgage and kids made me go from voting for Obama twice to conservative because it was easy to be liberal when you don\u2019t see how bad the government is at everything.
