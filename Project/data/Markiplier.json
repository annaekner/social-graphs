US fans especially, as it is only available in america right now. we are the only ones that can give it the success it deserves for the team to not only have a chance to get noticed by someone willing to buy it and get it streaming to a wider audience, but to also give mark a proper chance in the acting industry since he has been a star in the process. being the main character, already being famous irl, and helping produce the show. the success of TEOS could greatly effect the success of iron lung's release. especially since iron lung is mark's own project. mark for the most part just acted in TEOS, outside of that he did not have much of a hand in the creation process. but iron lung is his baby, his chance to get noticed in the film industry and to prove a point. and the point he wants to prove is erasing the stereotype of higher up people in the film industry thinking youtubers and other \"smaller\" content creators can't create a \"good\" serious project like that. that they can't produce a full movie that actually does well. that's what this is all about, mark wanting to prove that point to tear down that stereotype and change the film industry in the process.\n\nso if it annoys you because \"TEOS is everywhere now\" then maybe take a break from the subreddit or even the fandom in general if you're not down for seeing the process that it takes to get him to the goal he's trying to reach. if you're annoyed, unfollow the sub so you don't see the posts all over your home feed. stop complaining about things you quite literally have control over.",

Maybe because the team who works on it is currently focusing on the TV series. Or maybe Wood Elf (the same who helped create Distractible and currently Brain Leak) just shut the whole thing down because they don't believe in the project anymore after nothing was published for so long and they feel they hype wave has long passed. As a reminder, the original audio series is from 2019, so 5 years ago.\n\n  \nIdk, we can only speculate.",

As far as I'm concerned, they can keep making movies about DUSK, The Pony Factory, Fingerbones, Chop Goblins, Squirrel Stapler, whatever.",

It's kind of difficult to see Mark in a live-action role beyond the With Markiplier series though. Like, he's fine, I had no real issues with him, but I could only see him as Mark. It felt a bit less distracting when it was just his voice in the original series.\n\nThe final episode is the best part though. I love how they play around with the format and just go wild with the editing.\n\nOverall, I felt like some parts were a bit awkward (the design/costume/makeup of \"the elephant\" was a little strange. Like, I kind of saw what they were going for, but you really had to stare at it to see what it was), but I'm interested to see what season 2 might bring.",

                    "body": "Full opinion after watching the show (with having listened to the audio drama at least 4 times LOL): \n\nAll in all, a great piece of film. But not without its flaws\n\nTo look to the positive first, all of the cinematography in this show was absolutely gorgeous. You can definitely tell what Mark was going for, making sure the shots lined up with the characters mindset and emotions. Along with this, the editing and style choice were fantastic. From an artistic standpoint, it was phenomenal \n\nBut if we\u2019re looking for the characteristics of a captivating piece of FILM, thats a different story \n\nOne of the main reasons I loved the audio drama so much was because of the incredible pacing throughout the entire story. Im gonna give Mark the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to him having a certain budget, because the main plot points of the story were EXTREMELY rushed. \n\nWhat happened to Lindas whole experience in the hospital? I feel like that trope and POV of her character would have explained a lot of her bluntness and dread that her actor was (trying) to conjure up. A lot of these character are established because, we, as Marks fans, already know the story line. But for other people\u2026it seems that the audience was just supposed to accept the dramatic environment, without enough information in the dialogue/scenes to make that conclusion. \n\nAlong with this, why did the entire plot point and character of the Kidnapper in the parking lot COMPLETELY disappear? In the audio drama, that was a perfect way to foundation Matteos role in the Army, as he was disrespected by the Kidnapper by lying about being a veteran. In the show, it\u2019s all just vague inputs about his \u201ctours\u201d and \u201cmilitary life\u201d that make his character another shallow adaptation of a \u201ctraumatized veteran\u201d.  And if we just kept this character, there would have been no reason to introduce Ruth, a poor attempt for more drama to be introduced.  \n\n\nWHAT HAPPENED TO THE MOOBLES TROPE???????????\nI WAS SO EXCITED FOR THAT AND IT JUST DIDNT HAPPEN????\nAgain, this show was trying to introduce drama and be dramatic, WITH NOTHING BEING DEVELOPED. The Moobies trope was the PERFECT way to showcase Daves parasomnia and how it affected him even after he thought it got better. Again, the audio drama was INCREDIBLE at developing these characters, while the show just\u2026assumed you listened to the audio drama beforehand \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nLowkey theres a lot more I wanna say, but my lunch is almost over \ud83d\udc80",

Any YouTuber with a scandal or bad reputation can hinder the performance of anything and that\u2019s where I feel this animosity has an explanation. It\u2019s just unfair that for those who truly are being honest. \n\nThe internet has a bad reputation period. Being an internet star can be dismissed because of this association and seen negatively compared to others who truly work in the industry. \n\nEssentially yes, it may be about control, but companies have a brand to protect. It\u2019s understandable from a business side. You guys are thinking about it way too emotionally because it\u2019s Mark. He himself has accepted that this is how the ball rolls and he is prepared to fight the fight for his projects. For that we should applaud and support him. He will prove himself despite this all, and of that I am proud of him for.\n\nEdit: Let me include the fact that the marketing issue of this release is an entirely different matter. My personal opinion is that Prime is just unorganized and sucks at promoting their shows that they release that also don\u2019t get much attention either. They\u2019re just dumb imo.",

His jaw kind of gets lost in the shadows/stubble of that pic so it\u2019s hard to see but you have the position pretty correct. His ear could be a little bigger and a touch lower too. We tend to focus on facial features more when looking at a person and that can lead to drawing those features larger than how they actually are proportionally. Doing a light rough outline of his facial features first and comparing that to the reference before detailing will help you with the proportions.

But they are going to be your BIGGEST lifesaver when measuring where bits of the face go. \n\nFor smoother blending, use tissues and go easy with it. It will help it look very soft and smooth, then you can add hatching/crosshatching lines overtop for texture or deeper shadows.\n\nI dont want this to come off as negative criticism, because that is not what this is. This is an amazing piece, and i have always had to figure these tips out for myself. I hope you try these out (doesnt even have to be on another piece, it can be on a \u2018practice piece\u2019, like drawing a circle and shading or another object) and hope they work out for u \ud83d\udc4d",

Eventually he got to a point where most of his faces look really good, but it's still a challenge. I recommend to start putting a lot more time into practicing them. Instead of drawing random things or the rest of the body, focus purely on faces for a while. You'll get better.",

Like the corners of the mouth usually go in between the middle of the eye balls, the nose is as wode as the inbetween of the eyes, the eyes are in the middle of the head (not face) etc.\nThose are things that help me with faces so much and when you wanna dras someone in particular (someone recognizable) those proportions are what make them recognizable (apart feom other stuff like hair, style, etc.)",

Please do not do this, it is literally throwing your vote away because he's not a registered candidate.\n\nAlso, you know what it would mean if Mark actually ran for president? It means he would have to deal with very heavy and stressful topics. You thought he was busy when making his movie? You could say goodbye to regular uploads for 4-8 years.\n\nAs always, Mark makes his own choices. If he decides to run for office, that's another story.

No more making things or creating jobs just to stimulate economic markets, everyone gets the basics to live, eat, and be treated regardless of their job, even those who don\u2019t work at all, even if they are capable.\n\n\n\nDemocratic socialists are closer to alt right conservatives than they are to actual socialists and communists, but at least they don\u2019t force children to give birth and outlaw being poor, a minority or openly support fascist ideology. \n\n\n\nBut both parties work for the rich. The country is ran by companies, not ideals or the benefits of its people. Profit drives all politicians, and in lower levels of government, it\u2019s a necessary evil because you literally need money to do things for free. If the right people don\u2019t get paid in favors or money, you do not exist.\n\n\n\n\nFor the right, it\u2019s not at all the same landscape. Trump has a personality cult surrounding him as the hero to fix all the problems, and even those who heavily disagree with him will still vote full red ticket because of the false narrative that the American left party supports actual socialism and the dismantling of capitalism.",

Rather than isolate the part of this quote that mentions gender, I'll include the whole thing:\n\n>The next conservative President must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for woke culture warriors.

No one is ever lesser because of something outside their control. I was put into a body that matches how I feel, and I think I fall in the gender binary, so I'm cis myself.

People drop out of the race cuz running for president is expensive and tiresome, and the parties have to unify behind one candidate to even have a CHANCE of winning on election day.\n\nVoting for a third party doesn't *cause* the problem, its a symptom we have to deal with because that's the precedent. the US's entire political system is built on two parties. This kind of thing would need to be changed from within the political system as a politician, not as a voter.

I politically lean left but I did NOT see the concern over the state of democracy itself with McCain or Romney-- I generally tend to view such narratives as fearmongering, but looking at Project 2025 itself and things Trump has actually said, I think being concerned is rational response. I know Biden is not a \"great\" (or even \"good\") candidate, and he's not as sharp as he was in 2012, but I'd vote for an actual corpse before Trump if that was his main opponent.\n\nAlso, FWIW, Trump plans to be much more ghoulish when it comes to supporting Israel, so that's something to consider on a practical level when voting. I don't like the two party system either, but whether we like it or not doesn't change that it exists as of now.",

Trump thinks Israel was weak for letting October 7 happen, but has since stated that he backs Israel completely, but thinks they should stop publicizing their actions because it's bad PR (one [source](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/where-trump-and-biden-stand-on-israel-and-gaza/) for that), we're talking not being anywhere near tough enough in opposition vs endorsement, and the reason Trump has cited for wanting to stop the war, or \"get it over with\", whatever it means is [PR](https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-israel-pr-hugh-hewitt-21faee332d95fec99652c112fbdcd35d); I don't know if you care about morals (I'm guessing you do, given your stance), but that's worth noting. \n\nI know it sucks, but voting is often a matter of mitigating the damages to keep things from getting worse, as grim as that sounds. If you dislike the current candidates, I urge you to fight like hell in the primaries for someone you *actually* think should actually be president (for myself, that was Bernie Sanders, and he came very close both times) and also, if you choose to be idealistic (in politics, idealism without compromise will make you VERY disappointed), get involved in your local and state elections, which can be just as consequential; an OR house candidate I canvassed for is largely responsible for ensuring access to reproductive care and abortion, which is now part of Oregon's state law after going to a vote as a ballot measure (which I also canvassed in favor of) in the middle of Trump's presidency.",

I think he is actually interested in the game itself that's why he did a solo playthrough without the gang and I don't think there is anything wrong with that. He just likes the game and they don't so why not let him play by himself.\n\nI may be wrong on that one so feel free to correct me, just a thing i noticed that may have contributed to him playing by himself.",

Thats what a normal lets-player acted and sounded like in that era, and as we faded out of that era he experimented and found a style that suited him and he chilled out a bit more and started playing up angry emotions instead because he found it funny or because we found it funny.
