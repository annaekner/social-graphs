(XSPC \u2018yellow\u2019)\n\nIt\u2019s got a 7700x and 7900xt\n\nAnd I\u2019ve gotten half a million comments about it being piss urine haha funny already just fyi.\n\nNot everyone believes it is my first build but oh well. I used a 2019 acer predator Helios 300 (1660ti) before this (est 2019) and a MacBook Pro 2015 before that (which I still use) and a 2008 MacBook Pro before that. That is all.\n\nAnd yea the coolant can be changed if I choose to so don\u2019t think the yellow is a permanent fixture although I likely won\u2019t change it anyways.\n\n(Finished 9/23 btw)",

Is this a special kind of pump or reservoir that has a third connector specifically for draining?\n\nAlso, why is there this tube at the very top of the reservoir? Isn't it going in from the rad and then coming out at the bottom?\n\nThanks for any help, just trying to learn more",

In a month the internet clout will disappear and you will just have a box that looks like it\u2019s plumbed into the piss trough at a state fair.",

You can express an opinion without throwing a hissy fit that someone else didn\u2019t share the same opinion. \n\nThat being said now, the budget was set from the start, and I wasn\u2019t going to expand the budget for the sake of spending more, for me, these parts were more than enough already. What I wanted primarily was to build a water cooled pc. \n\nDue to improvisations required along the way, the build ended up going slightly above budget as it stands, but keep in mind that a 4090 is MORE THAN double the price of the 7900xt (especially recently because of the whole China thing, not that that mattered back then). Not a very insignificant amount, but small upgrades, such as jumping to the xtx or x3d, all add up, and sticking to a budget means not jumping at every upgrade opportunity if it puts you over. (Btw at the time, idk if it still is, the 7700X was actually even cheaper than the 7700 to put this in perspective)\n\nIt\u2019s like going shopping and keeping a list so you don\u2019t buy things you don\u2019t need and end up spending way more than you intended. I made a list going in, and stuck with it. That\u2019s all.\n\n(Except ram. That\u2019s shits expensive. But I intend to keep that for a while longer than other parts)",

So you're better off with a standard non 3d series.   Like why the fuck did they make them?!.  I'd be amazing if you could run the 7950x3d perfectly as like a dual cpu and basically have a 7800x3d for gaming and at the sane time be able to use the other die for everything else you're doing.

Its okay Im deploying ory so I can self host an alternative for cloudflare protection. I have a 7900 xtx i have a 3080 ti i have a surface pro 9. Dont mean shit, these are all consumer products; what you are getting excited about is just benchmarks and marketing. Depending on the use case of the end user, that marketing doesnt mean fu$\\*$ shite. For instance my grandma does not need even a gtx 760 to browse the web. This is a watercooled loop, that shit aint for function. That shit is for art. So berating and down voting someone for making a midlevel computer that is  a work of art is some first world holier than tho garbage. And pretty lame imho when I know my knowledge and skillset probably more and I can keep calm and be a chill nerd and not a terror like these haters XD",

I've since switched to a Liquid Freezer II after upgrading to a 13700K.](https://i.imgur.com/XI0V76e.jpeg)",

Any CPU intended to be misleading in a harmful way has been colored deep red like the 7120U as a warning.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SWqLJ6tGmYHzqGaa4RZs54iw7C1uLcTU_rLTRHTOzaA/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nOriginally, AMD would use the first number to indicate the CPU architecture. Ex. A 1, 2, or 3 could mean zen 1 or zen 1+. A 3 or 4 indicated Zen 2. 5 was used to indicate zen 2+ or zen 3. The following numbers and letters would classify the performance and power consumption or features of the CPU. This was considered really dumb and misleading, so AMD replaced the first number with the manufacturing year to be even more confusing and moved the architecture number to the middle of the number where it could be more easily missed. It used this number scheme:\n\nhttps://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fdfa74Gvq1p4-LgIkCsI5XjmboI=/0x0:998x451/998x451/filters:focal(499x226:500x227)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24002163/rhallock_0_1662481952330.png\n\nThe newest naming scheme is even more confusing because Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 is extremely unique and scrambled.",

Installing gaming drivers will give you voltage control though Adrenalin performance tuning. Undervolting this GPU and memory will decrease heat and increase frames.\n\nThe FE doesn't support the Gaming version of Adrenalin without a [registry edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/e91rnr/psa_kmd_isgamingdriver_1_to_enable_non_pro_mode/). This means you have almost no control over your GPU's performance. With this edit, you can use the Gaming version of Adrenalin up to 4/2022. Versions after that do not support voltage control on Vega cards AFAIK. Even with this \"hack,\" you should consider re-pasting that card if you haven't already. I installed the Raijintek Morphus II cooler on my FE because the HBM heat is just crazy.\n\nI have since moved on to the 7800XT, but I was able to get a good, long run out of that card.\n\nEdit: for clarity",

            "text": "Over the last 5+ years I have been working to better the Linux virtualisation space through my work on QEMU, KVM and the Looking Glass Project.\n\nYou may remember me as the thorn in your side that brought the AMD GPU reset issues to your attention back in 2019 with the release of the Vega 10 (Radeon Vega 56/64, etc), and again in 2021 when you were about to release Navi 21 (Radeon RX 6000 series) after seeing that you had still not fixed the issues with the release of Navi 14 (Radeon RX 5000 series).\n\nWhile things with Navi 21 improved somewhat with the addition of a partially functional PCI bus reset, things again have taken a step backwards with the Navi 31 (Radeon RX 7000 series). For some the bus reset works most of the time, for others the bus reset doesn\u2019t work at all. When the GPU crashes for any reason, VFIO or not, often it ends up in a state that is completely irrecoverable without a cold reboot of the PC.\n\nWhile the general consumer might be willing to accept these issues to a certain extent (I mean, it\u2019s not like you advertise these GPUs for VFIO usage), what I find absolutely shocking is that your enterprise GPUs also suffer the exact same issues and this is a major issue, especially when these customers are paying in excess of $6000 USD per accelerator.\n\nMany compute deployments often run multiple GPUs in one system, with the GPUs running in virtual machines so that the resources can be leased out. If one of these GPUs crash, instead of just recovering the crashed device with a industry standard reset method (not some device specific register poking magic), the entire system often has to be restarted forcing the interruption of the remaining still working instances.\n\nYou might be thinking that this is to be expected when using consumer GPUs like the Radeon, however I are not talking about your general consumer GPUs here. These enterprise deployments are running hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of AMD Instinct compute accelerators.\n\nI find it incredible that these companies that have large support contracts with you and have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into your products, have been forced to turn to me, a mostly unknown self-employed hacker with very limited resources to try to work around these bugs (design faults?) in your hardware.\n\nThree times in the last two years I have had three different international companies reach out to me to help them diagnose and try to resolve these exact issues. I know that at least one of these companies decided to discontinue using AMD hardware as a policy due to your abysmal support with these reset issues.\n\nWe get it, GPUs are complex devices and require thousands of man hours to develop drivers for, consisting of hundreds of thousands of lines of code. That code is never going to be perfect, the devices are going to crash due to mistakes/bugs. The silicon is not going to be perfect, it\u2019s also going to have erratas that cause it to crash/fault, and the firmware like any other software is going to contain bugs.\n\nThe ability to \u201cturn it off and on again\u201d should not be a low priority additional feature, but rather an expected and extremely important hardware requirement. Have you actually taken the time to look at how much code in the drivers that is devoted to attempting to recover a crashed GPU? How many man hours have been wasted here that could have just been replaced by a single line of code to trigger the GPU to perform a full reset?\n\nEvery other GPU vendor has had this working for 10+ years. NVIDIA devices are amazing, no matter how much abuse I throw at them, from overclocking to poking random registers with random values, every time the GPU crashes, it\u2019s recoverable with a bus reset.\n\nWhile you have implemented several reset methods into the silicon such as the PSP resets, and the BACO reset, none of these work reliably, and none of them will recover a GPU where the PSP has crashed/hung which is a frequent occurrence. Even the aforementioned PCI bus reset will not recover a GPU with a crashed PSP.\n\n**I have several requests that I hope to see as a result of this letter:**\n\n1. Make the PCI bus reset actually perform a full reset of the SOC, not just certain IPs. Reset the entire SOC, **including the PSP**. The GPU should be in a virgin state after a reset, as if the PC had just \tbeen powered on and the BIOS has not yet attempted to load the option rom.\n2. Stop holding the documentation so close to your chest. Even Intel with the Intel ARC release register level documentation of their GPUs. It lets those of us that want to help you, actually help you. Having \topen source drivers is practically pointless if you do not provide the hardware documentation!\n3. Start actually providing support to your enterprise clients, listen to them and fix the bugs they report. I know for a fact that your clients with compute accelerators have been reporting these reset issues for years.\n\n**Why should you listen to me?**\n\nBecause people are getting sick and tired of this. Not only is it damaging your reputation, it\u2019s costing you sales. But don\u2019t just listen to me, look at what you are doing to yourself:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr0rWJhv9jU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr0rWJhv9jU)George Hotz \u2013 giving up on AMD, abysmal commit messages, lack of documentation, switching to NVIDIA due to the instability of your drivers.\n\nIn the VFIO space we no longer recommend AMD GPUs at all, in every instance where people ask for which GPU to use for their new build, the advise is to use NVidia. Even if the AMD GPU manages to reset/start properly, overall stability of the GPU is terrible in comparison to your competitors.\n\nThose that are not using VFIO, but the general gamer running Windows with AMD GPUs are all too well aware of how unstable your cards are. This issue is plaguing your entire line, from low end cheaper consumer cards to your top tier AMD Instinct accelerators.\n\nPlease AMD, help us help you!\n\nEDIT: AMD have reached out to invite me to the AMD Vanguard program to hopefully get some traction on these issues \\*crosses fingers\\*.",

Here we are almost 10 years later, same issues still exist.\n\nOh yeah, and BlackMagic (DaVinci Resolve maker) today officially doesn't support their software on any AMD hardware.

It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..\n\n* Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things.\n* No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues.\n* I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality.\n* AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a \"We have this too guys look!!!\". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech.\n* Speaking of tech demos, features like \"AMD Link\" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as \"High quality\"? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently.\n* AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist.\n* The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of.\n* Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA.\n* The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it.\n* There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??\n\nIf these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",

Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment. \n\nSo yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",

Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are \"just\" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. \"It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?\" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.\n\nOn second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the \"proper\" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.\u00a0\n\n\nPoint being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?\u00a0\n\n\nThere is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.\u00a0\n\n\nSo what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?\u00a0\n\n\nMy own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.\u00a0",

AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.\n\nSo the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.\n\nBut if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it \"can\" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's \"Brilliance\".\n\nI brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either. So we can't expect them to do anything and spend the man hours to deliver fixes and work with the different projects (QEMU, Redhat, Spice, ...etc).",

The number of employees more than doubled and revenues more than tripled.  Whatever challenges and resource constraints AMD faced back then are not the same as today.\n\nThat's not to say they don't still have resource constraints and will be able to immediately fix every issue. It just means you cannot make extrapolations from an experience years ago with CPU/platform all the way to GPUs and accelerators today.  \n\nObviously there's no memo going around which says \"make the customer experience bad. signed, the management\"",

And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.\n\nDo I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.\n\nA prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.\n\nRecently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \\+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.\n\nNot only is this using a \"diagnostic\" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.\n\nI can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.\n\nThe issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",

As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.\n\nDoes ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif\n\nFrom the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.\n\n* **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**  \nIn  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today.\n* **What's the future of the project?**  \nWith  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",

This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.\n\nNvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards.

If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh. \n\nAnyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.\n\nAnd overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.\n\nAs a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they \"improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series\" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.\n\nI think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.\n\nJust sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here.

No, Radeon VII and other Vega products were killed off because they were very expensive to produce and they weren't moving enough units at any price to justify any further investment or even any meaningful support.\n\nEveryone paying attention called this when they revealed Vega, and even long before with the tragic marketing.  Insert the GIF of Raja partying at the AMD event, complete with cigar.\n\nPeople love coming up with theories as to what critical flaw or failure point caused a given generation of AMD GPUs to suck, and how those will be fixed in the next generation.  From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.\n\nIt's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.\n\nDoes AMD need to improve things?  Of course.

My motherboard (B650 Aorus Elite AX) can't run 4 sticks at 6000 MHz stable, and based on what the sales person told me, it seems this problem is common across all of AM5 (max with 4 dimms is like 5200 MHz?). But maybe that was only for the specific kit I originally had bundled with the motherboard and RAM which might have been more problematic due to being dual rank. I suppose if OP has single rank sticks they'd be fine?",

It's like how we all pretend it's magic that we can super undervolt AMD GPUs, and never question why it's so high to begin with, which is because someone out there is hitting the worst case silicon lottery.

The cheapest is usually the mec310 which is A tier, which is also the tier most cards are in. Nitro taichi etc. Are S tier they aren't practically much different. \nJust better hope for better bin and slightly lower noise. Also look cooler for the most part, except I personally like the Merc looks. \nThe overclocking ability of XT is very good so you can make your XT be faster than a XTX. But it is always advised to go with the larger model instead of a better version of a lower tier card. \n\nDon't think you will regret anything but unless the higher tier card is a certified bad for some reason it's is usually more advisable to get the best model you can get and don't spend money on Uber tier cards. I would think it's kinda obvious they aren't there for value.\n\nOnly the AMD reference model is kinda meh and not \"good\" aka B tier.",

What you really need to look for isn't size, but component quality, temperatures staying normal, and noise level. Also, some cards use different clocks and power levels.

I'd rather they not match Nvidia pricing.

Also, it's rather hilarious that people AND reviewers promote consoles, while Desktop cards are \"magically\" bad. No, that's not how it works. Consoles are using RDNA and Zen, just like Desktops. You can't be BOTH bad and good.

I did even see some with 4200 RAM (2100MHz IF) and higher, but that is very luck dependent.",

A long post, but had to get it right that Lian Li themselfs are not the reason RGB is popular again. its softwares like Signal RGB that allows you to controll, pc, mouse, keyboard and all other lighting addons you can think of, in cohesion with each other. I have the same colours schemes on my periphials as the PC :)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/lp9ohxe1y4sc1.gif",

RS-630\n      * Up to 103% average increase in performance across select titles  at 1440p resolution when AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) is ON and  upscaled with FidelityFX\u2122 Super Resolution 2 (FSR 2) at Quality Mode,  using AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition\u2122\ufe0f 24.1.1 on the Radeon\u2122 RX 7600XT  GPU, versus when AFMF and FSR 2 upscaling are OFF. RS-631\n   * AFMF preserves image quality by dynamically disabling frame generation during fast visual motion.\n* **AMD Video Upscaling** \u2013 Advanced video upscale algorithm to improve video playback image quality for AMD Radeon\u2122 RX 7000 desktop series GPUs. \t\n   * AMD Video Upscaling can be enabled within the Graphics tab to  enjoy improved sharpness and clarity, for DirectX 11 applications such  as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Media Player, with resolution  support up to 4K.\n   * For more instructions on how to enable upscaling, please ensure that your version of AMD Software is up to date, and learn more [**HERE**](https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/amd-software-24-1-1-amd-fluid-motion-frames-an-updated-ui-and/ba-p/656213)!\n* **Additional Video Improvements** \n   * Content Adaptive Machine Learning (CAML) text detection has been updated to support up to 4K gaming for even greater clarity.\n   * Various encoding support within AMD Software including AVC, HEVC  and AV1 codecs have undergone additional optimizations to improve video  encode quality.\n   * AMD continues to work with partners to implement video enhancements into 3rd party apps; more updates to follow in upcoming drivers.\n* **AMD Smart Technology Tab** \u2013 Access the suite of great A+A features from one convenient location to maximize the power of your AMD-powered system.\n* **AMD Assistant** \u2013 Automatically enable or disable AMD Software features based on various situations for improved performance or battery life.\n* **Additional OS Feature Support** \n   * Support for Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling has been  expanded to Radeon\u2122 RX 7600 series GPUs on Windows 11 version 22H2 and  newer. Click [HERE](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/hardware-accelerated-gpu-scheduling/) for more information.\n\n## What to Know\n\n* **AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF)** \n   * AFMF can be enabled for\u00a0**any**\u00a0DirectX\u00ae 11 and 12 title using HYPR-RX.  \t\t\n      * AFMF may introduce additional latency to\u00a0games and may not  offer the optimal experience for fast-paced competitive titles. AFMF is  recommended to be combined with AMD Radeon\u2122 Anti-Lag to reduce in-game  latency while maintaining a minimum in-game fps of 60.\n      * Due to the potential latency impact of AFMF, it must be manually  enabled in the per-game settings for certain fast-paced competitive  titles, even if AFMF was\u00a0already enabled globally. Gamers\u00a0are free to  enable AFMF in these titles based on their preference and gameplay  style, however, they may not experience optimal performance\u00a0\u2013  specifically at lower frame rates.\n      * AFMF may be enabled or disabled on the fly using the default hotkey of Alt-Shift-G.\n   * AFMF currently requires the game to be played in fullscreen mode with VSYNC disabled. \t\t\n      * For better compatibility with borderless-fullscreen titles, Windows 11 users can enable\u00a0[\"Optimizations for windowed games\"](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/optimizations-for-windowed-games-in-windows-11-3f006843-2c7e-4ed0-9a5e-f9389e535952).\n      * For a better visual experience, AFMF is recommended to be used with variable refresh rate enabled.\n   * Users can check AFMF\u2019s frame generation status using AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition\u2122\u2019s in-game overlay.\n   * AFMF adds frame generation technology to boost FPS outside the  game\u2019s engine. Users can use AMD Software Performance Metrics Overlay to  see the resulting FPS. \t\t\n      * Support for third-party performance monitoring tools is not available at this moment.\n   * For systems setup using Hybrid Graphics (such as laptops featuring  an integrated and discrete GPU), AFMF must be supported on the  displaying GPU to be activated.\n   * Stay tuned for future enhancements and innovations coming to  HYPR-RX with AFMF, focusing on elevating image quality, smoothness, and  latency. Enjoy gaming with HYPR-RX.\n   * **AMD Video Upscaling** \n   * AMD Video Upscaling can be enabled for most DirectX 11  applications to improve image quality. However, certain applications  such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge may require an additional step  to activate AMD Video Upscaling. \t\t\n      * For Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, 'Media Foundation for  Clear' must be enabled. This setting can be configured in the browser  settings accessed through chrome://flags/ or edge://flags/.\n   * Users have the flexibility to adjust the level of sharpness added  by AMD Video Upscaling using the slider located within the Graphics tab.\n* **AMD Technical Preview Driver** \n   * Users had the opportunity to get an early look of AFMF through  the AMD Technical Preview Drivers and provide their feedback to build  and refine the feature. The feedback received through our online  communities and\u00a0[AMD Bug Report Tool](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/amdbrt)\u00a0helped create a more stable experience for AFMF in AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 24.1.1.\u00a0\n   * Users looking for updates of future AMD Technical Preview Drivers can subscribe to our newsletter [HERE](https://www.amd.com/en/forms/sign-up/gaming-software-news.html).\n\n## Fixed Issues\n\n* Performance drop may be observed in some DirectML workloads.\n* Intermittent grey screen after driver upgrade with certain monitors (such as Nixeus NX-EDG274K) on Radeon\u2122 RX 7000 series GPUs.\n* Graphics API metric may show as N/A in certain UWP applications.\n* Heavy stuttering may be experienced while playing Warframe and loading into a new area or starting a mission.\n* Black artifacts may be observed in smoke effects while playing Call of Duty\u00ae: Modern Warfare\u00ae III.\n* Black texture flickering may be observed while playing Starfield on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon\u2122 RX 5600 XT.\n* Intermittent install failure may be observed when using the factory reset setting.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n* Deathloop may experience extended loading times on some AMD  Graphics Products, such as the Radeon\u2122 RX 6900 XT. \\[Resolution targeted  for 24.2.1\\]\n* Dead Space may experience an application crash after enabling RTAO on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon\u2122 RX 6800.\n* Excessive stuttering may be experienced when first playing a match in Overwatch 2. \\[Resolution targeted for 24.2.1\\]\n* Audio may intermittently become out of sync with the video when  recording from AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition using AV1 codec.  \\[Resolution targeted for Q2\\]\n* Oculus Rift S may display with a green tint on AMD Radeon\u2122 RX 7000 series GPUs.\n* After a system reboot, Parsec host application may experience a  crash on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon\u2122 RX 7900 XTX.  \\[Resolution targeted for 24.2.1\\]\n* During Microsoft Teams meetings, the camera may intermittently  display looped footage on some AMD Products, such as the AMD Ryzen\u2122 7  7840U Processor.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n* For users that game remotely with AMD Link, one important  announcement is that AMD is ending support for the AMD Link software. We  originally launched AMD Link at a time when there were few alternative  remote gaming solutions for Radeon graphics users. Today, there are many  options available for users to stream their PC content to other  devices. AMD\u2019s role is to enable and support developers, not compete  with them. As such, we are ending support for AMD Link and focusing our  resources on other core capabilities and features that benefit users. We  will also continue to support developers with our SDKs such as the [AMD Advanced Media Framework](https://gpuopen.com/advanced-media-framework/) that allow them to enable streaming functionality within their solutions.\n* For users who previously installed an AMD Software preview driver,  running AMD Cleanup Utility is recommended before installing this  driver.\n* AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 24.1.1 will now automatically clear  previously installed drivers located in the C:\\\\AMD folder to save  space.\n\n# ",

These were not game design issues like Dead  Space or Fallen Order. These were stutters in the menus, stutters in  loading screens, and ugly, terrible stutters during gameplay.\n\nI  tried 24.1.1 and it caused the same thing. I tested it in Lies of P,  Alan Wake 2, and Street Fighter 6. All had consistent stutter (in  gameplay and menus) that would make the games unplayable. Lies of P  actually worked great twice (randomly) but as soon as I switched to  another game, the stutters started back up. I tried going back to Lies  of P and the stutters were back.\n\nI  tried troubleshooting by toggling Hyper RX on, toggling features off,  playing with in game settings, checking windows settings. Nothing  worked.\n\nI then tried toggling SAM  in Adrenalin and suddenly all three games worked perfectly. NO MORE  STUTTER! The menus stopped stuttering, the game stopped stutter, the  loading screens stopped stuttering. I rebooted and the problems were  back. So I toggled SAM again, and the problems were completely gone. I  could even change settings on the fly. Clicked Hyper RX on and off while the games  were running and it wasn't freaking out. Worked like a champ, as it  should be.\n\nI feel like I have  minimal software on here, but maybe by toggling SAM it killed an app  running in the background that was creating the stutter issue or maybe  it woke something up in the card. I tried disabling all startup apps and  the stutter issue persisted. Toggling SAM fixed it. Maybe this method  toggled something in AMD's software or my card, IDK but at least I can  have stutter free game play now... didn't have to do this with 23.11.1  though...\n\n7900XTX.",

I guess it's bugged huh? **Edit:** **Found some interesting things!**\n\nAFMF doesn't work, AT ALL, if you have MSI afterburner / RTSS running. I used it for the overlay mostly and secondly setting my max fps to 150, but even setting it to 0 (unlimited) in RTSS didn't let AFMF work until I completely closed those two programs.\n\nCyberpunk was weird, I don't think it was a better experience.\n\nTLOU1 is weird too. Game only runs \"okay\" (for me) if I hard lock it to 60FPS, anything above that has hard judders like the characters are shaking, yes it's that weird. It did seem better though in this case, but the game even on 60fps still judders a little for me (significantly less than >60fps natively though) so that's still present a little. I would say it's an improvement and probably how I will play the game now.\n\nYou can't use AMD Chill with AFMF, I was curious to see if I could cap the maximum FPS this way so it's under my refresh range but nope. So I tried their old school method in the custom profiles FRTC and setting it to 60fps but it didn't work... until I enabled Enhanced sync? Weird! But this FIXED the game for me, kind of!\n\nI noticed with AFMF off, the game set to uncapped FPS but being limited by FRTC to 60fps.. literally ALL the problems I had with the game were gone. MSI/RTSS at 60 couldn't eliminate them, the game set to 60 couldn't, only AMD's FRTC at 60 actually did.\n\n...unfortunately, when I enable AFMF all those same problems come back again. Enhanced sync says it's still on and maybe it is or it isn't, but I guess AFMF also disables FRTC and that's the real problem that reintroduces these problems.\n\nSo in short, if anyone from AMD reads this. Please let AFMF respect FRTC / Enhanced Sync (Whichever is the problem, my guess is FRTC) so it can fix edge cases like this with games that refuse to get fixed properly.\n\n**EDIT 2: It got even weirder!**\n\nI noticed some weird ghosting in TLOU1 which led to me turning off FSR to try it, and that ghosting was still their so IDK but that judder from using a combination of FRTC, Enhanced sync & AFMF that was there before... was suddenly gone? It was being caused by FSR being turned on in the game? Now this is making me wonder about Cyberpunk...\n\nIt's harder to tell with Cyberpunk because the game already ran well, I think it might be slightly better without FSR?",

But this will get little adoption and most will say why bother when AMD only has at most 20% market share, and even lower for actually compatible GPUs.\n\nThe other option is AMD asks the anti-cheat devs to whitelist their anti-lag+ \"tampering\" using some secure method. They'll probably say no as it's a potential backdoor, and even this would have little adoption due to poor market share.",

It seems to be something related to shader cache, but before when I updated drivers it was not so intrusive. Fortunately, as you play the stutter disappears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2: Works the same as before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRE4R: Very severe stuttering in the first run, but it eventually goes away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlan Wake 2 at the moment is the only one where the stuttering problem is more severe, in the second run it definitely improves, but it is not as stable as with the 23.11.1 drivers. There are often \"spikes\" in frame times resulting in a choppy experience. It also reduces as you play longer, but with previous drivers it was a much more solid experience even on the first run.",

I'm going to keep it on in the emulators I can use it on, upscaling games that natively hit 60fps to 120fps actually is amazing to see. I had issues with frame drops playing Red Dead Redemption on Xenia but using AFMF it smooths out the drops so well I don't even notice the fps dipping below 60 in towns.\n\nI do hope AMD reenables Vulkan support for AFMF as now most of the emulators I was using it on just do not support DX11/12 which is odd to me considering Vulkan is an AMD thing? lol",

Whilst in the cyberpunk game, press alt+r to bring up the AMD overlay settings, go to the cyberpunk game and switch afmf on, make sure vsync is turned off, you should see a green tick under afmf to show that it is on. But Same, in most of your cases regarding the Mod. I'm using 7800xt. The game also crashes when switching tabs. There is also ghosting with the mod. It's tolerable though.  I know it is the mod because when I disable it, the ghosting is gone. Even with afmf by itself I don't get ghosting. Also I have to disable upscaling in the settings, then restart the game to make sure the mod is turned off. I mainly use it just to give me an idea of how fsr3 will feel as opposed to visuals, because I know this will not be an issue with the proper optimised release of fsr3. Feeling wise, it feels good, ray tracing is no longer an issue for AMD imo , mainly speaking on the 7000 series. I was considering buying the 4070 ti super or even the 4080 super just for another option if I wanted to play with ray tracing on, but I don't see a reason anymore. Fsr3 frame generation is literally a game changer for AMD. Using the unoptimized mod gets me 80-100 FPS consistently at 1440p ultra settings, psycho ray tracing, so I'll just wait for fsr3 to be implemented in these games. Hopefully, AMD also brings back anti lag+, as that would make path tracing experience a little more easier. I think AMD could literally steal the show with just driver updates until the release of their next gen GPUs. The supers are a big L, so far.",

Seeing how most games only have 1-2 RT effects available with the max I've ever seen being 3 (and even then Portal RTX has really bad RT effects to the point where disabling some of them will actually improve the quality of your graphics, and control has been optimised to such an extent that even my 2070 mobile can handle all the RT effects at 720p/1080dlss).\n\nAnd now that I'm experimenting with FSR2.2 as some games either don't support dlss or dlss won't let me use the settings I want, I'm no longer on the dlss hype-train as FSR2.2 gives you a much crispier image with significantly less noise and TAA artefacts (sure the image is a little unstable, but at least things don't turn invisible when they're moving around, and at least I don't get after-images of anything that doesn't turn invisible).\n\nSo far the only genuine downside to AMD I've \"seen\" is the input lag, however every single input lag test I've seen of the nee tech also uses fluid-motion frames simultaneously, which makes me think reviewers are actively trying to bork AMD's results in order to give Nvidia buyers a gratifying reason to justify their overpriced cards.\n\nI honestly would like to see an RT comparison between an AMD RX7000 series card and the Nvidia card that's the same price as it (even if it's a \"lower level\" Nvidia card, cause at this point the performance tier of the card doesn't matter when prices are this insane), as I have a sneaking suspicion that AMD will match their RT performance, or compensate for any RT fps loss with a rasterisation fps gain.",

But I do have a 4090 that was, for me, something more of bragging rights at the time . Although I am building my kids' comps now, and theirs will be amd up down left right and center \n\nI commented because in the years prior every computer I have ever owned that I had any success with has an AMD CPU . Ever since the amd athalon cpus came out . Since the fixed 1.8 ghz system, which was my first . They are workhorses.  I see Intel guys underclocking their 13900ks and 14 series because 3 360mm cooling fans aren't enough on their radiator . (To me this is ridiculous for .2ghz increase in turbo speed . Nvm the fact amd has better singe thread performance anyways)\n\nMy arctic air two 120mm radiator barely spins with my cpu.  39 degrees at idle . Never reaches above 70.",

I hope AMD can improves those productivity applications where having hardware accelerated raytracing can greatly benefit their performance.",

Basically, instead of \"thermal throttling\" Ryzen GPUs \"thermally over-clocks\" automatically if there is thermal headroom. And at 75C there is no headroom. \n\nAlso I am sure acoustically there is a difference as well, there isn't really any speculation here - it is fact that say 360mm AiO has higher thermal capacity than even best air cooler. Higher mass and higher surface area can dissipate more heat and one does not need to be genius to understand that more heat dissipation = equal better.\n\nI would point out that your testing \"methodology\" has one big shortfall - open standing motherboard. Basically, it does not reasonably represent heat soaking of the close case, unless you planning to keep the motherboard \"open standing\". \n\nBesides - again just simply load testing CPU you are not getting full picture. Okey so you have CPU at 100% load in synthetic application, this proves that your system not going to overheat an shut down... good result, but that is bare minimum. It doesn't prove that processor achieves same boost clocks and same computing power running at 75C... which is high, even ignoring the above fact that you not exactly running realistic test of motherboard in closed case.",

It's what the manufacturer expects to be the required dissipation capacity for the model.\n\nThe reason the 7800x3d is rated for 120w TDP is because of the 3d V-cache layer that sits between the cores and the IHS, and also because the IHS on the 7XXX series is thicker to accommodate older coolers.\n\nThe chip draws up to \\~85W or whatever it is, but AMD recommends a cooler that cools 120w TDP or more to \"keep up\" with the extra \"distance\" that the die has to the cooler itself.\n\nIt works the same in reverse. If we de-lid, we get lower temps because there is less material for the heat to be dissipated through, we get a more efficient cooling system, and can thus get away with using a worse performing cooler. In other words, we have lowered the TDP.",

CPU's have an IHS so it's not as big of a deal but should still be nice.\n\nOn my 5700XT, I repasted it damn near a dozen times with different pastes, including NT-H1, but every time after a month or two my hotspot temps would shoot back up. Stock settings we're talking going from high 80's or low 90's hot spot under load, to low-mid 100's, after a month. Still within spec technically but not comfortable. My card is seemingly the GOAT of pumping out pastes lol.\n\nWith PTM, I put it on a few months ago now and my hot spots are the same as when I put it on if not lower, in the mid 80's depending on the ambient temp and shit. With the undervolt I normally run, I can set my fans to not go over 30% and the hotspot barely touches 90 unless it's hot out.\n\nI seriously don't think I'll be using another GPU without PTM7950 on it, it has made my experience so much more consistent lol.",

            "text": "I run lots of benchmarks, capture stats on games, etc., and decided to see what 24H2 might do for my 7800X3D/7900XTX/X670E system. All results are based on the most recent runs on 23H2, and on 24H2 runs today (August 26, 2024) using the preview release. The BIOS settings, Adrenaline version/settings, system software, etc. are all the same, the only difference being the OS version. Most benchmarks were run/captured once, so this is not exhaustive or scientific.\n\nResults:\n\n|Benchmark|23H2|24H2|Change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Geekbench 6 Single|2389|2660|11.5%|\n|Geekbench 6 Multi|14104|14824|5.1%|\n|Cinebench 24 Single|97|115|18.5%|\n|Cinebench 24 Multi|1018|1061|4.2%|\n|Time Spy (CPU)|12239|12990|6.1%|\n|BM: W bench FPS|96.6|113.6|17.6%|\n|BM: W bench 1%|83.4|98.2|17.7%|\n|Fortnite FPS|193.9|248.6|28.2%|\n|Fortnite 1%|138.2|195.8|41.7%|\n\nNotes:\n\n* BM: W is Black Myth: Wukong. This is the benchmark version at 2560x1440 Cinematic, RT off. Stats are captured at the section starting after going over the fallen tree.\n* Fortnite uses in-game captures at 2560x1440 using DX12, with Frame Rate Limit off and Vsync off. All settings Epic except for Medium Shadows. TSR is Medium with Native resolution, 100% 3D Resolution, Dynamic 3D Resolution off, Nanite Virtualized Geometry off, Global Illumination off, Reflections off, etc.\n* Captures and stats are from CapFrameX with 60 second captures.\n* Other software running in the background includes HWiNFO64, Chrome, Razer Synapse, Adrenaline, OpenRGB, and any necessary launchers such as Steam or Epic Games. \n* Power Plans is Balanced and set to Best Performance.\n* Benchmarks are run in normal mode, not as Admin, special Admin, etc.\n* System is a ASRock X670E Taichi, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, ASRock PG 7900XTX, 32GB Team Group 6000CL30 with EXPO  (30-36-36-76-112), 2TB WD SN850X, 420mm Arctic LFII AIO, etc.\n\nMore official testing is needed, but I'm impressed with what I've seen so far. I was not expecting to see such gains in the games, and at least on my system, single core performance is much better. It's not often a performance boost like this comes along with so little effort, and I can only wonder why this wasn't discovered and released sooner.\n\n",

Based on suggestions for testing from folks here, I was updating 23H2 yesterday, DDUing, etc., trying to ensure both were as close as possible. When running various tests I was getting almost identical results on both, which was baffling given the earlier results. My first thought was that in fact my 23H2 had been \"fixed\" during the updates, and that the only gains on 24H2 had been due to it being a fresh install.\n\nBut after looking at other results, I was confused as to how 23H2 was outperforming almost everything from before, and I began to suspect something must be going on. I reverted back to the non-preview version of 23H2, and the results were more in-line with what I expected. I had a serious WTF moment, and it was at around that time the Reddit posts, YT videos, etc. announcing the backport to 23H2 began to break. On one hand I was a bit miffed at the effort spent trying to confirm the results, but on the other I was happy that it was being fast-tracked.\n\nI'm now updating to 23H2 cumulative preview again, and will likely not bother with 24H2 again. Thanks to all for the suggestions on clean installs, etc. It's great that Microsoft & AMD are working to get this into the hands of more folks.",

First thing to look for is DX11 or older rendering engine.  While there is a multi-threaded mode for DX11 it's seldom ever used and it's not very easy to work with nor very good.  Older Nvidia drivers actually used to use some secret sauce diverting some draw calls to a second core at the driver level, but this was removed around 2~3 years ago or so in favor of DX12/Vulkan rendering performance improvements.\nCities Skylines 1 and 2, FALLOUT 4 (especially with scrap mods disabled pre-combines, this spikes draw calls like nuts, causing performance issues down-town, near heavily-modded built-up settlements, and at the Corvega factory mostly on the roof), early versions of MS Flight Sim... etc.  There's others, but if you see DirectX11 on a recent game - or often the Unity engine itself - expect SLOW.  Use DX12 or Vulkan to avoid this issue or lessen it to a point as well as the engine is coded on the render back-end.\nIf you're dead-set on running a DX11 or older single-threaded render-engine type game, the best thing you can do is jack up performance on a single core as high as it can go - ghz is your friend but AMD ghz speed is not the same as the Intel ghz speed, and ghz speed is not equal between differing processor generations in most cases (barring renames/refreshes which don't really improve things).\nRender-engine wrappers (think glide wrappers in the 90's or early 00's) don't help things.",

Wish I had a 7800x3D/7900x3D or 7950x3D / or even 9950x/9900x in it's place, but those cost money and this 5 years old AM4 system does just fine (aside of the heat now and then, but there's a 3090 in here too, and it also throws a TON of heat if you make it do RTx).\nTo keep the same 16 cores and 64gb RAM I'd have to spend at-least 1000$ and not about to do that.\nSo lowering TDP will mean higher clocks within said TDP restrains of a smaller case thus better performance, and in my case a toasty environment sometimes; so both instances benefit, and we're far from alone.\nAMD is more guilty of throwing an X on the end when there should NOT have been one, but the BIOS update with the TDP increase to 105w for the lesser parts will help things to the tune of 10~12%.\nAMD is making this 105w option mode available to system integraters and motherboard vendors should they want to feature it, MSI for one has already released this option for their BIOS through a BIOS update on their website.",

ACC's physics run on complex lookup tables, and when it comes to performance gains from v-cache, ACC is almost always at or near the top of the stack, likely due to those lookup tables residing entirely in L3. The game absolutely loves v-cache, and yet, ACC is also one of the few games where Zen5 has a significant lead over all the non-X3D chips, even managing to eek ahead of the 5800X3D, and does a good job closing the gap to 7000X3D chips.\n\nHowever, while there are other games which respond very well to v-cache, Zen5 doesn't always have results in them like it does in ACC, which I think is fair reason to suspect that an L3 occupancy issue is the bottleneck.",

Some of the core-to-core numbers are so poor that it's approaching dual socket systems, which doesn't make ANY sense, and it's hard to imagine anything that could produce numbers like that in a single socket other than if the cores are being forced to share data in DRAM instead of L3.\n\nHere's the tests for Linux vs. Windows.: [https://www.phoronix.com/review/ryzen-9950x-windows11-ubuntu](https://www.phoronix.com/review/ryzen-9950x-windows11-ubuntu)\n\nThere is a trend that Zen5 has a larger uplift in Linux than Zen4 does in many scenarios, and abnormal performance results in the Windows vs. Linux testing. This could be caused by whatever is slowing Ryzen down in Windows builds prior to 24H2, but another explanation could be that Linux simply has less background noise occupying L3, as it's pretty well established that the Linux kernel has less bloat and is better at managing resources. I also find it interesting that these large discrepancies were measured in Ubuntu, which almost always falls behind the performance in lighter Fedora and Arch based distros, often putting Ubuntu near parity with Windows.\n\nAs for the increase in cache misses versus Zen4, that comes from Wendell's (Level1techs on YouTube) Zen 5 review. While cache misses don't tell you anything on their own, when correlated with the impossibly bad core-to-core latency and the aberrations in the Linux results, it starts to paint a picture of a bottleneck and hints that it may be L3 occupancy related.",

Even if the performance return was not doubled, the performance gain could at worst only be 30-40% but in the best cases we saw gains of up to 90%.

Its mind boggling to me that this isnt an issue on Nvidia but only on AMD. Mind you I came from a 3060ti and I never once saw these compilation stutters in any game, not even Warframe after the first launch or playthrough, my quesiton is what is going on with AMD cards that makes the shader compilation process freeze up the game in such a dramatic manner, I googled this and its very common. \n\nThis isnt a tech support thread so plz dont delete admins, I am just pointing out that this is something that should not be a thing in 2023.

AMD came out with Mantle API so that game devs / engine makers could do more things low-level and really fine tune compared to DX11 & OpenGL which relied more on the hardware vendors to optimize per game for their hardware on a case by case bases. Mantle showed the success not only for AMD but also Nvidia, and that then encouraged the development of Vulkan and DX12 which also are low level API's with the former I think taking a lot of the code from Mantle. Fast forward and Vulkan and DX12 are well established API's. AMD now decides to optimize their DX11 and older DX api's by turning those calls into DX12 calls and doing shader compilations (something DX12 & Vulkan do - sacrifice low performance at the start while optimizing hardware at first runtime for ideal optimization after).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what we may be seeing is games that weren't built with DX12 but instead older API's now having shader compilation happen and happening without having the code in place to compile at game loadup menu, etc... So your 1 or few matches have stutter until everything is compiled. Just my hunch.",

This can often be seen as micro stutter. \n\nShader Compilation stutters go away usually after a few hours of playing a game, as shaders are compiled either beforehand, or in a just-in-time manner. Shader compilation stutter can be 100% eliminated by the developer, so if what you are seeing is indeed related to shader compilation, than you should raise this as an issue to the developers instead.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the 6900 XT is much more powerful GPU than the 3060 Ti, meaning it should deliver a much higher base framerate. A single stutter of roughly 150ms will be much more jarring when encountered on a higher base framerate, then when encountered at a lower framerate. You might have had stutters lasting about the same time, but it's much much more jarring now, because performance is generally much higher, so it feels worse.\n\nMicro stutters are most often caused by cache misses. AMD cards usually have a bit more cache than an equivalent Nvidia card, but the Nvidia cards are usually using faster memory. More cache can more than offset  slower VRAM, but even L3 cache is quite small in capacity. If the requested data is not cache, it needs to fetched from memory, and in that case, both latency and bandwidth can be important, but I suspect that in most cases, latency is the more important factor, as the memory controller will be hard pressed to interleave an unforeseen memory operation effectively. \n\nYou mentioned that once you load into a mission the first time, it stuttered, and then when loading into it the second time, it was smooth. Does that happen every time, or was that just a single scenario, perhaps after installing the card?\n\nIf the stutter is consistent, you can try disabling DXNavi, as others have suggested. If that still doesn't fix the issue, perhaps you could open a support ticket to AMD and/or the game's developers. Both should ask for at least a DXdiag report.",

It switches texture format for some games that use not optimal ones, according to AMD. This option causes hitches on older games, Dying Light 2 is, however, very much affected.\n\nI had a 5600 XT before swapping it out for 2070S, then I had a 3080 and finally a 6950 XT. My experience with the 6950 XT has been rather flawless.\n\nI recommend everyone to always opt for the driver only or the minimal install solutions. It's very good that we have so many options in our drivers' control panel, but all those options can mess things up.

The average FPS won't be all that impressive, probably averaging 90-100 FPS depending on your resolution/track/amount of cars, albeit it will still be more than playable and very smooth.\n2. Close Wreckfest, enable SAM, relaunch Wreckfest and jump into a race. You'll notice your FPS has nearly *tripled.* On some tracks I can go from 70-90 FPS to 450+ FPS. If I make myself CPU limited at 720P, I can go from 250-300 FPS with SAM disabled, to well over 1100 FPS with SAM enabled. It's hilarious, and you really don't want to play Wreckfest with SAM off.\n3. Now, keep SAM enabled and start up Baldurs Gate 3. Load up a save game and just start spinning the camera around quickly, just run around like normal, or start a dialogue. You'll notice awful frame pacing issues, with spikes to 80-180ms, and very noticeable stutters.\n4. Close BG3, disable SAM. Load up a save game and repeat the above. The frame pacing will be excellent, very consistent and smooth, and the stutters will be completely gone. You really don't want to play BG3 with SAM on.\n\nBoth scenarios are 100% easily reproducible in any order you'd like to see it happen. SAM takes one game from performing acceptably to beyond excellently, but makes another game run like complete garbage.",

DX11 is stuttery mess and DX12 kinda works, but have some issues. So did the .dll switch accordingly to [this](https://nimez-dxswitch.pages.dev/NzDXSwitch) table and tried with DX11. On same map 0.1% lows were about the same level as max fps without the fix. GPU load was pretty much maxed the whole time whereas without the fix it fluctuated like crazy. Night and day difference basically. There are definitely some issues with those DirectX 11 optimizations on some games with 6000-series.\n\nAs per usual when poking with registry saved settings into file before beginning.\n\nThanks!",

Meanwhile, Nvidia GPUs have better QC across the board, and Nvidia is famous for not letting AIBs mess around too much nowadays. AMD's top trusted brand is Sapphire without a doubt.

AMD used to have a control panel option for forced shader caching, and IDK if reg edit still can force it. Steam is also responsible for some shader caching, and perhaps it's just not available yet. Unreal Engine is also notorious for bad shader cache optimization.\n\nThis isn't an AMD problem. Many people on AMD gpus do not have this issue, likely because long term use has already cached shaders, steam has it available to distribute, etc. The issue is specifically caused from switching to a NEW AMD GPU, which has no cache. \n\nThe stuttering WILL GO AWAY after you use the card. Playing the game for 10 minutes is NOT representative of playing for multiple hours. This complaint is ultimately a massive Nvidia Troll, whether deliberate or naive. \n\nIf this was a REAL problem, it would be pointed out by Gamers Nexus, Hardware Unboxed, and every other tech channel, but they don't, so it's not.

Games and everything worked fine still, but I adrenaline wouldn't start. I figured out finally that it was the same reason that everyone was having corrupt windows installs after updating drivers. Windows was downloading and overwriting the drivers I installed with whatever incompatible version it was using. Disabling Windows' automatic install of drivers and then a driver re-install fixed it. I have no idea why only AMD has this problem, and neither do they apparently.",

Any time there's a problem, the complainers are the main group being vocal. Participating in a circle jerk echo chamber doesn't make the problem AMD's drivers, because this clearly isn't affecting everyone, and it's not the majority. AMD could be just as clueless to the cause, and are depending on bug reports to address it. It doesn't help when complainers don't file bug reports either.\n\nAs for the CPUs, we all know Ryzen wasn't a \"good\" gaming CPU until 3, and Intel has a similar issue where they removed some hardware function to the chipset and increased latency with the 12+ series, and there's videos of people downgrading Intel specifically for this reason. Not that I think any of this is related, unless it's a scheduling bug. Which there are known issues for upgrading a CPU while keeping the same install of windows, like the CPU config being stuck on the old mode on a new CPU.\n\nThe problem could also be a Microsoft issue, because Linux doesn't do this, but complainers aren't really interested in finding the real problem so we don't know what's causing it.",

Looking at new laptops there are several brand new, readily available AMD based laptops on the market. I'm also not talking about the crappy AMD A-series mobile CPUs, there are a ton of laptops with Zen CPUs on the market now. Pre-built desktops are also adopting AMD CPUs much more than previously. \n\nIt helps when there was a lawsuit against Intel when it was found that they were paying off OEM's to only use their CPUs. \n\nThankfully that just means more competition in the industry and that's good.",

They're embellished consumer-grade products that lack the professional features needed for their intended use. I'm returning a PA32DC tomorow and will never buy a ProArt monitor or any HDR grading monitor from Asus ever again.\n\nIn your case you have three choices:\n\n1. You keep the current hardware and plow through the lacking features until it's time for a serious upgrade.\n2. You sell all that nonsense and buy a M3 Macbook Pro or a Mac Studio. Unless you plan to work with 6K or 8K RAW footage from RED or Arri there's nothing an Apple Silicon machine won't do better than any Windows desktop build.\n3. You do the same as I did and make a Threadripper 7960X + Gigabyte TRX50 Aero D build. That motherboard is literally catered to serve our use case, nothing more nothing less.\n\nTo also answer your question: no, you're not a pro yet.  \nReason isn't the hardware's quality level but rather the fact a professional would've picked either no. 2 or 3 on the list above, without stumbling into issues first.  \nRemind yourself that the value within content creation is not the machines or brands behind them, but rather the ability of the creator and his own creativity. Whatever takes time and efforts away from that hinders your work more than you can afford. Moreover, clients and viewers will base their opinions on the end result and won't give a damn about what hardware you used to achieve it.  \nI also am specifically tired of doing constant initial researches on products, researches on where and how to get these products, researches on how to make these products work, and so on. You do that too long you forget what you wanted to do in the first place, which is to make art. That can sometimes require more than one can give already on its own, so this whole hardware deal is driving me crazy. Hopefully this can avoid that part for you.\n\nBottom line is: it is not the car, it's the driver.",
