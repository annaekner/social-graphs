            "text": "My (31M) wife (32F) and I are in a healthy and happy relationship. That said, we\u2019ve been together since high school, so we both feel that we missed out a little by being each others\u2019 only sexual experiences. We\u2019ve talked about this at length and decided a few years ago that we\u2019re ok with having a few hall passes in our relationship, since we very much intend to stay together the rest of our lives and don\u2019t want any resentment over missed possibilites. Plus it\u2019s pretty rare that we could even find such an opportunity, as it\u2019s a little hard to find hookups when you\u2019re in a committed marriage and don\u2019t go out much. We even gave each other advance approval in case a situation arises, so long as we\u2019re safe about it and tell each other immediately afterward. We\u2019ve both used one HP, each with someone we knew well enough but would never see again, and no issues came out of it. In fact, it\u2019s only made us more secure in our relationship and how much we genuinely appreciate being with each other.\n\nRecently, I had to travel to London for work. I don\u2019t normally get to travel for work, so I decided to make a trip out of it and spend a few extra days of my own time in the city after the project was done. My wife couldn\u2019t join because she didn\u2019t have any vacation time left but was very supportive of me taking some time to explore since I\u2019ve never been to London and she has. Being cheap, and being a pretty outgoing guy when I\u2019m so inclined, I decided to stay in a hostel. I was interested in meeting other travelers since I didn\u2019t know anyone in the city and love being sociable with new people. I chatted with several of the people staying there, and in particular a very attractive French girl (mid-20\u2019s) who dressed super goth.\n\nFor context, I love the goth girl look. I\u2019ve been sucked into the goth gf propaganda online, much to the annoyance of my wife. It isn\u2019t her style, but she has been nice enough to cater to me by putting on a sexy goth outfit on occasion, since she\u2019s knows it\u2019s a huge fantasy of mine. Still, I pester her constantly to be more goth because I enjoy it so much. \n\nAnyway, I ended up spending a little bit of time with goth French baddie - we both went to the hostel\u2019s happy hour event and hit it off there. I found out that she was recently single and was in London for an art show. It turned out we were both into emo music, and we talked about our favorite bands. I had the thought that she was acting a bit flirty towards me, but didn\u2019t think too much of it, until I later found myself sharing a sink with her in the hostel bathroom. \n\nThe hostel was co-ed, so each floor had a small shared bathroom with a communal sink, and a door that was meant to be kept open but which people frequently closed for the sake of having more privacy than just a stall to shower in. So I\u2019m brushing my teeth while chatting up the real-life version of Shadowheart (who, mind you, is wearing an extremely low cut top), when she suddenly closes the bathroom door behind us. In my mind, my wildest fantasy is about to come true. It\u2019s even more exciting because of the adrenaline rush of being in a semi-public setting, and a girl being so into me that she would make such a bold move. I can\u2019t believe this is actually happening to me. I instantly get hard. Then she turns around and asks \u201cAre you interested in learning about our lord and savior Jesus Christ?\u201d\n\nShe had me cornered for 10 minutes trying to talk me into salvation, while I grew increasingly despondent and immensely disappointed, with the whiplash of going from what could\u2019ve been one of the crowning moments of my life, to pure and utter dejection.\n\nWhen I told my wife this story, she laughed for a solid hour. She said it\u2019s karma for annoying her about wanting a goth gf. \n\nTL;DR life dream was to bang a hot goth girl. Thought I was getting the opportunity, but got cockblocked by Jesus Christ. god is real and he hates me.\n",

I did not at the time (I was with the same person for 25 years, get off my back lol). So I get connected to a BBC reporter! She's very cute, tells me I'm funny and she can't wait for me to fly on over to London....where we can get married in order to do the laundry list of unchristian things she's talked about for weeks! And of course join her church. And you know what? In a moment of absolute horniness I found myself looking up flights! Thankfully the rather large numbers in front of me settled my teakettle. It did not, in fact, work out.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I would like to take the time to apologize to any other very nice Nigerians meet Nigerians members who ALSO were unaware that their data was being collected. Because she had no idea and was QUITE offended her profile was on some ..rather unfortunate dating sites.",

I'd win the race, and I'd say things like \"you've got to talk like Wario for the next race,\" or \"I get to borrow your DVD's,\" most of which was wildly amusing and diabolical for me to ask of her.\n\nBut the thing about it is that I kept winning, and being the dope I was, I thought I was on a hot streak getting all this free stuff from her and I played it up like I was some kind of pompous court jester gallivanting across the courtyard.\n\nEvery now and again, she'd put the same offer back on the table, and I'd keep winning, and she would make her frustration known the more she kept losing races in Mario Kart.\n\nAnd it didn't help that I'd brag about my victories within our circle of friends, celebrating with invisible trophies and spraying imaginary champagne.\n\nIt wouldn't be until we were older and grown apart that she would disclose to me that she was a little upset by the whole thing, because she would practice playing Mario Kart for HOURS before racing against me in the hopes of winning.\n\nAnd the reason she wanted to win was because she found me to be handsome and didn't know how to initiate this attraction she had.\n\nThe whole time, she was hoping that I would ask for a kiss from her whenever I would win, but me being the dumbass I was kept asking to borrow her Linkin Park albums and to draw buff kittens with sleeve tattoos.\n\nSo not only did I miss my shot with my friend, I also broke her heart every time I would clench victory from her on the final lap, performing the miracle last second overtake monouver or cackling like a cartoon villain whenever the spiky blue shell of doom would nuke her dreams.\n\nTL;DR My female friend wanted to win a game of Mario Kart against me so she could kiss me but never won, and I kept winning and asking for anything except physical intimacy.",

Because of how society has framed gender roles in the last... always, women are taught that they must be the passive receivers of affection and men must be the proactive purveyors of affection. It creates a twisted dichotomy in the minds of young girls (which they may later carry on to adulthood) where they don't want to make the first move, but want to send a signal to the guy they like that he should make the first move. \n\nIf the guy they like is interested and their moves are overt enough, then nothing wrong. But if he's not interested, or she's too subtle, then he won't ever make a move on her, leaving her in a frustrated state of limbo where she can't get him to notice her but is too afraid to make an overt advance because that's just \"not how it's done.\"\n\nAt the same time, men are taught that they must pursue, and are thus looking for signals everywhere. So if THEY are interested in a woman, they will read into her actions with far more scrutiny than they do with other women, and convince themselves that common courtesy and niceness are the \"signals\" she's sending because she likes him back, and then make a move, and get shot down. Happens all the time, because men aren't mind readers.\n\nIn summary, the gender roles we've ascribed to men and women about how they are supposed to behave in a male/female relationship/courtship can lead to complicated and frustrating behaviors in youth that can lead both parties to get frustrated and feel like the other one \"just doesn't get it!\"",

Flirting is all about a slow escalation of sexual advances where the first is shrouded in plausible deniability, and each subsequent response becomes less so.  By calling attention to her flirting without expressing his own desire, he shows that he's in on the game (decreasing plausible deniability) while still not technically admitting to his own interests (not dropping all pretence).  \n\nIf she didn't want him that way, she would respond something like \"oh god, it does sounds like that doesn't it?\" or \"lol no, I just wanted to make the game more interesting\", and that ends the situation without either party being embarrassed.  If she says anything positive like \"what if I am\" or \"could be\", then he can again respond with something like \"well if you are, then I'd say you're a beautiful woman and I'd be a fool not to kiss you\".  Again, both responses still technically hidden behind hypotheticals, but you can be far more certain now.  A final statement like \"fine, if you win I'll kiss you\" and then half sandbagging the game would absolutely be warranted.  That way, she can't really be upset about you asking for it, since she encouraged the conversation, and then by only half throwing the game she has the option to back out by throwing harder.",

Then you suddenly turn around and start asking where the grandchildren are. By the time I finally turned 18, my self-esteem was shot, I had trauma from failed relationships, and the beginnings of a drug problem. But I definitely learned my lesson. I no longer have sex or let anyone find out that I'm attracted to them unless they're a close friend and I know there's no chance of a relationship. The upbringing worked.\n\nSorry to rant, but I've been thinking a lot about formative years lately, both in terms of gender segregation, and the constant lack of sleep from early school start times. After learning in rehab how much lack of sleep can affect your mental health and everything else, I can't help but thinking that we're seeing problems that are so widespread we can't recognize them or identify the source.",

            "text": "So I'm absolutely fucking obsessed with the Fruit Adventure flavor of Tic-Tacs. The flavor combined with the soft *smush* they make between your teeth when you chew them makes my brain very happy. I've been buying them in bulk, where each container has 200 candies each, and they come in bulk packs of 12 containers. I tend to eat them by the handful while I'm working or gaming, so in a day I can easily slam through 1-2 containers. \n\nNow keep in mind that on the nutrition label, it says the serving size is 1 candy, and is listed as having 0 calories, which I thought was awesome because I could have as many as I want! \n\nOver the past year, I found that I gained about 40lbs, and nothing about my eating habits had changed as far as I was aware. I told my doctor about it and she was a bit worried, so she had me do a bunch of bloodwork to see if there was a reason why I gained so much weight in a short period of time. Everything came back normal. She referred me to see a weight loss doctor who would also have me see a dietician. \n\nI had been working with the dietician for a few months now, and we have me keep a food log. I had a virtual visit with her today and during it, I was fiddling around with an empty container to keep my hands busy. She saw it and asked where I got such a large container from, so I told her about it and how I eat 1-2 of those per day. She asked why those weren't on my food tracker and I said it was because they're 0 calories so they wouldn't count. \n\nApparently I was very, very wrong about this. She explained to me that food companies can label something as being \"0 calories\" if the food's serving size contains 5 or less calories. In reality, each individual Tic-Tac actully has about 2 calories. So essentially, since each container has 200 pieces and I typically have 1-2 of those, I've been eating 400-800+ calories *per day* of Tic-Tacs, in addition to all the other food I've been eating - which is very likely why I've gained so much weight. \n\nTL;DR: Didn't realize that tic-tacs weren't actually 0 calories and gained a ton of weight because I eat so many a day. \n\nEdit: Just wanted to clarify that I'm aware that sugar will in fact make you gain weight (I'm not *that* stupid), but I never actually read the product ingredients. I assumed they must have been made with something like Xylitol or some other artificial sweetener to make them \"0 calories\" so it never crossed my mind to check!\n\nEdit 2: Dang y'all are brutal lmao. But at least some good came out of it since apparently, like me, a lot of people didn't realize about the \"less than 5 calories per serving\" rule can legally be classified as 0 in the US. Personally I wish we could have the model they do in other countries where they list calories per X amount of grams. \n\nEdit 3: MY TEETH ARE FINE \ud83d\ude02 I actually just had a dentist appointment two weeks ago. No cavities or decay, gums are healthy. Despite my candy habit I do take good care of my teeth!",

He was buying low calorie bread, but never compared the calories to regular bread. Just assumed it was much, much less. Instead of serving her 2 slices of regular bread each morning (190 calories) he was serving her 4 slices of lower calorie bread (240 calories - slathered with \"zero calorie\" butter spray, of course).",

She works at a very large and popular wholesale store that has hotdogs. She told me beforehand that I could come see her at work any time and there would be no trouble. \n\nI walked in the front door and walked past the card-checker girl. She did a double-take and asked if I work there. I replied  \u201cno, I do not. I am here to see an employee, however. I\u2019m looking for \u2014\u2014\u2014 in \u2014\u2014\u2014.\u201d\n\nShe sheepishly got her radio and said, \u201cmanagement to front entrance; non-emergency\u201d\n\nA manager with the largest tablet I\u2019ve ever seen strapped to her arm walked up and I explained again why I was there. She called for my GF on the radio but she was not near her radio. I apparently kicked the hornet\u2019s nest and I could hear chatter on other employee\u2019s radios. \n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that guy here to see \u2014\u2014\u2014-?\u201c\n\n\u201cAre we being audited? He looks important\u201d\n\n\u201cGUYS, LOOK BUSY\u201d \n\nI caught glances from just about every worker nearby and I could feel them trying to figure me out\n\nIt was at this time my GF got back to her radio and heard the commotion and stepped out of her office and made eye contact with me. She wrapped up her work and we went out to lunch finally. I asked her why there was such a ruckus. She said that I dress nicely and I\u2019m very polite which are characteristics of a corporate rep who comes in to fire people. That\u2019s when she also admitted to me that I sometimes have asshole resting face. I guess I need to smile more. \n\nTLDR: I surprised my GF at work and her coworkers thought I was there to perform an audit or fire somebody. ",

That kind of stuff.    \n\nI had worked there for just about forever and had known him for over a decade and we were work friends.   Every time he would come into town he would let me know and we would meet up for breakfast/lunch to catch up on life, kids, whatever.    \n\nWhenever he was coming in to fire someone he always wore a salmon-colored tie.  It was pretty obvious after a decade of people seeing him come into the building and people leave and him wearing his tie that it was his firing tie.  We had talked about it at lunch one time and he said it just kind of happened that a few times he had worn that tie to an employee meeting and it just became his standard issue when he had to do that.    \n\nEvery time he walked onto to floor of our call center, wearing that tie, it was like watching a herd of cats on a glass floor.  Everyone popped up in their cubicles, people started whispering, it got tense.   The amusing thing was that 99% of the time it had nothing to do with our unit and he was just passing through and would stop at my desk to say hi or arrange lunch later, but that didn't negate the power of the tie.    \nA few years before they closed our office and laid everyone off he showed up one day in a pair of slack, a sport coat and no tie.  He was finally retiring and wanted to say so long before he left.   Some of the people around my desk heard he was retiring and came up to say bye, good luck, etc.  As they were saying good-bye more than a few commented on and chuckled about the tie and he said he had retired it to the back of his closet to never be worn again.",

Externally I look like an authority figure, internally I'm as stern as a golden retriever.\n\n1) I was waiting outside of a club at one point, my gf was in there with her friends and I was just hanging out until they were ready to go. A small group of inebriated but friendly guys came up to me to show me their IDs, thinking I was the bouncer/doorman. \n\nI gave them a raised eyebrow (internally: the fuck? \ud83e\udd14 ) which they interpreted as declining them entry. One pulled out a few bills with intent to bribe me. By then I'd realised what had happened, and said \"that won't help you here mate\". Feeling guilty, I then told them, \"you'll behave yourselves won't you? I'd hate to have to come have a chat with you\". They all eagerly agreed, and I was left trying explain to the next group of people who had pulled out their IDs that the door check was inside and downstairs.\n\n2) I was having a beer with a mate, went to the bathroom, and as I entered a guy exited the cubicle with well powdered nose and wide eyes, because he thought I was a cop. Then he realised I wasn't, and told me so. To which I laughed. All good...\n\nFollowed by a nervous, \"you're not are you?\", \"do I look like one?\" \ud83d\udc6e\"..yes. It's my birthday. Friends bought it. uhm..did you want a bump?\" \"Is it really your birthday?\" \"Um..yea..Yes.\" Then he showed me his ID. Really was his birthday. So I just said \"happy birthday\" and went to take a leak.\n\nAfterwards, bar tender said the guy had bought me and my mate drinks, and when I nodded over to him, he did the whole \"omfg, that's the guy! that's the cop!\". I like to think we both got a fun story out of that interaction.\n\n**tl;dr** I apparently look like a cop, bouncer, auditor, and a professor (so far of history, nursing, and architecture). Mostly due to my staring off into space with a look of sour skepticism.",

They had a tasting menu and I wanted to treat myself to a nice night out. I was a bit nervous to do something like that solo, but figured wth, it'll be a good time. I had tickets to the symphony for after dinner.\n\nI wore a suit and when I arrived, I could immediately tell the staff were going out of their way to be extra cheery to me. It was odd. The waitress was so nervous serving me, at one point she knocked a half-full glass of water into my lap. I was there for a couple of hours and it was honestly one of the best meals I've ever had.\n\nAt the end, I asked if she was new and told her she did a fantastic job. She said that since I was dressed well and dining solo, they assumed I was a restaurant review critic that was there to do a write-up for the restaurant.\n\nOn a side note, if anyone is nervous about fine-dining solo like that, just do it. It's great because you can eat at your own pace, really enjoy whatever it is you're eating/drinking, and you don't have to feel forced to make conversation with anyone if you don't want.",

I had offers up to $150 for it, several trade offers including an only-few-month-old iPhone 4s, a few attempts to get me to put it up for a bet, and a couple failed theft attempts. My one friend half-jokingly *did* steal it several times, but he'd always make it a point to wear it around me afterward, leave it sitting out in his room, and would give it back if I called him out. \n\nLooking back, I can't help but feel like it was kinda dorky. Very emblematic of the time, a bit embarrassing. But I'll be goddamned if I'm getting rid of it now, if for no other reason than because I managed to hold onto it.

            "text": "This happened many years ago, when I was but a young man in college.  But the story actually starts about 18 years before that, when I was a baby.\n\nLike most kids, I hated getting soap in my eyes in the bath.  Even the gentle \u201cbaby shampoo\u201d would send me into a rage.  My dad, being the intrepid problem solving sort with a penchant for over engineering, came up with a sort of 360 degree visor that my hair would stick through.  Then, they could wash my hair and the soapy water would just roll off.  It was great.  It kind of looked like a flower on my head, so my parents would say I was \u201cflowering while showering.\u201d\n\nEventually, the OG visor got mildew and was disposed of, but my dad made a few over the years.  He ultimately stopped when he decided that I should be able to wash my hair without getting soap in my eyes, but I wasn\u2019t having it and started making my own.  Over time, \u201cflower hats\u201d for this exact purpose became mass produced and I switched over to just buying them as needed.  Never got soap in my eyes!  It was great!\n\nWell, by the time I was 20 and living in my own apartment in college, I still hadn\u2019t kicked the ol\u2019 flower hat.  I was flowering while showering every day, living my best life.  Cue a cute girl staying at my place and suggesting we take a shower together before fucking.  She asked me to wash her hair and brush conditioner through it, which apparently felt really good to her and was a major turn on.  When I was done, she offered to wash my hair.  I didn\u2019t think that would do anything for me, but I said \u201csure!\u201d\n\nI then reached out of the shower for the drawer where I kept my flower hat and put it on.  At first she laughed and thought I was joking, even after I explained what it was.  But then I think she noticed how it looked kind of old and used and faded, and that it would be strangely elaborate to keep a flower hat in my bathroom for the occasional joke.\n\nTo her credit, she washed my hair while I wore it.  We didn\u2019t end up having sex that night\u2014I can\u2019t remember her explanation\u2014but after she left the next morning she didn\u2019t return my calls or AIM messages.  \n\nI didn\u2019t stop flowering while showering immediately after that.  I would just say, \u201coh, I washed my hair already\u201d if the situation came up again.  But when I met my now-wife, I knew it was time to give it up.  So I no longer flower while\nI shower, I just live with the occasional pain of getting soap in my eyes.\n\nBut you better believe that when we had kids, I immediately got them flower hats.  My wife thinks they\u2019re brilliant.  She has no idea of my dark past.  And every once in a while I look at my kids\u2019 flower hats, and I hear them calling to me, beckoning me to don them.  I haven\u2019t succumbed yet, but I think it\u2019s only a matter of time\u2026\n\nTL;DR:  Flowered while I showered; got a good hair wash but nothing else.\n\nEdit:  [A general idea of what my flower hat looked like in college.](https://imgur.com/a/gRU8Mk4)",

He never lifted a finger around the house. His room was a fucking pigsty. I remember one really mortifying time, he said his mum was tidying his room and found his porn because she'd put it in a new box cause the old one had broken. He was addicted to porn. He didn't really have a clue how the real world worked, he said he'd never learned to cook or clean because when he was at uni he lived with 3 older female students and they all just fed him and stuff.\n\nHe just wasn't taught basic life skills by his parents. They were simultaneously really protective of him (I was never allowed to sleep over) and also really negligent (teaching him basic skills like cooking/cleaning/hygiene), he was a pothead as a teenager and they didn't stop him, it was just a very weird situation. I'm 99% certain he still believed in Santa and he slept with a security blanket (it was a old towel).\n\nI broke up with him cause he was too immature for me. He was a nice enough guy and a good first boyfriend but I needed someone a bit more independent and competent. I remember once I set a pan of chili to defrost and popped to the toilet, I asked him to just keep an eye on it and stir it. I came back a few minutes later & he was panicking and frantic that it has started to bubble and he didn't know what do to. I believe a lot of it was weaponised incompetence/learned helplessness.",

As the coating starts to build up in places (and completely leave other parts of the strands of hair), my hair starts getting more and more uncooperative; when I say it won\u2019t lay right, I usually mean that my fringe or layers looks terrible and is clumping together and/or separating in random places, and styling products plus heat aren\u2019t able to get a solid curl or straightening everywhere any more. My hair can look greasy in some places, frizzy in others, and in general look as if the hairstylist who cut my hair was blind with dull shears. At that point (or a few days before), it\u2019s time to strip away all the buildup and start afresh. All of a sudden, my hair starts looking uniform in texture again (after I apply whatever products I decide to use), glossing products work again, and I don\u2019t look like I cut my own hair by using a weed whacker. I have learnt to make every effort to use clarifying shampoo (or Dawn liquid) before a haircut so that my stylist isn\u2019t seeing buildup and thinking it\u2019s my real hair texture.",

His demeanor cracked and he started laughing then presumably one of the meeting organizers had the presence of mind to mute Mike.\n\nA little while later, presumably after he saw a plethora of texts and Teams chat messages from people trying to save him, Mike commented on the meeting chat and said, \"Sorry about that everyone. I was watering my plants and emptying the rest of the water from the watering can into the toilet.\"\n\nSomeone in the chat replied, \"I'm not a doctor but I think your watering can should get its prostate checked.\"",

You're the guy with, like, a short mohawk? Who told you that I hate it? I love it! If I were forty years younger I'd wear something like that! Wait, don't tell me, I know who said that. Well trust me, I've seen you many times running around the office and if I had something to say, I'd tell you personally. Our guidelines are against outrageous hair and if you promise not to grow it out into neon pink spikes, I'd say we're cool\" and it was... just a normal conversation?! with a CEO running an office the size of a small city?! (if we use the US definition of a \"small city\" between 1500 and 5000 people, as this was a 4000 people company) versus a manager with like 25 people under him? \n\nAnd the same went for most of the management, directors, and partners. The nicer the person is, the bigger is the chance it's a managing director or a partner. If he looks at you like you're trash, that's some junior manager or, funny enough, a recent promotion from an intern. These were also insufferable for some reason, often thinking they're above IT engineers in company grade (thing military rank) and paygrade. \n\nAnd it was wrong for both.",

            "text": "I (M29) have been with my girlfriend (F27) for four years, living together for two. We have a pretty good sex life, but there are some things I want that she doesn\u2019t. Since this is an alt account I\u2019ll just say it: sometimes I like being pegged. I told her this exactly once about six months into our relationship. At first she thought I was joking and just laughed at me, when she realized I was serious she said it was weird and gross, and had absolutely no interest in it. I haven\u2019t mentioned it since. \n\nI still have an old dildo from a past relationship. (My ex loved pegging, she was the one who convinced me to try it in the first place.) I still use it when I masturbate, not every time but most of the time. My girlfriend doesn\u2019t know I have it, and I intended to keep it that way. Not that I needed to hide it because she\u2019d be upset, I knew she wouldn\u2019t be, but because it\u2019s fucking embarrassing and I don\u2019t want her to know. Since we moved in together I haven\u2019t been using it as often, which is fine. Our sex life is still good. But when I have the place alone for a few hours, I still use it. And to be clear, I\u2019m definitely not fantasizing about my ex- that ship has sailed and sunk. I just watch porn, which we\u2019ve both expressly agreed is completely fine, although neither of us does it often.\n\nToday, I was home alone, enjoying myself. My girlfriend was supposed to be out for most of the day, but she ended up coming home early. She came in quietly and I was being\u2026 rather loud, so I didn\u2019t know she was home until she walked right into the bedroom. When I saw her, I panicked, screamed, rolled off the bed, hit my head on the nightstand, and the dildo fell out with a loud wet plop. She started laughing louder than I\u2019ve ever heard her laugh before, and she turned and left the apartment. No clue where she went or why she came back early at all.\n\nSo now, a few hours later, I\u2019m just sitting here with absolutely no idea what to do. I haven\u2019t texted or called and she hasn\u2019t either. I can see on Life360 that she\u2019s at the beach with some friends, like she was planning on. If her plans don\u2019t change again she won\u2019t be back for another hour or two. I have absolutely no idea what will happen when she gets back and I\u2019m not sure if I even want to. I\u2019m seriously considering going to a friends house to hide from all this. Fuck my life.\n\nTLDR; my girlfriend walked in on me with a dildo in my ass and thought it was hilarious, then left, leaving me embarrassed and confused.\n\nSmall update: I texted her \u201cHey when will you be home?\u201d She responded \u201cten minutes.\u201d Fuck fuck fuck.\n\nBIG UPDATE: She came home, we talked. She laughed because, in her words, \u201cit sounded like you had three or four guys in there, I seriously thought I was about to bust a gay orgy.\u201d It was partly because of my reaction and partly relief that I wasn\u2019t doing anything actually wrong. She had completely forgotten that this was even something I was interested in, because I only mentioned it once so long ago. Now that she realizes it\u2019s something I still want, she\u2019s willing to give it a shot. She doesn\u2019t promise to like it but she promises to try it, and that\u2019s way more than I expected. Honestly, I was just hoping she\u2019d pretend it never happened. I would have been happy with that, so this is great. \n\nAnd for all those who keep asking: no, I didn\u2019t keep going after she caught me. I have no idea where the dildo went, it vanished. It better turn up because now I really need it.\n\nFINALLY UPDATE: we tried it, she actually liked it. She didn\u2019t really realize what it was until we did it. It\u2019s going to be pretty common now, looks like. And yes, we found the dildo, and no it wasn\u2019t hiding in my ass. (I would definitely have known.) It rolled under the dresser.\n\nThanks everyone for your supportive comments, and for those who are calling me gay and unmanly, I have only one thing to say:\n\nFellas, is it gay to have sex with a woman?",

I never pegged him but definitely provided stimulation to the area previously and we both liked it. I tried to address it later very reasonably I thought. I mostly just didn\u2019t want to end up using a toy that had been in an ass in my vagina. I keep those separate.

A few weeks later, I received my packages, and after a month without cumming i was super horny. After my mom and I returned back from my football practice, me in skinny jeans and a baggy white sweaty, super horny by my outfit decide to play with the dildo (6inch) in me, and 45 minutes later, my mom walked up stairs and opened my door, but I couldn't hear her because i was wearing earphones listening to music and watching my phone with my left hand as she saw my really erected 6 inch penis at the time flopping and cum all over my legs with my right hand moving the dildo up and down in me. Later that night, I was so embarrassed during dinner that my face was still red, and I forgot to change my skinny jeans which had cum stains on them. My mom later told me in private in my bedroom to lock my door next time and to maybe use a buttplug instead, so if it happened again, she wouldn't be grossed out.\n\nWhat's worst is that she mentioned the first thing she saw was the dildo going out and inside of me as I quickly sat up to hide my rear, but then she saw my penis afterwards dripping with cum.\n\nBut, my mom used that incident to blackmail me to finish my chores and excel both in my sports and academics. Otherwise, she would tell my dad.\n\nI'm 19 as if now",

It is. You need to be compatible and if your partner is into something you majorly find gross, than you need to ask is that a viable relationship if we are not meeting all of each others need? I find anal/anal play absolutely disgusting. I really dont like it. And whilst im not bothered if others like it, i become bothered if im in a relationship with them. Because i dont want it as part of my relationship and it will start to affect my opinion of them. And i know that i will basically dump them for it.\n\nSo now im really blunt and tell them straight up about it, mainly because its unfair on me as it is just such a deep instinct on my part (i find it dirty and gross), which is weird because im not exactly vanilla. But mainly because my reaction will be unfair on them. Ill be asking them to repress and hide it amd that's not on.\n\nNo one owes anyone justification for their preferences and it is absolutely not a democracy.",

            "text": "The store I shopped at last week had a special on grapes, $2 a box. But no way to weigh the boxes, they have the kind of scale that hangs from three chains, and the boxes didn't fit in them. \n\nSo I got 4 boxes of grapes. Large boxes, I wanted them to make a batch of wine. For $8 it was a steal.\n\nThe first thing I did after leaving the store was get the shopping cart stuck in a rut in the parking lot and I couldn't pull it back out. A stranger helped get me out.\n\nThen I got home, and was able to weigh them. A 5 gallon batch of wine uses 50-80 pounds of grapes. I had 109 pounds. Oops.\n\nOkay, so I hand pressed the grapes through a rack meant for cooling cookies. 3 hours later, I have enough mash to fill my 5 gallon fermentation bucket. And there are still more than half the grapes in my fridge!\n\nI decided to embrace the FU, and made jam with one of the cases. I was at least happy to have a reason to use that no/low sugar pectin I bought a few years ago. 4 hours later, I got 22 pints of jam.  2 quarts didn't fit in the canner, I just tossed them in the fridge with screw on lids, but the rest is all set for the pantry. But - none of it actually jelled, the directions said it might take a few hours or overnight to get thick, but nope. The pectin must have been too old (2018). I'm gonna have to unseal all the jars and recook it with sugar and can it again. And I still got like 30 pounds of grapes in the fridge.\n\nSo I decided to turn my canner into fermentation bucket #2 and make 5 extra gallons of wine, with the brilliant idea that I can use some of the unjelled jars of grapes to top it off since I'll be a little short, and that will save me some reprocessing time with the jam.\n\n4 more hours of hand smashing grapes and that bucket's full. Or almost, I do have to top it off with the liquid nonjam jam. I figure I'll start with the two quarts from the fridge that never got sealed, I grab them from the basement. WTF, they aren't liquid, they are full-on jelly now. The fuckers jelled up in the fridge. So now I realize I can't use them, and can't use any of the others that are still liquid at room temp because I can't have my wine jelling up if I refrigerate it. \n\nSomewhere in there I realized the store gave me a senior discount for being over 60, which I didn't ask for, and it's not a store with a loyalty card where they'd have my birthday on file. The cashier was just like, yeah, this one's obviously over 60, don't need to card her. (I've been 60 for like 2 weeks.) That was especially demoralizing because I'd just been trying on dresses from my closet to see if they still fit, for an event I am going to this Wednesday, and was feeling smug because they DID fit, and I was thinking I look good in them, I was specifically thinking I don't look anywhere near 60. Pffft, wrong about that. I look old.\n\nI got a call from the event host today asking where I was. I wrote down the date wrong, the event was yesterday and I missed it. \n\nAnd I need to buy either more grapes or more juice to finish the second bucket of wine. \n\nTLDR: Accidentally bought 50+ pounds more grapes than I needed, everything I did to try to use them backfired and now I need more grapes to save the ones I used. My ego ended up even more crushed than the grapes after being given the unsolicited old lady discount.",

Well apart from missing the event, you still fit in your dresses and look good, got a killer deal on grapes, the jelly you thought you messed up just need to be jelled up in the fridge, you got nearly 5 extra gallons of wine and 22 pints of jelly you didn`t account for, and you even got the Senior discount you were entitled to despite completely forgetting to mention it to the cashier! You should be really proud of the fruits of your labour and being a savvy shopper :)   \n   \nYou might also be popular amoung friends and family if you give them a freakin low-sugar guilt-free homemade pint of jelly or a quart of wine",

There are only two outcomes from them, you pick up cheap produce or you don't bid and look at people like they are insane for paying the prices they are. When the produce goes cheap it's hard not to get caught up and buy a lot. I should add there are no small amounts, everything is generally by the box. Last year my MIL went to one. She called me, \"do you want some zucchini?\" The answer was yes, because who says no? She shows up to my house with 4, yes four, 40 pound boxes of zucchini. When she kept bringing them in the house I thought we were dividing those up for people. I was wrong, they are all for me. She bid on and won 12 boxes. The total was $24 for all 12. At the end of two weeks we had made/froze zucchini everything and still had two boxes left. Do you know that it only takes about one zucchini to make any baked good with zucchini? \ud83d\ude44 I found a recipe for zucchini pickles both dill and sweet. So I made a bunch of those until I ran out of jars. To get rid of the last box I randomly left piles on our friend's and neighbor's porch!",

You can make ice cream with dry ice, you just have to crush it really well first and don't use too much of it.  The texture of that ice cream is great.

My step dad had a habit of going to the cashier and paying once he was done eating, even if it would often be another 20-30 minutes before everyone else was done and the conversation would wind down down.  So one time we get home and a call comes in from the police that we dined and dashed, and an employee got our plate number as we drove away.  Very luck for us, my step-dad used a check and was able to tell the cop the check number and amount.  The restaurant found the check and all was good.",

The best way I came to understand the intestines is when I heard it described like train cars. Eating is like adding a train car at the end, and if a gastro-colic reflex is triggered, the train car at the front is what is getting released. Normally, you don't have a completely empty train track when you're eating, there's typically train cars in various stages of the intestines.",

This just happened like 15 minutes ago\n\nI was playing Fallout 4 for several hours, and I had no clue where my parents were. Keep in mind, that I also have a hearing deficit and I was not wearing my hearing aids at the time. On top of that, it is currently very late where I live so I figured my parents were in bed or something.\n\nAfter playing Fallout 4 for several hours, I go into the hallway and I see a small amount of light coming from the game room. I thought that maybe someone left the TV on and I went to turn it off. I open the door and lo and behold...\n\nMy father's head is in between my mom's legs, like 6 feet away from me. I just shut the door and ran downstairs and outside. I became a little concerned about what would happen next.\n\nMy father came outside, and I asked: \"How are ya?\" And he said: \"Fine, but next time knock.\"\n\nI explained that not only had I been unaware of where they were, but it was also late and I thought maybe they were in bed. I also mentioned that I was not wearing my hearing aids and could not hear behind the door very well. I also added on top of all of that I saw a light coming from the game room and thought that maybe someone left the TV on and intended to turn it off. I also apologized and said that I just made an honest mistake.\n\nMy father said everything was fine and I had absolutely nothing to worry about. He just said that Fridays and Saturdays are the only two days that he has time to spend with my Mom, so I should be more... vigilant about opening a door on those days.\n\nTLDR: I walked in on my parents having sex. My father asked that next time I knock, but he acknowledged that I made a genuine error.\n\nEDIT: Holy F-Word 6k upvotes! I want to thank the people who have given me positive reinforcement so far.\n\nEDIT 2: I am at a loss for words. More than 10K upvotes. My inbox is so demolished that I don't think even Vault-Tec could have made a vault sturdy enough to protect it. ",

And that child rearing is just one of their endeavors in life. \n\nChildren want to feel safe having their first sexual experience in their own homes, along with supportive parents who guide and nurture them through that part of life and typically get nothing but disgust and apprehension in return. How is that fair? I think most kids wouldn't like it if their parents accidentally walked in on them as teenagers having sex and wouldn't stop saying \"ewwwww how gross\" for the duration of their shared lives. You walk in, say excuse me as you turn around and walk out, and life goes on! Really doesn't even necessitate a conversation beyond what the OP had, assuming all parties are sexually active or at least sexually aware. \n\nAnyway, you can't make other people happy if you aren't happy yourself. Sex is one of the ways that happens. As others have pointed out, when couples stop having sex, it's almost certainly not a good thing. Miserable couples make for miserable parents. Go check out R/DeadBedrooms if there is any doubt. Your parents are healthy. OP sounds like no one really fucked up. It's just an accident. No biggie. Kudos to everyone for not making it weird!",

He did and they reconciled, they told me they were back together the night before Easter and I decided that night to call my friend on MSN messenger and tell her about it and play some games. At some point, I excused myself to go to the bathroom. For context, my hallway leads directly into the living room and their bedroom was at the end of the hall, which, for most of my life had the sofa in direct view from said hallway. Lo and behold, my mom was going to town on my dad. At first I didn\u2019t know what was going on but it clicked pretty quickly and I decided to ruin their \u201cfun-time\u201dby asking if there was an \u201cEaster bunny tracker\u201d (like the Santa one) while fully knowing that I was interrupting after putting 2&2 together. \n\nNearly 20 years later and now I get to make fun of them for it\n\nEdit: they never noticed I even left my room 3 times before interrupting them lmao",

She still didn\u2019t seem old to me when she was helping me move into my college dorm at nearly 60. I guess it helped change my view of growing too. Go for it if that\u2019s what you want. \nOh also: I have a sister too, same mom, 21 years older than me. Her experience with a young mom was completely different and we kind of share what we learned from what feels like two different mothers sometimes.",

            "text": "I feel so embarrassed. I (23F) have had my period for more than 10 years now, and I just learned, from a Reddit post of all places, that you are not supposed to just shove the whole thing, applicator and all, up there and then leave it like that. I have a Biochemistry degree. I have travelled the world. And yet somehow I never figured this one out. This is my first and probably last reddit post because I cannot keep my horror at the fact that I\u2019ve been keeping pieces of plastic in my vagina for ten years inside, but I absolutely cannot fathom telling anyone I know about this. I have always thought that tampons were super uncomfortable (for reasons that are now glaringly obvious) and mostly used pads, but I love swimming and so I use tampons fairly frequently during the summer. As best as I can figure, I have used hundreds of tampons in this way. I have been scouring my brain but I don\u2019t think that anyone ever told me about this, despite the multiple, wildly uncomfortable health classes I had to take in grade school. The worst part is that I knew the plastic bit was called the applicator, I just figured that was because it made putting it in easier and you were just supposed to leave it in. Thank you, redditors, for listening, and I can only hope that this horrifying blunder of mine will convince you to explain very clearly to your children how tampons work.\nTLDR; I have been using tampons wrong for ten years and am extremely embarrassed \n\nEdit to answer some common questions: yes, the whole thing fit up there. Maybe I just have a long vagina idk. No, it probably didn\u2019t work great but I only kept them in for a couple of hours at most while I went swimming and I used them very infrequently, maybe a few times a year. There are lots of comments asking why I didn\u2019t read the instructions. Well, my mom always just had loose tampons lying around. I\u2019ve bought my own maybe once or twice but that was when I was much older so by that point I felt confident in my tampon-using abilities and never read the instructions (lol). I had health class and went to grade school in a fairly liberal public school district. Now I am questioning what I thought was a fairly comprehensive health education.\n\nThere are some comments asking if I can read or saying that I must not have gone to a good college/ worked hard for my degree. Please don\u2019t be rude. In my experience sometimes it\u2019s the people who are really smart at one thing that are super dumb at others. I want to thank the people who shared their own tampon blunders for helping me feel less alone in this embarrassing mistake.\n\nAnother edit: people are also asking about how I could have had that much of a lack in curiosity about how it worked. I think when I was younger I felt a lot of shame around my body and didn\u2019t want to think about it any more than absolutely necessary, and once I got older and more comfortable I kind of thought I knew everything I needed to about tampons",

Your vaginal canal angles back more than you think.  This way your tampon will insert fully with the entire body of the tampon inside your vagina and only the string passing through the vaginal opening.    \n\n**DO** insert the tampon and applicator into your body, use the applicator plunger to push the tampon out of the applicator tube, then remove the applicator tube from your body.  (OP already covered this).   \n\n**DO** change tampons frequently, about every 3-4 hours. Even if the tampon is not soaked, still change it.  Leaving a tampon in too long can make you sick with Toxic Shock Syndrome. And it will smell absolutely terrible.    \n\n**DO** consider a Diva Cup or other period cup product.

It tries to keep everything light and funny. That book is how I learned about menstral discs and decided to try them. Its also how I learned what wasnt normal in regards to periods and talked to my gyno. Turns out I had a cervix that was fused to my muscles causing me extreme pain. I just thought it was normal pain until that book opened my eyes.\n\nAnyway. My daughter and I talk about those things, but the book gave her the right words and info and if she had further questions she knew how to ask them.\n\nBefore she started her period i made her a box of supplies and included all of the instructions and a funny book about starting and understanding your period. She was in bed avoiding the world for her first period, so reading that book gave her something to do and helped her feel confident again.",

I'd say it would be useful for big events(nice clothes events) where you would have the option of discreetly checking without wasting time.\n\nAlthough it would generate a lot of tech waste with how widely it would be used. And another problem is that it might erode and become a safety hazard(either cuts+tetanus, burns, or even shocks).\n\nAll in all it would be helpful if it weren't so dangerous.

I ended up having to employ needle nosed pliers to get it out. \ud83e\udd23\n\nI have also once pulled one out not quite delicately enough on a heavy flow day and ended up flinging blood all over the bathroom.

When inserted properly, you shouldn't feel it at all!\u00a0\n\n\nThe tip of it should go all the way back to your cervix (think how far your doctor goes in to get cervical cells for a pap smear). It will seem like it's too far at first, but just go slowly, don't force it, and you'll almost feel it slide right into place once you got the angle right.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can put one foot on the toilet to loosen the muscles and make it easier at first. Push the top part of the applicator in all the way up to the plunger part and then push the plunger in and the tampon will sit just at your cervix.... then remove the applicator...almost forgot that part ;)\u00a0\n\n\nYour post probably helped some folks so good on you for sharing what you learned.\u00a0\n\n\nhttps://www.pullingcurls.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tampon-insertion-6.jpg\u00a0",

I had headphones on and thought my wife was asleep. She ended up being behind me in the back of the room and basically saw the entire shooting match. \n\nMy wife is very religious/conservative and I think I may have really fucked up. We do share a lot of the same values but I have been doing this in GTA since before we met. I tried to explain that it was just a game but in her eyes it was betraying her trust. \n\nShe is even more pissed because I went back for seconds and thirds, paying the prostitute multiple times. \n\nI am no longer welcome in by bed and this could actually cause a major problem for us. She is the type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies we are watching. \n\nTL;DR \n\nI was unfaithful to my wife in a video game and now my marriage may be over.\n",

The rectangle makes a \"rocking\" motion 2 or 3 times and the polygon-lady starts walking around again.\n\nIf someone was playing a GTA game for sexy times titillation, they'd go to the strip joint where you can see boobs.\n\n> GTA allows players to pick up hookers in your car and pay them for various sexual services.\n\n\nLike this right here. That's not at all accurate. GTA 5 shows you the rear brake-lights of a car and they rotate slightly on the X-axis.\n\nIn what universe does a dude, with headphones in, playing late at night do this multiple times in a row? It isn't an interesting animation from a \"sexy times\" perspective.\n\n> I had headphones on and thought my wife was asleep. She ended up being behind me in the back of the room and basically saw the entire shooting match.\n\nIt's also kinda slow.  How long was she allegedly watching for from the shadows? 10 minutes? \n\nThis feels like someone wrote a hypothetical into a story for reddit to me.\n\nNow ... If it was \"caught wanking to the strip joint scene in GTA5\" I'd be more likely to believe it... But the underpants section of a JC Penny catalog is sexier than the GTA5 car-pickup prostitute scene.",

I've had an ex like that, and all I can say is, no human being is perfect, but some human beings prefer their partners to attempt to be perfect even though they can't be...and those people are, well, jerks. They think they have high standards, but the truth is they have a huge fear of abandonment, and it can destroy others' mental health. That's the kind of person who could literally drive you crazy, so take care of your mental health. Remember it's not your job to be perfect. It's her job to lighten up.\n\n\nI'd rather act normal, be imperfect, and be single, than have to try to appease a perfectionist the rest of my life. She may try to convince you to go to some kind of therapy for looking at lady in a game the wrong way, but everyone will know she's the one who needs therapy for giving a shit if you look at a video game character. Keep that mind straight. Be willing to call her out for being ridiculous. It's just a game. It's just as dumb as her getting mad you slid a long tetris piece into an open space. Remember that.",

Then my jealousy took over, and I pulled out my rifle and shot both of them while they were in a clothing store. He kinda just snuck away as she and I started gun battling. She was really kicking my butt, I always sucked at shooting. But I\u2019m good in a jet, so I got my jet and kept killing her until he called me and said thats his sister. She got on the phone and cursed at me, and I cursed back at her, lol. We literally started beefing from that point on, and every time I went over to his house, she didnt speak to me, rolled her eyes at me, & closed her door. I never knew a video game could cause drama like that... We broke up a few months later, too, lol. Super embarrassing memory and silly. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "text": "\nTIFU by turning my cat into an iPad kid\n\nRecently, my TV broke, so I decided it would be cool to replace it with a projector. A few days ago, the projector arrived, and I spent a few hours setting it up and playing around with it. Then, I had the bright idea to put on one of those videos made for cats\u2014the ones with insects, lasers, and mice\u2014to see how my cat would react. She fucking loved it. Naturally, I let her watch for about an hour before turning it off for the night. She protested a little, but nothing too serious\u2014at least, not compared to what was coming.\n\nOver the next few days, I foolishly let her watch the projector a few more times, thinking it was hilarious how excited she was about her new \u201ctoy.\u201d However, as time went on, she started to get a bit more vocal, growling and meowing at me to get my attention. I soon realized it was because of the ads. She was throwing tantrums because she couldn\u2019t stand waiting. \n\nNow, she complains whenever I turn it off, or if she gets interrupted and bonus points, my YouTube now thinks I\u2019m a cat.\n\nTLDR; I let my cat watch videos on my new projector, and now she throws tantrums like an impatient iPad kid when I don\u2019t let her binge insect videos.\n",

It\u2019s been in my wardrobe ever since until I took it out yesterday to take photos of it because I found out about the r/whatisthisthing page. Lots of people came back with different answers but a few people said it looked like it was radioactive and that I should go to my local fire station to check it. This morning I phoned the non-emergency fire brigade number and explained the situation. Two minutes later 3 fire engines arrive to test the object which was in fact radioactive. They then called for backup and 3 ambulances 3 police cars and a counterterrorism CBRN bomb disposal unit arrive. They evacuate all the flats in the building and after 4 hours they finally remove the object. It turned out to be Thorium (I\u2019m not sure about the isotope number or radiation levels)\n\nHere is the link to the original post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/s/ENI2mYpVu2\n\nTL;DR Object I bought in a flee market is identified as radioactive thanks to Reddit and fire brigade",

There's a chance one of my mantles has thorium in it, as some of them are old enough, but I don't have a detector to test them.\n\nThat being said, the thorium mantles make tissue paper look as strong as steel in comparison, as it is an ash latace, so when it breaks down, it becomes a powdery dust kinda like flower Accidentally breathing that powdery dust is not a good idea, so dispose of them carefully. \n\nThe safety is mainly about understanding the material you are handling and how to do it safely. For thorium ash, when you replace a manfle, remove the old one (or ones) with the mantel downwind (wind to your back) of you so the dust can't blow back at you.\n\nIt decays (very slowly) into extreely small amounts of radium, which decays so fast it can't become concentrated enough to be dangerous (as I understand it)\n\nTechnology connections has made a cool video on these devices and demonstrates a thoriated mantle being a little radioactive and that it becomes a powder when broken down.\n\nLink:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/D_qFWoa_HR4?si=f1Gl5q-77gY_Axci",

If you were to stand out side shirtless in the sun in an attempt to soak up as much ionizing radiation that would be  equivalent to a lethal dose of radiation from holding a piece of thorium, you would die from sun exposure long before you had any sort of increased risk of cancer. Plenty of old plates and floor tiles used to be more radioactive than that. The radiation is negligible. The earth itself is subject to all sorts of ionizing radiation all the time. From rocks and minerals to the sun. So as such humans have evolved to be able to absorb SOME radiation and process it. There is a certain dosage that people can safely be exposed to each year, and it is fairly high.",

The biggest risk with thorium is accidental ingestion or breathing thorium particles, neither of which seems likely in this case.",

Now if you like ate it or decided to cut through it with a grinder and breathed in some of the dust, that would be a problem. You could sit in a room for a couple of hours with the thorium exposed near and it would be like spending a couple of hours in the sun as far as cancer risk is concerned. Probably less. While enclosed in the shielding, it's hardly a risk at all.\n\nHell, you can legally buy samples of thorium-232 online in glass vials, and the glass is enough to block the radiation. So despite all the hubbub around it, you're fine, man.\n\nI keep bringing up thorium-232 because that's one of very few isotopes it could realistically be, given that most isotopes of thorium have half-lives in the milliseconds, and about 99.9% of all thorium on earth is thorium-232. Also, everything I said about alpha particles in regard to thorium-232 also applies to the other couple of longer half-life isotopes.",

It does however go through many beta decays in its chain which may pose a slight risk. Th-230 does have a gamma emission in its chain along with beta decays but takes a long time in our sense to build up radioactivity.\n\nSource: am a physics student",

There's been a trend lately of shady companies making thorium-laced pendants and such, and marketing them for their positive health effects, without disclosing the thorium content. The problem is that they've been using powdered thorium and not mixing it in evenly with the plastic, perhaps even deliberately, because the unmixed thorium makes sort of a veiny marble-like look. Well, it sheds powder everywhere, fine powder, that can easily be inhaled, and just sits in the lungs (yes, I know, things can be expelled from the lungs, but when you're still inhaling a steady stream of thorium powder, that becomes moot). Inhaled radioactive materials are generally really bad.\n\nI wouldn't go around making blanket statements about something being among the safest radioactive materials. Pretty much any of them can be very bad, depending on the form it takes, and how people are exposed to it.

I know cause I did it once for a couple pocket watches, and FOR FREE they will send someone to your house to test items for you!! I encourage everyone who collects old mystery junk/clocks/clockwork/toys ect, to do this. \n\nMy grandpa was a watch maker, and i kept a ton of tools, clockwork, watches ect. Like 3-4 years back, I noticed a clock face with the green painted hands, and immediately dumped it and two others into a bucket of water and had them come out to test. The guy was very friendly, and reassured me that it \u201cprobably wasn\u2019t\u201d radioactive, but it was good to check and better safe than sorry\u2026 as we were walking over to the bucket \ud83e\udea3. He has his testing device out + PPE on, dumps out the water and grabs it, and what do you know, his device starts going off immediately! \n\nHe was like \u201c\u2026. Ah. Yup, ok, that\u2019s radium paint all right.\u201d \n\nBut! That\u2019s not all. I had ONLY thought the 3 pocket watches/ clock faces were sus. But \u2018just in case,\u2019 we had him test everything from my grandpa, and there was a number of things that pinged. \n\nIncluded on that list were: a couple of clock winders, a small folding pocket knife with a Mother of Pearl inlay, a windup spring, a few small tools- different tweezers, tiny flatheads, a watch chain, a tiny tin kid\u2019s toy, the inner clockwork of a pocket watch that had no radium paint visible, a 1/2 cup of little knobs with gems on the top of them, 2 of the containers that were used for storing this stuff, and the sculpture of a clockwork butler I had made out of watch parts \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\n\nOh yeah, and the surface of the folding table that we had dumped everything out on for him to test \ud83d\ude30\n\nHe said that I could keep the stuff as long as it was stored safely, because the radiation was weak enough to be stopped by a glass or plastic container. (For example, the gem-knobs didn\u2019t register until the plastic vitamin bottle I had them in was opened.)  Or he could take them with him to be safely disposed of. I had him take everything, I mean for gods sake the tabletop that things were sitting on had gotten contact radioactive material on it. We had to scrub it several times and have him retest until there wasn\u2019t a signature. \n\nSo, yeah. Grandpa died of leukemia by the way\u2026 the scary part of that type of low level radiation is not what it\u2019ll do to you from outside your body. It\u2019s that the active isotope \u2018looks\u2019 similar enough to calcium for your body to get confused and puts in in your bones the same as calcium. That\u2019s when you are fucked, but you\u2019re gonna have decades of not knowing anything about it. Leukemia is cancer of the blood, which is produced in the bone marrow. \n\nMoral of the story, getting things tested costs nothing and can be lifesaving.",

                    "body": "The problem is, most of it is basically useless information and the sheer amount of it practically drowns out more vital warnings. For example, a warning on french fries because they (and many other cooked foods) contain acrylamide. But the amount found in french fries is so low that even the American Cancer society says that you could eat 150 servings of those fresh fries, in one sitting, and still not reach the amount of acrylamide thought to raise the risk of cancer in mice. \n\nProp 65 warning is required on *hotels* in California, because previous guests might have drank alcohol or smoked on the property at some point. And drinking alcohol and smoking can raise the risk of some cancers.\n\nAll wooden furniture has to carry a prop 65 warning to be sold in California. Because the level of wood dust that a sawmill worker, who's not wearing any kind of mask, is exposed to, can over a period of years, raise the risk of cancer. (As can inhaling any kind of fine dust in large enough quantities for a long enough period of time, because of the irritation and damage to the lungs) There is no way on earth a wooden chair carries enough wood dust to raise anybody's risk of cancer.\n\nPotted trees sold in California often have a warning on them. Untill a court case  in 2018, restaurants that served coffee had to have a warning, because coffee has traces of acrylamide\n\nThere are warning required on things that  international regulators agree are not  carcinogenic hazards.\n\nWhen  people see those kinds of warnings literally everywhere, they stop paying attention to them. And there is no difference in the Prop 65 warning telling you that a table contains wood, or that golden brown potatoes have acrylamide at less that 100th the dose that *might* raise the risk of cancer in mice. And a Prop 65 warning saying that a necklace marketed to little kids,(who tend to put everything in their mouth) contains lead. So the end result is that a lot of people just ignore ALL the prop 65 warning labels, because they can't tell the difference between the (many) useless ones, and the actually important ones. And most of the ones they see are the useless ones.",

                    "body": "So Prop 65 is punishes anyone violating the thresholds even unintentionally under the logic that you should know exactly what you\u2019re selling.  This is understandable but also means that every potential source of contamination is a potential source of a lawsuit from the government.\n\nFor vitamins, almost every mineral sample is inherently contaminated. Like if your supplement has 65 mg of iron and is 99.99% pure, thats 6.5 micrograms of random contaminants.  Same applies to the Calcium and the Magnesium.  Now those contaminants are random but are typically based on the source. Iron is from rocks, so other metals in the rock are often contaminants. Calcium is often from shells, so it depends on what the shelled thing ate and the water it lived in over its life.  Reducing contaminants is very expensive: going from 99.99% pure to 99.999% might increase cost ten times over.\n\nProp 65 says the daily limit on lead is 0.5 micrograms per day (which is the FDA maximum level for infant consumption).  0.5 micrograms per day for an adult would take a long time to have your body absorb enough lead to reach the 0.5 micrograms per deciliter in your blood that\u2019s considered elevated as an adult. (An adult contains about 50 deciliters of blood, so you\u2019d need to absorb 25 micrograms of lead, and lead doesn\u2019t absorb well in the digestive system.)\n\nSince a vitamin is daily, if they can\u2019t reliably say that the contaminants in some batches might be a tiny bit high in lead to breach 0.5 micrograms, it\u2019s safer on a regulatory side to add the sticker. Since the contaminants are somewhat random and the amount of contaminants is hard to get under 0.5 micrograms as a whole, it\u2019s fairly likely that at least some batches fail just on random chance.\n\nCompanies can get a USP lab to do random batch testing on their product as well as do process verification to guarantee that contaminants are more like harmless carbon and not harmful lead, but it\u2019s a LOT of money and is an ongoing service contract.\n\nNow for a prenatal vitamin you should probably find one that\u2019s USP verified, but be prepared to pay a significantly higher cost to get one. Typically they\u2019re only brand names, which means you\u2019re paying for the brand, and the USP verification cost also gets passed on to the consumer.\n\nThe other major buyer of USP verified supplements are drug tested athletes, since even minor contamination of a chemical byproduct in a medicine can cause false flags on tests.\n\nMost makeup kits should have a sticker due to contamination, and finding USP certified makeup is way harder than supplements, and stuff like mercury can be absorbed through the skin.  Also organic produce should technically have a sticker if it\u2019s intended to be consumed every day, again because of contaminants plants absorb from the soil.",

I was the perfect combination of warm and slutty and i was excited to strut my stuff.\n\nThe way that this bar is set up is that there is a main level upstairs, and then you can walk downstairs to go to the dance area. it\u2019s a pretty small place so it gets crowded. \n\nI had taken some mushrooms earlier in the evening. And I was feeling good.\n\nAt some point in the night, I had to \u201ccut the cheese.\u201d I thought it would be a small one. I thought I could just crop dust it . but it was the most silent/deadly/toxic/foul mushroom stink bomb of my life. \n\nThe smell from my ass destroyed the Dance floor. People cleared out! It was so bad people thought that someone had an accident on the floor. like they turned up the lights a little bit to see and make sure that there wasn\u2019t a health hazard. Even the DJ made a comment.\n\nI went upstairs because I couldn\u2019t stand the smell of my own ass. I was up there for about 30 minutes. And when I came back down, I could still smell my ass.\n\nIt\u2019s all anybody could talk about. They thought someone had an accident . I had to play dumb. I was so embarrassed. \n\nTL:DR my mushroom gas smelled so bad that it cleared out a Halloween party and the DJ even made a comment about how bad it smelled",

Never have done that on a post with this many replies. \n\nAs an old retired guy, and a regular practicing skilled professional farter here is my story (sorry for the length):\n\nI grocery shop (I like it actually) on Sunday morning. Store is basically empty because I assume everyone is at church. Had a full blown Mexican meal with my wife Saturday evening. Sunday comes around, I'm up at 5:30am regularly based on doing it for 40+ years. Made coffee, dog did her business. Watching the news. All good. It's now about 7:30am, time to head to the grocery. I'm feeling fine, but have a little morning after wind, because we'll Mexican food. I have wind most mornings anyway, just because I do.\n\nSomewhere in the store after a few mins. (remember the store is almost empty) I feel a bubbler coming on. Look back, the aisle behind me and in front was clear. I let go. Not loud, but a good 15 seconds of walking and farting. Like walking in unison, each step was a new fart. You know the type. Since it was behind me, I smelled nothing. Around the corner behind me, a Mom and a 6ish year old toddler head right into the flatulence curtain of disgust. I'm near the end of the aisle, they at the beginning. I hear the boy start telling mommie it was really stinky, and that someone must have farted. I'm now smiling. I then hear the little boy tell mommie he was feeling sick, and he was going to throw up. I'm now tuned in, but facing away from them. Mommie ignores the boy. I then I hear the \"barf wince\" noise that accompanies throwing up. \n\nHe coughs and tosses cookies all over the freshly mopped white floor. \n\nI'm literally at the end of the aisle, turn to see what they look like, and see if they noticed me. Mommie is holding his head, while there was a huge strewn barf pile on the floor. They didn't see me. \n\nI've never laughed so hard in my life. I was stifling the laughter so I wouldn't be caught as the offender. \n\nKept with the shopping trip. Didn't see them again.\n\nWent home and told my wife. She wasn't as impressed as I was. I guess you had to be there.\n\nIt was so classic. Perfect wind distribution. Thanks for the memory.",

It\u2019s a cool setup; they have two stages, but only one band will play at a time, while the next sets up on the other. So you kind of go back and forth between the stages but there\u2019s a large middle sweet spot where everyone sits and is able to see both stages by turning around. You\u2019re not super close but you hear the music and can still get a decent view. \n\nI had eaten some mushrooms as well and mushies just do not agree with me. I dropped a few farts and I knew they were bad but I was holding it best I could. But I was close to stage on one side and would need to cross the area where everyone was sitting to get to the bathrooms. It was a beautiful day out sun out great lineup and everyone was chilling in the grass, enjoying whatever high or psychedelic they were on. \n\nUntil I walked by. \n\nIt was BAD, like someone had left a dozen eggs in a car over an entire summer. And everybody got some right at face level. People were falling to the ground, rolling around, yelping out in surprise or pain or disgust, frantically waving their hands in front of their faces, some looking to and fro for the perpetrator. It was a trail of destruction San Francisco hadn\u2019t seen since the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989. And my fart lasted probably just as long. An entire swath across the lawn, like the mark of Voldemort on Harry\u2019s head, was decimated. \n\nAnd my girlfriend was laughing her ass off.",

We were at a forced team building event at this fancy resort and we both got there early and were sat in the bar which had these really awkward beanbag couches. We were sat next to each other laughing and joking and making plans to team up and beat the other coworkers.\n\nWell the bells rang and I had to run to the bathroom (IBS), so I told her I had to run to the bathroom and she said it was a good idea and she\u2019d go to. We were laughing about how we felt like beached whales and decided that because it was a badly designed low beanbag couch you had to kinda roll to get momentum to stand up.  I roll to the right to get up and I didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d also decided to roll right. In such a way her face was directly in line with my ass. Her two eyes briefly stared at where my brown eye. \n\nAs I released a bubble fart so bad I swear her hair ruffled in the breeze. I was chewing on it and my mouth was 4ft away from ground zero. \n\nShe just looked hurt. Didn\u2019t talk to me the rest of that weekend.

People near us were catching the scent, and our panic, and joining the push to the door.  Our initial group of 5 became a pack of a dozen and grew,  pushing to open doors and climbing out open windows, all while people outside were still pushing in (and paying a dollar).  The fire alarm started going off about the time I made it to the porch.  \n\nWe regrouped across the street as the first fire engine arrived to the house with people pouring out the doors, climbing out the windows, including to the porch roof.  A couple kids were puking on the lawn (more likely drunk than gassed).  I was in favor of staying across the street to watch the chaos.

Jim is the absolute best, he\u2019s funny, crude, brilliant, personable and gives no fucks. I love Jim, he\u2019s the guy I want by my side when things are dull. The 2 day conference was interesting, but dull, Jim and I caught up and on the evening of the first night, we went for burritos (from my favourite burrito place near Trafalgar Square) and beers. And a few more beers \n\nYou know where this is going - Burritos from that place has an effect on me. Not a good one if you\u2019re in close vicinity\n\nThe first morning session was fine, but in the second, my tummy was making noise. Hot, rumbling noise. The second session was a medium sized, packed conference room. PACKED. With no air conditioning. Jim was sat next to me and I leaned over to him and said - \u201cJim, I\u2019m sorry\u201d\n\nThe look of confusion on his face, makes me laugh even today. The look of horror on his face as he breathed in the rat death stench that blew from my ass was something to behold. Cue my giggling, your own farts don\u2019t offend you and the first few were ok, the next few offended even me and it just got worse\n\nDid I mention that the room was packed?. The people sat near me were first confused and then offended - a few left the room muttering phrases at me - there was no question that it was me, I was too busy trying to hold my laugh in. Jim was giggling too and regularly calling me a \u201csmelly dirty bastard\u201d\n\nThe presentation, I\u2019ve no idea what it was about at all, but the memory and thought of that, genuinely makes me laugh to this day \ud83d\ude42\n\nNot the first time this has happened either,.

We'd been working all day on stuff around the house, and I hadn't taken the time for my mid-day poop (it just never really...came up...) Once we finally settled down to grab a bite to eat, things started to settle in my bowels too. It was a quick dinner (Firehouse subs) and off to Home Depot. After letting things settle while eating (and eating to start getting things moving) the walking around Home Depot had started the gas factory into full churn mode. I crop dusted a few random aisles in Home Depot before we got into the car. Nothing major. But on the way home, I started to feel the warning rumbles of something I knew would be foul. I tried to be polite. I really did. I opened the window. My wife...she should have known this was a sign of something. We almost never drive with the windows open. Did she ask me why I opened the window? No. Did she pause to consider that there might have been a reason I opened it? No. She just said \"Close the window!\" And my daughter immediately followed suit, \"Yea, close the window, please.\" (At least she used manners)\n\nWell...I closed it without a word. Then let loose the longest warmest SBD I've done in a while. It was one of those farts that you could just tell by the way it felt that you just KNOW it's going to be foul. And foul, it was. Now, [everyone likes their own brand, don't they?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6PRtt_jLUE) But it was pretty foul even for me. It was a slow traveler too. I got it first, and I think it might have melted my nose hairs... but I sat silently and waited. It hit my wife a few seconds later who loudly proclaimed \"WHOA! Jesus Christ, SgtMac!\" Then my daughter pipes up with, \"What? What's the mat-- OH MY GOD!\" My son...boy he's a man after my own heart. He and I just laughed our asses off as I left the windows closed and everyone died just a little, and the interior of my car began to melt under the penetrating fury of my biological attack.\n\nNext time someone in the car decides to randomly open the window, you might want to pause and ask why.\n\nTL;DR, Got dinner, ran errands, filled the car up with gas.",

We watch our movie without event and go to bed shortly after. \n\nWell there was something else in this ice cream that didn't agree with me or something because my stomach started bubbling. We also had cabbage soup for dinner so that didn't help. \n\nMy husband is asleep already and I finally start to doze off. I guess I relaxed too much and the biggest fart just ripped right out of me. It was loud enough to wake him up and when he sat up, he could smell it...like sour milk and old cabbage. The smell had me gagging as well. He yells \"WHAT THE FUCK DIESEL\" (our poor innocent dog). He was fully convinced our dog shit on the floor. He starts throwing lights on to check the floor and I am suffocating my laughter in the blankets.",

Up down, up down. From cali to seattle. On our last leg when we were heading back up from our Portland stop an awful smell hit the cabin.  It spread quickly even the flight attendants quickly checked the bathrooms for some sort of error. My younger brother who was 10 at the time kept giggling and playing his Gameboy, (yeah I feel old). Two rows back a baby started crying upon our altitude gain. The older woman to my left states how she wished the mother had taken the landing and departure of seats to change the baby's diaper. Upon hearing that my brother laughed loudly and made things kinda awkward, never looking up from his gameboy. People began turning on the air to try and cycle the God awful death smell out of the cabin only to eviscerate the entire cabin more quickly. Meanwhile everyone in the cabin with small kids is doing the butt smell.  The lady with the crying baby literally at one point said loud enough for others to hear, \" its not my baby the diapers clean\" Finally we hit Seattle! I've never seen a plane de boarded more quickly and in such an orderly fashion. Heading up the ramp my brother is giggling and laughing. At this point I'm like what the hell are you laughing at. As we are just about to meet my mom at the end of the ramp he says, \" that was me, we will remember this flight for the rest of our lives.\" We still both talk about this and laugh a lot about how a 10 yo killed an entire aircraft with the flatulence.",

So I'd figured the gas was blown out of proportion. \n\nBoy was I wrong. I tried to fan it out, it immediately overwhelmed me. That shit burnt my eyes. I couldn't really run away from it. I tripped getting out of bed. I tried to take a breath and I couldn't. I ran to the kitchen, it followed me. 30 minutes passed. We couldn't go to bed, even she couldn't go in the room.

Truth be told, I believe I convinced myself of the monster because I didn't want anyone to know that I had to go to the bathroom. As if going to the damn bathroom would make my classmates laugh at me... Anyhoo, I held my waste all day long and then ran home from school to piss and shit. I believed this was all normal until one day I had to pee so damn bad. We were taking a test and  that made me more nervous. It was getting bad and I was rocking back and forth, getting crazy trying to hold it instead of just raising my hand to go to the bathroom. Like the above story, I thought - okay, I'll just go a little in my pants and that would relieve the pressure - so I started and couldn't shut the damn faucet off. Panicking I just continue to take my test and the pee was coming out in a raging river, soaking my pants and dripping off my seat. Of course, I pretended like nothing was happening. Pretty soon, the teacher,who had been walking around the room, came down my aisle and noticed the small pond of pee and said \"Joe are you okay?\" and the fucked up kid that I was, responded - \"Yeah, I'm fine\". Of course all the kids realized what was going on and started whispering. I was sent to the nurse's office with a classmate as an escort and the kid was like - \"what happened? and I said \" \"Oh nothing\" as the bottom half of my shirt and my pants were completely soaked. Shit, my damn shoes were filled with pee and there was a sloshing sound with every step I took. \n\nI was a fucked up kid.",

There was a rash of incidents in malls downtown and I don't know if they ever caught the person. It happened to a friend. They came out of the bathroom in a hurry trying to find security. Eventually they did but by then the poop ninja had fled. The security said it was something like the 3rd time this month they'd had a report of this.\n\n\nAnyway, I just want to say it's really brave and kinda wild of you to admit being a poop ninja.

It was an extremely hot fart so I knew it was going to smell bad. 1 second later she looks at me and asks if I farted, I was embarassed and said no. Her mom responded with 'oh, its probably just raw sewage we drove by'. Yes it was definitely raw sewage........from my ass. To this day I have not admitted it was me. It is still the worst smelling fart I have ever done. I've no idea what I ate but jesus christ I almost threw up from the smell.",

            "text": "TL;DR TIFU by essentially telling my girlfriend that my type was the exact opposite of her. Sad times ensue.  \n\nObligatory \u201chappened a couple months ago,\u201d but realized I fucked up this morning.\n\nSome time back, I brought up the topic of \u2018types.\u2019 I mentioned it because her best friend and I seem to damn near be the exact same individual, just of different genders, and I joked that she must have a type. \n\nShe took it a bit more seriously than I intended and proceeded to tell me she wasn\u2019t sure she had a type, but she did like it when men were comfortable with expressing femininity, and that she thought tattoos were cool. Then she asked me my type, and I told her that generally it\u2019s been curvy blondes with long hair, big chests and blue eyes. She lightly teased me for having basic tastes and we moved on.\n\nThe past couple of months, she\u2019s been asking for constant reassurance. Asking if I\u2019m sure I like her immediately after moments of intimacy, asking if I find her attractive, etc. She also stopped coming with me to the gym, which was strange because she loves weightlifting, and has lost a lot of her muscle tone.\n\nThis morning, a woman walked past our car at a red light. I sincerely didn\u2019t notice her, but my girlfriend said, \u201cWow, look at her. She\u2019s exactly your type.\u201d I hadn\u2019t thought about that conversation since it happened, but everything made sense, instantly. I told my girlfriend that she was my type, she said, \u201cNot even close\u201d and started crying. I have only seen her cry one other time in the four years I\u2019ve known her.\n\nMy girlfriend is tall, flat-chested, muscular and has short brown hair and brown eyes. She\u2019s beautifully androgynous and occasionally people mistake her for a very pretty teenage boy. (I love and am attracted to every bit of this about her more than any other \u2018type\u2019 that exists because she\u2019s her.)\n\nShe said when she spoke about her type, she said she described a vague style pretty much anyone could embody (and I do dress and style myself a bit adventurously for a man), meanwhile I described an individual person she was in no way similar to, but always felt like she was expected to be. She said she couldn\u2019t go to the gym anymore because she\u2019d tell herself I was checking out other girls (I glance sometimes but not egregiously, and we used to do this together) and all she could think about was how unlike my ideal she was.\n\nThat one throwaway conversation has been eating away at and completely wrecked her self-esteem for months and I only just realized. Looking back,  she definitely did try to bring it up once before early on, and I brushed it off with \u201cyou\u2019re perfect for me baby don\u2019t worry about stupid stuff\u201d not understanding how bad she was feeling.\n\nSo yeah, I feel like I fucked up. Not sure what to do about it.",

I\u2019m a 100% Caucasian woman \ud83e\udd21 and I agree, there are many many stunning Asian women. But Asian is something I can never ever be. Rip my self esteem lol. I wanted to know about things he liked that he and I could explore together, which I still have none of lmao \u2620\ufe0f\n\nEdit: I agree, white men fetishising Asian women is completely fucked up. I work in an industry that already has a high rate of 0 respect for women, and my non white friends are treated even more poorly. It goes without saying that it is so wrong and no one should ever have to experience that. Our society is fucked, the casual and overt racism is appalling.\n\nI agree his comment was in poor taste. In my bf\u2019s case, I really do believe it was a thoughtless, spur of the moment comment because I am constantly pestering him about his sexual interests. I am sex obsessed and have thoroughly explored my sexuality/kinks etc, he has not, he likes it pretty vanilla. He has a general interest in all attractive women, regardless of race lol. He has never indicated that his type is Asian women, never seen any evidence of an obsession etc etc as some people are saying in their replies.\n\nMy partner definitely isn\u2019t racist, and he definitely isn\u2019t misogynistic.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t talk about his sex life because of childhood trauma, I was being completely self indulgent in my original comment. Reading the OPs story brought the feeling of that moment in time back for me.\n\nWe have explored different sexual avenues together, he\u2019s getting therapy. Too easy to make snap judgments based on a tiny minuscule fraction of peoples lives.\n\nHope everyone has a good day, unless you contribute to racial fetishisation/are generally racist/are misogynistic, in which case, have a very very very bad awful day \ud83e\udd17",

As a woman who is similarly outside that \u2018ideal,\u2019 I can also say that it\u2019s so pervasive that sometimes you don\u2019t even know how heavily it weighs on you until an offhand comment punches you in the gut. \n\nFor me? I\u2019d want my partner to take some time to apologize for hurting me (with no rationalizations or excuses, just recognizing that it was harmful and that my feelings are valid) and explicitly tell me all the things he finds attractive about me (not just physically, but including some of that as well). Depending on her reaction you could even try explaining what she has/can do that you find attractive/you like about your relationship that the \u2018type\u2019 you described doesn\u2019t/can\u2019t. Maybe do this during a long date night, where neither of us had any other obligations, or in a letter if that\u2019s more your style. \n\nIf we had previously been going to a gym together, I\u2019d probably like for my partner to say he missed me working out with him, and to invite me to work out at a time (or location) where the probability of other girls being around was low, so I could focus on our gym time and not on who else was around. I\u2019d want my partner to specifically tell me that he thought my muscles/athletic ability was attractive and that he liked seeing me push myself at the gym (or similar, adjusted for his truth). (I *wouldn\u2019t* want my partner pointing out that I\u2019d lost muscle mass, because that could feed into feeling inadequate, and like nothing I do will make me attractive enough!) \n\nAnd after that apology and trying to accommodate my insecurities with respect to activities I still might want to do with my partner, I\u2019d need a lot of smaller confidence boosts, like compliments that specifically point out something my partner found attractive (specific like \u201cI love how long your legs look in those jeans\u201d vs \u201cDamn, you\u2019re hot\u201d\u2014the second one still feels good, but the first tells me my partner has specific things he\u2019s looking at on me and finds attractive, AND includes a bonus in that it reinforces that he likes something in *my* build that his alleged \u2018type\u2019 doesn\u2019t have). Another thing my partner does that works well for me is we\u2019ll shop for clothes together, and he\u2019ll sometimes buy me something he picked for me to try on because he likes the way it highlights a particular attribute of my figure he likes. \n\nIt\u2019d take time, a thorough apology, and a lot of encouragement and support to help her rebuild that confidence. It may or may not shake out, but that\u2019s what I\u2019d recommend you try. Good luck OP",

It doesn't take into account who that person is or what they do, it's almost like, what sort of sex doll would you buy. But women don't really mean that when they talk about type, they for whatever reason mean like what type of person would you like to have sex with. It's a fundamental difference based on the fact that men and women typically view sex differently, and when you are making a decision about who to penetrate it can be as surface level as what person-shape do you find prettiest, but when you are making a decision about who to let penetrate you, the criteria becomes much different, and it would become more about the person's actual characteristics, because you want to trust this person, but also be intrigued and thrill by them, so that question is rarely as surface level as it can be for men.\n\nMy advice is to tell her that you didn't understand what context she was talking about, and you were only considering it topically and uncritically, because questions like that always seem too ethereal to really consider, and that your real type is her (make sure to note the parts of her personality or demeanor that you find attractive primarily, and maybe some of her enjoyable physical qualities as well). Part of the situation is on her, if you are honest and articulate about your feelings then it is on her if she can feel OK with that or not. If not then consider a bullet dodged, but give her a chance to be reasonable with her behavior once you tell her and it will likely improve your relationship.",

This is an insecurity that stems deeper than what you said a few months ago, you simply (unconsciously) re-opened a wound. She\u2019s the only one who can truly heal herself, but you can help her in the process by showing her how much you love each and every thing that makes her unique.

I say idiot with love, though it was probably the most hurtful thing he did to me, intentionally or unintentionally, throughout the entire 11 years we have been together. His type is athletic, shorter girls with dark straight hair, large bums, and smaller breasts- more pear shaped. I\u2019m taller than him- my hair is curly, I have very large breasts, negative butt, just zero ass, and not athletic.\n\nIf you guys stay together, I guarantee that info will live rent free in her head forever and pop up when both of you least expect it. \n\nI feel like I did what your girlfriend did, I described my \u201ctype\u201d as being someone bookish, who never lost the drive to learn new things, who was a bit more into nerdy stuff, was confident in how they carried themselves, etc. I didn\u2019t describe the way someone looked, because well.. I don\u2019t have a type in that regard? That\u2019s not to say I find everyone attractive but I don\u2019t favor one ethnicity or body shape over another. \n\nMy husband has said before he chose me for my brain and that should be better than him choosing me for my looks. Please don\u2019t say that. It is like a knife to the heart. I wanted to be both brains and beauty for someone. \n\nI wanted- and I\u2019m sure your girlfriend feels the same- to be the person my partner found to be their perfect person. You fit her mold. She realized she didn\u2019t fit in yours. She will never not feel like you didn\u2019t settle for her to some degree. \n\nThe best you can do is gradually try and convince her that being with her has changed your type to be what she is, and you wouldn\u2019t change a thing about her. She\u2019ll never believe you fully, but it will help. Get some home gym equipment, and work out with her at home. Try to not ogle people in front of her. \n\nI can\u2019t stress enough how this is actually the single biggest thing I resent about my spouse. In the throes of postpartum depression, I became very much suicidal over it when my body changed even further- I gained weight, my boobs got even bigger- and had to go on medication for intrusive thoughts (it didn\u2019t help he was inappropriately messaging someone who was perfectly his type at that time and I found out). \n\nSometimes I feel like I\u2019ve forgotten about it, for a while. Months might pass. Years sometimes. But then boom, I see something like this post (yay Reddit!) and I\u2019m right back in time and he told me all this just moments before. And it hurts. And honestly? Sometimes I wish I had never married him and had broken up with him at that point and found someone whose type I was, because then I wouldn\u2019t have to live with this knowledge that I\u2019d never be what my partner wanted, and couldn\u2019t become that no matter how hard I tried. \n\nHe\u2019s a very supportive, loving husband. A lot of good qualities. In many ways I doubt I could have a better spouse. But yeah. You fucked up. I\u2019m really sad for your girlfriend and hope others see your post and my comment as a PSA against doing this. If someone asks you your type and you have like\u2026 a body shape type or something similar, and it isn\u2019t exactly what your partner is, just DON\u2019T say it.",

Tell you are sorry that you spoke without thinking. Tell her that what you said was an old generic response to a shallow question about types and you responded from a solid place of security in your relationship because you can\u2019t imagine feeling more secure than you feel in your attraction to her. \n\nThen touch her face. Tell her what you love about her face. Tell her how it makes you feel just to be able to see her face every day. Tell her that you can see this face forever and never tire of it. Don\u2019t hold back your adoration. \n\nContinue to her neck, then her shoulders and when you get to her breasts, hold them close together and kiss them. Use your palms to hold them both. Don\u2019t go straight to the nipples. Love the whole of her chest. \n\nThen give her a full body massage slowly and with oil. Talk about everything you love about her body. Take this moment to share with her all the things you love about her. \n\nThere\u2019s so much you can do with this. There is so much potential for healing and bringing healing energy to both of you. \n\nHave some fancy snacks that you can feed her as you blanket her with your love and adoration.

And, at the end of the day, personality is what impacts attraction the most. We're in relationships with people, not pictures. \n\nI empathize with the emotional conflict OP's girlfriend is having and I hope she can get to a place where she can see it as a compliment rather than an insult.",

She also may have caught flack for being \"manly\" and even tall. What you said, while completely casual and with no malice, pretty much shattered her confidence in your attraction to her.\n\nYou know her better than me. But if this happened to me, this is what would make me feel better:\n\n\"I want you to know I was just listing off the most common traits across all my girlfriends/women I wanted to pursue. I've been thinking harder about it, and I'd say my type is more (list her qualities, physical and personality wise - like, if you love how muscular her thighs are, or her butt, etc, mention that in a general sense - 'I like muscular legs. I like strong arms.' etc)\n\nI don't want to be with anyone else more than you. I didn't even notice that woman the other day. I never wish you looked different. You're so hot, you're (insert favorite trait here - funny, loving, etc, all of the above), and I am so sorry that I said what I said without clarifying. You are PERFECT, babe.\"\n\nIt doesn't need to be a whole speech but, if you reassure her like this I bet she'll cry and hug you. Bonus points if said over her favorite meal. \ud83d\ude02\n\nYou're a sweetheart. I hope she feels better. You didn't do anything wrong, just...us women have hangups about our bodies that rear their ugly heads at the worst times. Then our insecurities are like a dog with a bone; our brains won't let them fuckin rest, and we overanalyze everything, it drives us nuts. Having a supportive partner helps a ton there, as does being super honest. I just tell my other half outright: \"Dude, I don't believe this. I promise I don't think this about you. But my anxiety is yelling at me so can you just reassure my dumb ass please\" lmao. Let her know she can be open about how she's feeling and you will help. It feels so much better to be able to ask my boyfriend to help me fight my shitty inner voice \ud83d\ude02",

And the last time I went skiing, I had to get the widest pair of boots they had and even then, my calves were constricted all day. \n\nIt\u2019s a very tough issue to fix, if one is inclined to try. Like you, I eventually lost a bunch of muscle mass without intending it (during the pandemic), and I was finally ok with my thighs and calves. However, the loss of muscle was absolutely not a *healthy* development. \n\nIt\u2019s a real mindfuck when you find that your legs/other body parts look more *conventionally* attractive *because* you\u2019re ill, starving or have lost muscle due to becoming super sedentary.

He has shown me his dating profiles on mixerdates which I thought was straight up delusional. But since I didn\u2019t wanna have an uncomfortable conversation with him and was certain he wouldn\u2019t hit, I didn\u2019t bring it up.\n\nBut recently he actually brought a girl over who looked decent and really cute. An actual real-life Japanese girl. She swings by for his date and I\u2019m trying so hard to contain myself and want to high-five him so bad. Anyhow he goes out with her and turns out she got really weirded out by him cos he kept bringing up these anime references thinking she would get it and reciprocate. I don\u2019t know what to say, except I knew it would happen.\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s a really nice guy, just that he needs to drop the Japanese girl anime pedestal thing and be more normal. So i sit him down, and start telling him how it\u2019s super weird to real females and how they aren\u2019t like that and how if he gets out of this mentality, it would definitely improve his chances.. He starts crying and doesnt want to talk to me anymore, he is also moving out next week. I lost a friend and someone to help pay the rent.\n\nTL;DR: Don't try and get someone out of their fantasy place, regardless of what good you think you are doing for them.",

Most Japanese girls are just normal people, not anime characters. They like fashion, cafes, cute animals, drinking at bars and variety television.

Like WEIRD for me.  As an Asian male in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, being Asian felt like more of a liability to me than anything so it was a full turnabout from what I had experienced and it was strange.

Second....of all the places a person could be from that it would be offensive to refer to them as that....like do you know the history of Taiwan and China?\"\n\nSo Paul gave me shit and said I was overreacting and she didn't mind.  I said well if she doesn't mind that's between you and her, but how would you feel if I called you \"My Russian Friend\"?  He said he wouldn't mind so I dropped it.\n\nThey didn't last long and my friendship with Paul drifted into nothing over the n ext few years.

It would be like if she came to your house for the first time and she saw the old japanese imperial flag plastered across your wall, an old imperial army uniform and sword, and you looked her dead serious in the eye and said \"Nippon banzai!\"",

American sports have youth leagues that get you up to about 10 to 12, and then you start to join travel teams/clubs and school teams.\n\nAnd definitely, for musicians, most of the serious ones take private lessons or have a music school they attend at a young age.\n\nThe marriage between schools and activities, I think it's a function of the US being so large and the pop density being much less.  Also, the early paradigm for education in the US was the community schools system, where the school functioned as a community hub, providing athletic resources like fields, courts, pools and tracks to the community or neighborhood use.\n\nThat's gone out of style in the last 40 years with mostly negative consequences, especially in urban/rural neighborhoods.  But for football, especially, the school team functions like a u18 club centered around the geography of the school's district and our college teams like a u25 semi pro team.",

I was in charge of cooking the Christmas turkey for the first time this year so I got up early, seasoned it, and put it in the oven. I\u2019ve been basting every hour or so and I just pulled it out of the oven. Then my mom and grandma started freaking out because I cooked the turkey breast side down. I genuinely didn\u2019t know that there was a right side up for cooking a turkey. It is thoroughly cooked and it\u2019s not burnt or anything but they are acting like I ruined Christmas. Now they are saying that they can\u2019t trust me to do anything and I\u2019m completely incompetent. They are trying to figure out where to get a turkey in a hurry since this one is ruined. I was in the middle of baking a cake but now I\u2019ve been ejected from the kitchen until it is time for me to do the dishes (usually the people who cook the meal don\u2019t have to do dishes in my family).\n\nTLDR: I cooked the turkey upside down and now I\u2019m banned from the kitchen\n\nUpdate: The guys of the house and I ate the turkey and it was genuinely the best turkey I ever had! The ladies sat there glaring the whole meal and refused to touch anything I made. I helped with dishes just to keep the peace since I\u2019m home from college for another almost 2 weeks. Many lessons were learned today and I am probably going to cook the turkey upside down for the rest of my life!",

My mother in law died, and my dad moved to another town so there was noone else's house to migrate to for the holidays. My first year alone was the best turkey I had ever had in my life. I thawed it out a few days, then did a dry salt brine on it and let it sit in the fridge for 3 days until Thanksgiving. It came out so moist, so tender, so juicy and flavorful. This was when I realized that everyone I know sucks at making turkey, they just suck so hard.\n\nNow my turkeys are just getting better every year. I decided on spatchcocking it every year now, as it cooks more evenly and a LOT quicker. I add herbs and spices, always trying new things. Next year make your own turkey and show your family how incompetent they really are...",

I still couldn't eat mushrooms for like 10 years after that though, because of the flavor association with puking. \n\nI totally thought it was the dish that made me sick until I got older and learned how bacteria operate. I wish I could have practiced mind over matter on mushrooms earlier in life!\n\nAnother interesting and related tidbit, it's recommended to bring cancer patients who are going through chemo odd foods. Rootbeer flavored candies are a common one, because if you bring them their favorite foods, they may no longer like them after chemo because of how sick the chemo makes them.

            "text": "So, the lady that lives next for just came by to \"thank me for giving them a giggle.\" The **FedEx guy** (I accidentally slandered our mail lady) accidentally delivered a package for them to my house, and ofc I was gonna go drop it off. It's, like, 30 steps round trip.\n\nWell, I overthink everything. I set it on their porch in front of the gate that goes across their steps, and went to walk away. Then, I was like, \"oh, but I'm not sure if they're actually home right now, so what if they go to leave the house and knock it down the stairs with the gate? That wouldn't be very fun and I'd feel awful if whatever's in the box is broken...\"\n\nSo I picked it up and moved it to the other side of the gate. But then I realized it was getting dark, and I didn't want them to open the gate and trip over it, so I picked it back up. I want to avoid bothering them, so coming back later when I see (or hear, because she's a borky girl) the dog let out is absolutely out of the question. At this point, I'm just holding the package and walking up to the porch and stepping back to try and gauge where the streetlight would hit their porch when it kicks on, and I eventually settle on a good spot and half run home bc thank goodness nobody's ever going to see this! \n\nWell, after asking what the neighbor meant by that, she explained that it was really funny to see me just basically walking in circles, especially if you speed the footage up a bit. She showed me the footage. I do, in fact, look like an idiot, but it is, in fact, kind of hilarious. At one point, it even kind of looks like I'm waltzing with the box.\n\ntl;dr I tried to do something nice by returning a misdelivered package, ended up looking like an idiot, and may or may not end up in a TikTok with the Benny Hill theme song playing while I goofily stumble around trying to figure out where to put a box on a porch.\n\nediting to add a couple things: First of all, I don't have the footage. My neighbor showed it to me on her phone. I didn't tell her not to post it anywhere, but my face also doesn't hide what I'm feeling so I'm pretty sure she could see that i wasn't comfortable with the whole thing. Second (due to pressure from random people in the comments), I've written her a note to see if she does plan on uploading it anywhere. If she does end up posting it, I'll add the link to this post, but as for right now I'm keeping my physical self off of Reddit as I do enjoy the fact that nobody here knows what I look like.\n\nJust another edit bc someone dmed me that this is \"definitely going to end up in a Smosh video\": Hello, Shayne/Dad! Please feature Damien in my episode.",

Nicely balanced, she started pushing it to her house.  When she hit the top of the driveway, she failed to account for the slight incline toward the street and the dolly got away from her and started rolling toward the street.  She started running after it.  I was laughing so hard that a few coworkers came to check on me.  When I got home I went to pick it up and when I saw her I lost it.

One time, for some reason or other I went with my wife and really had nothing to do. So I did what any guy would do, I started miming two parts of a very over the top bank heist for about 10 minutes to their porch camera. About a week later my wife gets a call as her bestie and hubby are dying laugh at my ridiculous miming that hubby found as he was doing a quick review of the week's footage.\n\nSo you accidentally did what took me planning and thinking. :-D Good stuff OP, you need to lean into this and make sure to wave extra every time you see them.\n\nedit: like a Peewee Herman wave without the spanking.
