            "text": "I've been a fan of hip hop for over two decades and I aint seen nothing like this. \n\nYou have to be an absolute drake glazer to disagree, this beef is over, at least on wax. The winner is indisputably Kendrick Lamar.\n\nWe will definitely see fall out from all this, but this phase is over. I dont wanna hear no more debates. \n\nEdit: Peep game since I see this comment floating around a lot (and rightfully so). \n\nI am not saying Kendrick is telling the truth, and Drake is lying. I am saying I believe Kendrick over Drake any day. There is a reason why Kendrick's narrative is overtaking Drake's. Pusha said it best \"We talkin' character\".\n\nKendrick has proven throughout his career what kind of man he is. Overall, he is trustworthy and has been spotless of scandals. Drake, on the other hand, has been caught lying multiple times. Has actual links to possible pedophilia, his persona is all about sex and using women (I mean, look at his CLB cover), and many more things as to why people are more likely to believe Kendrick and doubt Drake. \n\nYes, if someone comes with proof, then the tides can turn, but that probably isn't going to happen. Drake is reaping and sowing. What is making him lose in this beef now is his character. This is why Kendrick wins. \n\nEdit 2: This man went and dropped a Dj Mustard produced club banger now. It really is over. Drake needs Jesus at this point. \n\nEdit 3: Drake just dropped. It is officially over. The dude needed to come with a guillotine and came with a paper cut. The Heart part 6 is a white flag. Kendrick the indisputable GOAT of the generation. ",

The way I see it, the beef was already over when it went nearly international as various hip hop outlets around the world and even general media outlets from every corner started reporting on this beef. Given the very nature and narratives of it all, It was always a slippery slope to begin with and by scooping so low and provoking Kendrick by namedropping his fiance and whatnot, Drake made yet another mistake, the same mistake he made when he was beefing with Pusha T. He never learns. It's done for Drake; from now on, you are going to be forever remembered by the masses that you are a certified pedophile.",

Yes hes not as hollwyood/pop star like as drake is, he's more private etc but it doesn't really sound like his hands are remotely clean especially RE: treatment of females.\n\nEven on a basic level of the song itself. Kendrick claims moral superiority but also wishes direct death on drake, calls him a paedophile sympathizer and trafficker of females and writes a fake narrative to the guys kid/kids, for them to listen to in future about their dad being an evil monster who should be locked up with Weinstein etc. All with next to no real evidence.\n\nLike you say in the court of public opinion, truth doesn't really figure as the winner is the one with the most compelling narrative and most vicious angles which in this case is Kendrick but I just cant help thinking that people are always swayed by the most shocking lines and supposedly 'clever' narratives no matter where the truth lies or whether the bars themselves are stronger or not. It's like whoever has the most salacious gossip and presents it the best wins.",

While production never reached previous highs in quality with the exception of a spin off throwaway project .The Drake character continued to enjoy chart success in an area of streams and tiktok dance bullshit he was king but the boy was never the same and would rely heavily on features from artists such as Future and 21 savage to carry him whilst forgetting who the artist Aubrey was.Many have questioned the characters relevance to the culture with the likes of Pusha T exposing the lover boy women friendly person but the powers that be have kept the show on air as s money making machine the Drake character is too lucrative\nKendrick Lamar is currently directing the Drake character  in his first and last horror series latest addition called Meet the Graham's opened to rave reviews jury's out on whether it will be a career ending project for Aubrey as he's shyed away from any serious role and taken a more kid friendly approach during his career. Rumour has it the film would be classified pg13 and could feature Aubrey in a role with younger female costars to his delight however this has not been confirmed.Due to creative disputes with Lemar and outburst on Instagram and twitter it seems the two are still locked in a battle of creative differences when Kendrick suggested the character take on the role of a Loving Father rather than Loverboy to Aubreys dismay as his bad bitch mobtie  character Arc had been doing so well up until now.",

He made 2 classic, classic albums with TPAB being best rap album ever, then his quality dipped with DAMN and MMATBS. Yet because he is appointed as the critical darling, he gets his automatic 8.5+ ratings, his Grammys, his Fantano slurping, a Pulitzer (lol), and other dumb stuff. Some of Mr. Morale is meandering nonsense (some is really good), and he is leaning into using all these dumb inflections and voices that make him sound like Cartman. In addition, he's putting on his cousin Baby Keem whose album was like 60% unlistenable (except the opener and the song \"16.\") And also pandering to woke stuff while still dabbling in Keem's misogyny, Future collabs, etc.\n\nMMATBS is not a good enough album to justify the 5 year wait. Be more prolific. And stop with the dumb voices and inflections. Finally, his next prominent move in the public eye is to jump on an adversarial thing and be all machismo with Like That? After MMATBS was about therapy, finding peace with yourself, coming to terms that you're a toxic/terrible person, your family's cycle of sexual abuse and a trans cousin? You jump from that to \"ay yo f\\*\\*\\*\\* J Cole and Drake they suck I'm king?\" It's just odd and maybe speaks to him backing down from the notion that he and PGLang were post-rap, doing modern art and filmmaking and all this shit. Honestly it feels like he's figured out that he isn't actually good with the new direction of being an artistic curator or whatever the f\\*\\*\\* it was supposed to be.\n\nDrake is not a good person now. But he has a few great albums in Take Care, IYRTITL, NWTS. His quality dropped right when Kendrick's did. Yes, DAMN is better than what Drake has put forward since. The gap is closer on actual merit than the music world cares to admit. But Drake, or Team Drake, has at least remained prolific and still makes hits. Drake hasn't resorted to idiotic voices like Kendrick or late career Eminem.\n\nDrake has significant issues. He's a bit of a delusional rockstar. He's a 38 year old whose taste in women is 20ish years younger. His songs have become formulaic since Views really. He still has acting inclinations, flipping between tough and sensitive, Black/White/Patois, the mob boss and the desperate kid. He is using a ton of ghostwriters.\n\nBut despite all of Drake's flaws, he has landed significant shots on Kendrick (tbh, so did J Cole before he backed down) and has changed the way I felt about Kendrick artistically post-TPAB. I have not changed how I felt about Drake.",

Kendrick has a track record of activism, and giving back to the la community. The mayor of the area spoke of the hundreds of thousands that Kendrick has donated to the area to improve different aspects of the community, and you can check his fucking twitter and see he\u2019s hosted events for families in la.

Kendrick story telling is so good that even things we already know about Drake sounded ten times harsher.\n\nDrake last respond overall is another bimbo whim, with some good bars but no actual complexity in it, drake is a limited artist when it comes to expression and that\u2019s why I can\u2019t see him winning this battle.",

Kendrick and Drake have been \u201csneak dissing\u201d each other, which just means the rhymes they write are clearly about each other but no names dropped so there\u2019s always been some deniability.\n\nThis past year Drake released a song with J Cole titled First Person Shooter. On that record, Cole makes many references to the \u201cbig 3\u201d of hip hop, meaning Drake, Cole and Kendrick. It was a big record.\n\nFast forward to just about a month or two ago, out of nowhere Kendrick dropped a verse on a song called Like That where he explicitly says things like \u201cfuck the big 3, it\u2019s just big me\u201d as well as calling out Drake (he called out Cole lightly as well).\n\nThat prompted a response diss track from J Cole pretty quickly thereafter but almost immediately after release, Cole bowed out. He said his spirit wasn\u2019t in it. He initially got a lot of flak for that move but looking back, he probably had a good idea how ugly a lot of these accusations were going to get.\n\nSince then, Drake dropped a couple diss tracks in a row basically just hounding on the fact that Kendrick is short, accused him of cheating on his wife and slapping her around, and claimed he heard one of Kendrick\u2019s kids is actually not biologically his among other things. Kendrick then dropped a couple diss tracks also back to back in which he claims Drake is a culture vulture, master manipulator and, most scathingly, a pedophile.\n\nThis latest diss track dropped by Drake is a what makes a lot of people think he\u2019s waving a white flag as the energy in his voice is down and he\u2019s spent a lot of time denying accusations made by Kendrick.\n\nNeither artist has dropped one lick of proof, mind you. Everything you\u2019re reading online is just speculation and people taking sides. That\u2019s pretty much the long and short of it based on what I know. Hope it helps.",

He told Drake in a couple different ways to stay in the dance/pop genre, and stay out of rap.

They have always been lumped together as the top of that generation. For the longest time, Kendrick and drake have been subliminally insulting eachother here and there. Not all is public knowledge but it's been relatively well known that they aren't friends. \nNow skipping forward to last year, drake dropped a song with j. Cole called \"First Person Shooter\" where Cole drops a bar about Kendrick, Cole and drake being the big 3 \"like they started the league\". While this obviously isn't an insult, Kendrick views hip-hop as more competitive than that and treated it like an insult, because he views himself as a superior artist to Cole and drake. \nSkip forward to last month, future dropped a song called \"like that\" with a Kendrick feature that, for the first time, took direct shots. He said \" f the big 3 its just big me\" and a bunch of other lines directed more specifically at drake. \nThis obviously ignited the internet, and since then discourse has gone crazy everywhere about who's the best artist, who needs to diss who etc. \nAfter this Cole dropped a song called 7 minute drill. In which he responds to Kendrick and insults him back. However after a few days, in a public display he apologized for his diss track, saying he didn't mean what he said and wants out of this beef.\nSince then drake dropped a full diss track \"Push-Ups\" and a secondary diss track \"Taylor made freestyle\". \nAnd today Kendrick dropped his full nuclear response which is what's being discussed here. \nHope that helps",

Cole was on the song First Person Shooter which was supposed to be this hip-hop allstars thing with the biggest rappers in the game (essentially like \u201cForever\u201d with Eminem, Lil Wayne, Drake and Kanye). Kendrick is not on the track (he likely turned down a feature request). \n\n- J. Cole makes reference to Kendrick on that song, stating that Kendrick, Drake and himself is \u201cthe big three\u201d\n\n- Kendrick then takes numerous digs at both Drake and Cole on the song \u201cLike That\u201d (mostly going at Drake though). Amongst other things, he states \u201cFuck the big 3, it\u2019s just big me\u201d\n\n- J. Cole then responds with a super weak diss track (7 minute drill), which he deletes and apologizes for a few days later. \n\n- Drake\u2019s Kendrick diss track \u201cPush Ups\u201d leaks and it\u2019s actually good compared to Cole\u2019s attempt. Song officially releases about a week after the leak. Drake takes shots at Kendrick and numerous other people \n\n- Kendrick release this. You can listen for yourself\n\n\nEdit: I forgot Drake also released a diss where he used an AI voice filter to disguise his voice as Tupac and Snoop Dogg to diss Kendrick. Didn\u2019t go down well with anyone",

A couple of the bars felt downright sloppy flow/syllable wise and there was nothing crazy lyrically wise. As well as explaining some of his own lyrics as if genius lyrics and annoying Kendrick nerds (like me) won\u2019t pick up the slack on that. At times it kind of reminded me of that bad Australian rap battle video. \n\nThe gay lines were out of character for Kendrick and the real women line seemed weird and targeted towards the women instead of drake. Gunna stray was weird.  \n\nBUT\u2026\n\nOf course kendrick isn\u2019t going to drop his nuke. He wants to see Drake drop HIS nuke first and he\u2019s giving him the opportunity to do that. He doesn\u2019t want to end it now because he loves the sport but also because he still wants to have the last word. \n\nSo we can\u2019t judge it on what shocking new info was introduced. And Drake\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d info is just him lying. Kendrick made the better song with better production and higher highs.\n\nThe only other theory that makes sense is that he\u2019s going to pull a back to back and drop a much better track Friday. If he does that then we pretty much know for certain that Drake has no red button. Which makes no sense because why would Drake bluff so hard knowing Kendrick can legitimately body him? That being said, he can always hit us with the classic \u201cI just couldn\u2019t drop it\u201d and take no hit on his career as always.

All dude said was, \"Yo, I don't think Kendrick intentionally did that as a hidden meaning. I think that's just your interpretation.\"\n\nIt's not about \"poetic sensitivity\". Ppl can still be open to interpretations but also be realistic when it comes to an artist's intent. All this \"you become dead inside\" is ridiculous. You're obviously an emotional person, cool. People enjoy and connect with music all the same regardless of their opinion on the validity/truth of certain meanings & inferences  derived from a song. Something can MEAN something to YOU. Something can be reasonable. That doesn't make it true. In terms of diss tracks sometimes the artist hides something hidden in a creative way and other times ppl over-analyze & come to conclusions that don't seem realistic or likely.\n\nThat's it.",

It's literally how you determine who was actually the most clever. It's a disstrack, it's a video to a disstrack. If it was more like, \"This is what it means to me.\" Then cool. But if you're saying shit then concluding/suggesting Kendrick intentionally did something then falling back to \"use your imagination\" & \"where is your poetic sensitivity\" when someone disagrees then you're beyond corny as fuck, lmfao.\n\nMost people who analyze disstracks go in trying to be objective and realistic. Not with the intent to just consuming \"poetry\" and finding out what it means to them. It doesn't mean they lack imagination or \"poetic sensitivity\". There is a place and time & for this that is how they choose to handle it.

We gon' kill all you motherfuckers!\" And \"All of y'all motherfuckers, fuck you, die slow motherfucker\nMy .44 make sho' all y'all kids don't grow!\" \n\nGoing to show that drakes fans don't actually listen to rap at all and only listen to Drake. Because anyone that has listened to rap and especially any older rap beefs would know that there were regular threats to kill each other, and at times, they did kill each other! \n\nThe cherry on top is drake then saying in The Pedo pt. 6 that he would slit Kendricks throat. \n\nLike how is that not crossing a line if what Kendrick said somehow is?\n\n\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21 All of them",

It's hard to come back from that, especially when his \"nuclear bomb\" is partly dedicated to this person who seems to be fictional. From a pure battle rap perspective it isn't even close.

The slightest bit of digging would help you find that out rather than just blindly supporting everything Drake does. In Kendricks song We Cry Together he tells people to stop listening to R Kelly and other bad/problematic people, and has said similar things in both his music and in person \n\nR Kelly has writing credits on Certified Lover Boy, FYI. \n\nThe fact that Drake was texting MBB anything about missing her, talking about boys, etc when she was 14 and he was in his 30s is mad weird. He also said on Billie Eilish IG when she turned 18 that \"he had been waiting. There's a video of him touching on a 17 yr old girl after she told him she was 17. And that's not even all of the allegations, there's more. Even in the Heart Part 6 Drake's whole response was to say that he knew he'd be compared to Epstein and that he never touched MBB in that way!? Neither of those names were mentioned anywhere in Kendricks diss tracks???\n\nThrowing your whole support and identity behind any celebrity as if they could do no wrong is weird to me. If there's legitimate proof and not just speculation of any artist, even the ones that I like, comes out I will of course condemn the actions of that person. So yeah I'm gonna go ahead and say Drake's behavior is weird af and should be investigated further, and I can do that because I'm not a stan \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Another example is at the beginning when he says 'the people you're getting info from are clowns' and then goes on to say his own camp was doing the leaks. Like I see how that could get by you on a first draft, but did you not proofread your lyrics even once and go 'hmm maybe I should rephrase this so it can't be used to make me look dumb'? \n\nI thought Family Matters was a real good track, better than Push Ups and a fair fight against Euphoria but my overall impression of THP6 is that it just feels like a first draft.

Eminem was on the radio a lot back in the late 90s and early 2000s. Even on rock stations, alternative stations, everywhere. Hearing him on the alternative station my parents listened to when I was younger was my first exposure to modern rap, and is what initially got me interested in hearing more.\n\nThat being said, I don't really listen to much after the Eminem show, it's just not my taste after that. I think some of his youngest fans don't know anything lol they've decided he's the goat (which is fair ig) and the actual God of rap. They're crazy and terminally online lol. The gatekeeping, edgy for the sake of edgy, \"you kids are so soft you couldn't possibly understand slim shady\" gen x fans though? That's a whole other level",

It's fine if you like his music. Even his....questionable newer stuff, but the way they even try and defend his shitty actions is ridiculous. \n\nOld school purists are all super annoying too. The Biggie, Pac, etc fans who think rap hasn't been good for 20 years.  \n\nBasically they're all just as bad as each other. Eminems is definitely NOT any worse than the others. They're all equally terrible the deeper you delve into their respective fanbases.",

He kind of lost me after that with Encore & Eminem Show as he was clearly leaning into a gimmick. His music became very camp/corny around that time but it\u2019s ultimately what propelled his career. It felt like he was making music specifically for MTV but the numbers showed that it worked.\n\nThen over time he (after MTV died) he tried to reset his career in a more serious path which ultimately led to a long string of seriously mid, 5.0/10-rated releases. At this point the people who preferred his more serious music already moved on because they had to deal with 3-4 straight cornball albums in a row. The popular radio crowd who only liked him for his campiness also didn\u2019t vibe with his more serious style so they also kind of fell off. But then, you have this third type of fan\u2026 the *riders*. \n\nLook, I don\u2019t hate Eminem. While I don\u2019t listen to his music anymore, I respect what he\u2019s done for himself in such a competitive industry. His awards aren\u2019t unrecognized by me. But that third group, the *riders*, are so fucking cringe that it inadvertently makes me dislike him by proxy. \n\nThey believe that he is objectively the best rapper to ever exist, that the industry is just out to get him, that he\u2019s some Messiah that\u2019s going to uproot the genre in his 40\u2019s, that he\u2019s the most offensive rapper, and so on. Let me be blunt, though \u2014\n\nEminem\u2019s lyrics were never deep. Never. Everything he says is so baseline that a random stranger completely unfamiliar with him could listen to any song and turn their brain off while still fully understanding the exact meaning behind each of his lyrics. He raps fast, rhymes a lot, and makes pop culture references aaaand that\u2019s\u2026 about it. His actual lyricism is pretty weak, but the *riders* hear a lot of words fast, some of which rhyme, and they shit their fucking pants in excitement.\n\nThe industry is out to get him? Uhhh no bro the industry is out to profit off of him. People think because he said faggot a lot in the early 2000s and got censored by the FCC on television for it (as they would for ANYONE), that the industry hates him? People really don\u2019t understand that *the industry* are the labels and their masters and they want nothing more than to see him succeed as he was once their copy+paste=$ breadwinner. The industry != the culture != censorship bureaus.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s \u2018too offensive\u2019 for today\u2019s listeners\u201d is also straight cope cap. They make it seem like people are *literally shaking* when they listen to him because he\u2019s sooo edgy xD. Bruh his shit is so fucking mild. The only thing he ever did that was \u201coffensive\u201d was say faggot a few times over 20 years ago. Nothing he can say will even come close to the **standard** of rap music today and there\u2019s no shot he\u2019s gonna start dropping f-bombs again (not that I want him too but that would actually be impressive and show he is that \u201cidgaf\u201d boy they all claim him to be). \n\nThere\u2019s so much more but I already wrote a novel so ima just leave it there. TL;DR: Eminem is fine as an artist but his dickriders are unbearable fantasy dwellers.",

As Kendrick sings and raps his unique human experience and his best is when he's introspective with himself he looks at us the audience and through his silence and acknowledgement of his journey of contemplation and betterment his dares us to do the same on our own unique life's paths through the forest.  And change in my behavior and mental person hood toward a better self actualized human being has occured by the wavelength Kendrick helped me do better in. \n\nEminem is one of my favorites, he's had songs I've teared up, he's moved me, and helped me feel less crazy as an outlet of madness. Plus I am and I'm convinced his also has ADHD/ASD like myself so the insanity feels like being seen an has voltage and amps in the current of electricity his rap convey, to me. To each their own.\n\nHowever no one other than Kendrick has moved my soul toward betterment in the same way. I am a better person in life and toward my fellow humans, I have more confidence in myself through my betterment that when the music turns off, I still explore the forest.\n\nMy friends know Kendrick is my #1 and how he sublimated Drake, which makes me feel good. I've never liked Drake he like the opposite of my grandmothers Mexican cooking, he's inauthentic. Hip-Hop and Metal were always my favorite genres of music because they displayed honest human emotion so elegantly and honestly.

                    "body": "My best friend is a huge Eminem fan, got his kids (before they were 10) listening to Em, constantly has Em on the playlist, and is always asking me if I\u2019ve heard the new Em song.\n\nEm was my favourite when I was a teenager.  We\u2019re 40 now.  I respect Em\u2019s talent, and am happy for the life he has built for himself, but his music generally does nothing for me.  The new song is catchy, but it won\u2019t be getting many spins from me personally.\n\nThis same friend, despite claiming Em is his favourite rapper, and the GOAT, couldn\u2019t for the life of him tell me who Em\u2019s favourite rapper is, never mind know who \u201cReggie\u201d is.  \n\nThis same friend constantly asks me about lyrics, \u201cwhat do you think he meant by that.\u201d  I explain it, because I generally understand most of what Em says when he raps.  My friend comes up with the wildest interpretations of what Em says, even completely makes up words to fit his narrative, and then tells me I\u2019m wrong when I basically quote Genius to him.  His reply is usually \u201cwtf is genius.\u201d  I\u2019m like bro, you could look up the lyrics on Google, instead of guessing, but he\u2019d rather guess.\n\nWhen I mentioned the Kendrick / Drake beef, this same friend claimed that he had never heard a Kendrick song before in his life (even called Kalendrick Omar, or whatever).  This same friend and his entire family, kids included, constantly say \u201cya bish\u201d to one another\u2026.and yet he says he doesn\u2019t know where he got that slang from (we used to listen to Money Trees all the time on a friend\u2019s boat).\n\nThis same friend, and entire family, has sunk hundreds of hours into GTA5, and yet still claims to not know who Kendrick is lol.\n\nAnd like OP said, the IYKYK part with my friend is 100% there.  His playlist is nothing but white rappers, sprinkled with some 50 Cent, G-Unit, Dre, and some Pac.  He\u2019s never heard of J Cole, claims he never heard of Kendrick, never heard of Jadakiss and the LOX, never heard of Outkast, despite Em naming them as his favourite rappers, in songs.  Most definitely has never heard of any of the young rappers out right now.  He knows Tom McDonald, but I don\u2019t even think he knows Jack Harlow lol.\n\nAnd yes, tbc, lately I constantly question the friendship.  We\u2019ve been close for 15 years, his kids are like my niece and nephew, but ever since Covid lockdowns, his brain has become rotted by tiktok and IG, and he wasn\u2019t the sharpest tool in the shed to begin with.\n\nHe also thinks Kill Shot was the greatest diss song of all time, despite the fact that he can\u2019t even name Ether, Who Shot Ya, Hit Em Up, Back Down, Back to Back, No Vaseline, The Story of Adidon, and still hasn\u2019t listened to a single track from the Kendrick & Drake beef.\n\nHe\u2019s the living definition of an Eminem Stan, but doesn\u2019t know the first fucking thing about hip hop and rap music.\n\nHe also completely misses the point of a lot of Eminem songs.  My friend actually thinks that Em hates gay people.  I\u2019m like, you realize he\u2019s explained multiple times that he says that shit just goofing around, and that he doesn\u2019t actually have anything against them.  I told my friend that one of Em\u2019s kids was non-binary, and he refused to believe me.  The bit in the new song about Em showing up to a cypher wearing a Bud Light t-shirt went completely over his head.  He thinks Em would support Trump, despite the fact that Em made a song saying the exact opposite.  \n\nIt would be funny, if it wasn\u2019t so sad.",

Kendrick has been the only one to provide receipts - Meet The Grahams picture and the 20 minute release after Drake dropped Family Matters. If Drake wants to stay in the game he's gotta show some proof past quoting a Twitter thread x.x and even then he still didn't properly handle the pedo allegations. Invoking Epstein (instead dof Weinstein) in the song and following it with, \"If I was a pedo I would be arrested\", and \"in too important to be a pedo.\" is absolutely wild.

Kendrick\u2019s motivation for calling you a pedophile stems from his own trauma of not being believed that his cousin wasn\u2019t a pedophile?\n\n\nOccam Razor\u2019s tells me Drake just misremembered the song, skimmed through it a bit, and wanted to say something that would get under Kendrick skin. But who knows maybe he was giving some Freudian level childhood assessment of motivation for adult actions lmao",

As soon as Not Like Us came out no one even cared about the fake daughter anymore. Drake clearly got finessed and I\u2019m happy about it but I still think Kendrick got tricked but was clever enough to cover it up which is why he is amazing.

That\u2019s my bad.\n\nRegardless though, Drake is sitting on pedo allegations and deadbeat allegations. If he masterminded and truly tricked Kendrick he can put all of that to rest by showing the receipts and prove Kendrick as a liar. Why is he letting this hurt his image even more?",

He moved from his wife and hasn\u2019t seen the kids in half a year apparently.\n\nYou can make the same leaps to equally prove that either of these crimes are true so as a neutral opinion I see them both as false, but I do find it annoying how Drake gets heat but Kendrick does not.\n\nEdit: Lastly I want to mention, Kendrick comes off as a hypocrite regardless, because if he\u2019s lying about shit he\u2019s everything he\u2019s said about Drake in terms of a liar and a manipulator, if he\u2019s right why tf did he hold on this info for a rap beef and if he\u2019s about protecting the kids why does he have a convicted rapist on his last album. Kodak really doesn\u2019t add much to the message",

We can\u2019t say he\u2019s sitting around when there was an attempt.\n\nMy issue with this whole topic is that no one can look at Kendrick Lamar and see hypocrisy, no one can say anything accountable on Kendrick\u2019s side. I\u2019m not a Drake Stan I\u2019m just tired of seeing how everyone can agree Drake bad, but Kendrick good when there is evidence on both sides that both people are bad.\n\nKendrick preaches black woman ontop and praises them in songs and music videos, but had an actual addiction to white woman. Calls Drake a deadbeat but moves across the county without his kids, and is clicking up w future (the biggest deadbeat in rap) and metro (being 20 and @ a 13 year old saying u wanna fuck is wild idc if it\u2019s a joke). calls Drake a pedo but platformed a convicted pedo on his album and let\u2019s keep it a buck Kodak contributed next to nothing (Mr moral my favorite rap album of 2020\u2019s next to the forever story).\n\nAt what point do we acknowledge ANYTHING at all.

He's a UMG artist and Republic is a subsidiary of UMG. Epic is not; it's under Sony. So the circumstances make it perfectly possible that it is as Metro claims.\n\nEDIT to add: Metro appears to be with an imprint of Republic, making the whole collab with Future a joint project between Republic and Epic. Kendrick is distributed by UMG so he and Drake and Metro are sorta all under that umbrella.\n\nEDIT 2: i see you rewriting the comment I replied to. Cool. To your new points, yes, Drake clearly doesn't actually have the pull to keep Like That off radio. Doesn't mean he wouldn't try, or that his handlers at UMG wouldn't humor him by going through the motions. \n\nLook, I'm not saying it did happen.

Crushing the van was even the cherry on top. That's why the response was dropped less than an hour later. It completely overshadowed Drake's move. \n\nThe heart part 6 though, many things have been said about it, but as the day has gone by, people are clowning more and more on him. He says many things, but only a few hit home. \"Nah Drake\" trending really shows how people are feeling about this. I feel like Kendrick is letting this stew, at least is what I would do. Seems like the more time passes the more damage that gets done to his image\n\nEdit: on second thought. This is probably over",

Not that he needs to and he already said it, but to show he wasn\u2019t bluffing when he said he got 5 more songs on the roster.

So there is part of it you could look at and say \u2018well shit, Kendrick didn\u2019t come with them\u2019.

This beef been brewing in a pot and it\u2019s just now heating up\u2026 this is Kendrick vs something disgusting. This is a man who values integrity and actual talent. Nothing about Drake is the right kind of talent. Sales? Who cares. Charts? Who the fuck cares? I\u2019ll tell you one thing. Kendrick isn\u2019t in this game to exploit the industry like Drake is. Kendrick is a poet he is here to make art. He is a real artist making real music. I bet you never listen to Kendrick songs do you? I bet you hear em but have you ever LISTENED to them and dissected them? Drakes last song just shows the difference in caliber here. Drake ain\u2019t on Kendrick\u2019s level. We are talking about a nationally acclaimed icon. Kendrick\u2019s music is culture. Kendrick\u2019s music heals families. His music is visionary and prophetic in such a profound way it goes over so many people\u2019s heads. Drake wishes he was half the man Kendrick was. Go listen to Mr Morale and digest it\u2026 you\u2019ll understand how different Drake is from Kendrick. Like I said earlier, clout means nothing to Kendrick. This is about morals, it\u2019s about Kendrick standing for what he believes in. I\u2019m sorry but I used to bump Drake way more than Kendrick before this beef but after all of this, I understood.",

If this is how you think, then you have 0 analytical and critical thinking skills, I\u2019m sorry. You need to understand culture and understand art to understand Kendrick is on a level unlike anyone else. Like I said, I used to love Drake to death, my friends will tell you how much I glazed him but as Kendrick put these things together it kinda exposed him for who he is. When meet the grahams dropped I was disgusted to even be affiliated, then when Drake did THP6 I lost all respect I had for him. This is what X was talking about. As a musical artist Drake is good, he is great, he has hits for a reason, but as a man, he isn\u2019t shit and he cannot be respected. And to go beyond that while he is great in the music sense, he still doesn\u2019t come close to Kendrick in terms of meaning and actual depth/art. Drake understands how to make hits, Kendrick understands how to make art. Music is art, music is supposed to have meanings music is supposed to be emotional, music is exactly what Kendrick makes. It\u2019s supposed to be moving and impactful, it\u2019s meant to convey a real message. Drakes music doesn\u2019t do that. They\u2019re hits yes but I\u2019ve never been moved by a Drake song the way a Kendrick song moves me. I\u2019m not the kind to care for lyrics in songs, I just vibe, but when Kendrick is on I listen, I pay attention because he is saying something meaningful",

I do agree that the last song was a huge L for drake the more people analyze it for all of the mistakes made with him rushing out a response.\n\nI honestly am starting to feel like Kendrick really did bait out drake and Cole and had a 10 min song and then knew exactly what each would do. He literally dropped a response to drake and had it uploaded within a hour which is crazy that he listened to the diss and put a actual song together and then mixed it down and uploaded it to YouTube all within a hour which makes me feel like Kendrick already knew what drake would say in response. Rumors of Kendrick having the song made over a month before this if true would be an accomplishment in it self.",

In Pusha Ts infrared and Exodus 23:1, Push takes shots at Drake being a sock puppet or industry plant unlike Cole or Kendrick (Wayne discovers Drake around 2008 a rapper not about the gangster life; around the time Kanye starts doing numbers and industry trends in hip hop start changing and becoming more commercial). Mona Lisa by Wayne ft Kendrick is eerily similar to how Pusha got his dirt on Drake, Kendrick quotes the money splits Pusha calls out in exodus (splitting with birdman) on euphoria, Mother I Sober is about generational trauma/sexual abuse and also how the industry capitalizes on it, and finally Not Like Us starts naming not only OVOs current crew (The moment Baka gets out of jail from sex trafficking Drake gives him a job) but also Young Money people. (Drake sleeping with Waynes girl, \u201cWhat is the owl bird n* and bird bitches\u201d) Im skipping over details like Waynes and Birdmans falling out over contract stuff and Kendrick not wanting Wayne to retire and such but this is the general gist of it.",

Every time Drake gets into a beef he never stands to lose much but it still follows him around.\n\nAfter Meek, which he still won, people still accuse him of using ghostwriters.\n\nAfter Pusha T, people still openly mock him as a father and say if it wasn\u2019t for Push, he wouldn\u2019t have so many photo ops with Adonis. Not to mention the bigger questions about his blackness that have grown more prominent since.\n\nAnd even now after Kendrick, the pedo thing is front and center. Bonus point for every time you hear Drake say the N word from now on you\u2019re going to think of Euphoria.\n\nThe Heart Part 6 is such an embarrassing track if I\u2019m Kendrick and I already won I would let everyone sit on it and understand just how bad it actually is before I even think about dropping again. I mean look at the dislike ratio on YouTube and discussion in here and twitter. Kendrick also has 4 tracks in top 10s on DSPs. I wouldn\u2019t be concerned with what some of his fans are thinking, they are not spinning the narrative that Drake won on anyone with common sense. No one is going to buy the domestic abuse angle either. Kendrick did the job better than anyone could\u2019ve as far as rap is concerned.\n\nAs far as Drake having a career. Look at all that was known about Diddy and R. Kelly. There was video evidence of what R. Kelly did, a lot worse than what we have of Drake, and he was still allowed to walk. The justice system is unreliable and people have incredibly short attention spans. Losing to another rapper doesn\u2019t always change the trajectory of your career, no matter what they say. The only reason people like Meek fall off is because of their own mistakes.",

This beef just opened up Drake to have an instant loss whenever the next guy disses him. There's just too much shit out there. Losing one rap beef gives ammo to the next guy. Losing the next one gives even more ammo to the guy coming after. And Drake being Drake, will inevitably sneak diss someone else and get his ass handed to him like this after mentioning their wife or gf. \n\nAlso, the loss of credibility each loss gives him is also pretty huge. You can see his own fanbase cracking at the seams if you go through their sub. Just look at the comments for the post about Ak and Boi1da hinting at Drake dropping something. People are just tired and want him to take some time off, in his own sub. \n\nPlus, if any allegations that Kendrick threw at him materializes into anything, which is reaffirmed by his defenses in Heart part 6, it would simply be over.",

While you might discuss negative aspects that growing up a minority in a racially/socially segregated country might present, their tends to be a duality for those who actually experience these things. Like Scarface might talk about selling drugs and the highs but he definitely always has a \"minds playing tricks on me\" type of song that brings reality into the equation. Since Drake went to the gangsta shit, he only talks about the positives of the negative aspects but no duality or equality in perspective. \n\nAlso the term hip hop is derived from slang.  HIP meaning down with what's popping and hop meaning knowledge of the reality of your situation as a community. Infact in most AA genres we tend to have heavy activism in some way or form from the top.  Drake is there to say Free Larry Holmes (because it gives street cred and yea asked) but never mentioned a single sentence about prison reforms or the wars on drugs. Even Meek became an activist for prison reform but Drake just makes music that glorifies a liestyle that gets people locked...shit even NWA made a song about police brutality...shit even Kodak was on a song about Trump. Drake dips into AA culture when we are happy but goes elsewhere when we are struggling imo. And yea I know he's Canadian so he has options but the PM of Canada is always talking about USA business. Various Canadians in the US have stood for and behind something. Even Diddy told people to register to vote lol",

Hip hop culture. He let Not Like Us become a cultural rallying call and tried to drop when the culture was kinda moving on, so he rehashed BBL drizzy. If he atleast stepped on BBL drizzy as a trending topic early, he could have deflated some of that Kendrick energy earlier imo because his fans would have had a track that could possibly match as far as playability.

He could have deflated Metro as well\n\nI feel like after not like us, Drake was just morally defeated by Kendrick\u2019s low blow. In THP6 he cleared sounded like he was not tryna continue a rap beef with a man who has the whole world singing a song about you touching little kids. Kendrick went lower then low and Drake bowed out on THP6. I think drake is probably moving on from this beef and is gonna focus on music again",

He collaborates with a lot of top electronic producers, be it people like Daft Punk, Gesaffelstein, Hudson Mohawke, James Blake, so I like hearing how these minds collaborate artistically. Whether his album ends up being great or not, you can't say he is boring. Every album is different, he's not afraid to blend genres, or push into different territories. There are few artists who have as varied a discography as he does. You got some others like Quincy Jones, Radiohead, David Bowie, Tom Waits, etc. Even Taylor Swift is getting up there.\n\nAll this being said, he's insanely problematic as a person, and has his issues. He sucks as a person at the moment, but I still try and judge the music separately. He's like a 1/10, but Vultures is like a 7/10. I like to believe people can change opinions and viewpoints though, so still holding out he can dial back some of the damage he's done.\n\nThere are two camps that I think have issues. Those who defend his actions in real life because they like his music. Those who dismiss his current art because of his unhinged remarks outside music (boycotting is different than trying to convince people his current music is a 1 star album like a lot of publications are already trying to push in their reviews).\n\nKanye might be my favorite producer, but I personally think r/kanye and r/goodasssub are pretty cursed at times.",

Hell, even the cover is garbage.\n\nIt is Kanye's undisputed worst album ever, it is a pile of shit plain and simple.\n\nThe fans should be mad about this travesty of a record being released like this, they should hold him accountable on his laziness and carelessness that created this album.",

The people who find that problematic instead of Kanye openly saying he liked Hitler's actions is baffling to me. I swear, they just want to hate her for fun. The crazy thing is, football fans and Kanye fans are just as obsessed with their things as swifties. Football fans worship football, Kanye meatriders worship Kanye and swifties worship Taylor. But they always try and put swifties on top of the obsessiveness chart, which makes the football and Kanye fans seem even crazier. For example, a 76ers fan tackled a Chiefs fan just because the Chiefs fan said GG. There's a video of it on YouTube. And Kanye fans keep defending Kanye after everything he keeps doing. All I'm trying to say is that they're making problems related to Taylor out of thin air when there are problems with football fans and Kanye fans that nobody is talking about.",

You are just as annoying as a Taylor Swift fan going out your way to attack Kanye fans and just bad mouth him just because of his comments. With all the negative stuff in hip hop and it's music yet Kanye is the biggest problem?\n\nBruh get over it. Kanye has the number 1 selling album in the world  and his clothes sell out and people still listen. The truth hurts Kanye has more fans than the people who hate him and run around bad mouthing him with fake reviews. You people look like losers at this point.\n\nNot even defending what Kanye said i just don't care like i didn't care about all the drug sellings, killings in hip hop, negative images of women. It funny Kanye is the problem, but the Grammy awards don't have a problem with Dr.Dre history of domestic abuse and neither did the superbowl yet Kanye needs to be canceled for his opinions",

Numbers aren\u2019t a good measure for how good something is (since that is subjective) and isn\u2019t an accurate measure on someone\u2019s actual popularity.\n\nTake Nas for example. I don\u2019t have Spotify, but I suspect his monthly listeners don\u2019t even come close to either Drake or Kendrick\u2019s. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s charted high for a good while now. However, he\u2019s in most rap listeners top 10. \n\nWhich brings me into the next point. Not Like Us has been hovering around 1-3 on Billboard for about a month now, so naturally his monthly listeners are up this month. Realistically, Drake will probably overtake him again next month. Kendrick has a somewhat *niche* audience (I use the word niche extremely lightly), whereas Drake makes music for almost everyone. Naturally, Drake has and will do better numbers for that reason. \n\nThe two are practically incomparable. I think that most of us knew before this beef that Kendrick is the better rapper and Drake is the Jack of All Trades. Hence why almost everyone agrees that Drake\u2019s numbers point was moot, like this post.",

It\u2019s an acknowledgement that Drake is the best mainstream rapper and if anything, he and Kendrick can\u2019t really be compared.  I frequently eat at Michelin restaurants, but I eat at McDonald\u2019s more.  Why?  Because it\u2019s available and it\u2019s a much better meal when I\u2019m road tripping, after a night out, hungover, etc.  There\u2019s other fast food, but I, like most people, prefer McDonalds.  Is it complicated food?  No, but I\u2019m not going there for that.  I could get other fast food, but I usually don\u2019t want it.  Just like I could listen to other mainstream rappers, but I usually don\u2019t want to.  \n\nWhat Kendrick does is great just like Jean Georges, Daniel Humm, and David Chang.  That doesn\u2019t mean that what Drake does isn\u2019t also great.  They\u2019re doing different things.  While many fast food consumers can\u2019t consume Jean-Georges, 11 Madison Park, or Momofuku Ko, all michelin star restaurant consumers can eat at McDonalds, and if you think they aren\u2019t, you\u2019re deluding yourself.  \n\nSorry to unload.  I\u2019ve just seen the comparison so much and it\u2019s just not the dunk that people think it is.",

Sure but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s what most Kendrick fans think. The sentiment for most of them is to use this to show that \u201csee Drake fell off because Kendrick defeated him\u2026\u201d and statements along those lines. That\u2019s why i call it hypocrisy. If Drake had a hit song as diss they would just say \u201cwell he just proved that he\u2019s not not a real rapper he\u2019s just a pop start nothing new\u2026\u201d because most KL fans i had discussions with whenever i brought up comparisons to Drake, they dismiss him as pop star and use it to say there is no substance to his music which i disagree but now that some numbers seem in their favour now let\u2019s talk about it?? \nYou see the hypocrisy?\n\nAlso most of the media try and skew stats in KL\u2019s favor like Spotify say NLU is the fastest song to reach 300M streams, you ever wondered why 300M in particular?? Why not 100M or any other arbitrary number because they just wanted to highlight NLU and that\u2019s the stat they went by. \n\nSame skewing of analytics happening here: monthly listeners is of course gonna go up NLU is a #1 song rn. Streaming wise Drake is still leading by a big margin and since the start of the year and multiple years going back but let\u2019s not talk about that and say \u201cnumbers wise, you\u2019re not fucking creeping up line from Drake aged like milk\u2026\u201d  isn\u2019t that hypocrisy?",

                    "body": ">One thing to get out of the way Kendrick is not a small artist all. He had one of the biggest tours and his streaming stats are up there as well.  \n\nJust to be clear, I never said Kendrick was a small artist, I was just making a general example. However, Kendrick's overall profile is definitely smaller than Drake.  \n\n>Noteworthy? Sure but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s what most Kendrick fans think.  \n\nAnd here is where you're wrong. \n\n>The sentiment for most of them is to use this to show that \u201csee Drake fell off because Kendrick defeated him\u2026\u201d and statements along those lines. That\u2019s why i call it hypocrisy. If Drake had a hit song as diss they would just say \u201cwell he just proved that he\u2019s not not a real rapper he\u2019s just a pop start nothing new\u2026\u201d.  \n\nBecause here you are putting words in mouths and creating a strawman rather than listening to and learning from differing opinions.  \n\n>because most KL fans i had discussions with whenever i brought up comparisons to Drake, they dismiss him as pop star and use it to say there is no substance to his music which i disagree but now that some numbers seem in their favour now let\u2019s talk about it?? You see the hypocrisy?  \n\nFirst, you're making assumptions of and applying a blanket view to an entire group based on some interactions you've had.  \n\nSecond, Drake is obviously more mainstream leaning than Kendrick. I don\u2019t think that robs him of substance at all, but like other mainstream artists his brand is more associated with numbers.  \n\nLastly, this is not hypocritical. You keep giving wrong examples of hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is if I say \"high streaming numbers don't make Drake a good artist but they do make Kendrick a good artist\". People are not saying this. People think Kendrick is a great artist regardless of any accolades, but when he gets those accolades people will celebrate. You can't determine the value of art from numbers alone, but you can celebrate an artist getting more publicity from it. That's not a contradiction. \n\nI feel it should also be mentioned that Kendrick probably does care about these achievements because he's independent and they literally represent his own bottom line.  \n\n>Also most of the media try and skew stats in KL\u2019s favor like Spotify say NLU is the fastest song to reach 300M streams, you ever wondered why 300M in particular?? Why not 100M or any other arbitrary number because they just wanted to highlight NLU and that\u2019s the stat they went by.  \n\n>Same skewing of analytics happening here: monthly listeners is of course gonna go up NLU is a #1 song rn. Streaming wise Drake is still leading by a big margin and since the start of the year and multiple years going back but let\u2019s not talk about that and say \u201cnumbers wise, you\u2019re not fucking creeping up line from Drake aged like milk\u2026\u201d  isn\u2019t that hypocrisy?  \n\nNo it's not. Again with the wrong example. This is not a hypocrisy, it's a false equivalency. The media is talking about a song and you're talking about a catalogue. Compare like to like. Not Like Us is a trending topic and becoming part of the cultural Zeitgeist that's why they're covering in, but specifically they're reporting on what the song is doing, who's dancing to it, how it's being parodied and whether or not it's breaking records. If Drake had released a song to do that they would be reporting on that. We know that for a fact because when God's Plan released that's exactly what the media did.",

I\u2019m not strawmaning Kendrick fans at all or using my personal interactions. X and the general sentiment on Reddit is just a sample of opinion i can base my judgement on. This particular general sentiment is by definition hypocritical because the same people if you say Kendrick was falling off before beef (since his numbers was down) they say numbers don\u2019t mean you fell off. These are the types of convos people were having and still are having.\nIf you don\u2019t think that hypocritical then your definition is different than mine or you look at some of this behaviour in a favourable manner to Kenny fans so you can\u2019t see the hypocrisy. \n\n\nAnalytics are skew, it\u2019s part of marketing. Like i asked why 300M in particular?? \nAnswer: Because that puts Kendrick ahead\n\nYou wonder why no one saying that Drake has a lead in streaming numbers in of any rapper since the beginning of the year despite nasty allegations and it being public opinion that he lost a rap beef?\nSame reason marketing. Those numbers are not posted or talked about but they are facts and are more impressive depending on who you ask. Also Spotify got beef with Drake because he was pushing for artists to be paid more. Kinda like how he got beef with Grammys and he will never get any more even if he wrote an undeniable classic ( the ignored the Weeknd\u2019s After Hours because he wasn\u2019t going to perform, but this was album of the year to many people) so go figure Drake has dissed them and they\u2019re still salty about that. Though this is a bit off topic.\n\nOf course Kendrick cares about numbers all artist do independent or not. Numbers mean you have more eyes/ears on you which all artist who publish they work want. \n\nAgain it\u2019s hypocritical and you haven\u2019t shown me why it\u2019s not. The only thing i got from what you said is that you personally aren\u2019t in the majority of people who use these numbers as a way to put Drake down. If don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the minority go in those places where people are having these convos",

You think he's not lying about stuff we have no way of proving rn?\n\nIt doesn't look good for Drake and anyone defending him at this point may wanna save their breath.",

Drake thinks it's about getting bars off while Kendrick is stating the whole concept of Drake is invalid and has no place in hip hop. Kendrick has picked apart Drake's character, that he is an actor and Drake is just a persona. Specifically a persona designed to exploit and take from the culture for personal gain. The core assertion is that Drake is a fame whore who is attracted to status and motivated by image. From there it's a shorter step to associate his other moral failings and addictions. Within this, he uses his fame to get women, exploiting a power dynamic and taking advantage of them. Whether this actually slips into full on illegality or pedophilia is more of an insinuation based on the company he keeps and the inherent abuse of a grown man using celebrity to round up young women to exploit. \n\nAll of this speaks to his character at a deeper level and yeah, maybe it's not true, maybe Drake is just weird but doesn't *actually* cross lines. We might not ever know outside of actual legal intervention. But Drake still seems clueless what the beef is actually about.",

The rest of the record is just calling them weak in various ways.

He's just airing out all the stuff people say about him. \n\nThat's why no one cares about whether or not Whitney backs Kendrick or he's got paternity tests. Either you believe it or you don't. That's not Drake's problem how you decide to take it. Same thing with the daughter and pedo allegations. People been saying they bet Drake got more kids since the first kid. It's all been rumors swirling and talk. They just amplified the what was already out there. There was never going to be any proof. \n\nBUT that's where Drake falls apart in The Heart Part 6. Everything he's amplifying is based off of reddit/Twitter posts from the last 2 days. It sounds like he just took the top comments from r/Drizzy and read them off to a beat. It's weak. You can't just regurgitate the cope from your fans and expect us to act like you did something there. If it's a set up, if it's all been a plan, show us the plan. Show us how everyone spending the weekend shouting \"A MINOOOOOOOORRRRRRR\" in the clubs was going to win you the war. \n\nSee, for the other shit, proof was all but impossible. If TMZ ain't found the kid, Kendrick ain't. If there's no police report from Whitney, Drake can't help that. But Drake is claiming he's a mastermind of an elaborate bait operation.

And for the record, a 17-year-old is not a \"very young girl.\" Not even a 14-year-old can be called a \"very young girl\" in my opinion. Very young girls are females under the age of 12.\n\nPersonally, I don't think Drake really understood what was going on or what it was that he was up against. He was blinded by his cockiness and the amount of yes-men that he has in his circle.\n\nHe thinks/thought that this whole thing was about bars so he replied in a bars-way (i.e., \"Touch My Body\" reference) but he underestimated:\n\n* the culture\u2014we are back in the days of the Puritans in that we view sexual misconduct and deviancy to be worse than murder\n* the amount of hate and envy that Kendrick has in his heart\n* Kendrick's skill and expertise as both a rapper\n\nThis was never about going bar-for-bar or having regular beef. Kendrick is envious and he wants to see Drake be completely destroyed.\n\nAt the end of the day however, Kendrick calling Drake a pedophile without having any actual proof is not only very irresponsible and wrong but it's dangerous.\n\nI've seen people get slapped with a hefty defamation lawsuit for less. I've seen people murdered for less.\n\nSo yes, I think it's fair for Drake to say \"I'm disgusted,\" \"I'm way too famous (and hated) to get away with this,\" and \"prove it.\"\n\nKendrick should stay strapped and keep his circle extra tight. Drake should do the same and make sure that he has *very good* and *very proactive* legal team.",

He doesn't need to be more than he is, he just needed to slightly modernize in terms of production and references, but keep everything else just like old slim shady. I feel he did exactly that on this song. The production sounds sorta modern, but keeps a nostalgic core, and the references are simple, modern, yet very effective. He isn't trying too hard to rap faster than everybody, or have more technical yet still comedic lyrics or anything like that. He is no longer trying to be the best and that's exactly where I want him to be. Just be a chill funny old man that comments on the modern day squabbles of the youth. Like kings disease energy, but slim shadyified. Before I glaze too much all I gotta say is I hope this is a very tight and well made album from him, and I hope we get more like this in the future.",

I need a hobby. \n\nI (naively) think that this might be his way of offering a 'respectful' reminder about how little he cares about anyone's opinion... strategically directed, though. \n\nI think it's a full circle moment kind of release meant to call up his original fan base and fan's turned critics to tell us directly to sit down and shut up, too. He just said it in our native tongue which felt all nostalgic and got our attention.\nI think most would agree that his actions and words, whether we like them or not, always seem to align with his reality, his current values, and passions. He said Slim was dead. As a real life person, he evolved like people do, along with his sense of purpose and his creative process. And many fans thought our disappointment held value when we didn't like all of the evolution happening. \n\nHe's told the world since the beginning that he literally doesn't give a fuck about what we think, that rap is his therapy, essentially...   So what's he actually saying? Maybe that we're not special either. \n\nIt starts with Paul: you're on your own\n?consistently a theme mentioned throughout his entire career; he's fine on his own, always has been, always will be. Cool with that. \n\nBack in the days of old me/dope fiend/became smiley face emoji: \n? we can't shut up about how we miss the old version of him; the one that was behind the scenes starting and living with an addiction that changed and almost took his life. Cause, he's a real live man with kids and a life separate from us listeners, ya know..?\n\nVerse 2 I think speaks the same, like I'm going to say what I want so don't listen if you don't like it. But his reference to running full speed and others jogging could also suggest that he never slowed down, we just allowed down thinking he needed to catch up when it was us who got lapped. \n\nThe only cancel culture these days is really his old base... the media isn't the same. \n\nThere's some mic drop, 8 mile rap battle vibes near the end when he essentially knocks off himself, his fam, and everyone in his corner. \nThat's easy to decipher \n\nSherri Papini reference, she was the woman who staged her own abduction because she didn't know how to leave the life she no longer wanted with a husband and their young children. \nHoudini... I mean, isn't the key to magic distracting the audience so we're focused somewhere else while you make the real moves happen elsewhere?\nHe gave us what we wanted. I don't think it's cause he's spent a lot of time pondering how to get us back. \n\n\nShould that have been a private diary entry?! Lordy. I'm clearly avoiding the work I should be doing lol",

The world has moved on, we might like the attitude but the actual Slim Shady character is dated. \n\nI love Slim as a character. I think he\u2019s fantastic. I think him calling everything gay is genuinely endearing, because I am old enough to remember the specific sentiment that evoked (which wasn\u2019t homophobic, contrary to modern interpretations). And yet, it\u2019s nothing more than irrational nostalgia to want those times to come back again. \n\nI\u2019m looking forward to how he can tastefully push the character forward in an album while also saying goodbye to it definitively. Slim Shady is iconic and deserves a proper send off.",

Any real fan of hip hop or fan of Em knows this is just a desperate grab at relevancy. It\u2019s sad he\u2019s literally 51 years old. I can\u2019t lie the music video production is great 9/10 but the song itself is a solid 2/10. Him releasing a song like this gives me no hope that his next album will be good. I\u2019ve asked multiple people if they have heard this song and what they think about it. The response is all the same it\u2019s trash. The only people that like this song are white 40+ year olds or kids that have parents that monitor what music they listen 2. I promise you NO ONE WITH A AUX CORD IS GONNA PLAY THIS.",

Not using the same old gimmick.\n\nMaybe I expect too much out of him, but because of mmlp and sslp I\u2019ll always listen to his albums once.\n\nYou have the biggest audience, make some shit happen man.\n\nDo i expect artists to be more engaging, yes, you have the biggest audience ever and choose to do shit with it. Mosh was cool, had that spark. Now, eh. \n\nYour not that mad at the world if your making tracks like this, so I don\u2019t give it attention because you have all the money you could ever need but these songs make it seem like that\u2019s all you want more of. Winking at controversial topics instead of really digging into them to make change.\n\nIf I was in the studio with him I would have told him to delete this shit. It\u2019s not crossing no cultural barriers, and if he doesn\u2019t wanna speak to the world, then all he wants is his audience, so money. Put the pen down there\u2019s more important stuff for people to focus on. \n\nAbra abracadabra Foh. \n\nJust my two cents, not right, not wrong, but this song isn\u2019t for me. Yall enjoy.",

Look at every album he's done, even from revival onwards, and he's talked about serious issues. Not every song has to be serious, shit gets old quick. This is meant to be a Slim Shady type song, not a serious one. If you want that, why not check out some recent songs like Darkness where he raps about the las vegas shooter, or others where he talks about police brutality, racism, etc. \n\nThis song is meant to generate hype for the new album, it's basically a trailer. Its a fun song meant as a throwback to all his old stuff and is meant to be more lighthearted while making jokes about the current state of things, not actually digging into the issues of it all. People would just be disappointed and annoyed about another song that digs into that shit when its meant to promote a new album. Nobody wants to only listen  to serious rapping about social issues, its just depressing and everyone gets enough of that shit in their every day lives. He's a rapper, not a politician, but you sound as if you expect him to solve world problems because of his success in music?",

He went down to the lowest most personal level, and accused Drake of shit that obviously isnt true. Yes Drake has had weird, somewhat problematic interactions with young women in the past, but to literally compare him to Weinstein and alleging that he is running some pedo ring or something (?) is just absurd. Drake kept it somewhat professional and entertaining and Kendrick is stooping down to an incredibly personal level, attacking not only his deepest character but also Drakes family. Tasteless in my opinion; and i love Kendricks music way more than Drakes.",

But I\u2019ll continue and answer your question from my viewpoint. \n\nTo say that black people don\u2019t invest in hip hop is a distorted argument to make. It\u2019s ignoring history. Especially given that rap is much more mainstream and accessible now than it was before. Are white people buying the things you listed? Sure. Black people are too, but support and investment goes beyond what you listed.\n\nWhen an artist is trying to get put on, they come to black communities. In that same community you\u2019ll find the people who might\u2019ve paid $5 for that random mixtape they made. But if it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s our community who continues to pump that music and support the artist in various ways. We help raise the profiles of said artist and the art itself. Word of mouth. Small club shows. Mixtape purchases from the bootleg man or record store. That\u2019s not happening in predominantly white communities. \n\nBefore OutKast became big, I remember receiving their demo on cassette at a summer concert festival. No one knew who they were. But within 2 months time, I would hear songs from that tape around my city before they even hit radio. Thats support and investment. I was a purchaser of a Jeezy\u2019s early work at ATL strip clubs before he got put on. It was the strip club and the black community that supported and invested in his music and early shows. That\u2019s support. Not a white soul in sight at those shows. LaFace, and other labels, were created to support and invest in black music. You can go back in time and insert most hip hop artist into the above Kast and Jeezy scenario and they\u2019ll have a similar story.\n\nIt\u2019s undeniable that hip hop music is inherently black and a major part of our culture. It speaks to a black experience in America at the core. If we, black people, didn\u2019t invest back then, you wouldn\u2019t be able to make your argument today.There\u2019s a reason rap is more mainstream and global now. It\u2019s more accessible, and in a lot of ways, acceptable now. At one point tho, it was looked at with disgust. And we didn\u2019t care, because it was ours. But that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t to be shared. Anyone is and was welcome to join in, but respect the culture from where it came and the art form that was created.\n\nI never expressed the \u201ctreated as guests\u201d sentiment, but I can understand where one would make that argument. If you wanna join in, come on in. Make connections. Remain authentic in your love for all of the music and the context of the culture it represents. Don\u2019t co-opt it because it\u2019s the cool thing at the moment and you wanna be fashionable and current. You can\u2019t go crazy for \u201cHot In Here\u201d and then side eye \u201cFight the Power,\u201d \u201cU.N.I.T.Y,\u201d or even \u201cFuck the Police.\u201d Don\u2019t become tone deaf and run back to your \u201cnative culture\u201d (idk if those are the right words there) when issues involving the community are discussed through the music. Like any party or function, there are respectable guests, and then there are those you know for sure that you\u2019ll never invite again.\n\nDisclaimer: This will probably read like a jumbled mess as I\u2019m typing it while multitasking lol. But my views are from someone who grew up in hip hop as an 80\u2019s baby in the biggest, blackest city in the south and later on became a DJ because of my love for the music and our culture. I\u2019ve seen the various phases, changes, and progressions that hip hop has gone through.",

They are guest because it\u2019s one of the last remaining art forms the black people have and when we just allow anyone in our cultural spaces, it allows for higher degrees of appropriation and erasure of black identity in a black born genre of music. Throughout history white people have inserted themselves in our cultural spaces and have even took over complete genres to the point it\u2019s not even associated with its black creators. This is what happened to rock music when chuck berry and little Richard were coming out they were demonized in the media however when Elvis Presley stole his whole act from a black artist, rock became more acceptable for white America. \n\nThis is why it\u2019s important that Rap keeps its black identity. Nobody owns music or genres of music however, it\u2019s very important never to erase the cultural and historical roots of genres of musics as art is part of cultural identity and heritage. There nothing wrong with being treated like a guest in our community but you can\u2019t claim the culture as your own. If anybody doesn\u2019t see the importance of this than they need to do self reflection on to why they feel like black spaces/art forms shouldn\u2019t remain associated with black people and not just an \u201cAmerican\u201d art form",

I believe that the reason most fans are white is because we live in a country that is majority white.\n\nSecondly, hip hop is black music, with its origins in African American culture. Does that mean suburban white people can't like hip hop or even participate as artists? No. Are they guests? I don't think guest is the right word, but I always understand what people really mean when they say white people are guests in hip hop. The music wasn't made for them. It's not *not* made for them (the two \"not's\" are there on purpose, double negative), but it's just important for a white person to know where they stand in the community, and to not turn it into cultural appropriation or exploitation of black culture. I think Mac Miller is a perfect example of how to be a white hip hop artist and do it right. Action Bronson is another example. But then you also have artists like G-Eazy and Jack Harlow who come off as very disingenuous when it comes to their appreciation for hip hop as an art form. Then you have artists like Lil Xan, Post Malone, and Lil Peep who feel like they're in it for the clout. \n\nI think what bugs me is that a lot of white people didn't really get into hip hop, or accept hip hop as a legitimate art form until white people were doing it. Even though we had The Beastie Boys and House of Pain, it took for Eminem to get on the scene for white people to really get on board on a much larger scale. The more white rappers there are, the more white fans there are. There are some people that I know that seem to only like rappers that are white (I don't call them out on this, but I seem to be seeing a pattern, and I'm sure he's not alone). \n\nInstead of enjoying hip hop as a whole, they tend to only like rap because it is socially acceptable to do so. This isn't about all white people btw. Like I said before, there were The Beastie Boys and House of Pain, as well as a larger portion of white hip hop fans that support the music and the culture as a whole, and not just the white artists. If you're white, and you're on a sub reddit where you talk about hip hop, chances are, you're not one of the white people I'm talking about. You're probably a genuine fan. \n\nBut knowing how white people (as a whole) throughout history have made their music off of appropriating others' cultures (even rock was stolen from black people), I see a pattern, and it makes me feel uncomfortable sometimes. It makes me feel like they're going to do the same thing with hip hop (not the artists' fault, BTW, but the fault record labels, execs, and corporate offices) and then try to rewrite the history like they've done, not only with music, but with everything that doesn't have white people as the most prominent voice. I think telling them that they're guests in hip hop isn't saying that they aren't allowed to enjoy the music or participate in the artistry. It is just reminding them where the roots of this music belongs, not to forget it, and make sure you are respecting it and not exploiting it.",

We did not get sought after by the government and the CIA or our communities segregated and exposed the same way African American communities have/had/are. We are guests because while we can comprehend and understand it is not the same as living day in and day out in that culture. My best friend never saw his mom except once a week when she dropped groceries off, he was 7 and that lasted until I took him to college at 17.\nFor ten years him and his little brother survived sure with a roof and food but no parenting. They relied on the community and their neighborhood to help them with school work and health and safety concerns. I had the ability to witness but not understand until I was a teenager at which point I did as much as I could for them. Once I was able to drive I offered to never let them walk again if they did not want to. \n\nIt\u2019s just incredibly unfortunate and fucked up how this world has treated the black community and for a white person(unless actually grew up on those streets) we just can not grasp the day to day that those years made or make for these communities.\n\nAll I can do is help where I can and respect it to the best of my ability. I am incredibly thankful to Outkast/J Cole/Hov and Childish Gambino for making music that I relate to and have brought me life changing moments. But I understand that it was not meant for my perspective. Much love to anyone and everyone it\u2019s what makes a difference.",

The area your concerts are in, the creators you watch, and the artists you listen to will define your experience as to what you\u2019re exposed to. I can easily tell you that being from Atlanta, that a Young Nudy, Thug, or even Childish Gambino concert will have a majority of black audiences. \n\n*Appreciation is measured by more than just showing up to a concert.*\n\n2. This dives deeper into economics and sociology, but those with the disposable income and ease of mind to purchase that VIP or front row seat will, those can not, probably will support by watching the YouTube recording. I for one, am not nor know anyone that is willing to buy $300-$1000  ticket if it doesn\u2019t sit comfortable with them or if it isn\u2019t a once in a lifetime experience.\n\n*The person who\u2019s working 2 jobs to live might not be able to attend Coachella, but probably listens to Frank Ocean\u2019s Coachella mix daily.*\n\n3. There are roughly 340 million people in the US. 75% of them are white. 14% of them are African. \n\nYou should come to the Jazz Festival in Atlanta and see how much support is given because it\u2019s affordable and accessible.\n\nI think it\u2019s great whenever someone appreciates our culture, but why do you think we should put one race of people on a pedestal for buying our tickets? How do you think they should be appreciated since the current way doesn\u2019t work for you?",

For them, you can't separate the experiential knowledge from the art. Authenticity and being genuine is a key component to what makes the art form as interesting as it is.\u00a0\u00a0 White people, on large, do not share this same experience. Funnily enough, neither do most black people.\u00a0\n\n\nMost of us in these threads and listeners of hip hop, regardless of race, don't share this unique experience. As much as Drake seemingly co-opts black \"hood or ghetto culture\", you find black people in America do the very same thing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Interestingly, this sort of thing is mirrored in other aspects of life. We rightfully understand that the wealthy have an easier time in every aspect in life. We've now inverted that perception to correct that imbalance, and we now commodify being disadvantaged. This holds a unique and important social cache these days.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTo some people, that disadvantage could never and will never be understood from someone who is white. Connecting to that social disadvantage, ironically, has a lot of advantages in itself. You don't need to actually be from the hood to carry that social cache. You only need the color. For those people, there is power in exclusionary places where whites shouldn't or can't fully go.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0There's a historical precedent, so it's hard to tell that kind of person that other ethnicities can also belong here.\u00a0 I say If you can rap, then just rap. If you like it, you like it and that's aight. Bump whoever says you can't be here. If we're going by their standards, they usually don't either.\u00a0",

I\u2019m a white American dude, and I make my own flavor of reggae while trying to always be conscious about not biting and being respectful of the form and the people who gave it to us. If I hear and artist I like, I buy their music, go to shows, and generally support the fuck out of them. In my estimate, it\u2019s the best thing I can do to honor them.\n\nReggae music is first and foremost a revolutionary music. Like hip hop, it\u2019s a commentary on the environment from which it comes. It can teach us about experiences we might never otherwise understand. And most importantly, for the listener and fan, it can bring empathy and an appreciation for our shared humanity.\n\nAll that said, I find it important to be sensitive to certain boundaries that exist in the music and culture. Calls for unity might be first intended for the African diaspora, then colonized peoples generally, then Jamaicans at large, and finally all peoples. A lot of reggae music has deep bonds with religion and culture that shouldn\u2019t be dismissed nor co-opted to the point of removing its original context and meaning. We see a lot of this in hip hop music and culture as well.\n\nIn the end, and in agreement with your original post, I don\u2019t feel like a guest because of the relationship I have grown with reggae music and culture as a fan, and because of the niche I\u2019ve crafted (and filled with love and respect) as an artist.",

During my time approaching that pivotal moment, my mum always watched shit like grease, the village ppl movie, the Blues Brothers, even flicks like smokey and the bear had heaps of country music in it. My step dad played pink Floyd n heaps of other stuff like it. I love all music, but hip hop changed my life. Copping dubbed tapes of takes a nation of millions to hold us back, and 2 lives move something around 10 years old and I couldn't get enuf. Of course it was the \"oh you want to be a black person don't you?\" crap all the time until it became cool to be white and wear ice t and nwa and cube shirts without getting bashed by the local surfer twats. How times have changed, those surfer cocknuggets these days pump Aussie hip hop more than anything now lol anyway cheers blokey \nPS when ice cube or whoever comes to Australia it's almost all white cunts and it ain't no thang, just love.",

The whole point of music is shared experience. I would like to share my experience with someone else. That\u2019s at least my opinion. In a perfect world would African Americans be the primary demographic that consumes and supports hip hop monetarily? I mean yea considering that the music is often made by African Americans about their experience. However poorer people can\u2019t go to concerts and buy merch as much. There are poor people of all colors however they are disproportionately POC. So then it\u2019s just whoever likes the music who has the money to support. I think it\u2019s a little naive to think that hip hop as a whole isn\u2019t special for POC/people who grew up in the culture. Even for the guys who are white but grew up in mostly black areas they have a lot of overlap but it\u2019s still not quite the same. Regardless I do think it\u2019s stupid to gatekeep people from listening or learning about hip hop just because they\u2019re skin color that\u2019s dumb. Idk if I made a point here just some thoughts",

I remember when I was like four years old my brother brought me into his room and was like \"this is the sound, you need to listen and learn\" and he played NWA for me. Ever since that day, I was obsessed with hip-hop, and this was the time when MTV was really starting to peak, so I had access to a lot of mainstream gangster rap.\n\nThe first job I told my mom I wanted when I was a kid was to be a Breakdancer, I used to practice in the living room. When I was old enough, I started signing up for those free music CD mailers, I had over 300 CDs. The funny part was my mom paid for every single one of them and never said anything about it. I was listening to Tribe, Gangstar, Scarface, Wu, E40, Too Short, rap was my life from eight years old until today. I may not be able to identify directly with the culture because I'm not black, but I identify with the music because I understand what it represents.\n\nI remember when I was 10, Wu-Tang forever had just came out, I went onto some fan website I found through AOL and printed up all of the lyrics to every single song and learned them front to back. It inspired me to write, and I still write lyrics to this day. When I hear new shit like future and all that, I can't get really excited about it, but when I hear artists like Kendrick, I can't help but be taken back to when I was a kid. \n\nRap may not be a part of my heritage, but it's embedded in my heart. Fuck the police, wu tang forever. \u270c\ufe0f",

I\u2019m not the boss of english, but it seems like the pro-gatekeeping folks are saying 2 different things:\n1) Some are saying \u201chell nah, keep \u2018em out\u201d\n2) And others are saying \u201cwe need to be mindful of who comes in and how\u201d\n\nI wish there were more words here then, cause though both are what a gatekeeper does, one is more like a strict bouncer (who is/not on the list) and the other is more like a garden tender (\u201ccan this thing work with whats already going on here?\u201d)\n\nProduction/consumption:\nTheres a false binary going on about who is \u201cinvesting.\u201d\nIt is unfortunate that the white OP is framing this in a way that leaves out the INDISPENSABLE reality that (as said better by other commentators here) if you knew the history or many/most/all of the big names in hip hop being invested in by white fans with lots of cash to spend (ahem\u2026)\u2014then you\u2019d know it was black communities and black fans who were the first initial backers and investors, so to speak. The GOATs didnt just show up at some sorority in Durham and play a show for 10k and then two years later its sold out stadiums. They started with mix tapes, battles, by being part of the culture -that culture being black culture. Cool, white people are the major concert goers now that a hip hop act has broken big. But be real, if those artists werent hearing their mixtapes getting love in the clubs or on local radio (by black folks) they prolly wouldnt be where they are now period. \n\nI\u2019m white and i can say with high confidence as an insider: most white people cannot hold in their minds how they feel about a thing while also understanding where things actually come from and how they got to where they are today. Its like a cognitive bias curse of living in disney fantasies about our shared histories.",

White people and many other races have had influence enough to all own their own style of music at this point, for many generes. Fact remains.\n\nSecondly, there ARE some real fuckin goddamn posers that try way too hard and throw the nword around casual af and don't know shit about hiphop nor respect it more than enjoying its sound. A few bad apples really does have a stigma whether it's true for one race or another. Be a fan of whatever you like, just watch what youre stepping on i guess. \n\nSo I accept the guest ideology in ways, I also just don't feel labeled by it because I like what I fuckin like no apologies. People get upset over nothing so if we gotta pick our battles then Guest terminology ain't worth it fr.\n\nWhat I love most about rap are the stories. Jesus christ, things are written so eloquently sometimes. I feel like the most impactful stories to me were those that showed their life in such a way that I gained new perspectives growing up. \n\nNot to trivialize other skinned artists and their impact of course, but what I was taught by hiphop was majority thru black hip-hop.",

My school was across the road from a street that was notorious for having trap houses and they would constantly get raided by police,the only music I really heard was rap I never heard anything else unless it was from the radio in my parents car, I still remember when tpab released and it was massive in the country, I was only 9 but remember hearing alright all the time. I love hip hop and black culture because it\u2019s what surrounded me as a child.I know the struggles that black people face without facing them myself and I know the pain that racism has caused seeing as atleast where I grew up the hard R was still used all the time as a slur to cause hate and an Afrikaans word with similar meaning. \n\nTLDR:I\u2019m white but grew up in a kinda crappy neighbourhood with only black friends in Africa and got exposed to only black media,the only white influence in my life has been from direct family members.\n\nI\u2019m 18 btw",

This isn\u2019t to say that all hiphop artists reference these topics but rather that these topics are engrained into the DNA of the genre.

But the investment of money and headcount shouldn't be overvalued. It's not like the black population of the u.s. can just decide to multiply in size and spending power.

I try to just skip it so I don't offend anyone...and honestly I love the music so much even if every other rap fan disrespected me and called me fake I wouldn't give a fuck",

Like does OP know how math works? When something goes mainstream it hits a wider audience! That just so happens to be white!!\u00a0\nAnd yes white people can enjoy and relate to rap music but they will always be guests in this genre because the music is rooted in the African American experience. That\u2019s an extremely particular and specific lens and it cannot be erased. I mean, I would consider myself to be a little bit of a guest because I\u2019m not African American. I\u2019m Nigerian American. The history of the transatlantic slave trade to the new world and everything that entailed after- is not my story. It could never be. (It\u2019s British colonization and civil wars lol but that\u2019s another story for another day).\u00a0\nSecondly, I actually support a little bit of gate keeping to a certain extent. Maybe if that were to happen what happened to rock, folk, country and jazz wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u00a0\nIn my opinion white people and especially white people in this thread have absolutely no right to tell black people fuck yall this is my house about a genre of music and way of life that African Americans created through strife, community and ingenuity. African Americans built this shit brick by brick.\u00a0\nSo yeah- you ARE a guest. A welcome guest, I\u2019m sure. A valued and loved guest..\nBut a guest nonetheless.

However, one night in like 1999 I think, I was up late at a buddies house watching MTV (back when the M still somewhat stood for MUSIC), and this goofy looking white dude pops up on the screen and says \"HI....my name is\", and it wasn't just because he was white that I paid attention.  It was different than any rap I'd ever heard.  It was witty, and funny, and didn't take itself too seriously.  I spent the next few minutes staring at the TV, laughing my ass off at this dude just being a goofball in the video, and the lyrics just made me laugh.\n\nFrom that day forward, I became a serious hip hop fan.  I went back and listened to Pac, and biggie, and wu tang, NWA, etc etc.  I was hooked.  I grew up in a small city near Detroit that we refer to as \"Junior Detroit\" around here.  I was poor, had to walk everywhere, had a fairly crazy family life, watched friends start slangin to feed themselves while still in high school because their parents were either pieces of shit, or simply couldn't afford it.  Friends and acquaintances died to violence, and drugs, and if you were a teenager and a cop saw you out and about, you were getting fucked with (regardless of skin color).  Basically, I grew up kinda rough, but I know MANY had it worse.\n\nAfter becoming a rap fan, I began to understand the world around me, and my environment more.  The best thing it did for me was influence.  Ive been playing guitar since I was 6 and had metal bands growing up, but I always kind of felt like we were bland.  Rap gave me sooooo many more types of influence to draw from, and my writing became so much more versatile.  Rap has influenced so many things in my life since then, and helped me through the absolute worst times of my life.  I may have grew up within the culture but I never considered myself part of it until discovered rap and realized much of what they talk about is stuff I went through and saw others go through daily.  It changed my whole life and my outlook on life, and I'll never forget that.",

There's a reason logic, g-easy, maclemore, and action Bronsin had comment sections full of people saying some vairent of \"finally someone making good rap\"\n\nI'm white. I fucking love rap music. It's what I grew up on and loved my whole life. Ts the music me and my friends made growing up. Im not a guest.

In my opinion, it\u2019s more than that.\n\nI believe that, to be a part of something larger than yourself, there\u2019s a certain level of awareness and understanding one must have. There should be some level of empathy and sympathy. So yea, you may disagree with the message or messengers for \u201cFuck the Police\u201d (or any song with messaging for that matter) but if you\u2019re truly a part of the culture, you\u2019d be able to understand why that messaging even exists in the music. These people are speaking from experience. A shared experience in most cases. The words, or the meaning behind them, carry weight. That expression is hip hop at its core.\n\nThat song is also only one example. There are countless hip hop songs that express the same sentiments (and others) differently, with more context and detail. Choose your message and your messenger there.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re here for the bop\u2026cool. Enjoy the bop. We all enjoy the bop. That alone doesn\u2019t make you part of the culture imo. Thats only a small part of what hip hop is about. If you choose to ignore the parts that\u2019s real and raw, you\u2019ll never step foot inside the \u201cculture club\u201d door.

I started thinking about how ticket scalpers have become such a huge problem and another reason why you might see even less black people at the concerts of different popular artists. A ticket's original price being $400 is one thing but the minute the concert sell out and that resale price go up to $800.... you start seeing the people around you change their minds. Seen that too many times when it comes to co workers, friends, family, classmates, social media, etc.",

Drake and some of his fans love to boast he \"could have been the best conscious rapper, but chose stardom\". But when its time to discuss rap y'all love to ignore that. Eminem and 50 numbers are way more impressive cuz they only rap",

Also the general public isn\u2019t watching a stream on Twitch, but they will be keeping in touch through their feed and conversations. Like I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve heard and discussed Kendrick Lamar (especially Euphoria and NLU) multiple times, as well as heard it blasting in a car, and I live in rural Canada. I also heard of various clubs and venues that booed Drake and wanted NLU to be put on, one of which was said to be in Toronto. Also, 100 billion streams when he\u2019s had so many hit songs and features (especially pop ones) is no surprise, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s as relevant in the eyes of the public as he was years ago. I\u2019d argue that ever since he made the album with 21 Savage, he hasn\u2019t been at the forefront of music, but more on the back burner of mega fame. \n\nYou can also compare the interaction between the two, or are you one of those who thinks Kendrick is botting? That LLC was preposterous and the dates didn\u2019t match. Not to mention the fact that it\u2019d make way more sense to go through his label as a major artist, rather than pay some guy $2500 and proceed to not pay the full.

And even if it was true, it's something between them both and they surely worked it out\n\nKendrick is short : wow so funny \n\nWhitney isn't faithful: \"fabricating stories on the family front cause you heard mister morale\" and drake loves to talk about his opponents families so I won't be surprised,but it can't be proven or debunked \n\nNow tell me what Kendrick allegations i forgot that are fake",

But when I say \"nobody achieved Em's level of fan doind *rap music*\", im obviously talkin bout 2000-2002, his biggest numbers by far. The Rihanna joint is from the 2010s. \n\n\nTheres an appeal to a wider audience, but a rap song with pop elements dont compare to a straight up pop song.\n\nHence why Hey Ya is widely more popular than Ms. Jackson, one being a pop track, and the other being a rap track with a singing hook and singing bridge",
