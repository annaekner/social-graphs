I've even seen tons of COMC posts with the same kinds of games you describe and still rarely see anything but general positivity\n\nedit: I've read through this thread too and read your comments OP and -- I hate to say it -- this unironically one of the most negative posts directed at other members of this community I've seen posted in this sub.  OP, you seem to have a really strong opinion about a small minority and have painted a lot of people with the same brush, and don't seem very interested in seeing things any other way.\n\nFor anyone else wondering, the post in question was deleted at **28 points with a 78% upvote ratio** (despite OPs numerous comments about how only certain kinds of things get upvotes).  It had **19 comments, 7 of which were positive** (despite OPs claims that there was \"lots\" of vitriol and nastiness in the comments); _3_ weren't positive and were of course downvoted (again, contrary to OPs many claims about gatekeeping), **with _1_ being overtly negative**.  The rest were basically arguments between OP and the people who posted those 3 comments.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, the one guy in that comment section was definitely a dick.  But that kind of negativity and gatekeeping is like a 1-comment-a-week kind of thing in a sub that has hundreds of posts, each with dozens or hundreds of comments a week, and is possibly as far removed from the classification of \"an elephant in the room of a nasty and unwelcoming community\" as possible.

I've been going to public meetups at a caf\u00e9 more than once a week for 7 years, and we have members that have been coming that whole time, and there are often new people who join us and tell us how happy they are to find us. Are you saying we *shouldn't* advise people to give meetups a try? Are you saying we should tell people only to play at home?",

They become so thoroughly indoctrinated in the cult of consumerism that it drives them mad when someone pulls out an old copy of Monopoly they found at a garage sale for $1.\n\nI love board games and always have. I've spent countless hours playing games like Monopoly, Risk, Chess, Scrabble, Pachisi, Backgammon, Yahtzee, etc. both in person and online. Of course everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I think these are great games with an incredible amount of replayability, and many other people think so too. I can't tell you the number of times I've mentioned one of these games and seen someone visibly cringe and start telling me the board games that I *should* be playing instead.\n\nThe real irony is their genre-defining epic new game will be completely forgotten about in 10 years, a tiny little footnote in board game history, because, as it turns out, introducing 6 new game phases with 20 new mechanics to solve \"problems\" like \"this game is too random\", or \"this game is not random enough\", or \"people shouldn't ever be eliminated\", is not the break-through solution a lot of these players think it is.",

                    "body": "I'm subscribed to several subs and I find this one to the most echochambery, the most hivemind dominated. I earn karma on other subs to spend it here. Also: the vibe of this subreddit is pretty much the same as BGG general forums. The same hivemind, the same biases, the same elitism, which means, it's hobby related. *(Now I'm not a video gamer, so it could also be related to male dominated gaming hobbies as a whole.)*\n\nIt's not about \"vocal minority\", it's: whatever doesn't adhere to hobby hivemind will be downvoted to oblivion by silent majority. Like this comment right here. Yeah, press downvote, you know you want to.\n\nTypical cases\n\n* OP: *\"Hey which games you personally dislike?\"*\n* Me: *\"All MPS euros. And Brass Birmingham.\"* I don't like em. Can't make me. And yet this mere expression of my tastes is attacked by trolls with emotional level of 12 year olds and downvoted en masse.\n* some dude: \"*Catan\" -* Responses *\"Fuck yeah\" \"Bravo\" \"You know not liking Catan isn't an opinion, because it's objectively bad game\"* and so forth and so on. The same nonsense that you can also read in this very thread, posted by people who can't grasp how odds management and trading work on their own or combined. Of course bashing on Catan is completely legit, as well as Monopoly as they are \"just bad games, fact!\". Post gets massive upvotes and all hail the hivemind.\n\nReasons:\n\n1. I see this hobby as **elitist** by its essence. In order to play hobby games you must look down on non-hobby games. First you shit on Monopoly, then you wipe your ass with Catan and after 3 years in the hobby it's time to honestly admi*t \"err, I never really liked Knizia. Or Tigris and Euphrates\"* (big cheers in response!).\n2. The **myth of progress:** \"all newer games are better\". This of course feeds into consumeristic attitude of the hobby and the FOMO driven KS hamster wheel. *Yeah, each year is better, so you better pay 100 euros for 2E of a game you paid 80 for 1E two years ago.*  I'd say that cca mid 2000s all main design and production issues were figured out and that we cant talk about any progress from there on. It's not better, it's just different. And it's different because the hobby mainstream tastes have changed and games have adapted to changes in tastes. That's it. Plus what people are willing to pay for is also massively different from 2010.\n3. The **myth of \"inteligence\"**. As I have been informed when initiated into the hobby playing boardgames will make everyone the second coming of Einstein (aka Zweistein) and thus we can look down on other less intellectual genres like  those muggles who play party games. It's hard to admit dexterity and speed games utilise a lot of our brainpower (plus help kids with cognitive development) - when everybody knows regurgitating a textbook and optimising a spreadsheet puzzle is \"objectively smart\". People screaming how *\"games have too much luck\"* didn't get the memo that odds management is a skill and that in push your luck games psychological skills of readign people individually or as a group come very handy. It's far easier to claim *\"I didn't lose because of my inadequate skills, but because dice were against me!\"*\n4. **It's the economy, stupid.** It's a FOMO driven hobby, so everybody better support each other in spending money on casino called Kickstarter and hyping the latest hotness, or the whole collective hypnosis will instantly evaporate and you'll just sit at home with expensive boxes nobody will play. Oh, right Turczi will make solo modes for everyone. Crisis averted!\n5. **Inability of hobby to handle different POVs** is best seen in reviews - as in there nearly aren't any. The number of proper boardgame reviewers (video or written) I can list on fingers of my both hands. And reason being: hobbyists can't handle negative reviews and backlash follows. Content providers have adapted and so called \"reviews\" basically function as entertainment and/or advertising. And the role of both is to give consumers an alibi to keep on consuming *\"hey, I was on the edge with this 200 eur purchase, but you saying 'ireallylikedit' convinced me\".*\n\n*==================*\n\nto answer to OP.\n\nYeah, I've seen that post, now I feel bad for not commenting. \ud83d\ude15\n\n>It\u2019s a serious issue. The lack of social skills in this hobby is extremely concerning and it drives so many people away.\n\nSeems to me too many hobbyists have incredibly tough time dealing with the fact that some people don't like the same games that they do. And that this isn't a big deal, let alone a problem.",

For example my friends who would not normally play even mid-weight euros got into the Game of Thrones board game which is very complicated because of their love of the IP and the gameplay.  And kids can basically learn any difficulty level of game if they're motivated to do it.\n\nSo whether Outer Rim is a good recommendation mostly depends on what people's expectations are for this party.  If they want a general party with a quick board game as one of many activities, probably a bad recommendation.  If they want to celebrate Star Wars by getting really into a Star Wars game, it could be good.",

Mind you, I was *NEVER* going to get to the point of not-being-last in that game.\n\nYou know what happened? Our tutor got mad, and started insulting my mate that he \"should have let Vnze rot in his own turd\".\n\nLike, it didn't hurt his position, it barely hurt my mates position, but because it was a sub-optimal move he got shat upon. Mate and I left and went to play 7-Wonders duel on an empty table, much to the surprise of our tutor. \n\nWe play games to have fun. I  do play seriously, but at the end it's a game and I don't mind losing (although some lighthearted discussion may always happen), but I avoid the win-at-all-costs crowd. It's just not fun.",

I've thought about having a week in our sub when the mods don't remove anything, just so the users can see what it's like - much of the trash is hidden from the users, because the moderators tend to quickly remove it.\n\nIf you allow beginners' recommendation threads here, then I would guess the top half dozen threads every day will be beginners' recommendation threads, always with different people making the same replies. Same with open-ended recommendation threads, probably. Probably a good recommendation thread is one that's tight and specific, \"I want this kind of game, for this number of people and with these kinds of mechanics - we like games X, Y and Z\"; probably that can provoke good quality discussion instead of everyone recommending the most popular current games and their favourites every time.\n\nThe subreddit I mod is a personal finance one - we have a flowchart which says \"pay debts down first, save an emergency fund, invest for the future\"; we have a wiki with basic advice about saving and investing, and we still get people posting \"hey guys, what do I do with my money?\" We have a page on index fund investing, and we get a dozen posts a day from people who obviously haven't read it. And I still get exhausted making the same replies every day to the people whose posts pass the test and aren't removed. \n\nIn modmail we get people complaining. \"I read the wiki and it doesn't answer my question\" and we patiently show them the pages which do. We get people who say \"I want my post approved because I want a discussion and have people tell me the answer\". \n\nI don't know whether the current /r/BoardGames rules are right or wrong, but I bet if you go on the subreddit's discord you'll find they've been discussed at length. Maybe there could be some changes to the recommendations rule, but I bet the regulars who are writing long and helpful replies about boardgames to several threads a day don't want it to be a complete free-for-all. \n\nIn my experience Facebook discussion groups tend to be shite - the threading and sorting makes Facebook actively hostile to high quality discussion, and there seems to be little moderation there; that's the quality of content you get when people can post whatever they like. Reddit moderators are trying to improve the quality and prevent the same topics being endlessly and unproductively discussed every day.",

They might've played a game where they got screwed by the rolls and got locked out of expanding / playing the late game, or dealt with a player that wanted to take advantage of the newbie (something all too common and incentivized by the mechanics of Catan).\n\nI think people are allowed to counter positive opinions with their own negative opinions. In public discussion threads, you're not just directing your responses at the person you replied to, but also to everyone who can see it. \n\nIf someone on this subreddit plugs Catan as a recommendation to new players, I think it's valid for others who have seen the sour taste it leaves to also chime in, especially when any valid criticisms of it are being misrepresented.\n\nI actively want more people to enjoy this hobby, and while many of us are biased because Catan might've worked on us, it leaves a lot of new folks jaded and there are games much better designed to ensure new players have a great time. \n\nAnd let's be honest, you said yourself that games that \"serious gamers\" fit a certain archetype that invites toxicity. Have you considered that the historically popular gateway games like Catan select for those types of people?",

However, the goal of the game is still to end up with the most points at the end of the game so it actually strongly encourages you not to work with just a single other player, but to spread it around.\n\nMunchkin similarly can have positive interactions, with the base race of elves even having the benefit that they get additional benefit from helping other players. However, in my experience munchkin seems to usually devolve primarily into the group trying to screw over another player and the winner is the person in second place who wins after the person in first place is destroyed by the group making it a less enjoyable game to me.",

So, we bring Braggart and Century \n\n* Have a few medium-weight games that people newer to board games can still find approachable and fun without feeling too overwhelmed, but that experienced gamers can still play and have a good time. Things like Steampunk Rally, HEAT, Dice Forge, or Flamecraft. \n\n* Have a couple of heavier games that you're more than happy to play if someone suggests, e.g., Beyond The Sun, Ark Nova, Woodcraft, Revive, Gaia Project/Terra Mystica/Age of Innovation. \n\nIf you have 2-3 of each type, maximum, then you get to not only stop the analysis paralysis of having so, so many games of each type, but you also get to change out which games you're bringing with you every few weeks. That way, new options come up, but it never leads to analysis paralysis for choosing a game. If something is either being overplayed or is never chosen, that is a good candidate for being swapped out. I usually swap out only 1 game of each type at a time, so that it feels more like a rolling stock than a complete switch.",

For people who really love dominion, it's really strictly a 2 player game and lasts around 12 minutes if you are fast shufflers. 3-4 player games tend to be a little bit less popular among \"competitive\" dominion players since they can take a lot longer, and things like turn order matter a huge amount.\n\nThe game length is inherently variable depending on the cards available. If there are certain strong combos or single-card strategies available, then a 2 player game can be done in less than 10 minutes. Games with heavy attacks and no good mitigation can be a real slog.\n\nFor 3-4 player dominion, it can still be short, but will usually take a lot longer. Basically you can estimate it as 10-15 minutes per player, so 4 player games can take an hour. \n\nThere is a digital steam version of the game which is free to play the base sets, and you can play vs AI if you just want to get a feel for the game.",

            "text": "In Marcus du Sautoy's \"Around the World in 80 Games\" where he does mathematical analysis of classic games, he reveals that it is possible for a two-player game of Monopoly to be over in two turns:  \n    \n\"Player 1, Turn 1: Roll: 6-6. Lands on: Electric Company. Action: None. Double means roll again. Roll: 6-6. Lands on: Illinois Avenue. Action: None. Another double, therefore roll again. Roll: 4-5. Lands on: Community Chest. \u2018Bank error in your favor, Collect $200.\u2019 Action: Collects $200 (now has $1,700).  \nPlayer 2, Turn 1: Roll: 2-2. Lands on: Income Tax. Action: Pay $200 (now has $1,300). Double means roll \u201cagain. Roll: 5-6. Lands on: Pennsylvania Railroad. Action: None.   \n  \nPlayer 1, Turn 2: Roll: 2-2. Lands on: Park Place. Action: Purchase ($350, now has $1,350). Double means roll again. Roll: 1-1. Lands on: Boardwalk. Action: Purchase ($400, now has $950). Another double, therefore rolls again. Roll: 3-1. Lands on Baltic Avenue. Action: Collect $200 for passing Go (now has $1,150). Purchase three houses for Boardwalk, two for Park Place ($1,000, now has $150).  \n  \nPlayer 2, Turn 2: Roll: 3-4. Lands on: Chance: \u2018Advance to Boardwalk.\u2019 Action: Advance to Boardwalk. Rent is $1,400, only has $1,300. Bankrupt. Game over.\u201d  \n  \n**Edit:** A lot of discussion about the lack of auctioning. Current rules state that if a property is not bought then the property goes to auction, which starts at $10. The players DO NOT have to bid. If nobody bids the property goes to the bank.  \n  \nSome are suggesting this is against the spirit as the players are deliberately tanking the game so might as well just bid all the cash and then go bankrupt on turn one. But as u/VioletKate99 suggests, Player 1 should open the auction at the mortgage price. If they win they can mortgage straight away to keep the cash. If Player 2 out bids they have even less money to pay off the final debt, and mortgaging the properties won't save them.",

This is gonna be a long post, but I'm bored and it's Friday.\n\nThe final turn for Player 1 doesn't matter where they end up, as long as they still have the money for the houses and don't end up in jail. Plus, since they end with $150, they don't need $200 from Community Chest. $100, or even $50, would be fine. You don't lose at $0, you lose if you owe money past that. So that leaves 5 cards out of 16 from the Community Chest that would make this all work.\n\nAnd Player 2 is a lot more flexible: They just need to land on income tax, and then Chance to Boardwalk. There's a lot of ways that can happen in two turns.\n\nSo calculating for these flexibilities, the two players don't actually depend on each other, outside of the set parameters. I'll assert that only P1 can land on Community Chest, and P2 can only land on Chance, to keep that true. Otherwise, the odds of who needs to draw what starts to break my brain.\n\n---\n\nSo first, the odds of player 1's turns going as planned.\n\n**Turn 1:** \n\n* Roll (6,6) (2.7%)\n* Roll (6,6) (2.7%)\n* Roll a 9 (4 ways) (11.11%)\n* Draw a +$200, +$100, or +$50 (31.25%)\n\nMultiplying all of this together, turn 1 has **a 0.002679% chance** of happening, or **about 1 in 37325 chance.**\n\n**Turn 2:**\n\n* Roll (2,2) (2.7%)\n* Roll (1,1) (2.7%)\n\nThe third roll can be lots of things, as long as they aren't doubles. Not counting for CC odds yet, that's 20/36 possible rolls that work out fine. (55.5%)\n\nThe odds of a community chest draw being fine get complicated, based on what they drew initially. But I came up with an 85.3% chance that the card drawn is okay. So that's an 85.3% chance that a roll of 3 (2 ways) is good, which comes out to another (4.74%) So all together, we have:\n\n* Don't screw up the last roll: (60.3%)\n\n**Total odds for turn 2 are 0.0465%, or a 1 in 2149 chance.**\n\n---\n\nPlayer 1 odds: 0.002679% \\* 0.0465% = a **1 in 80,225,787 chance.**\n\nI'll post the breakdown for player 2 in the next comment because this got out of hand.",

I'm sure there's a better way to work this out, but all that really needs to happen is that they land on income tax at some point on turn 1, and land on Chance at some point on turn 2. I'll lump these both together and see how many ways it can happen.\n\n**Income Tax:**\n\nThis is 4 spaces away, and by asserting that CC is off limits, this calculation is really easy. They need to land there turn 1, because there's no way to hit it turn 2. So that just means roll a 4: There's three ways to do that. **(8.33%, or 1 in 12)**\n\n**Chance:**\n\nNow to hit the chance on turn 2. If they didn't roll doubles on turn 1, then this is just about getting to Chance in 3 rolls or fewer. I spent way too long on this, but accounting for doubles, the odds are **about 1 in 15 (6.77%).** Not really that rare, honestly.\n\nIf they *did* roll doubles on turn 1, then my brain implodes. So I'll just stick with the chances of landing on the second Chance space in any two rolls, removing doubles on roll 1 (To make sure it's turn 2). **That's about 1 in 18 (5.48%)**\n\nPutting these together, P2 has a 6.34% chance of landing on Chance, and then a 1/16 chance to draw the right card, for a **0.3962%** chance of getting to Boardwalk via a Chance card.\n\nThere's also a chance they'll just land on Boardwalk itself, if they didn't roll doubles to end on income tax. That's another **0.0029%.** Probably pretty negligible, but it *can* happen!\n\nAll together, the odds of getting to Boardwalk are **0.3990%, or 1 in 251.**\n\n---\n\nPlayer 1 odds: 0.002679% \\* 0.0465% = a **1 in 80,225,787 chance.**\n\nPlayer 2 odds: 8.33% \\* 0.399% = 0.0333%, or about a **1 in 3007 chance.**\n\nCombined together, we get a 4.145e-10% chance of this happening. That's a 4 with 9 zeros in front of it. About a **1 in 241,267,462,355** chance.\n\n---\n\nSo a 2-player game of Monopoly has roughly a **1 in 241 billion** chance of ending in two turns. That's a fair bit better than the many multiples of trillions for this *exact* game, but you probably won't see it happen naturally either way. I guess the main takeaway is that player 1 needs to be *far* luckier than player 2 for this to occur. In the other 80 million cases, player 2 gets to buy Boardwalk after losing 200 to income tax.",

                    "body": "Tbf I was just demonstrating rolling a 4 generically, not in this specific case, but yes otherwise I agree.\n\nSince I'm bored, why not answer that second question lol: \n\n- 2: always a double, jail, can't land here\n- 3: community chest\n- 4: baltic avenue (or doubles, we'll deal with them later)\n- 5: income tax, would be fine but wouldn't leave you enough money for houses, can't land here\n- 6: oriental avenue\n- 7: chance\n- 8: vermont avenue\n- 9: connecticut avenue\n- 10: just visiting\n- 11: st. charles place\n- 12: also always a double, jail\n\nSo aside from doubles, rolling a 5 also means we can't win on turn two, thankfully rolling a double and rolling a 5 are mutually exclusive results so we can just simply add the 6/36 chance of a double and the 4/36 chance of a 5\n\nSo the simple result is (36-6-4)/36 = 26/36 = 72.222%\n\n---\n\nHowever, neither this comment nor the original post deal with the community chest or chance decks, so for completeness: (this is going to be a bit long but you can skim read most of it, the bad cards are bolded)\n\nAccording to this [source](https://www.zpag.net/Jeux/list_of_all_monopoly_Chance_Community_Chest.html), there have been a few different versions of the decks, well be using the *original US version* (for consistency since the names are all US based so far anyway)\n\nThe Chance deck list is as follows: \n\n1. **Advance to Boardwalk.** - *Already owned by P1, no effect, **however**, drawing this means P2 can't draw it, so it's a bad card*\n\n2. Advance to Go (Collect $200). - *More money, otherwise no effect*\n\n3. Advance to Illinois Avenue. If you pass Go, collect $200. - *Does not collect $200, can deal with the landing on the property in the same manner as the original post, otherwise no effect*\n\n4. Advance to St. Charles Place. If you pass Go, collect $200. - *As above*\n\n5. Advance to the nearest Railroad. If unowned, you may buy it from the Bank. If owned, pay wonder twice the rental to which they are otherwise entitled. - *Unowned, so as above*\n\n6. Advance to the nearest Railroad. If unowned, you may buy it from the Bank. If owned, pay wonder twice the rental to which they are otherwise entitled. - *Unowned, so as above*\n\n7. Advance token to nearest Utility. If unowned, you may buy it from the Bank. If owned, throw dice and pay owner a total ten times amount thrown. - *Unowned, so as above*\n\n8. Bank pays you dividend of $50. - *More money, otherwise no effect*\n\n9. Get Out of Jail Free. -  *No meaningful effect*\n\n10. **Go Back 3 Spaces.** - *Repositions P1 to Income Tax, meaning they can't afford the houses needed, bad card*\n\n11. **Go to Jail. Go directly to Jail, do not pass Go, do not collect $200.** - *Can't collect rent in jail, bad card*\n\n12. Make general repairs on all your property. For each house pay $25. For each hotel pay $100. - *No houses bought yet, no effect*\n\n13. Speeding fine $15. - *Loses money but not meaningfully so, no effect\"\n\n14. Take a trip to Reading Railroad. If you pass Go, collect $200. - *More money, otherwise no effect*\n\n15. You have been elected Chairman of the Board. Pay each player $50. - *Gives P2 $50 but they're short $100, so no meaningful effect*\n\n16. Your building loan matures. Collect $150 - *More money, otherwise no effect*\n\nSo if we land on Chance, the only cards that can actually kill this strategy are \"Advance to Boardwalk\", \"Go back three spaces\" (since it's just Income Tax again lol), \"Go to jail\"\n\nAs for the Community Chest deck:\n\n1. Advance to Go (Collect $200) - *More money*\n\n2. Bank error in your favor. Collect $200 - *Removed from deck in an earlier turn*\n\n3. Doctor\u2019s fee. Pay $50 - *Pay money but not meaningfully*\n\n4. From sale of stock you get $50 - *More money*\n\n5. Get Out of Jail Free - *No effect*\n\n6. **Go to Jail. Go directly to jail, do not pass Go, do not collect $200** - *Bad card*\n\n7. Holiday fund matures. Receive $100 - *More money*\n\n8. Income tax refund. Collect $20 - *More money*\n\n9. It is your birthday. Collect $10 from every player - *Loses P2 money*\n\n10. Life insurance matures. Collect $100 - *More money*\n\n11. Pay hospital fees of $100 - *Pays money, not meaningfully so*\n\n12. Pay school fees of $50 - *Pays money, not meaningfully so*\n\n13. Receive $25 consultancy fee - *More money*\n\n14. You are assessed for street repair. $40 per house. $115 per hotel - *No houses, no effect*\n\n15. You have won second prize in a beauty contest. Collect $10 - *More money*\n\n16. You inherit $100 - *More money*\n\nSo despite some cards losing money, P1 has a budget of $150 for their houses at the end of the turn and can afford anything in this deck, \"Go to jail\" is the only killer Community Chest card\n\n---\n\nIn summary, for the last roll of P1's turn\n\n- rolling a doubles means jail (6/36)\n- rolling a 5 means Income Tax (4/36)\n- rolling a 7 means Chance, from there 3 of the cards are bad (6/36*3/16)\n- rolling a 3 means Community Chest, from there 1 card is bad (2/36*1/15)\n\nAll mean they can't execute the strategy for one reason or another\n\nSo there is a 1 - 6/36 - 4/36 - 6/36\\*3/16 - 2/36\\*1/15 = **2969/4320**  = **68.72%** \u2248 *69%* (nice) chance for P1 to get the result they need on that last roll\n\n---\n\nI wish I'd planned the 69% thing, truly didn't know that going in and had a massive laugh seeing the result from my calculator lol",

Was that not what you were assuming in your example?\n\nOh, I think I understand now. You were just filling in how the missing auctions would have had to occur in the theory assuming the two players are playing rationally.\n\nWell in that case, player one still doesn't have to lose the auction. They just have to avoid overpaying too much. We shouldn't need to worry about under bidding as a rational player would not let another player win a property auction for less than mortgage value if they had the cash to contest it.\n\nSo we just have to worry about overbids. Player one only had $150 left over, that's not a wide margin. Perhaps player one is hesitant to bid much more than mortgage value in property auctions? Even if they bought each property for $37 above mortgage value, they would still have the money needed after mortgaging to purchase Park Place, Boardwalk and the five houses.\n\nAnd if they don't contest Baltic Avenue above mortgage value because they plan to mortgage their other properties and invest in houses that turn, they could afford to have gone $50 above mortgage value on each of the earlier three auctions. Baltic Avenue on its own is only worth $30 to mortgage, so it wouldn't be able to give player two enough profit to pay the rent.\n\nOf course investing all your money in houses on Boardwalk is a dangerous strategy which is unlikely to pay before you land on a space that forces you to sell the houses back. But this is one way player one could win the auctions and still win on turn two.",

Gloomhaven by comparison really only affords you a few choices at any given moment depending on the situation and your cards. Even less so in the town phase where you are choosing an option where the outcome can feel extremely random. The game is complicated in that it is hard to learn the rules but IMO not nearly as complicated when considering what is the optimal play. Nemesis is incredibly easy to actually play compared to Spirit Island and since it is somewhat dependent on dice randomness there is no \"right answer\" a lot of the time. You can just decide whatever you like in various situations and even go the roleplay route of coming up with and acting in character and still win.\n\nAnyway I guess I disagree with your chart in some ways. I'd put Nemesis in three bars and Spirit Island up to 5 bars. I haven't played all these other games so I wonder if the same is true where you are thinking more about knowing the rules than playing the game reasonably well.",

Any Heat games are fairly quick as everyone is picking their cards at the same time and executing should be straightforward (just follow the count). Fun list agree with the rest of them mostly but everyone will always have differences based on their board game group.",

And Wingspan is 3?\n\nWingspan is that game I can easily get non-gamer friends to play.\n\nThe biggest challenges that should effect weight the most, IMO, are: Game Length & Rules Complexity.\n\nIf it's under an hour, and has simple actions to learn, it has a much lower floor of entry.\n\nStonemaier games is great at this, IMO, with both Scythe and Wingspan being more open to non-gamers then similar games due to the simplicity of actions, and how they're laid out. Even though Scythe is on the longer side, I can get it to the table more often among non-gamers than other games with similar length.\n\nI think there's a good debate over whether weight should focus on the skill floor or skill ceiling of a game. I personally feel that it should reflect the skill floor, namely how hard is it to convince people to play after explaining the game and average length of time... But I think the voting populous on BGG consider game length, followed by skill ceiling more than we probably should.\n\nIs the person who conceptually understands that Wingspan is an engine-building game going to win more often? Yes. But newer people can figure out plenty of strategies on their own, compared to some old-timey war game with a manual the size of a textbook with specific rules for historical locations that aren't used anywhere else (A modern example being War of the Ring's fortifications, which are used literally in only one space on the board).\n\n**TL;DR:** Weight should be about floor of entry for the game, not skill ceiling (with additional consideration for lengths longer than 1.5 hours). Because of this, I personally think Wingspan and Gloom should each be 1 lower, as wingspan is an easy teach that takes \\~1 hour, and gloom can go even faster than that and is easy to conceptualize.",

I feel much more exhausted after an hour of Root than an hour of Dune.\n\nI might make it a 4-bar system with the 5th bar being something else entirely to convey that it's primarily about _time investment_ instead of brainpower. Maybe 1-4 and then \"spare battery\".\n\nOtherwise, I think it's great! I might co-opt this and sub in some of my collection!",

They love all of them so far, specially ticket to ride. I was wondering which game I should buy next. Do you guys think the 2bar games from this list are all good enough to be the next ones? what about games not listed there? I really liked the idea of Heat but I don't know if it's simple enough to be the next one.\n\nOther games on my buying list: Wingspan (played the pc version and thought it was boring), Wits & Wagers (not really more complext but a party game I feel like they'd love), Pandemic and Zombicide.",

My go to game for that time you just finished a long game but don't want to leave just yet. That \"just one more game\" game:))\n* Hues and Cues -> one or two bars depending on your group. It's a chill game about how we all associate certain colors and hues to specific things that sometimes don't even have a color at all (literature is red, science is blue, things like this). \n* The mind -> two bars. One good example where the weight does not dictate the brain power you need to play. It's clearly a very light game, but you still need to be aware constantly to what was last played and how long ago, look at players and try to deduce how close their next card is to the one on the table and get your cards down at the right time. All this without counting cause' that makes the game not fun at all.\n* Mind MGMT -> four bars. Hidden movement game that goes so much more into deduction and step tracing than other games. The fact that you can't just straight up ask \"were you here at some point\" but instead you have to ask \"have you passed a parrot at any time\" is so mind crunching. And that is just the training game. Once you add the Immortals that block you from asking about symbols that they stand on it gets another layer deep. All that without all 14 mini expansions included in the box. With all these surely it goes to 5 bars but i doubt anyone can play with all those.\n* Mansions of madness -> three or four bars depending on the scenario you play. At it's core it is not that complex to understand and after the first play it's actually really easy but the story and playtime bump it up a bit. Very good and well structured stories that on the first play really feel like you are in some kind of movie. You really get into the skin of your character and start to go mad along with them:)) \n* Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective -> three or four bars depending again on the scenario you play. Another game that drops you into the story, but this time it's not a horror lovecraftian mansion filled with monsters but central London on 221B Baker street trying to solve cases for Sherlock Holmes following leads and questioning any detail you have in the well structured story from straight lies people tell you all the way to how people dress or what stuff they have in their homes.",

Or as a group limit yourself to a ratio of simple-to-advanced spirits\n* When picking cards ignore all that have tricky requirements like origin from holy site, specific lands or targeting blight and whatnot. Not having to worry with every card whether you can even play it helps a ton.\n* Keep an eye out for cards that have the elements you need for your innate abilities. If most of your cards supply the most important elements there's fewer dilemma whether to play card A for the effect or card B for the elements.\n* If you're playing with more than 3 people, stop discussing the whole board with each other. If you need help on \"your\" board tell the other players. If you're in a position to branch out and go help others do.\n* A pinch of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Sniping / pushing / pulling a lone explorer preempts the whole escalation of building and ravaging.\n* Clearing a land permanently is often worth more than just chipping away at a big village. A blob of multiple cities, towns and explorers is gonna do exactly the same amount of damage as a single town or 2 explorers.\n* Don't fret the initial phase. Yes you're underpowered, yes you have barely any presence and can't help each other much. You'll catch up.\n\nUltimately though, never be afraid of admitting something's too hard for you. I've encountered a number of games that I *can* play, it's just not enjoyable for me.",

I've played with someone who had all the expansions, but had never played with an Adversary.  This tends to be much lower complexity.  We like playing it at the edge of our capabilities, so it can easily hit complexity 5--especially with spirits like Fractured Days or Dances Up Earthquakes--but sometimes we pick a really great set of spirits or get perfect card draw and it becomes a walk in the park.  It tends to be more variable in nature than almost any other game I have ever played.  This is SIs strength and its limitation--once you understand how these things interact, you can customize the experience to a pretty significant degree, but it will still sometimes surprise you.",

There are so many variants and powers that it can become a 2 or 4 in terms of complexity.\n\nIf there is 1 new player, I would stick to green and yellow aliens, with only 1 variant (hazards). Most of my play sessions are with a group that wants some complexity, so we include red aliens and 3 variants (rewards, hazards, moons). We have done a few games with every variant (at the time), and that was definitely a 4 at least for complexity (rewards, hazards, tech, stations). I wonder how it would be with the addition of the odyssey variants mixed in altogether (moons, lux, evolutions, objectives). The game even recommends not going more than 3 or else it becomes unwieldy, but some take it as a challenge.",

It has a great combat system with a cool traitor element (though from what I understand it\u2019s a little hard to trigger that), and some nice area control, but the meat of the game is in the alliances formed each round which are filled with game making and breaking betrayals and can get complicated and time consuming - but in a good way! But because this is where the fun is the game really works best at the full 6 players, which pushes the playing time up a lot.\n\nThe 2021 Dune is basically the original game without the alliances/negotiation/betrayal aspect, instead they\u2019ve shinied up made the combat by making it so the traitor element is more likely to pay off and that\u2019s where the big \u2018game\u2019 moments are. I consider Dune 2021 to be \u2018Baby Dune\u2019 - it\u2019s a perfectly fine and fun separate game on its own, and it\u2019s more accessible playing time means it\u2019s way more likely to actually be played. \n\nI actually own both games now! When my crew have played Baby Dune enough and the time comes for Mother Dune they\u2019ll know 50% of the mechanics already and the learning curve will be much smoother which is always a good thing in heavy games.",

It\u2019s a lot more predictable and less rules to manage, but even with that I\u2019d put it at a good 50% with your analogy. But then you can also play it and dial it up to 100% with a level 6 adversary, blight card, a complex spirit, and a scenario (or really go crazy, multi hand play spirits, or additional adversaries etc.)\n\nI\u2019d vote you give it another shot (for as much as a strangers vote is lol). It\u2019s an amazing game. I need to play it more, it\u2019s such fun to see what other people do with a spirit differently than you, or the way spirits combo together.",

For example I would only pull out Nemesis with a dedicated group of enthusiasts, - even though the rules themselves really aren't that difficult to grasp - whereas I've taught Dune Imperium, a Class Four game, several times to complete boardgames beginners without issues. In fact I might suggest you separate the Class Five in two categories : 5.0 would be the games that have a big table presence and take an afternoon to complete, but have fairly straightforward and intuitive rules - like Nemesis or Spirit Island - while 5.5 would be the games that, on top of that, require a lot of brain power to assimilate their huge set of rules (ex, Dune 2019 or Twilight Imperium).",

You can look at the current state, choose an an action to adress this specific state and generally be successful.\n* There's very little potential to play yourself into a corner or shoot yourself in the foot. Of course it's possible to play badly and lose but most mistakes are recoverable.\n* The coop nature allows players to cover each other's blunders, something not possible in competitive games.\n\nTzolkin for example sits at a weight of 3.7 and is significantly more punishing in these regards.\n\nImperium Classic sits at 3.6 and is significantly harder to understand.\n\nAquasphere sits at 3.7 and cannot successfully be played without planning AT LEAST 1 turn ahead. If you haven't planned one specific thing you're not able to compete in the final scoring.\n\nMaybe those should be higher instead of Spirit Island being lower. idk",

However, there's an alternate ruleset where the first player to die gets to control the aliens. It's a bit unbalanced because giving the Intruders a human brain is a *very* big buff to the already near unkillable aliens, but it does help mitigate that.\n\nThe Coop mode means the only way you'll ever be eliminated is if you make a willing sacrifice or you just die to the aliens/events, so the chances of early elimination tends to drop down drastically.\n\nAs for more specifics on the time, it does vary from game to game- sometimes you get a fairly quiet game that goes quickly, others you end up with a quick massacre of the players, and othertimes you get through a brutal slog from start to finish where you don't even get to complete your objectives. So I'd say the game is pretty variable, but with an experienced group it caps out at about 3 hours *if you're unlucky.* Most of the time my games end in \\~2.\n\nI will be honest though, I think part of the fun is seeing the story that develops- the game is very thematic, and sometimes a player can die to a chestburster 5 minutes in which then evolves into a Breeder which proceeds to rampage through what would have been an otherwise \"quiet\" game, and othertimes it's a good, quiet start that progressively becomes more and more of a slog. Some of my most fun games have been the ones where I'm the first to die (and some of my friends would agree) because you kinda get to see just sheer movie chaos unfold in a different way each game.\n\nThe game is definitely worth playing imo, but I understand the hesitation with player elimination- it's a pretty inherently unfun mechanic, but for thematic games that build a bit of a narrative it's kind of a necessity. I like to treat the game a bit more like D&D in that sense, where it's \"just part of the story.\"",

Leaving a single town is functionally the same as a whole pile of invaders.\n* A pinch of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Getting rid of newly spawned explorers preempts their whole annoying escalation of building and ravaging and spawning and building etc...\n* Every spirit has weaknesses and your cards might push in a direction that's even more so.

Both are highly action efficient.  Then even if they build, you can Gather the town in order to prevent needing 2 points of defense in the Ravage phase.\n\nBy gathering towns away from certain zones, you can create 'pockets' that are not adjacent to towns, and thus don't receive any explorers, which net stops you from having to do **anything** to clean the zone.\n\nBasically there's only a few spirits who actually want to be stopping things in the Ravage phase (spirits like Eyes).  Many want to be stopping things in the explore/build phase, using gather actions and killing individual explorers.  Many spirits (River is a great example) want to push them all around the board until it creates one megazone and then late game nuke the zone that has like 2 cities/5 towns/4 explorers off the island.\n\nAction efficiency!  A build delayed is a build denied.  Many people think the primary way to deal with invaders is kill them, when in fact directly killing with cards is mostly a late game activity, and you want to be moving them somewhere harmless or defending their blights instead.",

They start stronger than you, but you can outgrow them. Slow them down, grow fast.\n\nA huge beginner mistake is to keep reclaiming to get that one defend card to stop blights. You don't grow, you don't kill, you are just stalling while they are getting stronger and your growth is minimal. \n\nAnother big thing is preventing builds. Stop them from growing! If I have a push power and a land with an explorer, a town and 2 dahan that is about to ravage and another land with an explorer that is about to build I will 99/100 times prevent the build and sacrifice a blight and a dahan for this trade. This way I have killed a town through the dahan and prevented another down by preventing a build. So much better than preventing that one little blight.\n\nPlay your powers, activate your innate. Don't just play one card because you dont see a use for the other slow card. Play your cards, activate your innate and play slow powers even if you don't see an immediate use for them (the board state will change before they activate).\n\nBest example is River. If you play at least 2 cards a turn, activating your innate every turn, use your pushes to prevent builds, you are golden. You can have two push powers every turn. Preventing every build on your board. Don't needlesly reclaim and you'll outpace the invaders like crazy this way.",

As worker placement can feel less directly attacking other players (most times you can block them) where area control is directly targeting other players often. I find people got to be in a mood to be directly attacking one another.\n\nAlso, some games will hit multiple categories and that's ok also. I know some people will try to get everything into just one category. For example, cubits is a racing game, a \"Deck\" building game, and a bit of a push your luck game.  \n\n\nIn terms of the number of categories that can depend on what your library contains. If you find you have some categories with one to two games maybe you scrap those categories (unless you know someone specifically likes them). For example, I have a dexterity category because I like them, but most groups don't have a single game for that category, so it won't make much sense.  \n\n\nIt's also a living list which not only includes the games and where they sit but what categories you include. As you group gets more familiar with a game the social battery level may drop. As people get more comfortable with a game and the strategies get more in depth the battery level may rise. As your group gets into new games you may find yourself wanting to make a new category type (I use to not have a whimsical/ push your luck category until we got into games like camel up and ready set bet. We then put existing games into that category also like quacks of Quedlinburg and Incan Gold that didn't seem to have a category).\n\nMost important, do what works for you group and the best way to figure that out is trial and error.

I agree defending to stop the first blight is usually a waste, but man, defend lets you use Dahan.  It's so energy efficient too, a defend card usually costs 0-1 and completely stops an entire zone, and often with any sort of Dahan movement you can set it up so you completely clear the zone too.  You can stall a blight spread, clear a zone, all for one card play and no energy.\n\nThe thing I see being most  overvalued is direct damage.  A card that does 2 damage for 2 energy is probably not very useful, but oh man people love it.  It's like oh man, you killed that town good, but you probably could have just gathered it somewhere and had the same effect without spending energy.",

Even as just a stalling mechanism, Defend is generally more efficient than skips and blight removal, as long as the Defend number is high enough; it's just not necessary to stall at low difficulty.

Ofc this is important but by the pictures you can understand that this bathroom doesn't even have a shower or bathtub, it will not get that much moisture in the cardboard unless ofc OP is not careful with whatever he can possibly do to damage the wall with water, the sink is not even that close. As for the toilet being in that wall, usually the splashes when you flush go to the front of the toilet not the back??? Now for the men that piss all over the place (sorry, can't really understand how hard it can be \ud83d\ude05) my boyfriend is super non careful with that and he never splashes the wall, wtf? Also, being a board game player, the most important thing is having manners instructed to your friends about being super fucking clean around board games, I would NEVER invite friends over knowing they wouldn't do that, I guess it goes for the bathroom too. And being at someone else's house I think anyone would care to leave things as clean as they found it and try to be more careful, idk. Unless OP throws a teenage party with 40+ people in that house (we're board game players how many people do we actually know) I assume the bathroom would be pretty clean",

                    "body": "I did so, because I did not want to defend the same thing in every thread. And people don't seem to understand what the reality of this is. And no matter what I say, it gets downvoted since people don't agree. I feel it to be toxic even I have said many times the different things what leads to this decision.\n\nBut despite of this most probably being voted down, I'll try to explain this once in here.\n\nFirst of all: In Finland in my type of apartments it is mandatory to send all change projects to licensed officials for review. As in this, I did and the construction engineers here in Finland went through my plans and came personally to look at the site. We discussed all the materials (not just the boardgame box covers!) and all were good. It is the words of this engineer that this is a dry room, and there are no humidity or risks that requires any special sealants or \"waterproofing\" on the wall. Floor yes. It is baffling to me that even I said that this is the case, still people insist that \"mold\" or \"yup, it's gonna stink\" and \"it needs waterproofing\" and when I give perfectly valid reasons why it is not true, they downvote. Who should I trust here, people in internet or the trained professional who discards or allows this kind of work on a daily basis as his job?\n\nSecondly: I especially chose covers that can handle wiping with damp cloth. Tested many. Also did a test with clear lacquer on random back of a box and did a water test with that and uncovered. Neither \"sucked\" in the water, so there is no point on doing lacquering. This only confirms the construction engineer's statement that it is totally ok. Also the sink place is chosen for the reason that the water don't spill from there to the wall. The distance is rougly 1,5 meters from there.\n\nThirdly: I acknowledge the risks of someone pissing / projectile vomiting or shitting on the covers, but that is a risk I am knowingly taking. Me being 43 years old, there have not been any occasion during my life that this has happened. It is not a guarantee for the future, I know, but if it happens, then I will renovate the wall. No big thing. There are no teenagers or children or drunken people using the toilet, it really is just me or my GF that uses this 99% of the time.\n\nLastly: The toilet bowl is chosen also to be modern, and it is not a traditional toilet which splashes down the water to the bowl. It is a new type flushing which circulates the water around and I have never seen a drop from it anywhere. If you like, you can look up IDO Glow.\n\nI understand that there are bacteria in toilet, but I assume that I should trust the professionals on matters like these. As said, in Finland it is really not uncommon to have regular wallpaper in toilets. Out of curiosity, I google d a bit on the same topic in Finnish and there were people saying that they have had wall papers on toilet walls for 25 YEARS without a problem.\n\nSo... I just don't want to justify something to random people that don't have any real basis on this specific issue but their worry. And a worry that I have gone through with the officials BEFORE the construction process.\n\nMy goal here was just to showcase the result of my project. Maybe I did wrong considering that, but at least I hope that people would understand that their view might not be the correct view and respect what I say and tell about the situation.\n\nI love the criticism on \"Why break boxes\" or \"I don't like this, it's ugly\". But the criticism for the waterproofing with what I went through... Not just worth defending because I know better.",

When you cut it, you have to seal it, which OP did not. Even if it never receives bodily fluids, it should be cleaned and those edges will bubble. If it's cleaned like it should be, it'll look horrible in a couple months.

That stuff will start to come apart very quickly especially with chemicals, and it sounds like a _very_ ineffective stress test.\n\n\nIt's your room so you do you.

Seven years ago, you paid us $15 to protect a pristine parcel of land on the US-Mexico border from racist billionaire Donald Trump\u2019s very stupid wall.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, an even richer, more racist billionaire\u2014Elon Musk\u2014snuck up on us from behind and completely fucked your land with gravel, tractors, and space garbage.\n\n2017: BEFORE MUSK\n\n\n2024: AFTER MUSK\n\n\nJust look at it. He fucked it.\n\nHow did this happen? Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX was building some space thing nearby, and he figured he could just dump his shit all over your gorgeous plot of land without asking. After we caught him, SpaceX gave us a 12-hour ultimatum to accept a lowball offer for half the land\u2019s value. We said, \u201cGo fuck yourself, Elon Musk. We\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d\n\nSo today, we\u2019re announcing Day 7 of Cards Against Humanity Saves America:\u00a0CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY SUES ELON MUSK FOR 15 MILLION DOLLARS.\n\nIf we win, we\u2019ll split the net proceeds equally among all 150,000 of you, up to $100 each. While this will never be enough to compensate you for the anguish you\u2019ve experienced witnessing Elon Musk defile your once-verdant land\u2014where wild horses galloped freely in the Texas moonlight\u2014we think it\u2019s a pretty good start. Unfortunately, Musk has way more money and lawyers than we do, so you\u2019ll probably get, like, $2 tops.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you want to increase the pressure on Elon, here\u2019s something you can post on Twitter (the platform he wants you to call \u201cX\u201d for his own sexual gratification):\n\nIn 2017, I paid Cards Against Humanity to protect a pristine plot of border land from Trump\u2019s racist wall. But then an even richer, more racist billionaire\u2014Elon Musk\u2014stole my land and dumped his shit all over it. @ElonMusk owes me $100. #ElonOwesMe100Bucks\u00a0www.ElonOwesYou100Dollars.com\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWith great vengeance and furious anger,\n\nCards Against Humanity\n\nOur mailing address is:\nCards Against Humanity\nPO Box 316620\nChicago, IL 60631",

There are parts of the US that do not require a wall, because it is basically an empty desert with no service for 100s of miles. Creating a wall there does not stop immigrants crossing, they can destroy the fence because no one is watching it, it just hurts the wild life. It stops wolves from hunting their entire pack area, it stops other wild life from moving freely, and it can impact the environment. \n\nThe fact just remains that there are areas of the border that do not make sense to put up a wall. It would be, at best, a huge waste of money. \n\nPlus, if the US really wanted to, they could just confiscate the land. The land purchase did nothing. The US could just buy the land if it wanted to.",

I'm going to try to answer at least part of this in good faith, and hope you're not just sealioning.\n\n\"White genocide\" is one of those terms, along with others like \"the great replacement\" or \"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children\", which sorta sound innocuous, but are part of a series of what are called **dog whistles**.\n\nA dog whistle is a term which comes across as harmless.  In this case \"what's so bad about not wanting white people dead?\"  And in a vacuum, you would be correct!  But there's a deeper hidden meaning to them.  In this case, it's \"in order to protect white people, we must elevate them above everyone else, even if that means killing other lesser races.\"  This isn't hyperbole, this is not me trying to minimize or exaggerate, this is just... what those things mean.  The last of the three examples I gave is, for context, the *rallying cry of neo-nazis* who explicitly want genocides to happen.\n\nWhen someone talks like this, they aren't taking a proactive stance to better themselves or their culture.  They are taking a *reactionary* stance, in response to what they see as threats.  Specifically, threats from foreigners, immigrants, and different ethnicities. And also almost always Jews too, though that's a much, much deeper well.  People do not use these terms otherwise, because the thing about dog whistles is that they're just not what a normal person would *say*.  A normal person, who is against genocide, would say \"I am against genocide!\"  They would not frame it as \"I am against *white* genocide!\"  The inclusion of that adjective, in a world where the thing they are talking about isn't happening, is a very specific word choice that makes it stand apart, while still allowing for plausible deniability.\n\nAnyway I hope this helps explain how tweets like that make Elon Musk come across as a big 'ol racist.

That's no less ridiculous than saying vegetarians are evil because Hitler was one. Separate the ideology from the person, and evaluate it on its own terms. \n\nAs for the reactionary bit, I guess I just disagree? You're right, \"I'm against white genocide\" isn't something a person normally says. It's something they say in response to a threat, just like Black Lives Matter or ACAB. And while I don't completely agree with the evaluation of the threat, I get it. Immigrants are being imported into small towns, the border crisis is ongoing and nobody wants to do anything about it, people like Floyd being put up as martyrs while people like Penny are demonized. It definitely feels like our priorities are a little wonky these days - and more than that, it feels like these polarizing issues are constantly being brought to light to keep our attention off of just how broken our two-party system is.\n\nSo yeah, I guess I'm still just not seeing how this paints him as racist, just because one thing he believes happens to coincide with one thing a racist group believes.\n\nEdit: this dude replies and then blocks me before I can even read the reply. \"In good faith\" my ass.

Black Lives Matter is a statement that opposes a systemic oppression that is both measurable and extant.  The US has been, and is, racist, and they would like that to stop.  Compare and contrast with saying \u201call lives matter\u201d.  What, exactly, is someone *saying* when they make that statement?  They aren\u2019t actually saying the believe all lives matter, because that arrangement of words isn\u2019t used by normal people to express that feeling.  It is, in fact, only used by racists to *dismiss* black lives, by implying that they have no unique or outstanding problems.\n\nThis is racism.  This is what a dog whistle is.  Just like the \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d conspiracy theory that you just parroted.  I actually fundamentally don\u2019t believe you don\u2019t understand *how* this is racist, I think you *like* that it\u2019s racist, and you just don\u2019t want anyone else to recognize that.",

I'm a \"climber\" level patreon backer of yours.  \n\nI'm very thankful that you posted that on X and not on Youtube because it would pull away from gaming which is something we all agree on and politics seem to divide people instead of uniting people.\n\nI give you props for your own beliefs and saying them (just like I am expressing my views here) -  I do personally think that you responding to that nutjob on X is giving them publicity that is not needed, but I'm also not running a business like you are.

At the end of the day the problem is that each side of the conflict is going to take condemnation of only one side as tacit support of the other side. Even though it doesn't work that way. And social media is just not a good platform for trying to lay out that both Hamas and Israel have done and are doing some truly awful shit and both need to be stopped. That it isn't about religion because Israel does not represent Judaism no more than Hamas represents Islam.\n\nBut yeah. Big old yeesh. She tries to disassociate from the shit David Leavitt said but frankly she's not really much better.",

There's a lot of gray area between those two ends of the spectrum. \n\nNot every single board game is political - there are tons of apolitical games out there, such as **Fort**, **Throw Throw Burrito**, **Blokus**, and even **Quacks of Quedlinburg**.\n\nBut to claim that politics has only recently, slowly, creeped into the space, without acknowledging games such as **Monopoly:**\n\n>[The history of Monopoly can be traced back to 1903, when American anti-monopolist Lizzie Magie created a game that she hoped would explain the single-tax theory of Henry George. It was intended as an educational tool, to illustrate the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies. She took out a patent in 1904. Her game, The Landlord's Game, was self-published, beginning in 1906.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_\\(game\\))\n\nor **Spirit Island**:\n\n> [As a game where the theme is explicitly anti-colonial, I think that Spirit Island merits discussion and kudos. It reverses the course of more typical Euro games based on a colonial premise. Indeed, games like Puerto Rico and Catan encourage players to place colonists and roads, develop personal fiefdoms, and extract natural resources without reference to any sort of autochthonous environment or beings. In Spirit Island, on the other hand, players take on the role of gods who seek to protect the indigenous inhabitants \\(\u201cthe Dahan\u201d\\) and destroy European efforts to interrupt the natural setting. Spirit Island is novel, and it has generated a fair share of controversy.](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2636453/spirit-island-considering-theme)\n\nshows a lack of understanding of the hobby.",

                    "body": "It's not Rodney or anyone else's job to police other people's willful misunderstanding of their statements. If someone like you legitimately believes that \"complicated relationship\" must mean dislike or hate, that is a reflection of your own personal biases more than a reading of the intentions of the original statement. I feel pretty confident that Rodney doesn't need your expert PR skills to tell him how something might be perceived, he's been an prominent online member of a community for a long time, he knows how this works. Maybe reflect on the fat that someone who says things publicly for a living didn't think this was wrong to say but you PERSONALLY did. I definitely don't think you get to speak for all religious people as a whole on this as your comment implies.\n\nRegarding \"hates or dislikes\", I've never met a person who uses those two things in a sentence and doesn't mean to imply the \"hate\" part. If you meant \"dislikes\", you'd have just said \"dislikes\". \"Hates or dislikes\" is classic couching so that when someone calls you out on your strong word choice of \"hate\", you can disingenuously point to \"dislikes\" and say \"I could actually mean this\". It's literally the exact same tactic that started this whole point. \n\nYour argument about having never encountered an atheist who likes religion ONCE AGAIN misunderstands atheism. There's a place between like and dislike, and it's ambivalence. I am an atheist, and to me religion is no different than literally any other organization that humanity has created. It has the ability to bring people together to do great things and form deeper connections than almost anything else. It's also been used as the reasoning for some of the greatest atrocities committed in humanity's history. Religion is no different than the people that are part of it, which is flawed in the way only humanity can be. I don't think religion is good or bad, it's just an outward reflection of like-minded humans, and is as good or bad as the people that are a part of it.\n\nI'm not going to keep replying to this, because it's clear you don't want to have a good faith discussion (and in fairness, neither do I). I just want to leave you with something to think on. You said this:\n\n>I have multiple family members who say the exact same thing and are atheists (and I love them to death)\n\nDoes it not seem weird that you felt it necessary to type out that you have family members that are atheists and you still love them? That people might assume that you WOULDN'T love them because they are atheists, and that it was important to clarify that you DO, rather than think that people would think you love your family even if they are different that you?  From my PERSONAL experience, people who say these things don't actually love you, or respect your decision, they just want to feel good about themselves because they can still interact with you even though they're confident you're wrong. Maybe that isn't you, and you always tell everyone you love your family every time they come up. But maybe you're so convinced that your worldview is right it's important for you to state publicly you can still like people that disagree with you. I'm just letting you know how another person might perceive this. :)",

I'm probably missing plenty of lore, but as a standalone incident the covid picture struck me as a nonissue that got blown out of proportion. If people who already disliked her or her associates used the covid picture as a pretext to attack her (as it appears to me), then I can see why she might feel justified lashing out in a similarly sloppy manner against someone else (Rodney).

So like chess, it's a fun game if you have someone you can play against that is the same 'level' as you are. If not, it's only fun during the first half and then you get outpaced.

                    "body": "For nearly 40 years, my girlfriend's family has hosted an annual \"Games Olympics\". Aside from a missed year in ~~2021~~ 2022 during COVID and a virtual Games Olympics in ~~2022~~ 2021, her parents have hosted friends and family from all over the country (and occasionally from abroad) in this all-day games competition. Once upon a time, after an all day gaming session, a friend of her parents (who did not play that day and has never participated since, funnily enough!) suggested they should make this an annual thing. The rest is history.\n\nEvery year a survey goes out for competitors to vote on the games they want included and want to participate in. This year's games were Azul, Catan, various editions of Ticket to Ride, Splendor, Wizard, Take 5, Wits & Wagers, Hearts, Carcassonne, Pictionary, Monoply, Scrabble, Pit, Camel Up, Lost Cities, and Uno (this year's final game). You play 5 games, 4 of which are played in smaller groups and the last is played by everyone.\n\nHer father has a system for assigning points based on your place in each of the 5 games you participate in so that an overall winner can be crowned. A [Hall of Fame](https://imgur.com/a/efg0F6X) is maintained for people who win certain games multiple years as well as those who have been crowned the overall winner of the Games Olympics multiple years. This was my first year participating, and it was a great day (although an unusually terrible performance in Wizard mean I finished lower in the standings than I think I otherwise would have expected). My girlfriend was the overall winner last year (her first ever victory), and she has proudly displayed her trophy in our home since then.\n\n**Edit:** Scoring Explanation\n\nTotal points available for each game is equal to 5 points per participant. The baseline is a 4-player game with points awarded being 8-6-4-2. Note, participant means the overall number participating, potentially across multiple subgroups. For example, there were 6 people playing Azul across two 3-person games. After the first game of Azul, the groupings were shuffled and a second set of two 3-person games were played. Time allowing, a third game might have been played. The overall winner for Azul was the player with the highest score across all Azul games played. That's how we can have a 15-person Wizard game: there were multiple games going on and every couple of rounds we shuffled, so you didn't play all 12 rounds of Wizard with the same group of people. For games without an inherent ranking system (e.g. Risk), one is devised to determine how to award 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.\n\nExamples of how points can be distributed...\n\n4P: 8-6-4-2\n\n5P: 8.1-6.5-5.0-3.5-1.9\n\n6P: 8.1-6.8-5.5-4.5-3.2-1.9\n\n7P: 8.2-6.6-5.5-5.0-4.5-3.4-1.8\n\n8P: 8.2-7.5-6.5-5.5-4.5-3.5-2.5-1.8\n\n9P: 8.3-7.7-7.0-6.2-5.0-3.8-3.0-2.3-1.7\n\n15P: 9.0-8.2-7.5-7.0-6.5-6.0-5.5-5.0-4.5-4.0-3.5-3.0-2.5-1.8-1.0\n\nThe Uno game at the end that included every player awarded 12 points for 1st, but otherwise the difference for winning a high participant and low participant game was no more than a point. In the early years of this event, there were big games that had big payouts for 1st, but after a couple of years they realized this meant you could prioritize large games and run away with the overall victory early in the day, so they now throttle the value of the first couple of positions when allotting additional points for more participants.\n\nAs I was making the above list based on this year's games, I noticed that some games with the same number of participants had slightly different values for some positions, particularly 1st. Apparently, this is done to handicap the winner of a game when there is one particular person who is overwhelmingly expected to win that game. So for example, if you absolutely dominate Hearts year after year, every year that Hearts is included and you're playing, 1st place might be worth fewer and fewer points relative to another game with similar number of participants.",

My family was kinda broke so I didn't have a ticket, my friend gives me one of his 10... and I won the bike.  Ran down there like I was the final contestant on the price is right.  His parents were so pissed, so I offered it to him, of course, but they stubbornly held their pissed off stance.  They were one of the richest families in our town too.  And they forced him to avoid and not talk to me anymore because of it lol.  We still tried to hang out, but his parents were just too petty.  When we did hang out shortly after I won the bike, they bought him a new, pro level mountain bike, top of the line everything, and he couldn't even ride it lol.",

I spent the day at my friends house helping his wife host as friends dropped by.  She heard my phone notifications and I told her about this post.  Throughout the day, every new notification turned into a chorus of FUCK CANCER.  I know she had such an incredibly hard day, but you all helped her find a bright side.",
