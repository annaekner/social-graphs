            "text": "My 10-year-old daughter, Pippa, was the lucky recipient of the 22 hat in Edinburgh on the third night.\n\nI am genuinely overwhelmed and deeply touched by the kindness and happiness expressed to my family in the last couple of days. I\u2019m also incredibly proud of how polite and gracious Pippa was; it was by far my proudest moment as a father.\n\nOn behalf of my adoring family, please accept my thanks for your love and kind wishes. Pippa was blown away at the concert by how happy everyone was for her. I\u2019m struggling to find words than express my gratefulness, but please know you are an incredible community. Every kind message has touched us dearly.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nHappy Dad\n\n",

Like the Meet & Greets, but a million times worse because there's only one hat. Instead, by giving the hat to a kid, everyone just gets to go 'omg so cute' night after night, because it is",

It always amazes me though that what I consider the true die hard obsessed swifties who follow her everywhere claim to be the biggest fans collect everything tweet her potential location violate her privacy and expect that because of her very public life she does not get the right to any sort of privacy and must be \"ON\"  at all Times in the public view which none of you would in any way tolerate and knowing that Taylor on so many occasions has made it known how truly scary people mobbing locations in which she is reported to be freaks her out and makes her very anxious as well as feeling unsafe why would you guys claim to be swifties yet ignore such an important detail?\n\nJust seems less than cool to say I love you so much but I give 0 F*cks about your feelings and or safety? Just some food for thought and something I wonder a lot but what do I know I've never been fortunate enough to even go to one of her concerts I hope the serious swifties take this as constructive advice and not me being hateful",

I don\u2019t know - or really care - how this differs from one father to another, or one parent to another.\n\nAs for \u2018the hat\u2019, my pride has nothing to do with Taylor Swift, or her hat. However, in my daughter\u2019s 10-year-old world, her dreams were coming true. Something that meant so much to her that she didn\u2019t even imagine would happen to her, actually happened. In front of 73,000 people and one of her role models, she danced, sang, and embraced every second. When the exchange happened, she was nothing but thankful, gracious, and humble. When she returned to her seat, she let every person who came up to her try the hat on and take their own photographs. Her kindness here moved others to tears, and her selflessness was beautiful.\n\nUltimately, I don\u2019t think I can help you relate. She\u2019s my daughter, and how she acted and responded in incredible circumstances, will never not make me proud every time I relive the moment. Manners, kindness, respect and gratefulness are massively important values in this household. Even in extraordinary circumstances of such significance in her wee life, she did not falter.\n\nI deserve to be this proud.",

It feels like she made this album without trying to cater to everyone all at once - there are no kidzbop tunes or spoonfed metaphors. She is being so honest and real about how she feels about her fame and her fans demanding things from her, she's not sugarcoating it for anyone. As a 32 year old fan who has been listening since debut, it feels like Taylor wasn't worried about alienating her fanbase with her work for maybe the first time ever (although you could make that argument for reputation, but TTPD has the advantage of a more grown up perspective).\n\nThis album IS what being in your 30s feels like. Being in your 30s doesn't stop you from feeling heartbreak any less than you did in your 20s - you're still messy and wild, but able to put on a brave face and deal with it a bit better. Being in your 30s is finally breaking free from giving a shit about other people's opinions and deciding you're going to live your life the way you want. Being in your 30s is looking around and wondering if you're the only one who still pretends what they know what they're doing half the time. ",

She said when she announced it the album was mostly a big therapy session that she absolutely needed and wanted to write. And she practiced what she preached and kept writing no matter whatever state of mind she was in. \n\nI\u2019m not expecting people to get it or looking for something familiar that they can play on repeat or on the radio. People will be disappointed by that. I think this album is one where you\u2019re at home chilling with your headphones on and just vibing or need to feel something. \n\nTo me the album is great. I got down voted in another sub by just saying that. I loved the album. What else can I say. I\u2019m excited to see what\u2019s next. I think she\u2019s not done yet. Very surprised by no lyric videos but those might come after the MV premiere. That in itself is going to be interesting. Especially from the way the song sounds and the 3 second teaser.",

Her albums have always been on the nose with where I was in my own life, for the most part, and I\u2019ve always wondered what Taylor\u2019s albums would look like as she/we got older. At some point she\u2019s going to need to break from her traditional starry eyed, innocent heart vibe, right? What does that look like?? I feel like we saw a glimpse of that break in Midnights but it was also a very pop, digestible for the masses type album. I really like Midnights but it wasn\u2019t as deep and cutting as some of her previous work overall (some songs were more than others, but I\u2019m generalizing the album). \n\nAnd then we get TTPD and holy forking shirt this whole album hits deep. I honestly think this is my new favorite album of hers. There\u2019s only two songs I don\u2019t jive with (The Alchemy and I Can Fix Him). 29/31 is insane! I was initially annoyed by the people not \u201cgetting it\u201d and kind of dogging her for it but I think she knew that was going to happen and she put it out there anyways because it\u2019s honest and raw and just real. And she knew the ones who \u201cgot it\u201d would really get it. This is not an album made for the masses and she put it out there knowing that. She had to. So if she\u2019s okay with that, I\u2019m going to have to let it go and be okay with it, too. \n\nFor me, this album is so grown up and takes a look at this period of her life with a rawer, less idealistic lens and I think most of us in our 30s can relate to being in that place in our lives. We\u2019re still the same teens and 20-something\u2019s who cried and screamed and dreamed to Tears on My Guitar and White Horse and Love Story and Red and ATW and so many more, but now we\u2019ve been through some shit by this point in our lives and have a hefty dose of reality under our belts. Even though the subject matter of a lot of these songs is heartbreak, it\u2019s giving a far more introspective lens than most of her previous work ever did and I think that\u2019s insanely relatable. \n\nI honestly could write an entire dissertation on my thoughts on this album. To me, it\u2019s one of the best overall albums she\u2019s ever done. And if you disagree, maybe you\u2019re just 23 and will understand it better in 10 years and that\u2019s okay \ud83d\ude06 Go listen to Red for now.",

Most music is made for early 20s, but this feels a lot like the stand-up special by Taylor Tomlinson. \"Is this a permanent flaw or something I can fish out before winter comes?\" Acknowledging your own self harm through toxic partners/not staying true to your values for the sake of a relationship, etc. I hope she continues to make music as she progresses deeper into life stages. I am so glad it's not super sad acoustic. \"I can do it with a broken heart\" feels so relatable. You can just mope when you have shit to do. It's fine when you're younger, but the older you get, everyone has their own shit and can't be listening to your sad sapping all the time. You gotta continue on, and you tend to be more resilient at least externally.",

While all her other work, whole fun, was nostalgic or a \"yeah to be young\" kind of thing. But my god, those albums gutted me. \n\nI was realizing how lost I had let myself become. The songs about relationships were tragically relatable. I mean, how could she not start doing that while in the process of the re-records? Bringing up everything from her past. Examining from a very different perspective. \n\nSince Midnights, I see her stepping more and more out of her superficial image. I honestly think she is preparing the fandom for a massive reveal or something that will alienate a large amount of them. Like becoming more politcal or not being as boppy or peppy or something. TTPD is getting a lot of hate, but it's my favorite album because it's not forced a \"smile bitch\". It's unhinged, manic, angry, standing up for herself, obsessive, sad and broken all in one.

BUT i think this is the first time she's really captured the energy of what it feels like to be a woman in her mid-30s -- the type of resentment you have, accepting that you are kind of a mess, just being over a lot of things... she's always been diaristic but with a varnish; this is diaristic in a much more straightforward way. i actually think the lyrics that people are pointing to as \"cringey\" speak to this -- it's unfiltered word vomit. ironically, i think it's a lot less cringey than some of her earlier work! \n\ni honestly think this is something olivia rodrigo does really well for her age group (and why she's another artist who a lot of millennial women seem to be drawn to as they reflect back on their late teens/early 20s) -- she is so good at capturing and expressing the feeling of what it's like to be a woman of a certain age.",

Honestly I would say I relate more to Kacey's self-care and settledness but I can see the maturity in the lyrics in Taylor's album and wouldn't call it immature. I also think they forget she's still playing with the Five Stages of Grief in her lyrics and denial and bargaining are a thing. There's the person Taylor and then there's the songwriter Taylor Swift, she's always playing with literary devices and exaggerating for dramatic effect in her work.

                    "body": "I just turned 45 and honestly felt like my \"grow up button\" is broken.  I don't feel any difference between being 45 and when I was in my 20s. The only thing that's different is looking back at my 19 year old self dating a 31 year old man makes me sick. I can see how he took advantage of me, but I did get my beautiful daughter out of it, so it wasn't a total loss. It just changed my future. Looking at my 19 year old self, I'd love to scream that I didn't need to feel the shame I felt at church and 6mo pregnant & single because nobody there was judging me but me. I rushed and married a stranger, but that gave me more beautiful children, but ended in divorce because of abuse. He was 10 years older than me.  So if anything all age brings is not caring what others think and self reflection of past mistakes. It's refreshing to see that it is normal to not have that magic grow up button that we all believe we have for some reason. Plus, my babies are all grown now, so it's me time. I still look like I'm in my early 30s and \"get away\" with dressing how I want, listening to what I want without much pushback. \nI swear I'm going to be 70, 80 or even 90 and still dressing in cute clothes that won't be considered age appropriate by the youngins lol \nI can't tell you how happy I am that Taylor brought pleated skirts back. Those have been my favorite since clueless years.  You know who's telling me to dress my age or wear my hair my age? Flipping men! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I also cared way too much what others thought of me and I started asking myself who am I living for? People in my life who doesn't pay my bills, feed me or sleep with me? Stranger's on the internet who literally have zero power over my life? When I started asking myself those questions that's when I gave up caring about what other thought and started discovering who I was, what I liked, started speaking my mind even if others don't agree with me. I am a very loving person. I decided that I wasn't going to dislike anyone based on their opinions, race, gender, how they identify, who they love, their political beliefs, religious beliefs, at the end of the day they have the right to believe and speak on whatever they want just like I do and if I want my opinions at least respected than I had to give that to others as well, even when I didn't agree with them. The only things on that list I just put that I judged was religious and political beliefs. The rest I never cared about. \nI promise you that you're going to reach the freedom of not caring anymore. When you finally do, my God is it the best feeling. \ud83e\udd0d",

A different type of music, he's into blues and I'm a Swiftie but we both play guitar.",

Because if she did MILLIONS would follow, and that is all money for him.  Taylor joining truth social even to make ONE post, would be putting money directly into Trump's coffers.\n\nI'm sorry your family members are in a cult, but there is no way to break through to them now.  It's too late.  I believe Taylor was ALWAYS going to endorse Kamala, but that is all strategic in conjunction with the Harris campaign.  they do not want to step all over the convention messages this week.   She will, at a time and place of her, and of Kamala Harris' choosing.  In the meantime, the lunatic has once again forced something upon a woman without her consent.

When he sees these misleading claims, it becomes a battle of my word against that of a former president.

Everyone deserves a government that takes global health risks seriously and puts the lives of its people first. The only way we can begin to make things better is to choose leaders who are willing to face these issues and find ways to work through them.\n\n\u201cI will proudly vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in this year\u2019s presidential election. Under their leadership, I believe America has a chance to start the healing process it so desperately needs.\u201d\n\nWe need to calm down \ud83d\ude05.

Everyone thought that it was reputation being released because of the jewelry bathtub reference in Look What You Made Me Do. HOWEVER we learned that the dress was really referencing the song ~bejeweled~. Tonight, everyone thought she was releasing reputation because her inner circle and even Taylor herself changed her profile picture to black and white photos of themselves on their Instagram profile picture. We were like omgggg reputation TV is coming! WRONG AGAIN! Ok\u2026 so then I wonder if the dress has anything to do with a song on the album. What does the dress look like? A WEDDING DRESS.  {insert you\u2019re losing me \u201cI wouldn\u2019t marry me either, pathological people pleaser\u201d}. Okay, so as we know she just went through a breakup after 6.5 years. A theme in midnights was marriage and how it just wasn\u2019t happening with Joe. I think that means that this album is going to be a breakup album at its core. It\u2019s going to talk about marriage. It\u2019s going to talk about heartbreak. But then, it\u2019s going to talk about falling in love again. \n2. TWOOOO. Ok as you guys know, I\u2019ve always thought folklore was a trilogy. I am a BIG BELIEVER IN THE BRAID THEORY (three strands, three albums & using hair to foreshadow music) My first thought tonight was \u201cwow, she\u2019s wearing a braid tonight!!!\u201d We know that it takes 3 strands to make a braid\u2026\u2026 I wonder if it\u2019s going to be folklorey vibes\u2026.. ??!!!!\n3. I also have a gut feeling it\u2019s going to be a lot of songs similar to the song \u201cdear reader\u201d because that was very ~poetic~ with a different vibe than folklore if she\u2019s going in a different direction. \n\nThese are my initial thoughts that nobody asked for \ud83d\udda4\ud83e\udd0d",

I acknowledge that I am a \ud83e\udd21, but please consider the following:\n\n\n- the title of this album and released lyrics perfectly align with emo-era poetic indulgence (I write sins not tragedies/a fever you can\u2019t sweat out, from under the cork tree, the young and the hopeless, life\u2019s not out to get you)\u2026 the fact that there isn\u2019t already a PATD album titled \u201cthe tortured poet\u2019s department\u201d is a miracle. \n\n\n- Taylor has long referenced the genre as an inspiration and one of her faves, has collaborated with Brandon Urie recently, recent music she\u2019s supported like Griff and girl in red have that vibe, and she\u2019s been longtime friends w Hayley Williams\n\n\n- Our girl is ALWAYS on trend, and everything 2000s is back again: ugg boots, low-rise jeans, plaid\u2026 \n\n\n- emo & pop-punk music has been influencing high-end artists recently \u2026 notably, Olivia Rodrigo, who has been crushing in the reinvented version of the genre. Taylor has also \u201cliked\u201d covers of her music in the genre on TikTok. \n\n\n\nThank you for listening. I look forward to being proven wrong after vehemently defending my  theory on the internet. But if our girl goes out in checkered vans, WATCH OUT \u2620\ufe0f\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udda4",

The absence of Dessner from the main tracklist of Midnights despite his presence on 3am and vault tracks - as though some new Dessner-produced tracks had been deliberately held back, as part of a deliberate choice to make that album an Antonoff-produced one.\n2. Lack of any major continuation (so far) of the sound TS developed with Dessner post-evermore, e.g. on songs like Renegade; All Too Well Ten Minute Version (Sad Girl Autumn Version); Would've, Could've, Should've; and High Infidelity - even though it is clearly a great, great sound, not just B-side material.\n3. Title and cover art reminiscent of The National and other Dessner collabs.\n4. Dessner's really enthusiastic and sustained support for Midnights even though he was left off the main tracklist (as though he knew his turn was coming).\n5. TS wanting to promote other Dessner-linked artists like Gracie Abrams, suggesting an ongoing close connection.\n6. The release of \"You're Losing Me\" - this may be an odd-one out (because it was Antonoff-produced) that did not fit on the new album and so was instead released as a \"Midnights vault track\".\n\nI actually suspect, for these reasons, that TS and AD probably recorded a lot of unreleased material in 2021 and 2022, contemporaneously with the Midnights sessions, and that Tortured Poets will give us that material.",

Joe was and is a good guy, but he didn\u2019t want what Taylor wanted and ultimately they weren\u2019t right for each other and the relationship probably became lonely and strained. But ending a relationship like that makes a person go insane (I speak from experience haha!). Matty was an old flame and so to rekindle this love and a crush she\u2019s harbored as a young 20 something was exciting and magical! I\u2019m sure he love bombed her and told her all sorts of things that she\u2019d been dying to hear from Joe. Rings, cradles. But Matty is not the best guy. And hence the tortured poetry. Taylor is prolific and I\u2019m sure she wrote a lot to get through this time in her life. I\u2019m sure she also wanted to address this time period of her life to the public and her fans, and that\u2019s what this album is. Now she\u2019s declared it done and dusted and can move on.",

The album is processing the emotions of a break up and all the ex\u2019s and self fulfilling prophecies we tell ourselves when we are going through it - aka down bad- \nI feel like this album is her screaming at the world that she\u2019s human and needs grace and space to be human without the level of dissection that everyone craves to be closer to her/ and being stuck under the microscope with so much speculation and loss of privacy during extremely private situations and experiences.",

She basically spiraled. That time that we would like to forget about is so important to understanding why she was so infatuated with Matty. He was different, exciting, and something she probably hadn't experienced in years (from Taylor's perspective; certainly not mine lol). Coming out of a 6 year relationship that was probably (at one point) a forever concept was difficult, and we can clearly see how insane her thoughts and fantasies were. I think that is where a lot of initial confusion came from surrounding the leaks. I even thought to myself, \\*it can't be about Matty.\\* But at the same time, I get it now. A breakup doesn't always end when the two people part; sometimes it's the aftermath that is even worse, and with Taylor, clearly the relationship had run its course, and the post-mortem was much crazier than we were lead to believe. I'm glad she has declared that chapter of her live dead. I seriously hope she is actually healed though. All of this happened so fast, and some of these lyrics are quite insane.",

This prologue is telling us that she won\u2019t hold back, that she spiraled, was in a manic state, and ultimately writing her thoughts, feelings, and emotions down in this way helped her process and heal. \nI LOVE that the album\u2019s lyrics seem to be more raw and come off almost straight from her stream of conscious to reflect her mental state. \n\nIt seems Taylor didn\u2019t hold back or filter as much as she normally would with her previous work. The album reflects a maturity and growth and good for being able to be brave enough to release and share this with this from what seems to have been a volatile vulnerable time in her life.",

Likely what she\u2019s saying is many of them are indeed about Joe and then more so Matty because she writes the worst men the best.\n\nSo Joe isn\u2019t/wasn\u2019t the worst, it just didn\u2019t work out. But then she acknowledges the harmful nature of the situation with Matty and enters into \u201cevidence\u201d for fans/the reader/herself that many of these songs were written with how she felt at the time, which looking back she now realizes wasn\u2019t love at all but mania. \n\n\u201cThere will be no explanation, just Reputation\u201d - TTPD is her attempt at an explanation for a \u201ccrime\u201d of self destruction. It\u2019s up to us/fans/even past partners to decide if we accept this evidence as explanation of her actions. Aka the story is told and now it\u2019s \u201cours\u201d - she wrote it all out and it\u2019s for us to decide how we feel/how we may choose to judge or not judge her.\n\nNot guilty on the basis of temporary insanity.\n\nWithout this explanation the album can come off as putting Matty on this love pedestal and this explains that she doesn\u2019t feel that way anymore/none of it was real.",

I think some of the lyrics throughout allude to her having an emotional affair with Matty as her relationship is ending. Then post-breakup, diving in DEEP, getting caught up in something so different than what she had experienced for more than half a decade. I Can Fix Him is the height of this mania until the final line when she realizes that she really, really can't. \n\nThen loml hits and I think this is her after the breakup with Matty realizing that she's lost both this big, long love she had with Joe and the sort of dazzling, rebellious excitement with Matty. This bleeds into I Can Do it With a Broken Heart. Then she gets angry at Matty with The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived before moving on to her current happiness with Travis. \n\nNot sure about the bonus album, as they seem more like Vault tracks. But the OG album seems to tell a fairly linear story, at least to me.",

Or people saying that she's self-obsessed and critiquing every small thing she does as \"making everything about her\" (the thing at the Grammys was probably too recent to be an inspiration for the song, but it reminds me of that)\n\n> I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me\n\n> You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me\n\nShe's grown up as a celebrity at the centre of pop culture, and that would be enough to drive anyone mad\n\n> So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs\n\nThe 'you' throughout the bridge feels like a plural you, but especially here with \"you kids\". 'Sneak into my house' brings to mind obsessive fan behaviour around Holiday House and Cornelia Street.\n\n> I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?\n\n> That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn\n\n> That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong\n\n> Put narcotics into all of my songs\n\n> And that's why you're still singin' along\n\nAgain, this feels like catty pop culture stuff - she's obsessed with herself and playing the victim, she's litigious, she's not actually a good songwriter, she just manages to 'put something in it' and make people like it anyway.\n\nI think there are other lines that fit with that interpretation too, like \n\n> The who's who of \"Who's that?\" is poised for the attack\n\n> But my bare hands paved their paths\n\nmakes me think of other people who are supposed to be notable/important but aren't on her level of fame - possibly other artists, possibly industry executives, possibly people in the media - waiting in the wings to tear her down if she's being cancelled. \"But my bare hands paved their paths\" - they got where they were by profiting off her raw talent or following in her footsteps\n\n> So I leap from the gallows\n\nFits with the idea of being 'executed' for 'crimes', possibly being cancelled again\n\nIt's all feeling very Mad Woman to me.\n\n**Edit** to add my thoughts on the other songs in the main album: I'm not 100% sure who 1 is about, it doesn't feel entirely Joe or entirely Matty to me. Possibly semi-fictionalised based on one or both? Or some secret fling that the public never heard about? 2-5 are 100% Joe, 6-9 are 100% Matty. I think given that I think 10 is about pop culture and cancellation and it's in the middle of the Matty songs, it's directly related to the Matty controversy. 11 is 100% Matty. 12 and 13 feel like they could be about either Matty or Joe, and I wonder if that's intentional?

The sign on your heart is still reserved for me.\" Like this is her going back to him after Hits Different, maybe. Or another time they were off. Especially because she uses the term \"bloke\" in the song, which is a British slang word.",

It\u2019s when one or both sides starts being rude and vilifying the other that it gets unhealthy. And there are a lot of people in this sub who do that. My feelings aren\u2019t hurt at all, but like I said swifties like me who don\u2019t subscribe to many leftist beliefs are going to feel isolated in a fandom that is largely a leftist echo chamber. I don\u2019t actually have a problem with your post in particular since I don\u2019t support Trump either. This just happened to be the most recent post so I commented my thoughts here.",

I had to deliver some things but she arrived around 1:30ish. We were forced to stand in the back corner while she walked past but I only caught I glimpse of her.\n\nFast forward to the end of the game. I was moving some things downstairs and needed the freight elevator but yet again they had to hold it. This time none of our bosses were there to dispel us so security let us hang around. She was feverishly thanking everyone (employees) for our help and thanked us repeatedly. A coworker got her attention by calling her name then she walked over and asked her \u201cDo you work here?\u201d. She then announced she\u2019d tip all of us for our service and pulled out a blue money phone inside an envelope, very modestly. She personally handed about 4 of us a blue note while thanking us before taking off. I still can\u2019t believe it happened. We lost but what a day. Thank you Taylor!",

Ed literally has been close with Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun for years and he still is. And if I'm not wrong Ed even attended a birthday party of \ud83d\udef4 last year. So if Taylor was truly the petty vindictive person they paint her to be, she would've cut Ed from her life a long time ago. This is why I didn't get the jokes that Taylor was going to be mad at Sabrina for taking part into Kim's Skim campaign. It was even more annoying that Sabrina was asked about it in an interview and had to explain that no Taylor wasn't mad about it. Seriously, a lot of things that Taylor gets accused of is purely projection.\u00a0",

With it came the most passionate crowds I\u2019ve ever played for, new traditions in the show, and an entirely new era added in. It was a more hectic pace than we\u2019d done before, and I\u2019m so proud of my crew/fellow performers for being able to physically perform that show and build our massive stage, take it apart, and make magic with so few days in between for recovery and travel. They\u2019re the most impressive people I know and I\u2019m so lucky they gave The Eras Tour their time, their energy, and their expertise.\nWalking onstage in London was a rollercoaster of emotions. Having our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating. The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows. But I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives. I was heartened by the love and unity I saw in the fans who banded together. I decided that all of my energy had to go toward helping to protect the nearly half a million people I had coming to see the shows in London. My team and I worked hand in hand with stadium staff and British authorities every day in pursuit of that goal, and I want to thank them for everything they did for us. Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows.\nIn cases like this one, \u2018silence\u2019 is actually showing restraint, and waiting to express yourself at a time when it\u2019s right to. My priority was finishing our European tour safely, and it is with great relief that I can say we did that.\nAnd then London felt like a beautiful dream sequence. All five crowds at Wembley Stadium were bursting with passion, joy, and exuberance. The energy in that stadium was like the most giant bear hug from 92,000 people each night, and it brought me back to a place of carefree calm up there.\n\nAdditional Comment:\n\nWe had some EPIC surprise performances from my long time friends@teddysphotos, @florenceandthemachine, and @jackantonoff. Performing 'Florida!!!' with Flo for the first time was unforgettable and Ed took me right back to our old Red Tour memories. It was the most dizzying honor to become the first solo artist to play Wembley 8 times in one tour. To the fans who have seen us this summer, you'll always have the most sparkling place in my memories. You were a dream to perform for, dance with, and share those magical moments with.\nWe'll see you all again when we resume The Eras Tour in October, but for now we get to take a much needed rest. Thank you for the adventure of a lifetime. May it continue...\nNO!: TAS Rights Management",

I am sad that we have missed out on the tour, but I understood from the very first minute that cancelling the shows were the wisest decision.\n\nSeeing many fans demanding a statement, bullying Taylor and her team (even the dancers!) without knowing the exact circumstances was even more saddening for me. Everybody is allowed to feel sad or grieve the shows we had been anticipating for a year but bullying and demanding things which we have no insight on won't take us forward or ease the pain.\n\nI do hope the community will calm down soon and we can move forward together. I watched the London shows at home, but it was so good to see everybody having a good time. I hope I can experience the magic on the next tour.\n\nEdit: typo",

I'm honestly glad she spelled out perfectly \"let me clear: I will not speak on something that might endanger my fans\" (I know it's not word for word, but couldn't remember it exactly). I'm truly glad she stood up for herself while also doing the right thing to her fans and everyone security.

Her statement wouldn\u2019t have made the news any bigger since  the cancellations made headlines everywhere. Instead the silence following the cancellations brought attention to herself in a negative way. the Longer she waited the worse it was for me and many of the rest of us who were in that situation.\n\nof course her actions also divided the fan base and a lot of people who were not there have been very cruel to us and calling us terrible people and fake fans. I\u2019ve loved Taylor since Tim McGraw. People I met in Vienna had tattoos of Taylor lyrics on their bodies. So I feel now very alienated from the swiftie community and I\u2019m not sure when if ever I\u2019ll feel comfortable back here, and that\u2019s really sad because the community in Vienna was the only thing that softened the blow of the cancellations.

I think I don't need to say much about that - but I almost fainted a few times during the show and my last hour there I was literally switching to singing loudly to needing to sit down at the floor (which I don't even do at my house, so you can imagine how bad the situation was) because I was too weak or getting dizzy. If I wasn't eating or drinking water for that last hour, I would have fainted. Every time I stopped it didn't take me more than ten seconds to start feeling dizzy or weak. God, I don't even know if I'd still be here if I hadn't gone with my boyfriend (he brought an absurd amount of food for us - and we had to throw some of it out because of security -, and let me eat almost everything because of my situation). It's honestly so scary to think about. And so so so bittersweet. I do know I was enjoying and singing loudly. But I have no memory of seeing Taylor. Or even of listening to her. I remember lightly a few parts of the surprise songs - and that's it. I just remember almost fainting every five minutes. And I was one of the lucky ones. I was at a spot that staff was giving water for free every ten minutes or so. Me and my boyfriend separately drank up to 2L of water. And yet I got to the level I did. \n\nI just don't feel at all I have attended the Eras Tour or that I have seen Taylor live. The very next night was rescheduled because of the heat and I saw SO many people complaining SO MUCH about Taylor doing this (it was rescheduled to a Monday, when initially it was on Saturday) and I would've given anything for my show to be rescheduled. Again, I was very lucky, she came to my home state/where I live and in a near city (less than an hour to get there - depending on day and traffic), so I would be able to attend whatever day it was. But still, I truly wish I could have at least one clear memory of seeing her and being there. I truly wish my concert was rescheduled and also as someone who was there when that tragedy happened... I feel kinda guilty. Looking back and remembering this show does not leave a good taste on my mouth because I know what happened. So much probably if the show hadn't been cancelled and something happened - the survivors would probably be traumatized (different experience of mine, so it's a bit of assuming, but I can't imagining going through that and not being traumatized) and have their memories of the concert pretty stained. I just wish people could realize that. While reading this I was a bit in doubt if I would've preferred a cancellation instead of having my experience the way it was, and honestly I think it only is a no because my boyfriend - who's not a swiftie and doesn't like Taylor all that much - had one of the best nights of his life just by experiencing the pure joy and excitement I had through the show - which I unfortunately have no memory of. If it wasn't for that, I honestly think I would prefer them to have been cancelled (obviously I'm talking to my experience only and not about all the other attendees who didn't go through the same and could enjoy it) instead of knowing I went to - spent all that money - and only have bad memories of what many say was the experience of a lifetime/the best night they ever had.",

The next ones are others that came to mind in case you get through the first ones or have seen them already. The last 3 I don't think fit *too* well, but I like them and they came to mind, so why not.\n\nAnd if you're looking for a series, Outlander and Bridgerton come to mind.\n\n> If it won't trouble you too much....\n\nOne of my favorite genres; it was fun thinking about it!",

Really hoping Travis and Jason react to this on the podcast!!\n\nETA: 1) stating that we had crumbs of their relationship is just me stating facts. Nowhere did I say I blamed Joe for this; 2) Ryan never did this with *any* of Taylor\u2019s exes before so my second sentence *also* isn\u2019t a slight against Joe.

            "text": "Now that the dust has settled a bit on everyone\u2019s shock at how much Matty Healy is present on TTPD, I thought I\u2019d do an analysis on how both of these muses play into the greater narrative at play here.\n\nFirstly, in the prologue, let\u2019s go through what she has to say about them:\n\n*You see, the pendulum swings*\n\n*Oh, the chaos it brings*\n\n*Leads the caged beast to do the most curious things*\n\n*Lovers spend years denying*\n\n*Resentment rotting away galaxies we created*\n\n*Stars placed and glued meticulously by hand next to the ceiling fan*\n\n*Tried wishing on comets*\n\n*Tried dimming the shine*\n\n*Tried to orbit his planet.*\n\n*Some stars never align.*\n\n*And in one conversation, I tore down the whole sky.*\n\n*Spring sprung forth with dazzling freedom hues*\n\n*Then a crash from the skylight bursting through*\n\n*Something old, someone hallowed,*\n\n*Who told me he could be brand new*\n\n*And so I was out of the oven and into the microwave*\n\n*Out of the slammer and into a tidal wave.*\n\nJoe is the oven \u2013 dying slowly, over time. The loneliness, the resentment, the caged feeling\u2026she knows this has to end:\n\n*Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter*\n\n*He was with her in dreams*\n\n*Gray and blue and fights and tunnels*\n\n*Handcuffed to the spell I was under*\n\n*For just one hour of sunshine*\n\n*Years of labor, locks, and ceilings*\n\n*In the shade of how he was feeling*\n\nShe knows that what they want no longer aligns \u2013 it\u2019s clear that they both wanted marriage and children at first (see: Lover) but then he got cold feet \u2013 and doesn\u2019t know how much longer she can give, especially since she feels like she\u2019s running out of time to have that future (the beat pattern in So Long, London \u2013 it\u2019s like she\u2019s racing faster and faster). She feels extreme guilt, but knows that this is unhealthy; even her friends are commenting on how unhealthy the resentment, stagnation, and fear of infidelity is:\n\n*And my friends said it isn't right to be scared*\n\n*Every day of a love affair*\n\n*Every breath feels like rarest air*\n\n*When you're not sure if he wants to be there*\n\nand\n\n*My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it*\n\n*Watch me daily disappearing*\n\n*For just one glimpse of his smile*\n\nI think people aren\u2019t talking about these lines enough. She feels afraid every day that he will betray their relationship (also in Fresh Out the Slammer: \u201c*he was with her in dreams*\u201d) \u2013 She knows that they\u2019re careening towards an ending \u2013 but who will end it first?\n\nEnter, Matty. The true villain of TTPD, from the language she uses, and the \u201cmicrowave\u201d from the prologue. We know that they reconnected in 2021, and that they originally dated in 2014. He worked on Midnights, on a track that ended up scrapped. I think this time is alluded to in Guilty As Sin? \u2013 she\u2019s dreaming of leaving, and he\u2019s doing things like sending her Downtown Lights (look up the lyrics). She wonders if maybe this is the way to go out, with a crash instead of a whimper. All along, he\u2019s promising the things she wants so desperately from Joe \u2013 a public commitment, a promise of children (look at Matty\u2019s interviews during this time).\n\nEssentially, he\u2019s promising her a \u201cget-love-quick scheme\u201d: leave the relationship you\u2019re dying slowly in, and take a chance on me, a reformed man who can give you what you need. She also is convincing herself, a girl who\u2019s entire belief system is built on fate and soulmates, that maybe this was the story all along \u2013 she so badly wants to believe that she didn\u2019t blow her whole life up for this (even though it was dying anyways), and he\u2019s telling her that it was irresistible, fated, meant-to-be:\n\n*Did you really beam me up*\n\n*In a cloud of sparkling dust*\n\n*Just to do experiments on?*\n\n*Tell me I was the chosen one*\n\nHe\u2019s saying all the right things and publicly making promises:\n\n*At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger*\n\n*And put it on the one people put wedding rings on*\n\n*And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding*\n\nShe wonders if she can slot him right into the place where Joe was \u2013 she can get what she wanted, and the future will stay the same, so does the person really matter now? (*\u201cAin't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here\u201d*).\n\nBut when she finally does give in, fully, despite the way her loved ones warn her away from him (But Daddy I Love Him) she finds that he actually is everything he\u2019s said to be. We see this narrative shift in \u201cI Can Fix Him\u201d:\n\n*The jokes that he told across the bar*\n\n*Were revolting and far too loud*\n\nand she ends the songs wondering if maybe she can\u2019t fix him, after all. This all comes crashing down in loml \u2013 the heat is too much for him, and he leaves her abruptly, leading her to feel immense shame and guilt. How could she think that he had reformed? How could she look past how bad he is (the jokes he tells, his general personality) for even a second? And even more than that, how could he have convinced her to leave her past relationship in such a fashion, even though she needed to leave?\n\n*A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme*\n\n*I've felt a hole like this never before and ever since*\n\nThis song brings back her split with Joe as the true sadness under it all:\n\n*You shit-talked me under the table*\n\n*Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles*\n\n*I wish I could unrecall*\n\n*How we almost had it all*\n\n*Dancing phantoms on the terrace*\n\n*Are they second-hand embarrassed*\n\n*That I can't get out of bed*\n\n*'Cause something counterfeit's dead?*\n\nBoth Joe and Matty promised her the future, but only one was a real love. The dancing phantoms are her and Joe; the ghosts of them are all over her apartment. Are they embarrassed that she is so terrorized by guilt and shame that she can\u2019t get out of bed? Are they embarrassed that the split with Matty is making her realize that it\u2019s impossible to slide in one protagonist for another, and try to have the same ending to the story?\n\nIt\u2019s why the most vitriol is reserved for Matty, and for herself. She\u2019s deeply angry at Matty: for being a terrible person, for convincing her he had changed, for luring her in by promising exactly what she wanted. She had convinced herself she could change him, and convinced herself that dying for his sins would be worth it, if she could finally have the future she craved:\n\n*I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside*\n\n*And you deserve prison, but you won't get time*\n\n*You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars*\n\n*You crashed my party and your rental car*\n\n*You said normal girls were boring*\n\n*But you were gone by the morning*\n\n*You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing*\n\nBut for him, he simply wanted the chase. He had no interest in ever delivering on his promises. It\u2019s why the tone towards him is so sinister. With Joe, she has more grace towards him \u2013 she understands why he\u2019s stagnant, understands what\u2019s holding him back. There\u2019s love for him, still, in how she writes. But for Matty, there\u2019s no love \u2013 his only goal was to play with her. And she\u2019s embarrassed that it worked. She can\u2019t get out of bed. She can barely hold herself together enough to do her job, the self-loathing and resentment is so intense (see: \u201cI Can Do It With A Broken Heart\u201d).\n\nI think the summary of it all comes down to this. She knows she has to leave Joe, and she takes \u201cmiracle move on drug\u201d (Matty) to do so. She doesn\u2019t think she can leave Joe unmedicated, and the alternative path is leaving Joe with nothing in her hands, and nothing to show for the six years she spent. Instead, she thinks it\u2019s better to leave him for someone who can offer her the same ending \u2013 only to discover that the drug was a placebo, with side effects similar to poison. And now she has to cope with the heartbreak and depression of leaving her almost-marriage, of the shame of falling for a con-man, and of the utter self-loathing of being so foolish to think that fate was real.",

There wasn't any time to truly feel the pain from the final end of her relationship with Joe and heal because she papered it over with Matty and the Eras tour.  When Matty ended too, the pain of both Joe and Matty hit her even harder at same time.   She has been singing about her feelings about the problems with her relationship with Joe since folklore subconsciously or by fictionalizing/obscuring.  There just wasn't that much material left unsaid about Joe.  Matty, like you said, was all new unheard material with juicy details.\n\nAnd its clear to me that Taylor has gotten sick of fans and the press judging her endlessly. So I wouldn't be surprised if she decided to throw a couple more Matty songs onto TTPD just to thumb her nose at those who judge her.",

It's so romantic to think this is the story all along. So it wasn't just the dying Joe relationship, it was their own lore that she got caught up in imo.\n\nIt's also interesting how there's Taylor the artist and Taylor the person. Taylor the artist was all about the drama and laying on the floor in a puddle in her music but Taylor the person continued eras, continued recording and working and taking over the music industry without skipping a beat. She even found time to become a football fan towards the end of the summer...She's not really that type of \"tortured poet\" and I think a lot of this is now tongue in cheek looking back at her going crazy kind of almost laughing at the hysterics re her behavior.",

This kind of stuff drives you insane for a bit.  \n  \nAnd she could\u2019ve just hid it somewhere and make us forget about this phase. Many swifties would\u2019ve gladly done that!

I think they were in love, but he was scared off when they first met, promised he had changed, but hadn't actually changed. \n\nThe missing context is in Peter imo.\n\nWhen they connected the first time 10-ish years ago, Matty said he was scared off by Taylor's fame because the 1975 had just dropped their first album and he wanted to be known for his own music and not just \"Taylor Swift's boyfriend\". That was the context to the \"emasculating\" comment. \n\nThis was from part of [comments](https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a34931/matt-healy-on-taylor-swift-q-magazine/) he made in 2016:\n\n> Matty: \"I was for a very short time immersed in a celebrity world that I found confusing and scary. At that time, I had fears of being 'somebody's boyfriend' (remember this is all speculation as we never dated!) before even being recognized for my music or presence as a person in my own right.\"\n\nHe would've been 25 at that time. It sounds like he told her the timing wasn't right because he wanted to focus on his band, so she lost him \"to the \"Lost Boys\" chapter of your life\". But he \"said you were gonna grow up/Then you were gonna come find me\". That's the reform she references; he obviously didn't get less controversial, but he makes a name for himself. \n\nThey were separated for about a decade (\"As the decade would play us for fools\" from \"Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus\") and then they did reconnect, like you talked about in your post. This time he says he's ready. But the public backlash scared him off again and he ghosted her (\"They just ghosted you/Now you know what it feels like\").\n\nAnd that's why Taylor is so angry in songs like \"But Daddy I Love Him\". He was the one who got away and when she got him he was scared off again.",

Maybe he wasn't completely comfortable with living in the public eye (which was what Taylor wanted too in the reputation era but not anymore). Still, he was a good partner to her. Theres mention of him in miss Americana too. Maybe he just wasn't the person who would cheer her on from the front row and kiss her in front of a thousand people, but the one who waited for her at the backstage hugging her as she finished the show. Doesn't mean he didn't support her. They even wrote music together. Just breaks my heart they didn't work out.

He promised me eveything I ever wanted from the previous guy but then suddenly left me hanging. Oh my god, the trauma, the self-loathing, the depression I went through. \n\nThank you Taylor for this album!

Although the line \n\n*Mr steal your girl, then make her cry* \n\ncould also apply to Matty \u201cstealing\u201d her from Joe and then ghosting her, I initially attributed that to the fact that she has previously hinted to pining after Joe the summer she was with Tom (*cat and mouse for a month or two or three*; *I\u2019ve loved you three summers now, honey, but I want \u2018em all*). We know she met them both around the same time. She also broke it off with Tom in early September 2016 and got with Joe a few weeks later, which isn\u2019t such a huge gap that it\u2019s not a pretty safe bet she was already talking to Joe, even if only as friends.",

It\u2019s very \u201chumanizing\u201d for someone of her celebrity status ; in which people have been angry at her for having the audacity to associate or \u201clove\u201d (it could be said that it wasn\u2019t genuine \n love , but rather a counterfeit illusion of infatuation) for MH . \n\nPeople absolutely were understandably upset about her choosing him, because he\u2019s an absolute train wreck of a human being. And she felt violated by fans having that opinion at the beginning. \n\nWhich is also understandable, because she is just a person who wants to live her own life. However , through the album , it becomes clear that the *realization* of why people despised MH became very real to her , once the cloud of his illusions lifted , and he began mistreating and disrespecting her , and manipulating her (eg the supposed suicide threat he gave her if she left him ) . \n\nThat could also be seen as outwardly selfish , to only see his miserable existence once something affected her personally and not from how he was documented treating others for years and in recent times . But as she outlines in the album, it was the insanity she felt for him during her immense grief of her long term relationship ending that distorted her reality of MH. \n\nMany women have experienced their own version of a MH in their lives : a  piece of shit of a human being who mistreated them (or worse abused them ) . Who they tried to justify fighting for out of \u201clove\u201d (likely would be due to traumatic experiences), and then eventually realizing who they actually were with . \n\nHer realization was just public . That makes a big difference. And that feels horribly shameful . \n\nThe album is an anthology of the two layers of grief she went through : the deep grief of a long term relationship ending , and the piercing grief of how one behaved in the aftermath . \n\nThe album is not about the two men . It\u2019s a post morteum of herself . It\u2019s raw as fuck. The anti hero example in long form .",

If it wasn't for that, she wouldn't have been as susceptible to his lovebombing, wouldn't have so easily believed he was a changed man, and wouldn't have been so desperate for it to work out. To that extent, the only song that is truly 100% directed at MH is \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\". Every other song at least touches on how she was in a more vulnerable state, which was a result of her breakup with Joe.\n\nTake \"The Tortured Poets Department\" for example. The entire song she is trying to convince herself that they are a good pair, because who else is going to be able to match and counteract him like she does? This eventually turns to \"Who's gonna know me?\" in the bridge. Though this song is very much about her relationship with MH, the desperation to find a perfect partner and the rose-tinted glasses she puts on to convince herself she can accept his flaws is directly a result of the ending of a long-term relationship and the loneliness that follows.\n\nAnyways, all of this to say, a lot of people thought this album would cover the breakup with Joe so were taken aback when MH kept being brought up. However, in my opinion, the whole situtation with MH *was* the aftermath of the breakup with Joe, so the album does cover the breakup in that sense. The prologue covers this as well, the Joe breakup made her insane, and that's why she went with MH.",

He wasn\u2019t strong enough to handle it; he finally realized what it meant to be Taylor Swift\u2019s partner and he wasn\u2019t up to the task.\n\nI realize I am romanticizing the relationship, but I don\u2019t think it was a bit of fluff.

It\u2019s also important for us to remember that the person Taylor portrays herself as to the media is probably slightly different than who she is behind closed doors and to her friends and family. Again this isn\u2019t me calling her fake or saying she isn\u2019t a nice person but I think it\u2019s similar to how we probably act a bit differently at work and when we meet people we don\u2019t know then how we act around our friends and family. I think in part she probably dies this to protect herself from being burned the way she was in 2016.

She obviously imagined herself with Joe as the only one, I think this is why she kept her relationship private. \n\nWhen I broke up with my ex after 5 years I went in a few weeks to the biggest shitbag of my whole 21 years. The relationship lasted for like a month and I realized that I used the guy to forget my past relationship. \n\nI think this case could apply to Matty too. She found Travis but I think she believes this love only because she knows that if she needs to find a new trustworthy partner it could take years and even if somebody for her is available then the family and marriage question is still there, so she will settle next to Travis as their vision could meet their desire. He is the safe choice for her.\n\nJoe maybe was in the right people, wrong time category. Travis got her when the timing was right. Such a sad concept of modern relationships.",

I mean, when she faced a similar onslaught of internet hate, she stepped back from the spotlight for over a year and is *still* writing songs about it. I cannot imagine what that kind of loud hatred does to someone's mental health. So I don't blame him for not being able to take it. He's a dick for ghosting her and not having a mature conversation about it tho.\n\nAlso, for those wondering why Matty inspired so many more songs than Joe, it's because that heartbreak was fresh. Her and Joe's relationship was already dead. She had already fallen out of love and moved on emotionally when she wrote those songs, and that makes a huge difference. Taylor and Matty may have only had a physical relationship for 2 weeks (if she is a reliable narrator), but they had an emotional affair for months prior. That and I get the sense that he was \"the one that got away\" from 10 years prior. After listening to this album, it's very clear to me that Question...? is about Matty. And while she was deeply in love with Joe, wanted to marry him and have his babies, Matty was that meteor strike that she had never felt before or since.",

The only made up characters are Betty, James and August , but even then it's a metaphor story for how Matty \"chased two girls and lost the one\" in cardigan. Matty is the one in this is me trying.

And then my friends would be much more upset about the second short-term relationship ending than the first long-term one. I would be confused, until I realized that you then grieve both relationships at once, but project them onto the last one.

She equates the latter half to that friend you call over after a breakup because you know she's going to care more about how you're feeling than hearing all the details. She's there for support, not for gossip. We all know that kind of friend, and she's saying \"Which one are you??\"\n\nThat's how I interpret the whole album, at least.",

It sounds like he's the one who she would consistently run to when things weren't going well in her relationships, not just Joe. I wouldn't be surprised if MANY of her older songs are actually about Matty, when we think they're about someone else. She's said she purposely leads the fans to believe songs are about incorrect people. I think she and Matty have at least been \"talking\" (as the kids say) for YEARS and the opportunity to get together finally happened this past summer and, well, the rest is history.",

Plus I can\u2019t see TK making jokes about her exes addiction - it doesn\u2019t seem to be who he is.

(think of when YLM was written).... So, I think she was just seeking passion and excitement. She tried to reignite that passion with Joe but it just wasn't there anymore so when something/someone new came along and showed that passion towards her, she wanted to feel that again, to feel wanted and seen which was no longer happening with Joe. Despite being with Joe, she was actually lonely, but willing to go down with the ship with him if he would have wanted her to. So she went for the quick fix with Matty and all the things he promised her that she wanted with Joe, and it backfired and made her feel worse.",

I don\u2019t doubt that he love bombed taylor because he\u2019s also been vocal about wanting kids and marriage so I think they both did it to each other but ultimately the backlash and death threats pushed matty to leave taylor so she\u2019s better off without all of his mess. taylor even alludes to this in some of the songs saying \u201cleaving me safe and stranded.\u201d matty also had to leave nyc because he had to go back on tour so it\u2019s not like he just ghosted her out of nowhere. whatever happened after that idk maybe he did stop responding and that was fucked up but you also have to give him some grace, he also had a very rough year and he showed that on stage. also the \u201ci win\u201d was said when he was dedicating songs to her at his concert because he was genuinely very happy. he really did want to pursue things with taylor but a lot of shit got in the way after they went public. i feel bad for both parties.",

I would recommend the platform in general though, as there's an excellent swiftie community there that I find significantly less toxic than most social media circles.\n\nI said it in a different comment, but I'll post a writeup for the anthology separately! To answer your question though, right now, I think the anthology is not just a deluxe edition, it's a double album. I think that album treats the situations outlined here differently, and the way it connects to fame and her overall career is deeper than it is on this set of songs. How Did It End feels like a response to the voyeurism of the public, first and foremost, and moreover, it feels like a response to herself. I don't think she knows why it ended, or can distill it easily into words. And I think the deeper message of that song is giving a lesson on the harm of public interest, hence its position on the second album.\n\nSo High School feels like an epilogue of sorts. Notice how she describes alcohol and drugs on this album - she's spiraling through them, or because of them, typically because of the muses around her. In So High School, her love interest is enough to make her feel high and drunk. It's a very different way to describe substances that are a part of her undoing in the first album, and a much happier song in general.",

But she\u2019s also upset at herself for believing in matty/ buying into what he had to say and some of the choices she made with him.

It was jarring at the time, but I think a lot of people chalked it up to her mindset on marriage shifting. But now, given the context of TTPD and You\u2019re Losing Me, it\u2019s clear that marriage and children are what she wants. So why did the situation of BTTS affect her so deeply? Is she grieving what she feels she has to give up to make her relationship work?",

I'm not sure if it was about him but for me 'he stayed the same, all of me changed like midnight rain' summarises their relationship best. Joe is a private person. He loved Taylor and wanted to give her everything. She wanted him but the fame too, which she works tirelessly to achieve. I feel that's why there was a tonal shift. Folklore and evermore were sombre. Even she knew they weren't going to be that big. But midnights was an all out pop banger. She realised she just can't put away the public star in her. They both had love, but sometimes love isn't enough, their lives needed to align too.",

I think this is a realization she's come to after releasing vault tracks for each re-record. Previously, we were getting the sanitized version of each album. For example, in Speak Now, the song we get about the VMA incident is Innocent, a song that took her 9 months to write. But the song she wrote immediately post the incident was Castles Crumbling. The song that makes it to the album is her forgiving the perpetrator, and there's almost no reference to her own thoughts on the incident. But the song she leaves off is heartbreaking, and discusses the crushing fear she has that this house-of-cards of fame will collapse at any moment. The songs she leaves off of Red are the ones really showing the depth of her despair of the Jake breakup, and her fear of aging in the industry.\n\nI think her lesson from the re-records is to stop editorializing and sanitizing her own diary. She wants to release the messiness. She wants to release the most raw version of her story possible. She doesn't want to feel like she's holding anything back, and I wonder if she feels like she works through things quicker when she releases her complete version of events. She alludes to this in the Manuscript - she discusses how the way we transformed All Too Well for her has made that experience less painful, and made her look at it with open, less biased eyes:\n\n*She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years*\n\n*Everything had been above board*\n\n*She wasn't sure*\n\nBut she describes how the passage of time, and writing about it, has made her realize her own purpose of doing it - to heal:\n\n*And the years passed*\n\n*Like scenes of a show*\n\n*The professor said to write what you know*\n\n*Lookin' backwards*\n\n*Might be the only way to move forward*\n\n*//*\n\n*And at last*\n\n*She knew what the agony had been for*",

So when she sings about being so in love, it seems like that was just her POV in her manic state of mind, not real true love, in her words. \n\nThe OP explained it well in another comment that the idea of fate and soulmates is very important to Taylor. So when the \u2018fate\u2019 and \u2018soulmate\u2019 aspect with Joe was dying, she in her heartbroken state clung to the man that was weaseling his way into her relationship, and he made her those promises of \u2018soulmate\u2019 \u2019marriage\u2019 \u2019family\u2019 so she decided it must be \u2018fate\u2019 all along in order to basically dull the pain of being in a 6 year relationship and having it not lead to marriage and children. Then when she retrospectively looks back, she realizes it wasn\u2019t love at all as she writes in the epilogue and that it was \u2018temporary insanity\u2019. \n\nThat\u2019s just my two cents.",

I think he was sincere and just got scared off again. The New Yorker interview and Taylor in TTPD the song point to that too.",

I think a lot of people are focusing on smallest man only and their negative associations with matty to paint him as the villain when in reality taylor doesn\u2019t even do that herself either. she includes so many other songs about how good their relationship was but ultimately got ruined by all the backlash and the fact that they were both on tour. I think people forget that matty and taylor were really good friends first so it makes sense that she still cares about him since they connected on an artistic level as well. people also keep saying that he ghosted her so he didn\u2019t actually care about her and just manipulated her but like he had to leave for tour out of  the country and wasn\u2019t going to be able to whether out the storm of backlash together. that coupled with the death threats his band mates and family was receiving at the time it makes sense why he would decide to end the relationship even if he did really love her, she says it too \u201cleave me better off.\u201d this situation is very nuanced and I do feel for taylor but I also feel for matty a lot since it\u2019s true he\u2019s been having a terrible year and he\u2019s been honest about that. it\u2019ll be good to see what music he puts out that can help us also see his pov",

People are interpreting it as Travis, but I think it\u2019s about Calvin Harris because the song is reflecting over the decade of their friendship. I believe the use of bones is a commentary on how thin she was due to her eating disorder. There\u2019s also a line that I feel connects to the \u201cKarma\u201d music video. She says, \u201cI changed into goddesses, villains, and fools\u2026\u201d which fits the imagery of her as the golden goddess statue (1989), demon in hades as the villain (reputation), and the fool Dorothy waving to the reapers (Lover).

I just have way too many personal stories of friends and just people I know who keep making this same mistake over and over. \n\nIt's an illusion that we need someone to make us whole. But as I see lots of people mention Taylor is all about soulmates and fate it explains why she gets so attached because she keeps trying to find The One but ends up with \"fool's gold.\"\n\nI think her main issue is FOMO. She is scared to reject a man or his advances out of fear she will miss out on her destined prince in shining armor. But believeing this is so dangerous and we see what happened with Matty (she really thought she can redeem him).\n\nIn psychology it's now popular to analyze Disney stories to find toxic patterns. I just loved Belle. This is a story about me. When you are so delusional that you believe that any monster can become a prince if only you love him enough.\n\nAnd I agree with you about rejection issues, also fear of being alone and facing her own demons without trying to reflect it off a man. Been there, done that \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nSame shows up with her fans. She reveals as much in Anti-hero about her struggles. She just can't imagine a life where she is a normal human being without every second someone saying: \"Taylor, we love you!\"\n\nI don't blame her, I just think she is coming to an age where maturity is inevitable if she wants to stay \"out of psych wards.\" (Fortnight MV is so telling)\n\nNot sure if she knows that real love is supposed to be drama free, even \"boring\" for someone coming off the toxic relationships high. And this idea of soulmates feels like a cheap marketing gimmic to me now because it's a commonly used tactic by professional narcs and manipulators in general.\n\nBut again, this is all learned in therapy and support groups. \ud83d\ude0a",

While on the surface it reads as just a song about a high school relationship, there\u2019s lots of lyrics suggesting it\u2019s political, including the following line to that lyric they said which is \u201c**voted** most likely to run away with you\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of others suggesting this like, \u201cAmerican glory faded before me [..] I saw the scoreboard, and ran for my life\u201d, \u201cmy team is losing, battered and bruising / I see the high fives between all the bad guys / Leave with my head hung, you are the only one who seems to care / American stories burning before me\u201d, etc. \n\nI wont write out all the lyrics of course, but I\u2019d say every line in the song when you view it this way feels about being judged by the political opposition and fighting against them with the person you love no matter the odds. Especially since this song is the title to the documentary she released at the time which was mainly about her decision to be open about her views, and the fact this release was after Trump\u2019s win.",
