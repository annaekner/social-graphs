            "text": "Last night I checked into a hostel. It was well reviewed, though comments mentioned it was self service, with no staff out of hours.\n\nI check in, and yep, no staff, which I was expecting. \n\nI\u2019m met with a man that is middle-aged and shirtless.  No problem here yet. I\u2019m new to solo travel, but not new to hostels. \n\nExcept this guy is obviously drunk, extremely intense, and very very off. I text my friends who advise me to leave, but I\u2019ve paid in full, so I stay. We\u2019re the only two in the room the first night.\n\nThe next day a girl checks in from Poland. Important to the story is I\u2019m a man. This older bloke spends all day in the room just sitting shirtless. Me and the woman chat a bit, but it\u2019s unnerving to have this silent bloke in the corner.\n\nCut to the night, and the polish lady has slept early as she\u2019s only just got in. The man comes over to me and shows me a badly Google translated note on his phone asking to talk downstairs, away from the woman. My alarm bells are ringing.\n\nWe go downstairs and he try\u2019s to explain he wanted me to have a better experience with the internet while I was working on my laptop. I asked him to cut the shit. He then admitted he wanted to be alone with the girl, and if I could stay downstairs for an hour. THIS GIRL IS UPSTAIRS ASLEEP. \n\nI go upstairs, pack my things, tell the girl what happened. The old bloke yells he isn\u2019t a bad guy and he has made a mistake.\n\nI\u2019ll be reporting this incident, but it\u2019s completely fried my brain and scared me for the rest of the trip. Please be vigilant.\n\n\n",

If you hadn't been there and it was just the two of them, I'd hate to even imagine what could have happened.\n\nThat guy is a creep - and we need to keep calling out men like this. It's not ok and is frankly disgusting. \n\nAdditionally thank you for sharing this story. Years ago I had a small stint where I worked in a hostel  for about a month in Poland. The agreement was I'd check people in to the hostel and I'd get to stay there for free in the dorms. I ended up sleeping in a bunk bed next to someone who I checked in, and then he ended up trying to rob me of my laptop the next morning. The police were involved, and a fight broke out in the hostel as he was trying to leave and not get caught. He escaped by jumping out a 3/4 story building. \n\nThat experience did a number on me, but it's the hardest experiences that make us grow as humans. Now you know how sketchy it can be to travel solo. \n\n  \nFinally I'll leave you with this, as another guy who has been traveling there are some incredible hostels out there with incredible people and while you may focus on the bad experiences, there are so many good ones out there. \n\nYou got this!",

A long-standing English resident got absolutely battered one night in a drinking competition, which he bigged himself up for... and got totally destroyed by the resident Russian. Four of us carried him upstairs; he was a big bloke, and slung him into his bottom bunk. \n\nAt 4 am, there was a massive commotion in the dorm room hallway; loads of people were standing around in their PJs. Confused and still absolutely slaughtered, the English guy had woken up and proceeded to piss into this poor woman\u2019s open locker on all of her possessions, all over the floor, and then once someone woke and frantically tried to redirect his aim, pissed out of the open window into the alley below. Unfortunately, the Russian and his girlfriend were enjoying an early morning smoke before bed outside in the alley. Needless to say, a golden shower was probably not what they bargained for, at least not with a drunk Englishman in an alley at 4 am. Furious, the Russian guy ran upstairs, and because he thought the golden shower was intentional, grabbed and threw the Englishman into the locker he\u2019d just been peeing in moments before. In the tussle, they both slipped in the guy's piss and hit the deck. The two blokes, covered in warm, ripe piss, then scuffled for a few minutes before it was broken up by staff. Both blokes were escorted to the showers while more staff tried to clean up the piss fest all over the room. \n\nAnyway, they kicked the English guy out, took away his deposit, and fined him for some of the woman\u2019s possessions, bedding, etc. The funniest thing was he moved to another hostel literally across the road and kept coming back to try and win over everyone\u2019s good graces so they\u2019d let him stay again.",

I ended up in a hostel that had a lobby and two connected dorms. That was the whole hostel. \n\nThere were only three of us staying there and one of the guys got VERY drunk - to the point where he couldn\u2019t speak. We each had our own bed luckily. I went to sleep early and awoke to him trying to get into my bed (I assume he was confused). I pushed him away and tried to fall back asleep. I woke up maybe 5 minutes later to the sound of liquid hitting the floor. I quickly realized it wasn\u2019t water. I turned to his bed and found him naked, dick out, pissing onto the floor. \n\nFortunately the manager put us in a new room and left him to sleep it off. Not an experience I\u2019ll ever forget!",

It was the sound of this person hitting the concrete. \n\nThere was a little boy riding a scooter on the street and the man who jumped, clipped him and knocked him over. The boy was screaming in terror. I didn't know what happened or how the man ended up there. I thought maybe the electric scooter exploded. It took me awhile to realize he came from the balcony above. I went to the man to try and do CPR but quickly realized that he was very much dead.\n\nThe police and ambulance came, but nobody could understand me, so I just left. I am pretty shaken up and do not know anyone here. I've messaged people from back home which is a comfort. I spent the day in bed watching movies.

Let your brain focus on it as it\u2019s a big thing to process, but try and enjoy some other things too.\n\nIf you feel you want to go home, and ur do better there and you truly want to go home for a couple of weeks to be with friends and family that is always okay to. You can come back to your holiday, and exploring the world! It\u2019s a big place, it isn\u2019t going any where soon!",

We just got out of the car from driving from her village to the city, Bergamo. Built on a mountain with an old upper and modern lower city. We were in the upper city, on top of the old city walls, with a view on the lower city, and Milan in the distance. I walked up to the wall, she said \"look at how high it is!\" I look down, and there they are. Someone jumped from the city wall just now. The police were starting to arrive. \n\nI went through with my trip and don't regret it. I regret not talking about it a little more, not giving myself enough space to be shocked. I don't regret going on, I regret not taking it into account and reacting to it more, not changing how I went on. I have visited her a few times since. She still feels bad and guilty about it years later.\n\nThere are many ways of processing, and everyone has different methods. How do you usually process heavy things? What do you need in such moments? Can you find these things while traveling? It's okay to cut your trip short, it's okay to change your trip to give you more space to process, it's okay to go through with your trip as planned. The best option is one where you can find ways to meet your needs. If your needs are social, can you get enough out of the possible contact with your loved ones from there? If you need alone time, can you isolate well enough? If you need distraction, you'll probably find it. If you need comfort, are there ways you can reach it? If you can meet your needs while staying on the trip, I think it'd be valuable to give it a chance. If not, go home to your loved ones and find support. However you choose to continue, try to not ignore what happened.",

I was told not to repress thoughts and to set aside some time each day to allow myself to think about what I'd witnessed. Luckily, I was headed home just a few days later (I was so relieved to be home) and already had a short vacation planned, which was also recommended by the counselor (oddly a person across the aisle on my vacation flight had a series of \"unexpected\" seizures so I was feeling a little toxic/cursed for a minute). I thought of that person who died often afterwards and still do, but I am so glad I was given information to begin to process my experience. No shame if you want to go home (or by finding something special/comforting to do if you can't), no shame in feeling upset about it, and it's ok to be sad or cry for people we've never met; definitely take time for yourself when you can to process this experience, whatever form that may be.",

For me, just being out and experiencing the culture again could be a bit of a trigger after my trauma because the language/culture gap was part of what made the traumatic event so much worse, so I recommend taking it very slow. The isolation of not knowing the language can make the immediate post-trauma all the more disorienting, so if you are able, try to find other English-speaking travelers or expats to connect with. \n\nA lot of people on this sub will urge you not to let this ruin your trip, press on, etc etc, because this is r/solotravel and you\u2019re more likely to find that vibe here. but I cannot stress this enough: do what is right for you.

You\u2019re understandably shaken up, but once the shock wears off you\u2019ll start to process the whole thing logically and eventually you\u2019ll move past it. A few years ago I witnessed a man take his own life in exactly the same way as what you just described. It was surreal - not just because I\u2019d watched a man die right in front of me - but also because of the sickening realisation that things like this happen the world over on a daily basis, and yet the earth just keeps on spinning and life goes on regardless. Be patient. Take some time to grieve and process the experience, then continue on your journey. The rest of the world will keep on moving and leave this whole incident behind. There\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t leave it behind either. \n\nGood luck.",

He barely missed a girl on a bike. \n\nGiven the trajectory and the place where he landed there was no way he fell. He either jumped or was pushed. I guessed he came from 12 to 14 floors up. \n\nThe crazy thing was he was alive. Both legs were broken and he had a pool of blood under his head but he was alive. I couldn't get through the gate so I ran around to the guard hut and told him what happened. We both ran back around to where the man was lying on the ground. I put my sweater under his head and talked to him a bit, then the paramedics showed up and took over. \n\nNo one seemed interested in talking to me so I just left, This was 16 years ago and I still think about him all the time.",

Whatever this has made you feel, and whatever it has made you think about life, is exactly where you are currently supposed to be.\nonly you can decide whether you should go home or continue your trip - if you feel you should go home, then go home. if you feel you should continue your trip, then continue your trip. if you are in two minds and can\u2019t decide, sit with it for more time until you feel that one way is more right for you than the other. \nbut the most important thing is not to ruminate and ask yourself \u2018why did this happen to me\u2019, but rather acknowledge that it did happen and embrace how it is making you feel with truth and maybe ask \u2018what new positive way can I look at the world after having had this (quite rare) experience?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe mystery of life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to experience; a process that cannot be understood by stopping it.

We have bad gallows humor so I would do things like listen to \u201cIt\u2019s Raining Men\u201d because for EMS providers it\u2019s laugh or cry and we can\u2019t choose cry. You are in a totally different position. First, know whatever it takes to process it (avoid drugs and alcohol like the plague especially for the first few weeks) is okay. \n\nI highly highly recommend talking to someone trained in processing trauma online till you decide what route to take. There\u2019s benefits to continuing your trip and going home. Continuing could trigger your subconscious to be okay with it via if we\u2019re continuing on. I\u2019m okay. However, a good support system is also important and if you feel by phone and internet isn\u2019t enough I would head home. Weight blankets are a great resource, funny movies, cry as much as you need to. When you choose to work on processing by going over what happened get comfortable. Comfortable clothes, blanket, bed, couch whatever that means and then talk it out with someone through every emotion and sense. What did you see, smell, hear, feel, etc? Because if you hit a trigger for the memory later this will help you identify it quickly and desensitize yourself to it by slow progressive exposure.\n\nMake sure you eat healthy, even if you don\u2019t feel like it and get adequate sleep if you have to squeeze a pillow to your chest or use familiar comforting scents near the nose to do so. I use lavender or spray my pillow with comforting body scents. Whatever you do don\u2019t bury it. Deal with it now. And I am super proud of you for trying to help that person. That is an action not many take. You did good by trying.",

Call family or people close to you and share your feelings with them. \nFinally depending on how long you will stay in Hong Kong, try to occupy yourself with other activities (sport, read,\u2026) while you wait to go back. I know it sounds tough and superficial, but sometimes for these sort of heart shaking issues where little help is available, I have made the experience it helps to just try to bury the feelings for a bit until you are in a safe space and you can then let go and get proper attention ! Hang in there ! You did everything you could to help. Don\u2019t feel guilty for it",

Luckily my body was sore from laying against a pillar and ended up finding a bench to move to, it ended up saving our lives. The bomb went off just one check in aisle away from us.\n\nI experienced a lot of survivors guilt. I saw the entire ceiling fall, so many families and bodies, it was horrifying. The people of Belgium really stepped up and opened up their arms and homes. I hold so much gratitude and deep love for them. This was only a month into our trip, we ended up having an incredible experience after, but the experience is something I am working through still today.\n\nI think what helped me work through a lot of it was honestly just being able to talk about it. I held it in for a few years because I didnt want to make people uncomfortable. Talking helped me process it outside of my own body and head.",

Unfortunately the nature of the universe is that this is frequently an unsolvable puzzle, so your brain spends its wheels and ends up strengthening the neutral pathways of the memory to a degree that causes problems. By giving your brain a puzzle to solve the need to solve something is taken care of and the memory doesn't get written so indelibly.\n\nI would suggest that if you're experiencing symptoms of PTSD playing a puzzle game could help give your brain something to solve while it's spinning the wheels, even if it was years after the incident. Very little downside to trying, either way. \n\nI'm not a brain scientist, that's just my layman's understanding",

For example, if you have no support or crappy support, and navigate the experience with no tools or distractions, and keep reliving the memory, you will have a rougher go with PTSD. Same goes if people invalidate your experience, or if you're exposed to anything but a safe, supportive environment. \n\nOp, it sounds like you're doing the right things by reaching out for support and taking care of yourself with rest and movies.

            "text": "I'm a 24M, I've spent the last five years entirely focused on building my career. I\u2019ve made solid progress, but along the way, I realized I was feeling lonely and unfulfilled. No meaningful relationships, no adventures, no new experiences. Just work.\n\nThen, in a moment of clarity, I did something impulsive. I booked a trip to Italy, planned the whole thing in one night, and stopped making excuses. Time was slipping by, and while saving money and focusing on my career got me far, I wasn't going to get my 20s back. I couldn't stand the idea of not feeling alive. The world is too amazing to just hide at home.\n\nSo, I got on that flight with almost no expectations, ready to explore Rome and try solo travel. Little did I know, this trip would completely change how I see the world.\n\nAt the hostel, I quickly met some incredible people. Soon, I found myself canceling my pre-planned activities to hang out with them, and it was the best decision ever. I learned that good people can turn even a simple trip into something unforgettable. I'm so glad I approached them. I'm usually too self-conscious and wait for others to approach me, which is not the best strategy...\n\nOne of the best parts of traveling alone was the chance to reinvent myself. Nobody knew my past or my habits, which gave me the freedom to be a better version of myself. Being away from home let me finally grow into the person I wanted to be.\n\nI saw this girl in the common room and felt drawn to her but didn't think much of it. Later, we accidentally bumped into each other while going out for a drink, and she bought me one. We spent the whole evening together and even exchanged necklaces before returning to our rooms. The next day, we had a magical date, like a scene from Before Sunrise, and parted ways as she returned to her country. That connection made the trip unforgettable and made me think about how meaningful it is to share moments with someone. It made me think about how important it is for me to find my wife and build a life with her.\n\nI realized I'd burned out trying to be hyper-focused on success, thinking I was smarter than my peers. But we all need real experiences and connections to feel alive. This trip woke me up. I used to make excuses, like \u201ctravel is overrated\u201d or \"I'll enjoy it later,\" but there's no perfect moment.\n\nNow, I'm planning a 3-6 month trip to Asia. With no major responsibilities and a flexible schedule, I have little to lose and so much to gain. I want to feel alive again, and I'm tired of playing it safe, thinking I can just save it all for \"later.\"\n\nTraveling has made me more social and opened my eyes to how big the world truly is. I can choose where to live and what kind of life to build. The perfectionist in me still wants to hold back, but that's not living. Life happens while we're busy planning for a perfect future.\n\nI used to fear challenges and discomfort. Now, my biggest fear is living a safe, easy life in my hometown. It's crazy how one trip can change your perspective so much.\n\nIf you're thinking about going on a trip, but aren't quite sure, just go for it. This is your sign. If you can't, do everything you can to find a way to do it. Remember, on your deathbed you'll mostly regret the things you didn't do.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nAfter years of prioritizing my career, I took a spontaneous trip to Italy and discovered I'd been missing out on truly living. I made new friends, met someone special, and gained a fresh perspective on life. Success and money mean little if you don\u2019t experience the world and create memories. If you\u2019re hesitant to travel, just go for it. You won\u2019t regret it. You\u2019ll return home a better person.",

It was at that time that I decided to make the time in my busy volleyball schedule and just give solo traveling a try.\n\nI planned a 2 week trip to \u0130stanbul for April 2023. About 5 days before my scheduled trip, my AirBnB host informed me they had COVID and I needed to find a new AirBnB ASAP, which I was able to do.\n\nLong story short, I am now happily married to my AirBnB host and live half the year in \u0130stanbul!\n\nIt is funny how much life can change on a dime!\n\nMy advice ... find the time to travel and enjoy what the world has to offer. \n\nYou never know!",

You may not always pack and carry the perfect kit for ever occasion, but you can pretty much always figure something out, cleverly adapt, or bring forth enough good cheer to deal with things as they are.   \n&nbsp;\n\n- Discovering that failure is sometimes a marvellous outcome.   \n&nbsp;\n\n- The joy of living simply, efficiently.",

Is the one that if want to have a decent living wage has less time to spent in serach of a woman and in the same time dating became something really hard to achieve and really hard to progress.

This opinion doesn\u2019t usually come from anyone who is well travelled so it\u2019s best not to care about their opinion while they sit there with no passport. Much like other questionable preconceived notions, usually they are had by people we are better off not interacting with. It\u2019s a great red flag indicator if a man thinks this way. Those judging women for being a solo female traveler are clearly too close minded to date one of us and should keep it pushing and leave us alone \ud83d\ude0a",

I've been to Toronto from the US over 30 times and a man in my convo group there recently asked me if I was staying with family, who I was traveling with, etc. I never revealed my hotel or other info to him. While having the great love affair is the theme of most travel movies, it isn't practical for a woman traveling alone, in my opinion. I am very cautious, and don't look to hook up with anyone either. It's just safer that way, for a woman. A few years ago I returned to my hotel to see dozens of men in the lobby. I never made eye contact with anyone and immediately went to my room alone. Sometimes I wear a wedding ring, other times I tell people that I'm meeting someone. You don't want to miss out on life-changing positive experiences from traveling. Back in the '80s my mom's friends gave her the business for letting me go to Mexico alone. She relaxed when she realized that my host family was picking me up at the airport. So many wonderful experiences happened with that family over two weeks. Both she and my dad eventually also went on trips with me during their lifetimes. Travel is wonderful!

That is only one example of the amazing week I spent there and engaging with people left me with many wonderful memories of that country. Some exchanges were with people from other countries too. On another trip, a fruit seller in Paris walked up to me one early morning, said good morning, here's a present for you, and then went on about his day. The present? It was an enormous quince! He had no alterior motive other than to spread his good mood. BTW, I'm a woman of a certain age. I think he approached me because I must have been giving off good vibes too.",

I love sex, I think about it all the time related to my own personal time, and I definitely think people should enjoy it when they want, but hearing about it all the time/making everything about sex is incredibly exhausting and annoying. It\u2019s hard to enjoy anything without it for a lot of people.\n\nHate the \u201cyou\u2019re only young once\u201d thing too. So irritating, tired, and worn out. Young people often don\u2019t even have the best sex, nor is having fun of any kind exclusively for young people. Nobody needs to have a bunch of their sex when they\u2019re young just because they\u2019re young, if they don\u2019t want that pressure. Can have just as much sex when you\u2019re older too. In fact, a lot of people I know who are older have had great solo trip sex and have better sex now anyway. I have had more fun of the \u201cyou\u2019re only young once\u201d brand as an older person than I ever did as a young idiot.\n\nAlso, people are sexual creatures, they know that can have sex without people telling them to. I\u2019ve never had more sex because people told me I should- lmao. I\u2019ve genuinely never thought to tell someone they should have sex on a vacation as if I were recommending a particular food. Wild that people do that. I can see someone recommending a red light district or a sex show because it\u2019s a novel activity, but not just urging people to have sex.\n\nMaybe in general people in an oversexed world are just sick of hearing about it. Or maybe they have trauma related to it and it\u2019s a sensitive topic. Some people don\u2019t want to talk about sex any more than they do politics or religion. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a movement toward younger gen and traditionalism. Just let people find their way. This post was brought up for a reason- a lot of people genuinely don\u2019t give a shit about random sex. Some do. Either way, unsolicited sex advice isn\u2019t appropriate.",

They froze and looked at me in fear. They stopped screaming and moved back to their rooms.\n\nI told the front desk the next morning and didn't really get much help. \n\nWe had signs in every hostel mentioning quiet times.\n\nMake sure to leave online reviews.

This thought was daunting, but I felt I needed to do this. Initially, I chickened out and bought a drink from a supermarket to have in my hotel room. When I got back and drank half of the bottle while playing music, I realized how lame that was. Why not have the experience I wanted at a bar in freaking Japan?\n\nSummoning all my courage, I took a shower, dressed up myself and walked outside. I walked around in Osaka, saw several bars on Google maps, but did not have the courage to walk in. I decided to head back to my hotel. But then I decided to just walk into a bar. I checked out the bar and decided the vibe wasn't right. I checked out another bar a few streets down the line (on a fifth floor/speakeasy vibe) and it was empty. There was another group of people but they were in a separate room hence we didn't have interaction. I decided to go in.\n\nI just wanted to say that this was excellent exposure therapy. I sat at the bar counter by myself. I was just being myself, played a bit on my phone / responded to some messages, chatted with the bartender who was very friendly with broken English, and enjoyed some jazz music and amazing cocktail. I had a great time and it was a relaxing and enjoyable experience. I am also very proud of myself.\n\nI am going to do this again tomorrow, but I will try to find a bar with more people so I can strike up conversations with strangers next to me",

Sometimes I just met people at random,  especially other solo travellers - and in some countries people are very friendly in restaurants or bars. Or eat / drink alone, who cares. Cafes are particularly nice alone with a book.\n\nKeep building up that confidence as it's a great life skill.",

But I went back then and it was great! Talked with a lot of people. One of the people there was some lady, about my age (I was around and I am female), and we got on well. She said she had the next day off and invited to show me around the town. It was great! She had a car and took me to a lot of out-of-the-way places. Terrific time.",

I really enjoyed going to these bars on a friday evening to unwind.\n\nI was in Vietnam earlier this summer and tried out a few bars. I found one that had a cover band on Fridays and was pretty chilled and I quite liked going there. I tried another one that was almost like a nightclub vibe which was wholly unsuitable for going for a drink on my own. When a friend of mine was in town for a couple of days we went there for a night out and it was great fun but really not suitable for what I like when I'm going for a drink on my own. \n\nWhenever I go somewhere I always google articles about the best bars in the city so I can pick a place to go for a nice drink at the end of the  week. A lot of these articles are geared towards a very different market - cocktail bars, rooftop lounges, nightclubs - so I usually have to read through a few of the articles to find ones that sound like my kind of place",

Etc etc.\n\nTraveling is a big broad world and the travel subs are a very small slice of it.

If you dont learn the language, only a few phrases, learn quickly filler words and like interjections.. also mimmic their accent, even if you speak in English. \n\n3. Pursue sports, games and dances, preferably local, but a lot will translate to any language. You dont need the same language to do stuff together. \nNothing beats a game of Scopa in Italy, Salsa in Spain, a game of chess against an old fella in a Hungarian termal spa or playing volley on vulcanic beach sand. \n\nMost european countries will also have their own folkdance.

Often people (wait staff, other people in the restaurant) would strike up a conversation with you.  Many people ate alone in the same restaurants.  \nThe Millennial generation is much more judgemental about everything and sees a person being alone as being an outcast.  Eating in a restaurant as a whole to that generation is supposed to be a social event with loud conversation and 'look at me' vibes.  So it became less socially normal to eat alone.\nI think the Gen Z (being children on Gen X) are more secure being independent.",

It's not just about the good moments, there are good moments and bad ones too, and it can be important for people to have a place to talk about those weirder/crappier moments that the glamorous influencers don't acknowledge in their carefully staged photoshoots. I think it's also part of why Anthony Bourdain's travel shows have mostly aged well too - he was sincere and honest, it wasn't just a constant fake stream of acting like everything was 100% amazing all the time.",

However I still had a great time. It was probably the most I walked and I packed so much in the 2-3 days I was there. Explored some museums/buildings went to great vantage points had great food etc \n\nIt\u2019s funny cause if u asked me before which experience I would\u2019ve had at each spot I would\u2019ve guessed that I was gonna be way more social at Barcelona than Valencia but it\u2019s just the way things worked out.

Even though we are into totally different things, we also have a lot we like to do together.  But for us \"together\" is...splitting up and enjoying it on our own lol \n\nAnd yeah, you are right about my friends... I have my doubts they'll make it. I mean, I said big trip its not like an international trip, but this one feels big to me still =)  Going to Bonnaroo music festival..it will be my first music festival, and I just got my RV, so planning to camp there and very excited!  But Im planning to be there the full time, Tues - Mon, and I just have my doubts they'll be able to take off work that long.  \n\nWe'll see, but I def wont be sad about it to go solo... \ud83d\ude01",

If they have no decency and don\u2019t care that others are in the room with them where it is public then live feed that shit.   Then go ahead tell the front desk and leave an awful review.  If two others want to scare me might as well meet at their level. \n Good luck everyone out there.",

Turn on the lights and say loudly, I guess they like it when people watch them having sex. Or B. Get out of bed and start recording them having sex blatantly from multiple angles while saying out loud, this is going to make a great porno! \n\nThese inconsiderate asshats are counting on others ignoring them and saying nothing. \n\nAnother example is if you're in a small space like an airplane or a bus and someone is listening to music too loudly, start singing along while looking them dead in the eyes. They'll turn that shit down. Or another example, if they're on speaker phone, start engaging in the conversation. It's clearly for everyone right!

So his fault and everyone was pleased to see him go.\n\nI am a male and was once put into a female dorm room. I was the first one there. Then it filled up quickly with females. It was a large 12 bedder room. I realised the person at reception put me in a female room. But I was now stuck there as the hostel was booked out. So the females in the room did\u2019t care at all.

The girl got confronted and denied everything, but she got a strict message from the receptionist that she had to pack her stuff and leave the hostel immediately. It was 4 in the night..

            "text": "So let me say that I\u2019m African American and I was scared to go there based on what I heard about racism in Poland. I still decided to go there for a full week and\u2026. Wow wow wow, must say that Krakow is now officially my favorite city in Europe.\n\nAppearance: The city is absolutely beautiful, apparently the government is very strict and requires business owners to clean up the outside of their business, so unlike most of Europe you don\u2019t see a ton of trash in front of restaurants. It was literally spotless!\n\nPeople: From the moment I arrived the people were extremely friendly. Even though I was told that people would be mean since the winter is so harsh, everyone that I encountered smiled and was nice. Cars will even stop in the middle of a green light to let me and other pedestrians cross. Honestly the sweetest people that I\u2019ve encountered Europe.\n\nFood: Everything was absolutely delicious, all of the food is in huge portions the dumplings are very delicious, I\u2019m not a fan of P\u00e2t\u00e9 but for some reason the P\u00e2t\u00e9 in Krakow was like crack lol it was absolutely delicious and usually came with every meal at most restaurants. In addition to the food being delicious everything is very affordable.\n\nPlaces to see:\nWawel Castle- One of the most beautiful museums/castles that I have ever been to. It\u2019s huge in two hours I was only able to see two exhibits because the castle is so huge. I really like the state rooms and the treasures. \n\nThe Leaky Cauldron- A Harry Potter themed restaurant, the food is mainly sweets that are VERY sweet. I had the marshmallow pancakes and a white hot chocolate drink, boat very sweet but delicious and in total everything combined was less than $10 USD\n\nSalt Mines- The salt mines was an excellent experience a lot of people suggested it to me and it was worth it. Underground but very cold though. I\u2019d suggest a Viator guide. The guides mainly just provide transportation though.\n\nAuschwitz-Birkenau- Obviously very sad but it was a beautiful tribute to the victims from the holocaust. I balled my eyes out when we went to the gas chambers. Very horrible part of history but great to see to the travesty of humanity.\n\nDiversity- As I mentioned before I arrived people (who had never been to Poland) told me about how racist it was and I was expecting that. Furthest from the truth, looked for a barbershop before I arrived and immediately found an African owned barbershop near the Jewish district. I honestly didn\u2019t see many black people in Poland but no one stared at me (even the polish say that polish stare at people, but I didn\u2019t experience that) kids didn\u2019t stare at me I actually get more states being black from kids in Latin America than I did in Poland. I didn\u2019t get any mistreatment. I felt bad for believing the hype before I went about how racist the people are considering how nice everyone was.\n\nOverall if you want to go to beautiful city in Europe with cheap prices and delicious food I\u2019d highly suggest Krakow especially to my fellow African Americans.",

For a lot of people in Reddit this was a surprise, but not for me. \n\nSee, what people in Europe don't like is poor immigrants. And poor black immigrants don't come to Poland. I know a lot of black people in Poland, and they are all highly educated, sought-after workers who speak perfect Polish, because the way they have come is as students, and when they finished their studies they stayed. Poland doesn't get the illegal immigrants Mediterranean countries get, so there is no stereotype of black person = unskilled poor immigrant. Black people in Poland are engineers, economists, physicians, doctors in physics...  People are much more bigoted against Ukrainians, per example.",

I still decided to go there for a full week and\u2026. Wow wow wow, must say that Krakow is now officially my favorite city in Europe.\n\nYou went to one of the most, if not THE most touristy city in Poland, and kept to the obvious tourist places and routes.\n\nBut regardless. When we say that poles are racist, we don't mean that you will be constantly pointed out on the streets, or rounded up, and beaten up. Most of the time it's not the case, unless you're unlucky and run into some hooligans looking to pick up a fight.\n\nWhat we mean is that many people here, especially 30+, have no real experience ever meeting any PoC people, and tend to hold racist views on them, without often even knowing. When talking at work, they'll throw jokes like \"I'm not racist, I have a color TV\", and nobody will say a thing about that, people will laugh, or let it slide. They will repeat that black people in US are criminals, and that's why we don't have such crime here, because we're not that diverse nation. etc etc. That mild/ignorance based racist views. If you're a person doing any manual labor they'll think it's obviously because you are uneducated, and will look down on you. If you hold any \"higher level\" position they'll think it's because company had to fill a quota.\n\nViews like that aren't obviously limited to PoC people. The same is if, for example, you're a romani - people will call you a gypsy, without realizing it's offensive, and will be thinking about jokes about eating debries or something. Same about ukrainians, who many still see as uneducated, jews etc, etc. \n\nThis is especially true in non touristy cities, or cities where there are no big universities, that tend to attract more young, more \"socially conscious\" people.\n\nNow, a lot of that is something you will not feel as a tourist. If you're at a restaurant you will not know what the server thinks about you, or other customers. You're a paying customer, so they will be nice to you, will smile and nod etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>no one stared at me (even the polish say that polish stare at people, but I didn\u2019t experience that)\n\nAs for stares. I'm surprised whenever anyone says they expected that in Poland. From my experience living here for all my life, poles tend to never hold eye contact, and avoid ever showing it, or staring. We used to literally hit kids for staring, and \"what you're staring at\" used to be the first line to start a fight with someone. We instead tend to keep our faces neutral, look \"into nothing\", or keep our noses down, to not attract any attention, and not give attention to others. Maybe it's been changing with the younger generations now, but us 30+ defo were like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Cars will even stop in the middle of a green light to let me and other pedestrians cross.\n\nThat doesn't really have anything to do with people being nice, it's literally our driving law, that has recently been made even more pedestrian friendly. Pedestrians in Poland currently have right of way even before entering the pedestrian crossing. Cars are required to stop if anyone is even approaching the crossing. And many drivers here do, because the potential fines for getting cought by random cop walking by are more annoying that stopping and letting someone go.  At least in Cracow. Although traffic in Cracow is mostly one massive traffic jam anyway.",

Since there are not that many black people here, kids can be mean sometimes, because kids often don't like when someone is different, and it's not just about race, but I believe even these attitudes are changing. I am in particular proud about our history and that Poland was once of the most tolerant countries in the world, and even when they tried to make our soldiers fight against the black community in the past, they deserted and helped to set up the first independent black country of Haiti.

The number of tourists is higher every year so I'm not really sure from where you got info we have hardly any tourists.\n\nKrak\u00f3w is destination for Brits to come to party just before wedding. This is also destination for Poles to go as it's former capital so kids \"should\" see the dragon and castle. \n\nI have checked and just during vacations in 2022 we had 350k tourists in a city that has 800k people if I'm not mistaken.\n\nBefore covid even at 1 AM it could be so crowdy near main square that it was difficult to cross the street.\n\nThere were times when even I couldn't order a drink at bar because it was so crowdy. The was comment that people were feeling discriminated because if it. No it's just the way it is. In some restaurants I guess due to high inflation you have 2 waiters inrtead of 3 like it was before covid. They don't come anymore to ask 'everything is good etc'. This is my feeling as white polish guy that visited USA and can feel difference. \n\nFrom one aspect it's good that we have tourists because of money that is left in the city from other traffic jams are huge, public transport can be a mess and restaurants are crowdy.\n\nThat is my 2c on the topic.",

They have extremely strict policies when it comes to who is allowed to immigrate there. Someone from their parliament has said as much. It also helps they only have sea to their north. \n\nCompare that to the likes of Italy, Malta and Greece who receive tens of thousands of illegal immigrants every year. You can't spend a day in Rome without a scam being tried on you by someone who is Northern African. There are only so many times you can experience that before it starts to rub off on you and you treat everyone who has a similar skin tone badly. It's not right but I can understand it.\n\nI don't know if you've been on this sub much but I've read countless stories over the years where a black American isn't treated very well until they open their mouth. I'm generalising but in Europe, that's because you're American, that's it, being black is as relevant as the colour of your shoes. There are assholes everywhere and some countries are 100% worse than others but I still think it's true to say.\n\nAgain generalising but racism doesn't usually describe what happens in most of Europe, it's usually way more complicated than that and Americans largely struggle to understand it. The closest word is probably xenophobia but even that isn't correct as it's more 'hatred' of destructive culture rather than any culture but their own. See for example Romani people. Americans on Reddit will screech all day that Europeans are racist for hating them. A large percentage of Europeans do indeed hate them but it is not because of their race, its because of their culture.\n\nSo yea, it's complicated.",

There are huge issues with women's rights and the safety of lgbtq people. There are lots of people, especially older ones, who are deeply racist and right-wing and justify it with nationalistic pathos or super old-fashioned Catholicism. They are super prejudiced against people that look different, which makes the lives of polish people that are POC hard.

No whispering, no attempting to use torches, no prepping the night before and no thought for anyone else at all. \n\nWhen i pointed out that other people were trying to sleep, they pointed out that they had to leave in a tone that said i was the one being unreasonable :/\n\nI don't understand some peoples level of self absorption.

All of the types listed tend to make themselves incredibly obvious, so it should be easy enough to immediately recognize them and regard them them as background noise; an obstacle to be avoided while on your own journey. When you filter out the noise, you're left with just the locals and the other travellers that aren't trying to make a spectacle of themselves. \n\nIf you can position yourself to attract *those* people, you'll have some of the most meaningful interactions of your life. Sure, you'll still get accosted from time to time by some random, overly excited person asking you to hold their camera while they do some weird Instagram shit. But if you look like you're cool and calm, then cool and calm people will generally just gravitate to you. \n\nIn the end, you've always got an escape mechanism if some obvious social-media junkie tries to bother you: just pretend you don't speak their language. \"I do not English\" works every time.",

Outside of a few well-known hotspots, most of the foreigners you meet in a given town are either expats or legit immigrants.  And I say this as someone who's gone out of their way to visit many places that nomads allegedly frequent.  Even in \"super hotspots\" like Chiang Mai or Buenos Aires, the number of people I've met who are committed to working remotely and traveling year-round is vanishingly small.  Even among the people who are traveling while working remotely, many of them are just doing it for a like a couple months and then going home.\n\nI'm not saying that tourism doesn't affect a town's economy.  And I'm not saying that foreigners going to another country and setting up shop doesn't affect the economy.  What I'm saying is the \"digital nomad\" lifestyle, while it has kind of a large cultural footprint, is actually not practiced by all that many people.  Certainly not enough to swing a whole economy in any city.\n\nI've seen AirBNB distort the rental market in cities that attract almost no digital nomads \u2014\u00a0basically every city in the US is like this.  Most cities are gentrifying anyway, and this has little to do with \"digital nomads.\"  And any town that already has a tourist industry is seeing their economy distorted by cheap airfares and other technologies that make travel easier (smart phones, google translate, google maps, credit cards).  But that's just from plain old-fashioned ordinary tourism.\n\nMy theory is the idea of a \"digital nomad\" took hold in the collective unconscious during COVID and while the crypto bubble was still in full gear.  But I didn't get into it until after that whole party was over, so it's possible that I missed the peak of the thing.  But from my own experience, rumors about the popularity of my lifestyle have been greatly exaggerated.",

When companies send workers abroad on business trips, they usually get them some kind of business visa - because the person is working, even if the company paying them might not be in that country. A tourist visa is technically \"for tourism\" ie theoretically you shouldn't be doing any work for any company even one in a different country. Depending on country's tax laws and treaties, any income you make while living somewhere might be technically taxable. But, of course, there are plenty of people who might briefly check their work email while on vacation without thinking about it, and I doubt they would get dinged by immigration for that. But digital nomads are doing a bit more than random email checks and again, depending on a country's tax laws a person living and using a country's infrastructure and services might - technically - owe that country tax on their income even if it was made abroad.",

Heck I was in Starbucks this morning and was the only white person in the restaurant.\n\nLove it.   I get to see things I would not see in a tourist area.\n\nYesterday for example all the school aged kids were wearing scouting outfits.   I am talking kids in high school are all wearing either a cub scout outfit or a girl scout outfit.\n\nI so wanted to take a photo but considering they were kids just did not think that was appropriate.\n\nThere were a group of about 20 all chatting after school in the subway station next to my condo and would have been a perfect photo.   This group all looked high school age.\n\nI am so curious how this happened.  How did US scouting spread to Thailand?\n\nAlso, I have always thought of scouting as being a pretty Christian thing.

We all trooped off together, stopped at the local bottle shop for beer and wine, and spent a hilariously entertaining evening out on the river learning some dance steps from some of the Egyptians who were staying there.  Other memories include my driver hired for a week taking me out for Turkish coffee with some of his elderly cronies and hearing their life stories.",

Over time I reduced the visits to museums and historical buildings, and I spend most of the time just wandering around, go to markets, sit in a bar/caf\u00e9, or even queue in a post office to buy stamps, but I still find this very touristic because there is the sightseeing part, even if of people. Go somewhere and experience something local, like a pint in an old (?) pub in London, is still something every tourist does, so it is still tourist stuff, even if you don't need a ticket for it. For me what is important when I travel is enjoy my time, I don't care if doing tourist stuff or not (but I'm a tourist, so the stuff I do is still tourist stuff after all).",

I stay on Don Khon, which is much quieter - very sleepy, in fact.\n\nFor me, Don Khon is the best of both worlds because you can walk or bike across the small bridge to Don Det if you do feel like socialising but, again, the most I've ever found is probably 200 tourists in those circumstances. Been a fair while since I was last there, though. Before covid.\n\nI also like to stop at a little town called Champasak on the way. I'm often the only westerner there and the locals are super friendly. Also means you can get up early and visit Wat Phu Champasak (allegedly the template for Angkor Wat) before tour buses start arriving from Pakse at around 1030. Have never seen another tourist there when I do that. Champasak has my heart due to incredible experiences I've had with locals who see few tourists in the actual town - have even been invited into homes for family gatherings. Special.",

She was kind, bright, patient, and always smiled and unlike anyone I have met since, that smile was what caught my eyes and she said I looked like a scared puppy which is what caught her attention. Before we parted ways she asked me to look her in the eyes and to remember that moment forever, she would do the same. The last thing I remember is a tear forming in her left eye and a crooked smile. \n\nLife has a way to give to you and quickly take it away but those experiences are what shapes us.

It wasnt a ONS and I wasnt the one traveling, it was him. 10+ yrs ago I used to live in a tropical island on the Caribbean and we had tourists hang out where the locals hang *all the time*. I remember it was the end of summer and college was to start the following Monday so it was the last weekend we had to hang out freely. I remember it was such a boring night. Me and my bff at the time where at this bar we used to frequent  and on this particular night it was super empty which wasnt the norm. We even had time to chat with the bartenders for a bit. Anyways, there was a bachelorette party of sorts next to us (we were at the bar) and they were bar crawling and had ordered a bottle of champagne and had left it empty along with an ice bucket next to me. This was a MardiGrass themed bar so they had bead necklaces all around. I was so bored that I started mindlessly picking up the stranded beads next to me on the bar top and tossed them into the ice bucket. All of a sudden out of the corner of my eye I see someone reach into the bucket and toss the beads next to me again. I thought it was someone drunk being annoying so I just grabbed them without looking and tossed them back in. Well this guy suddenly said (with the sexiest accent) \u201cI like your flower\u201d (I had a flower hairclip) and when I looked to see who said this, Im met with piercieng light blue eyes and blond hair with a model like face (clearly a tourist. Us locals usually have tans and darker eyes/hair) I said thanks and started chatting with him. I was star-struck because this guy looked straight out of a magazine.\n\nWe made out, talked & danced all night. My friend got to do the same with his buddy. They were Australian Marines and were staying at our port. We ended up making out under the rain (straight out of a romcom) lol We were supposed to meet that Sunday but a storm was \u201ccoming\u201d (it never did! \ud83d\ude21) and they had to leave so we never got to meet again. We did exchange FB and phone numbers/Skype and he reached out for my bday at one time as well but lost contact over time and he ended up deleting his fb. I haven\u2019t heard from him since. To this day I still wonder how he\u2019s doing.",

I was passing through and ask if we can meet up she said yes. I was so surprised. I went over to her mom's small old 2 bedroom trailer house around 10:30pm and just talking on the couch. Then we cuddle for a little then she got up and put her hand out and I grab her hand. She lead me to her small room and we made love. She told me to hurry up as her mom was going to be home soon before midnight.  So I did and cummed inside her. It was a lot about 2 weeks worth of cum. She was mad and thought I was going to pull out. Then she got up and got dress, so did I and both of us was going to the door. I turn around to see her one last time and she look sad. I gave her a hug and said are you ok. She was about to cry and said what will i do if I got pregnant. My mom will kick me out. I said every will be ok. Then I kiss her 1 last time as we hug for the final minute.  Then I open the door and left and never looked back.  I got in my truck and left. I only knew her for about an 1 hour and a half or less. The next day I went back to the app and she deleted her account. I was so sad as I didn't know what will happen.  Years later in 2020. I found her on Facebook and see her pics. She looks more beautiful and has a 2 year old daughter. I wonder if her daughter is mine as the age and the birth would be the time when I saw her. Now 2024 I still look at her profile and see her daughter growing up and wondering she is probably my daughter as she doesn't have any pics of any husband or guy. Just her and her daughter.  I decided to leave it be and move on but still seeing how our daughter grows up.",

                    "body": "THIS! i legit thought I was the only person who experienced a \u201csolo fling\u201d if even that? This past summer, I went to Cape Cod/Hyannis, Massachusetts by myself. Mind you, this was my very first time traveling alone; technically it was my 2nd time traveling in my entire life. I\u2019m 28 years old and it was my freaking 2nd time traveling \ud83d\ude2d anyways, on my last night in town I decided to go out to some bar and have a couple drinks. I didn\u2019t talk to anyone the entire time, just kept ordering drinks. As i was leaving, this really hot dude approached me and it turns out he was sitting next to his friend who was sitting right next to me. Funny thing was, i thought he was super cute but i didnt bother approaching him because i didnt have the balls to. \ud83e\udd23Back to when i was about to leave, he was trying to make conversation with me and asked me about my drink and if i was leaving. I told him, yes, but i was gonna go to a different bar. I told him where i was going and if he and his friend wanted to follow, he was more than welcome to. So they did. We ended up hanging out all night at the bar. We had fun, played pool and flirted. It got late and The bar was closing. We didnt really want to stop hanging out, so he decided to drive us to the beach and we sat in the lifeguard\u2019s tower and just hung out there. We kissed/made out and had some conversations about ourselves. We ended up back to my hotel and had sex. I didnt want him to leave but he had to because apparently he had to go to work the \u201cnext\u201d day. Looking back, im not sure if it was true or he just wanted out? He asked me for my number and promised to call me the next day before i leave for my trip back home. He never contacted me, unfortunately. Oh, and not to mention, he was also traveling, but he is from there. He is currently living in Florida. There\u2019s more to this story but basically, it sucks because i cannot remember his or his friend\u2019s names for the life of me. I didnt think to ask for his number, either. So ive literally spent an entire evening with this dude and it was hands down one of the best nights ive ever had in my 28 years of being alive, and that was it. Never saw him again. I don\u2019t know why but it kind of stings and why am I still thinking about him? Even though we barley knew each other and didnt spend enough time to form feelings for each other?! Wild. Now that i\u2019m back to reality and i\u2019m like blah. And the crazy thing was, it felt like i was in a movie too \ud83d\ude2d",

That is, people asking for advice without taking any time to provide specific info about their budget, itinerary, or specific travel interests. \n\nAs frustrating as it is to have posts removed, I suspect it would be more frustrating for everyone to have to read the literally dozens of daily \u201cwhat is there to do in Paris\u201d posts with no further info provided on the person\u2019s interests. What makes it through is the tip of the iceberg and most of that iceberg is the same repetitive vague questions many times a day.\n\nA lot of posts related to hooking up when traveling get removed under our \u201cno sex tourism\u201d rule but this one felt like it wasn\u2019t really about sex tourism. \n\nAnyway, constructive feedback is welcome. Try to be nice though, we\u2019re a volunteer team, and  as much as people complain about types of posts they don\u2019t like, those posts are often a pretty small fraction of the top feed in the subreddit for the day.",

Over the rest of the week we coordinated with eachother by leaving notes under eachother's hotel doors with instructions where we'd be in the evening and how to find eachother. This was in 2010 and using your cell phone in another country cost a fortune, so texting and social media were not a thing unless you were paying $2/minute for internet on the janky ass resort computer. We had to communicate like overseas lovers, only to rendezvous at night and fall in love all over again. It felt like floating on a cloud.. if I could bottle the butterflies I felt that week, I would keep them forever. \n\nSarah and I actually ended up reconnecting when we got home and we dated long distance for a short time.

I grew up extremely poor so that was weird for me. She invited me to prom so I bought a bus ticket from my home town which was about 2 hours away. This was my first time ever leaving my town alone other than Cuba. I had to navigate multiple bus systems and get to her house on my own. I remember it like it was yesterday. 20+ degrees in Toronto, sometime in June. Beautiful weather. I was high on confidence and tasting what felt like my first real brush with independence. \n\nAfter we got settled at her house and I met her father, we went to the prom pre-dinner together. I learned that rich people love having events before other events. We had the pre dinner, the dinner, the pre party and the party. Crazy. Everyone looked immaculate with their hair, makeup, dresses and suits. I had a shaved head because I couldnt afford a haircut, and a $100 suit rental. I felt like I blended in at the time, but in hindsight I probably stood out like a sore thumb lol But I rocked with it. We took a boujee ass party limo everywhere we went that night. We danced, laughed, had a great time. After dinner I was told some \"frat guys\" were hosting the after party. Let me tell you - frat sums it up appropriately. It was just like the movies. A strip of frat houses near the University of Toronto campus, with multiple parties happening at the same time. People would just wander up and down the street, in and out of these party houses. Each one had a DJ in the basement, a DJ on the main floor and private rooms upstairs that seemed to have revolving doors. I really wish I could give you more details from that point but things started to get a little blurry. There was crowd surfing and a live band at one point though??  One thing I do remember... is Sarah, a very sweet, soft spoken woman, was all of a sudden a horned up crazy person when we left home. We had sex in 3 different public parks that night on the walk home. We stumbled into her house around 5 am and had to be up at 10 am for breakfast with her family. It was nearly impossible to talk about anything other than the night before, but that's exactly what we did. I couldnt wait to get home and tell my friends everything that happened. It felt like I took a trip to a different world and was coming back with stories about how dope life could be outside of my sleepy little town. I learned after that, people tend to respond with jealousy more than enthusiasm when you tell them exciting things you've done. \n\nSarah and I drifted, naturally. A long distance relationship is really hard at 18 years old. We haven't spoken in 15 years. I creeped her social media a while back and it looks like she's settled down with a family now. She was born to be a mama, so I'm really happy for her. I hope she knows she made an impact on my life in the short time we shared together.",

            "text": "Hi there, I\u2019m currently solo travelling in Italy and have found that a LOT of men have been extremely creepy, to the point of following me to train stations and walking with my down multiple streets. I have been to Italy before and didn\u2019t find it so bad (I went to the same area). I\u2019ve been wearing joggers and jackets and this still seems to do nothing :( I\u2019m not sure if anyone else has experienced people also asking for photos with me? Like taking a picture of themselves with me, which I assumed at first was a scam to try and pickpocket but I had no bag and just my phone in my hands so I\u2019m unsure. Any advice on staying safe while alone here would be helpful!!!\n\nEdit - I\u2019ll add a few things here I have answered in the comments. Not all of these men are Italian ethnically, I would say it\u2019s 50/50. But it is also definitely Italians too. I saw a lot of comments about Italians liking tall blonde women, I do not fit this category, and I have seen it happen to other women who don\u2019t fit this category either :( back home I have been told I have quite an intimidating look, but clearly this isn\u2019t a deterrent ",

Immediately upon our arrival in Italy, we got surrounded by a pack of random men in the train station and didn't feel safe (initially we were just concerned about them being a gang of pickpockets, but as they kept increasing in number and tightening the circle, we became extremely uncomfortable). We ignored them as much as possible and talked to each other, loudly mentioning the police a few times before they finally dispersed enough we finally could walk away. The next day we again encountered aggressively weird men so we noped out Italy, heading to Austria, which wasn't previously on our itinerary at all. Beautiful country and we felt much safer and at ease. Things can change a lot in 25 years of course, but I wouldn't hesitate to return to Austria and would actively avoid returning to Italy at this point.\n\nWere they dangerous? Probably not, since they eventually let us leave. But it definitely soured our opinion of the country as a whole --we never made it to Rome, which we had been looking forward to. On the plus side, I can recommend Innsbruck (if you're young, at least--it seemed like a college city to me at the time) and Vienna was also nice.",

Some comments are right saying that female tourists are even more vulnerable to this kind of behavior sometimes. It\u2019s a common thought among many males (also people I know of) that female tourists are here only for a period of time and because of that are more inclined to make experiences with Italian men. Especially in touristic locations. For example, on the Adriatic coast, in Emilia Romagna, near Rimini, it\u2019s a common thought that nordic (or German) women are there to have sex with Italians and it\u2019s not only something locals think. It\u2019s a way of thinking that is typical also of Italian men that go on a holiday in these places. \n\n\nObviously it\u2019s not only tourists that are the victims of this kind of behavior. I live in a small town not far from Milan and my GF hates jogging because every single time she does she gets catcalled multiple times in just an hour. Not only by men saying comments, staring or following her but also by men that drive, usually honking at her. One time she was particularly shocked because one of the man that honked at her while passing by with his car was the father (married) of one her students (she\u2019s an elementary school teacher). I\u2019m sorry for what every woman in this post had to go through, I hate these men for ruining your experience in this beautiful country",

Some people, men and women, when they get into a relationship, do actually consider the shame of dating someone ugly/fat/hairy/short/too skinny etc\u2026).\nAct weird/do not engage in conversation ever.\nIf it doesn\u2019t work and you need immediate reassurance/help, do what you were told by your parents at 6: go look for women, best if with children.\nStill failing? Consider what a ridiculous underdeveloped country you\u2019ve gotten yourself into. Pity us Italian women. Buy a bunch of pistacchio cream, nope tf out and think about it next time you eat lasagne.\n\nGood luck \ud83e\udd72",

Then they get upset for being ignored and resort to calling us derogatory names such as the very infamous \"fighe di legno\", which literally means \"wooden pussies\". \n\nIf you glance at r/italia you'll find many of these guys complaining about Italian women. As I mentioned earlier, they call us \"wooden pussies\" because we're not interested in going out with them, having sex with them, engaging in conversation when they approach, or even smiling when they compliment us. These are the same Italian men who boast about their escapades abroad or with foreign women who come to Italy because, according to these men, foreign women are infatuated with Italian men and welcome attention on the streets unlike us Italian women.\n\nYou wouldn't believe how many times I've had discussions online with them, trying to explain that no woman enjoys being approached and followed by a stranger on the street.    \nAccording to them, it's an issue only with us Italian women because, as they put it, we're \"wooden pussies\" who act all high and mighty and think we're someone special and above everyone else.   \n  \nThey don't understand that their behavior is off-putting, stressful, and the reason why we don't want to engage with them and we prefer to stay single and keep to ourselves.\n\nObviously, not all Italian men are like this, my closest male friends hate these types of men and are exemplary human beings.  There are also men who step in to help when they see someone bothering you with unwanted advances.\n\nThe worrying thing is that many Italian twenty-somethings seem to be more bigoted and sexist than those of my generation (about fifteen years ago) and are increasingly subscribing to misogynistic and hateful ideas spread online from abroad (thanks to Andrew Tate and his followers). They complain so much about us Italian women and blame us for their singletude, their emotional suffering, you name it...\n\nI'm glad I'm not in my twenties for this exact reason.",

I said I\u2019m Korean and he said he thought I was Chinese, and I look really sexy. I felt uncomfortable from that moment, but I didn\u2019t want to make a scene so I just say thank you and left. \n\nI head to the lounge and worked on my laptop, and that receptionist came to put the bed sheets down to the lounge. \n\nHe says that he loves me, and ask me if I love him too. I really don\u2019t get why this person asks this so randomly to me so I just said I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re trying to say. He keeps asked me if I love him and I said I have a boyfriend. \n\nHe said my face looks good and asked me if I want to have s3x with him. Of course I don\u2019t want so I strongly said no several times, and he keeps telling me he has another private room in this building and ask for having s3x with him. \n\nI neglected several time and he left after that. I didn\u2019t tell this to the manager of this facility but I already feel so frustrated since it\u2019s not even the other guest but the staff of this facility that I\u2019m gonna stay for few nights. I talked with my boyfriend about this but still I\u2019m scared of what\u2019s going to happen, or how the owner would react.

He said he is not (which is someone gave me a different number, not the actual number of the owner) and refused to give me the actual number of the owner. And he told me to come to the hostel in the morning to meet him. Which I thought was quite a ridiculous thing to say.\n\nAfter that, I saw someone left a review at google map after I post this, and the owner replied to that review to contact her. I contacted her, and she asked me about the situation and appearance of him. I told her every detail of situation and his appearance, name, etc. She sincerely apologized to me and promised me this kind of incident is never should have been happened and never going to happen anymore in that facility. She showed me a deep empathy toward this situation. And showed me thank for reaching out and report. And I got promised for the refund for whole stay. I didn\u2019t reach out for the police since I didn\u2019t have enough time in Italy but still think wish I would for the further incident that can be happened.\n\nSo\u2026 that\u2019s how it all figured out. I will not able to do this all things without your all encouragement. I\u2019m happy that I was able to report this situation and speak up.

That is unaccaptable and nobody should feel what you felt.\n\nThat being said, I'd like to give some information to let everyone knows how to react in the case somenthing similar shoud happend.\n\nIn Italy, when someone report to be victim for sexual assault, the victim is generally considered credible, and it's up to the accused to defend themselves and prove their innocence. This means that if you go to the police, you're not the one who needs to gather evidence to support your story \u2014 it's up to the other person to do so. Now, this doesn't mean they will be convicted without evidence (that's still the presumption of innocence), but it does give victims a stronger incentive to come forward. Unfortunately, these types of reports aren\u2019t always taken seriously, so my advice is to ask to speak to a female officer, as it's more likely that she will \"get\" the issue. Just to be clear: most men in Italy are absolutely against any form of violence and fully support these kinds of reports. But, given how sensitive this topic is, I still think it\u2019s a good idea to try and talk to a woman, as they generally are capable of more empathy on this subject.\n\nAlso, in Italy there is the presumption of innocence, but there are no legal consequences for someone filing a report against sexual assault even if they don't have hard evidence - unless it\u2019s proven that the story was blatantly false.\n\nFinally: Italy also has anti-violence centers specifically and only for women \u2014 please let's not argue here about the lack of equivalent centers for men, that\u2019s not the point right now \u2014 where you can get full and solid support and indications.",

You report it to the manager, if you are scared of him you do it where there are guests. You make a decision on his reaction to stay or leave, if you do decide to leave you assist on a refund as it is the manager's problem to solve it not yours. Book into another hostel/homestay but not close by as the people love to talk. From there you can decide what you want to do, get the main problem solved and then decide  if you are taking the next step. He will go to jail for that and he knows it. But there are other ways as well by opening it up so foreigners know it is a red flag if you do go there, so business will decline for them. I have a policy that if I see , hear or catch any staff member he/she will be dismissed straight away. Tour guides like to do this with foreigners and get them drunk, be careful is all I can say. If he wants you to drink with him drink the drink you can drink not rice wine/happy water as they can drink it very well and the other party gets drunk. Drink beer for example as after 2 beers most of them are drunk and you will be fine, that is why I say, drink something they are not use to. Good luck and if you guys need help, you are more than welcome to ask. I am 11 months in Vietnam already and know the right people and how they work. Enjoy Vietnam and do not let one person make your holiday unpleasant, there are great people willing to help professionally.",

You get to truly experience a place and talk to locals and take a the time in the world to drink in the beauty of a place.\n\nTravelling with companions is more for the shared experience. I usually do not travel to new places with my loved ones but instead would use this as an opportunity to revisit places that I have loved before and want to spend more time in. You do not then have to rush and feel like missing out on things and can spend more time to talk and enjoy your travelling company. Seeing the sheer joy of my family members when they see a beautiful scenery or taste a new exotic and delicious food is very rewarding. This is something that I miss when I travel solo - the shared experience and happiness of discovering things together.\n\nChoosing the company that you share the experience with is very important. Don't let this one person sour this joy of sharing travel experiences with others for you. Happy travels!",

I was going to Japan to scout locations for a movie, was thinking of going there solo, but I decided to bring a 2 person film crew, one was an employee, the other a contractor hired for this job (both young females, recent film school graduates.)\n\nWe land in Osaka and while eating our very first meal together, the two camera people start talking about who they have already connected with on Tinder (I think it was that app), some in Osaka, some in Kyoto, some in Tokyo....\n\n2nd night they both go out on dates. They both overslept the next morning, causing us to miss the lighting timing for the first location, and we only make it to half the locations we needed to get to.\n\n3rd night and following morning same thing, they both go on dates and oversleep, and we only get to half the locations.\n\nThen we go to Kyoto. Same thing happens there first night in Kyoto.\n\nSo I told them they were fired, the contractor and the employee. Gave them a company credit card for hotels and food and said they were no longer working for the company. The contracted person's reaction was incredible - threatening a lawsuit (I'm an older white female, she is young Asian female). The employee threatened that she would spread the word throughout the industry. We found out the same thing happened when she was hired for a film shoot in Italy - she was fired because all she did was hookup and oversleep (we should have called her references.)\n\nThat's what we get traveling with narcissistic adults that have the mindset of a child.\n\nedit to add that I checked with the other co-owner of the company, and our HR dept, and our legal team before I fired the 2. They were all in agreement, so I felt I was doing the right thing.",

I always try to find fun things to do on our respective budgets, provide different ideas and choices, try to keep up a positive but realistic attitude, etc etc. But regardless of where we go or what we do everything sucks--a really good restraunt? Terrible. World class aquarium? Disappointing. Super cute famous bakery? Awful. World famous museum she wanted to go to? Lacking. Sightseeing like she wanted? Over it. Haunted hotel? She's mad we didn't stay at the even more haunted one next door. The bars we went to? Didn't live up to the hype. Almost the entire trip is like this. \n\nEverything is terrible, boring, unimpressive, or she's been to better (even though she very rarely travels) and she loudly makes sure I and everyone else around knows her opinions on it. What's weird is that's not her typical style of doing stuff. She's really only like this when she's on trips, but it still is absolutely draining. Then a couple weeks later she will tell me how fun it was and how great everything was, while all my memories of the trip are walking on egg shells and dealing with her god awful mood the whole time. \n\n\nSo I'm back to very happily traveling solo! There's plenty of people that are good friends or acquaintances that are just not good for traveling with, and that's ok. We can see them when we get back lol.",

I mapped out the areas I wanted to visit for sure \u2014 Harajuku, Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Yoyogi park. Each day I took the train to a different area and just wondered around. This is the way to do Tokyo. I loved allowing myself to be surprised by the city. A highlight was the biggest cosmetics store (Cosme Harajuku) in Tokyo. I purchased so many skincare products. Five months later and I\u2019m still using my products. \n\nWhen researching this trip, I saw a lot of Tsukiji Fish market haters. However I loved it! I went at like 5:30 AM (thanks jet lag). I ate a bleeding fresh bowl of tuna. It was topped with uni \u2014 first time trying it! The uni added a buttery smooth texture to this delicious rice bowl. I also sampled the strawberry daifuku. I don\u2019t fuck with mochi like that, but it was tasty. That strawberry was the star of course. Miss Strawberry is an icon!\n\nI\u2019m a relaxation girlie. And there are two quintessential relaxation experiences in Japan \u2014 the headspa and the onsen. First the headspa. I\u2019m a Black woman with natural Afro texture hair. I was nervous that the experience would be negative because they surely don\u2019t get many clients like me. However, my masseuse was amazing. She had a translator device that we used to communicate. She asked me about how to treat my hair. I told her not to brush or blow dry it. She then gave me the best scalp massage of my life, and my hair was so soft after. Honestly shocked the products worked ok on me, but I suppose a good product is a good product. Since I didn\u2019t need a blow dry, she used the extra time to give me a foot massage. In total, the treatment was 3 hours and a total highlight of my experience. \n\nThe Hakone onsen was also fabulous. I booked a ryokan with a private outdoor onsen. I took at least four dips every day. I needed this chill few days after the chaos of Tokyo. \n\nWhile you\u2019re in Hakone, I recommend the Open Air museum. It\u2019s a sculpture museum nestled amongst the mountains. The space put me in a contemplative mood \u2014 very Japanese, I know. I spent a few hours just wondering the space and appreciating the care they put into its curation. \n\nI\u2019m not going to talk too much about Kyoto because this was the work portion of my trip. But I will say, I found getting up at 5 AM for the bamboo forest to be worth it. There was no one there, except me, the monks who care for the area, and a few joggers. If you do visit, please respect the forest. I saw lots of initials carved into these gorgeous bamboo trees. That made me sad, because the monks allow us to visit this beautiful space. We should leave it how we found it. \n\nMy other Kyoto recommendation is to walk the Philosophers Path. It was quiet and peaceful. And at the end of the path, I found a lone cherry blossom tree that had bloomed! Feels like a metaphor for my trip. \n\nOne thing I missed out on was nightlife. I heard that Tokyo has amazing nightlife. I was not feeling very social, but I with I would have joined a bar crawl. \n\nFinal Verdict: I loved Japan. I was there as a kid and have overwhelming memories of Japanese people touching me and taking my photo, as the only Black person around at the time. That was over two decades ago, and things have changed a lot. I felt welcomed in all the spaces I went to \u2014 even Hakone, where I was basically the only Black person and one of maybe five westerners. \n\nAbout Me:\nI am a 31 year old Black American queer woman. I am fairly experienced with solo travel, and am comfortable navigating new spaces. I also tend towards a high budget trip, as I value paying for comfortable and safe accommodations, as well as unique experiences. ",

Yes, in a hypothetical world where colonialism and racism never happened then sure a Frenchman saying negro is fine. But that\u2019s not the real world and yall need to grow up. The French brutally murdered thousands of Africans during their colonial expansion and to this day have enacted policies in which the former colonies need to pay France monetarily for their independence.

Over the nineteenth century, as Jews were emancipated and ghettos were dissolved, the word \u201cghetto\u201d transcended its Italian roots and became a more general term for pre-modern Jewish life. It also came to designate new Jewish spaces\u2014from voluntary immigrant neighborhoods like New York\u2019s Lower East Side to the holding pens of Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe\u2014as dissimilar from the pre-emancipation European ghettos as they were from each other. After World War Two, ghetto broke free of its Jewish origins and became more typically associated with African Americans than with Jews. Chronicling this sinuous transatlantic journey, this talk reveals how the history of ghettos is tied up with the struggle and argument over the meaning of a word\u201d.\n-Dept. of History, Harvard",

I have done some hostels, but to guard my joy, I rarely use energy to connect with white hostel folks from the U.S., a country built on anti-Black racism. I also stay away from white people who come in groups from countries like Australia/UK. I have never quite had piss poor one-on-one incidents with people in hostels, but folks are embolden by groupthink and group action when they travel in a group. Stay away from them is my advice. \n\nI also stay away from solo AirBnbs/apartment stays, which is another story, but I think they bring out the worst in locals. It gives them an opportunity to treat you badly without true accountability. Hotels can be your best friend. I'm currently in SE Asia, and I'm in a hotel. Last night, I went to a bar, where I sat at one bar seat where all other seats were taken. Everyone was of Asian descent except for a table of white Americans in the back of the bar. They were the loudest people in the bar, which was fine, but all I could hear was them complaining about one thing or another. \n\nKnow that these are privileged folk who often don't have much going for them in their hometowns. They come to be praised by locals and live cheaply off the land. The white men, in particular, often feel they can pull a much more attractive woman in these places than they can at home, and they are correct, bc of what's perceived they have financially. There's a lot of incels, fools and assholes among this travel culture. Don't waste your time with them. Folks who are truly interested in the culture and genuine travel experiences will reveal themselves if they are meant to be a part of your travel experience. I hope you have a better end to this trip and safely make it back to the UK. Feel free to DM with any challenges.",

I've mostly witnessed similar derogatory comments towards locals and local culture, especially passport bro type grossness in Latin America, and occasionally other Europeans literally telling me I'm not from England because I \"don't look English\" (I'm mixed) - erm, I think I know where I'm from thanks, and you can imagine how ridiculous the concept of 'looking English' sounds to me as a Londoner!\n\nI'm going to DM you the name of a Facebook group that you might find more of a safe space and potentially find some girls to meet up with if you're still out there. I've travelled extensively in Mexico and generally had good experiences in hostels. But I do tend to avoid very party-focused hostels and look for places that attract more chill people, a few things I look out for are - that new hostelworld feature that shows people's flags so you can see which hostels have the most diverse group of travellers staying, locally owned hostels, hostels with events that promote conscious tourism and cultural exchange e.g. have language exchange nights etc. Checking their Instagram can help give you an idea too.\n\nI hope at least some of the conversations in this thread have been healing.

Of course Spanish people are exempted because it's literally their language.\n\nWe DO know that \"negro\" is offensive, for fuck sake. We absolutely do, there's no way you use that word without having that connotation, and you know it even if you don't speak English. C'mon...\n\nAs for ghetto, however, I'm sorry but that word is not associated primarily with black people here. First thing coming to mind is Jews and WWII. Second thing, any particularly bad neighborhood in a city. Not a particularly nice word ofc, but it's not an insult to black people exclusively like the n word",

All these bad experiences now make me hesitant to be around with them, which you might think that's another form of discrimination/racism. But after being treated like a piece of sh!t so many times by them, whenever they say they are from Australia/NZ, inside me is like 'is he or she an okay person towards POC? Or another tw*t?' and take ages for me to put my mental guard down against them. Of course I talk in a friendly manner with them like any other people, but I just can't cast off my perception towards them. They say 'oh but every country has got idiots like that!' but the ratio is much higher. I also don't feel good whenever they post videos of my country and enjoying their time. I didn't have a good time in their counties, and it's just not fair.",

Very rarely, a creep is trying to suss out if anyone would care if you got hurt or went missing.)\n\nBtw, is there any reason traveling solo on this trip would bother you at all? I ask because the only time I remember these comments got under my skin was when I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d be on a trip *full* of couples (my SO stayed home). I guess I felt a bit insecure being the odd one out, even though that normally isn\u2019t an issue.

I wanted to say I\u2019m gay and I do not have a partner yes and I wanted to take a cruise.",
