We can reasonably assume that she has already changed, or at least started to. Maybe she's hiding the little wings. What I wonder is whether she may actually have changed earlier.\n\nWhat I mean by that is the seed required a sacrifice, and I remember somewhere that the sacrifice required betrayal in order to count. So her killing her father would be one item. And we know that the whole purpose of the orphanage was to be such a betrayal sacrifice as well, since she poisoned them, and that was done earlier than when she killed the king. It's possible the conditions weren't complete until after king was killed, but it's also possible the conditions were completely met by the orphanage and the king was just her first loyalty test. A third option is that the conditions were met, but she went further than the minimum by killing the king in order to make the transformation conditions more favorable somehow (speculation since we know so little about the seeds).\n\nAs an aside, when he wakes up, she convinces him to serve the Sorcerer Kingdom, and even gets an additional fallen seed from Albedo so she can race-change him too. But unless that one is already active in some form, or there is another workaround such as alternate conditions, I find it unlikely he would ever meet the required conditions that we know about.",

                    "body": "Not evil, won\u2019t argue with the insane because her logic is batshit.     \n    \nHer intellect jaded her at an early age. She couldn\u2019t understand why people didn\u2019t understand the things she was talking about when in her mind it was incredibly simple.    \nShe had no peers. This depressed her so badly she was on the verge of dying because eating would cause her to throw up.     \n      \nShe was saved when she randomly decided to take a walk and came across a dying orphan in the rain.    \nHe looked at her with eyes that looked like they were looking at the Sun.     \nThat\u2019s the part people often forget; Renner and Climb saved each other in that moment\u2026with different angles.    \nMaybe young Renner finally saw someone look at her as impressed at her as they should be for her genius instead of the child that spoke of weird things, or maybe she really just loved those puppy eyes.     \nBut Climb does look at her the same way someone would look at the literal smartest/important person in the world.      \n     \nSo laying down that foundation, from that point on Renner didn\u2019t give a fuck about the rest of the world. None. Just Climb.      \nAs an aside, noticed that Climb\u2019s the same way? Everything is for Renner.      \n     \nNow, she\u2019s in a situation where she\u2019s a Princess and the person she wants to be shackled with is lower than a Commoner.    \nShe pulls a miracle and gets him appointed as her personal guard.     \nBut the Kingdom and its social structure won\u2019t allow them to be joined in any capacity. Maybe part of why Ramposa III hadn\u2019t married her off just yet was to give her more time with Climb. Hell he\u2019s even willing to get Climb a title later and even let him escape with her at the end.     \n     \nSo Renner, keep in mind she\u2019s critically obsessed with Climb, needs to hatch a plan to overcome the Kingdom\u2019s societal structure to be with Climb.     \n      \nThis is the part that sets her apart from being Evil.    \nShe didn\u2019t give a flying fuck about the method or the consequences. Just which plan was the most viable to get what she wanted.     \n      \nIf Renner had been able to get what she wanted (before she was married off) by making the Kingdom into a utopia for every citizen and scouring the corruption clean, she would\u2019ve done that.      \n      \nIt\u2019s just in cold logic, it was more viable for her to get what she wanted by making it so the Kingdom would get caught in Civil War, the Royal Faction wins and solidifies their power base, Renner\u2019s deal with Zanac would have kicked in and she now lives with Climb in the basement in a Kingdom that won\u2019t fall apart because the Royal and Noble factions were at each other\u2019s throats.     \n     \nThat was before Nazarick came into play.    \nKeep in mind that Phillip absolutely fucked the Kingdom. The Nazarick plan would\u2019ve played out the exact same as before, except using Jalbadaoth to accelerate the time table and the Sorcerous Kingdom would come in for the rescue.     \nThe incompetent Nobles would\u2019ve been wiped out, and the competent Royals and Nobles left would\u2019ve been tasked with running the conquered territory because Nazarick is critically low on management personnel.     \n     \nSame again with the Seed of the Fallen.    \nShe didn\u2019t care what the conditions were. If it had been save dozens of dying puppies and grow them to adulthood, that\u2019s what she would\u2019ve done.    \nIm fairly sure Albedo or Demiurge\u2019s bias played a role her as Renner absolutely had no say in what race change item they would\u2019ve given her other than maybe asking for one with immortality. So she could serve Nazarick and/or be with a limb forever.     \nDoubt either Albedo or Demiurge\u2019s first thoughts would be to give her the Angel race change item as in their minds, most of Nazarick is in the lower negative karma value afterall.     \n      \nSo more psychopath. Her Imp character sheet even states that all the people that were killed were more like ingredients in a dish to her, she was thankful for all of them for allowing her to achieve what she wanted.    \nIt was just bad luck for them that instead of being a dish that would live in an utopia under the Sorcerous Kingdom\u2019s banner that Phillip 86\u2019d and instead became warning to others and a tiny little hors d\u2019oeuvre instead.",

He thinks he might be able to defeat \"her.\" Mare obviously being powerful even among the guardians makes it ridiculous lol\n\nAfter their talk, Climb hears buildings collapsing and kills the urge to look back. Then, see's pillars of smoke and thinks that Mare was with a sizeable contingent, not actually alone. Again, underestimating \"her\" because we know Mare is trying to kill everyone in one shot with as very little survivors as possible. \n\n\u201cTo destroy the capital and kill all of its inhabitants \u2014 hey hey, ho \u2014\u201d Mare threw his tightly clenched fists upward\"\n\nClimb wonders why he doesn't hear any screams, and like other things, he's still just trying to ignore everything and get back to Renner. It's Climb, his inner monologue being about getting back to Renner as a number one priority is not out of character. \n\nThere's some sentences and paragraphs for dread, too, like not hearing screams.\n\"Even though this place was far away from the knights\u2019 defensive lines, he should still be able to hear some sort of noise, even if it was just the sound of a sword clashing against something. \n\nSpeaking of which\u2014 It\u2019s even quieter than before. \n\nCompared to before, the silence became even more uncomfortable. Never mind the palace, the loneliness he felt right now was like if he was the last man in this world.\"\n\nWell, all I mean to say is maybe you would enjoy it a bit more if you reread it. Maybe not, but it just seems like you're kinda hating it a bit too much lol to each their own, though. \n\nAlso, what do you mean by Arthas moment? If it's a reference from another series, would you mind explaining with limited spoilers if any :o",

Tsuare was a completely off the rails thing for Sebas and the way it was written, it seemed like he was being suspected of having gone rogue, all over a secret he tried to keep. \n\nI definitely think he may have grown negatively from that experience had he been forced to kill her. His karma might have even changed, and at the extreme end of things, he might have even grown to harbor resentment towards Nazarick, maybe even Ainz.",

I'm afraid to say more because of spoilers but you'll see in the movie.   \nThe next season, unless they decide to do another movie, will be the elf kingdom ark. The end of the fourth season actually marked the ramp up for the series in terms of actual fighting. Conquering the kingdom and the fight at the end were just the beginning of Ainz's disrespect.",

Even if anyone say that the publishers won't make him end it that easy, he still have the final say to it since he the author. Looks to me that even tho he \"really\" wants to end it, he still plans to wring out the last penny he could get from it and he just lowkey racist hating on international fans and community of the series.",

You could then send this in and assuming you had a japanese adress you would recieve the side story. \n&nbsp;\n\nHowever, a few months after it was released someone linked them the post of the English Translation. Rightfully he was a bit upset that it was pirated and ranted about it on twitter.\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Problem**\n\nThis created a big problem with the fans... Overlord is a huge series globally. The Overlord Anime Team (director & etc) and even sometimes the author travel around the world to anime conventions... it is that big.\n&nbsp;\n\nYet, we never even got a chance to buy it. It was never translated or released in other languages and even if you could read japanese you still needed a japanese address. I literally have the voucher that states that. \n&nbsp;\n\n**Repeat**\n\nNow again... the author is releasing a limited edition side story that you can only get in japan. Although this time all you have to do is goto the movie during the first week and you can get it.\n&nbsp;\n\nIt just sort of feels like a slap in the face.\n&nbsp;\n\nThe author will probably see it again and complain about it. It just... it is hard to explain. They know Overlord is popular outside of Japan, and the movie is even being shown outside of Japan. The Anime director did a preview in germany. It is just sort of mind boggling they didn't even attempt to do a secondary release for the global market.",

Few companies are as annoying and anal regarding copyright and piracy as the japanese ones (maybe Disney?) and this is clearly something cultural as well. Whereas you or I will think \"as long as no working person (like an author) loses money I don't give a shit, corporations can go fuck themselves \" the *average* person in Japan will probably go with the \"default\" morality on the matter. Or at least that's my experience when talking with them on the internet. If it's the law then it is **GOOD**. Hence the default anti-piracy stuff.\n\n2) Maruyama apparently values all those \"limited edition\" bullcrap ideas. So he is honestly annoyed that his fantasy of \"only X number of people get this\" will be denied. Strangely analogic of him but in a world where books existed only on paper his desire would be *mostly* accomplished. Sadly he has forgotten such \"analogic\" world doesn't exist anymore.",

But to disregard what could be potential real reasons for why he got upset that his work is being used in an unintended way, and blame it all on \u201cxenophobia\u201d is the most immature and selfish thing I\u2019ve seen in a while. \n\nMany people seem to have no care for why he actually acted that way, astonishingly. It\u2019s easy to put the blame on xenophobia with anything related to foreign cultures, but that shouldn\u2019t be and it isn\u2019t the right outlook.\n\nI\u2019d honestly like to believe that not all Overlord fans are like these guys in this sub, that\u2019s what I hope as not all fans are particularly using this sub after all.\n\nEdit: added a bit more of my opinion.",

For example, all those characters in that \u201ctotally 5000 years old but looks like a child\u201d type of trope is fairly assumed to be some sort of pedophilic insert since there\u2019s no reason why a child character can\u2019t just be a child or why a millions year old character has to look like a child. This is especially concerning when these types of characters are given outrageous secondary sexual characteristics or given romantic subplots with the adult/older teenage characters however one sided. Raphtalia in Shield Hero is one example although they tried to get around the pedophilia by \u201cevolving\u201d her even though she is still a child age wise. I don\u2019t see how not liking things like this is being pathetic towards Asian cultures unless pedophilia is an integral part of Japanese culture.",

I'm not suggesting it's right in any way but I can't really say that I wouldn't feel the same. Not having walked in their shoes it's kinda difficult to excuse Maruyama's actions in this regard.\n\nThat being said, if Overlord has taught me anything it's that there is no absolute right or wrong in this world, it's all just shades of grey. What we think of as completely illogical/misguided can very easily be a simple fact of life/common sense/core belief of someone else. We say they're wrong, they say we're wrong. \n\nIn such a world, it's kind of difficult to judge Maruyama's decision to try to restrict the side novels to Japan. That being said, I sure as hell am not gonna bow down to his whims. \n\nBtw, does he get royalties from Overlord merch? If he does then imo he should instead be grateful to fan translators, right? Just look at how many posts there are on this sub alone about people sharing pics of their new figurines and such. How many of those people became fans because of fan translations?",

Maybe having exclusive collectables is a big deal in Japan, which seems to be the case from how Japan is usually portrayed in anime. Or maybe his hands are tied with his publishers and so on.\n\nAll I\u2019m saying is that we should try to see the big picture so we can know what\u2019s actually happening, instead of jumping to conclusions. I would like to give a different perspective, what do you think he feels when he sees the foreign audience calls him xenophobic, make memes mocking him and Japan when we don\u2019t know their culture in regards to exclusive collections, or his work environment with his publishers, or other laws in place and so on? Do you think he will go \u201cI see, they have a point. I do look like a xenophobe.\u201d? Is that what you think he\u2019ll think?\n\nLet\u2019s not sugar coat things, a lot that happened from this community is what led us to this situation. Not Maruyama only. He has expressed his tiredness with writing as it\u2019s just a hobby to him. So instead of showing support for him so he can at least finish the story with good quality, we call him xenophobic when he makes a decision to release an exclusive item without actually caring to try and understand him. That however doesn\u2019t excuse his attitude as well, as it just fueled the reaction of the community as well. It\u2019s like an abusive relationship in a way.\n\nAnd regarding your last question, I believe I already answered it previously. I have no problem with him making something exclusive to Japan, that\u2019s his prerogative. I\u2019ll be sad, of course, but I\u2019ll respect his decision. I understand this doesn\u2019t directly answer the example you gave, but I\u2019d rather just talk about Maruyama directly and this instance, as it\u2019s more relevant since Japanese is just a single nationality/country, while whites are not a single nationality/country.

You are merely putting focus on cases that further your agenda when there are cases which show the opposite.  \n  \nLet's look at countries like Brazil for example. The country is mixed as all hell immigrants from all over moved in over centuries of history and the result? The cultures merged and gave birth to new ones. Beliefs centuries old are still practiced today.   \n  \nImmigrants will gravitate towards communities that are closer to what they are used to yes. There are many communities of people from similar places here. However they do not simply \"destroy\" pre-existing cultures in place. The only way a culture trully die is if the descendants lose interest in their native culture and gravitate towards others.  \n  \nBut all that aside here's the real kicker. Even without taking into account immigrants your culture and everybody else's has already changed and been affected because we live in a globalized world. Work culture, transportation, food, entertainment and many other things have changed and been absorbed by many places. So like it or not your culture will not remain pure. It already is not pure because unless your country is completely isolated and had no outside contact whatsoever with other places your culture has already suffered outside influence and changed as a result.   \n  \nAll that is to say it's not immigrants that will change your culture it has already changed in this interconnected world. Making this \"fear of outsiders\" just plain moronic and pointless. Might as well close all borders and cut all outside contact. But that is not feasible now is it?",

Herogasm is specifically a disgusting depraved event that morally bankrupt supes participate in and the whole event shows them in a bad light. The giant incest baby is specifically a joke in an entire episode about Morty being disgusting. I think when done that way, it is generally not seen as creepy as when these things happen in some anime where these acts are not being shown as creepy. A prime example is stuff like Overlord or Goblin Slayer. These shows do have many shitty things happening but most of the time they are done by legitimate monsters and inhuman criminals. I can see why some wouldn\u2019t like to see such dark shit, but they are not inherently problematic like other anime content. I\u2019m not going to sit here and act like creepy shit doesn\u2019t get created in the West or in another Asian media. They are and they are rightfully criticized. See the new Blake Lively movie about an abusive relationship that seemingly glorifies it for the most recent reference. I\u2019m just tired of Anime fans acting like just because they like anime in general that anime cannot be weird and creepy OR that criticizing creepy shit in anime is some sort of offense against Japanese culture. Rising of the shield hero is a pedophile\u2019s dream. I can say that and still like One Piece. Redo of a Healer is a rape fantasy only about raping those who did you wrong. I can say that and still like Howl\u2019s Moving Castle. \n\nAlso, just as an aside, just because you haven\u2019t encountered many of these tropes doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t a legitimate problem. You don\u2019t even have to consciously look for it like you are assuming. If you watch isekai genre a lot, you will find many manga and anime glorifying slavery, rape, pedophilia. If you watch/read romance dramas enough, and you\u2019ll run into numerous NTR stories which is essentially just rape stories.",

Both Ainz's original earth and the NW is faaaaaar from anything we've ever experienced and likely ever will experience.\n\n\n>Demiurg's Happy Farm - Wrong.\n\nThey're in a completely new world with different (compared to both the game and earth) natural laws that are still mostly unknown to Nazarick. To figure out what they don't know they need a way to easily and efficiently obtain data. Thousands of lab rats they can manipulate however they wish is a good start. And so they do experiments to obtain that required data to find ways to improve Nazarick without considering anything else. Yes he's evil, but in his eyes he's not. \n\nAlso, we kill tens of millions (some estimates put it at 200mil) of lab rats and other animals (dogs, rabbits, cats, monkeys etc) EVERY YEAR for the sake of gathering data. To some that's evil, to others it's for the greater good. \n\n>Wiping out an entire Kingdom and its people for the unsanctioned actions of a handful of lower ranking individuals - Wrong.\n\nAinz didn't wipe out the kingdom because of the caravan. He would have wiped them out regardless, it was just a scheme to give him a reason to use as a casus belli. To show all other external forces \"If you act against us, even a little, you're done\". With this example, it should reduce casualties on all sides in the long run.\n\n>Genocide - Wrong.\n\nYes, to us in 2024. There are plenty examples of genocides throughout history. That would not be the case if there weren't individuals for whom the massacre was justified/morally right. Heck some saw it as a \"sacred duty\" to wipe out certain populations.\n\n>Using sapient beings as materials (This happened in Death Camps in WW2, where people were turned into soaps, for example) - Wrong.\n\nAgain, to us yes.\n\n>Torturing prisoners to break their will and indoctrinate them - Wrong.\n\nYea, to us at this point in time.... well most of us. Torture is still very much utilised for a wide variety of applications. Just not publicly.\n\n>Saving innocent villagers from raiders - Right.\n\nFrom our and the villagers's pov yea. The \"raiders\" were executing a false flag operation to lure out and ambush Gazef to get rid of the Kingdom's strongest force. So to the Theocracy, Ainz's actions of saving the villagers and Gazef and killing that Sunlight scripture squad was wrong. Like objectively so(to them).\n\n>Sometimes it's futile to speak of shades of gray, when some issues are back and white. Momonga is the ultimate evil, after all, regardless of how bad other characters are.\n\nGod damn you're stubborn. Try putting yourself in others' shoes. See through their eyes. Then you just might understand them. Understanding them still doesn't mean you have to agree with them on anything.\n\nEdit- Apparently I was off on the estimates, it's quite a bit higher than I thought",

They are not the same as they were. That is a fact. Our eating habits, entertainment, ways of transport, ways of work, media and so on were and are influenced by other cultures like it or not. It is impossible for a culture and way of life to not be influenced in some shape or form in this day and age unless the country completely isolates itself. And that i'm sorry is not feasible unless you want to cut out all trade to the outside world. That means cutting off internet access, trade, communication, technological and medicine advancements in other places, the works.  \n  \nI'm not saying we should stuff Japan full of people with no control or reason since the place wouldn't even have enough living space or internal structure to accomodate a lot of people anyway. What i'm saying is this fear of outsiders entering the country and changing the whole culture is moronic because it already happened and no immigrant presence was needed. Controlled immigration can be a boon. It's completely uncontrolled mess ones such as in some countries in Europe that make it an issue for all parties involved. Wanting to disguise your xenophobia and fully close off the country while being hostile to all and any outsiders under the guise of maintaining your culture as it always was is silly because it has already changed and will continue to change.   \n   \nAnd let's not pretend outsiders only bring to the table the destruction of your culture lest we forget you and i are right now using outside technology and media to even have this discussion about a work heavily influenced and based around western authors, themes and history. Not wanting uncontrolled full open border immigrant presence is fine because that only causes issues. But having problems with people from other countries by itself or controlled immigration just shows one's hypocritical intolerance and xenophobia even though they still enjoy boons heavily inspired or outright made outside their country.",

While there are heroes who decided to focus on teaching the next generation, the writing in the last chapter gives off the negative impression that Midoriya let Bakugo have all the credit for stopping Shigaraki, which feels impossible - the world already knows \"Deku\" the hero, so they would recognize who was boxing Shigaraki on the live feeds, and Bakugo would be livid if he tried.\n\nIt's made worse by the contrast in the success of his peers. Rather than speaking to how Midoriya checked in on them all from time to time, Horikoshi focused on how adults  drift apart - an understandable aspect, but in this context it made Midoriya's classmates look like asshats due to cases of villainy dropping significantly. I feel like Horikpshi got rushed into ending things because the epilogue deserved at least five chapters, in my opinion.\n\n3) I feel like the irritating vagueness of Uraraka and Deku's relationship was Horikoshi attempting to compromise with the rabid side of the MHA shipping fanbase\n\nThey can't be pissed that Midoriya ended up with Uraraka over their preferred ship if it's never explicitly shown, but at the same time, this backfired for him, as the lack of a clear payoff despite the two being built up as a couple over 6 seasons infuriated anyone that supported the main ship, which was only worsened by the idea that she of all people didn't see Midoriya regularly",

They are truths ingrained within us from birth, like how we all know that we \u201cexist\u201d in reality. There are exceptions, of course, but those are infinitely minuscule in number that they don\u2019t represent anyone else.\n\nAnother example is how trees exist irrespective of us, that\u2019s a universal truth, that the world exists around us. A specific person could have mental issues and hallucinate, but that doesn\u2019t affect the reality around him, only his subjective experience with said objective reality. You are confusing what is subjective with what is objective.\n\nAnd with all due respect, what you said about the killing makes zero sense and doesn\u2019t reflect reality. Almost no one would say that if you\u2019re in a situation where someone is trying to kill you and you ended up killing him in self defense, that it is a \u201cbad thing\u201d to do. Your life was in danger and you had to preserve it, it just happened that the guy died in the process.\n\nDo you know where the shades of gray come into play in the previous example? It\u2019s not the killing in self defense, but in whether there was no other option but to kill him, or if there were but you decided to just kill him anyway. That\u2019s when \u201cshades of gray\u201d comes into play. That is why they can coexist, they are not mutually exclusive. But they can also exist without the other, like genocide and rape. They are absolute wrongs, and in no way shape or form can they become \u201cshades of gray\u201d.\n\nAnd the part about religion is a long discussion, as objectively there can only ever be one true religion, not many, or 3, or 2, just 1. There can never be more than 1 giving different and opposing perspectives as absolute truths. So to know if the one true religion is aligning with objective reality you\u2019d have to search for it and scrutinize other religions. So let us not go there now, it needs a separate discussion.",

Ceasar wins his bid to become emperor and Pompey flees to Egypt to escape repercussions for his political and literal attacks against him. Guy in charge of Egypt, a young king named Ptolemy, sees the rising power and reach of Rome and wants to get ahead of the problem through diplomatic cooperation. Ceasar comes to Egypt to meet with ptolemy and discuss his search for Pompey. Ptolemy shows Ceasar the head of Ptolemy and basically goes, \"I killed him for you! We're friends now, right?\" Ceasar is pissed that his rival got done dirty and begins a campaign to depose Ptolemy, supported by another member of the royal family he just happened to meet completely by coincidence a little earlier: Cleopatra.\n\nSo, we have an autarch in pursuit of a rival military leader finding that their quarry had been decapitated by a third party hoping to avoid being conquered down the line. The autarch, aided by a female member of the royal family, is pissed and punishes the conspirators for cowardly killing a person he respected. It's a big 'ol allegory down to its roots.",

Generally speaking, conquerors like to takeover land and titles; not lay waste with a ~~scorched~~ frozen earth policy.\n\nSo when Zanac basically tells the nobles 'the only chance of survival is if we fight' what the nobles heard was \"I refuse to surrender and I will spend the lives of everyone in this kingdom to protect my royal inheritance\" so they killed him. They presented his head to Ainz because they didn't understand Ainz motivations or personality. They thought all he wanted was conquest and an expansion to his domain.\nWith Zanac out of the way, the kingdom could've easily been annexed by Ainz. If things worked out as they planned then they would've retained their positions as nobles but under Ainz instead, saved their families, and spared the populace from genocide.\n\nThey just never could've anticipated how dumb and psychotic Ainz actually is.",

Inbreeding usually happens once a reign is stable, to ensure power remains within the family. It was actually surprisingly more common with peasant landowners. Since they had much less assets to try and retain it became incredibly important to use marriage to do so. So a lot of peasants would marry cousins or uncles/aunts to keep what little they had in the family.",

Ainz immediately reached the conclusion that he was wrong, and no life (aside from Zanac) was worth anything, so he decided to 'end the charade'.",

And while you are at it you can convince ainz that you are his own body died playing the game and isekaid here like one of the isekai mangas. Since we know most of the lore there is no reason that he wouldn't believe in us. In our story we would make it a little bit different tho so he would believe that we are a different version of him from another timeline.

Because I'm pretty sure that if you wanted to, you could easily break out.\n\nAlbedo: ....\n\nMe: .. or not? Were you ordered to be here??\n\nAlbedo: I was told to do my time, worm. Apparently I need to learn my lesson, but I don't even know what it is.\n\nMe: Well, I could maybe help\n\nAlbedo: NO!... I was told I had to figure it out for myself.\n\nMe: A little help doesn't hurt. If anything I'd just ask questions for you to answer. Like if I handed you puzzle pieces to put the puzzle together.\n\nAlbedo: *displeased but gives in to the idea*\n\n*from there I ask what happened before getting thrown in and if it was an often occurrence to get her to get her own conclusions, and to suggest a few answers. Most likely to treat humans with respect being the culprit*\"",

For a copy bought there's somewhere around 5% I believe that goes to the author so for every 10 dollars you spend he gets 50 cents. There are also translation issues with the names of certain institutions and inconsistent naming between volumes. The prose from yen press imo is much better than the fan TL so there's that to consider but either way you go supporting the author should be done by purchasing things directly from them, so the actual JP books or other merchandise, buying through yen press doesn't help the author much at all.",

There was one random comment with about 20 likes, and it was three paragraphs long. It told a super unsettling and detailed story, supposedly by the author, about how they were sold, abused, and died. After reading that, I felt the show was too dark for no reason and decided to drop it. Later, I realized the comment was probably fake and made by an edge-lord. I finished Overlord a while back; it was 7/10. I would still recommend it.",

All they knew about it was that it was unexplored and had unusual architecture. They assumed it was relatively safe and likely stronger than the previously explored dungeons. Arche was in need of money to leave her parents behind so they could survive on their own so it makes sense that she would go to an unexplored dungeon with many other strong Worker groups. No one expected that dungeon to be unfathomably more powerful than anything else they had encountered and no one knew that Momon, the strongest adventurer with them, was secretly the Tomb\u2019s leader.\n\nPersonally, if I was in their position, I would go with the second group of explorers and hope to go down an unexplored passage even if I do find less treasure.",

If Arche (and the rest of foresight) took the loot from there, and left with that they would've been fine, and Arche would've had more than enough to leave her parents with her sisters.\n\nSo yeah, you shouldn't feel too bad for her.",

Slavery in the empire is not illegal but I don't think Jircniv would allow the increase of Brothels for \"special kinks\" in his country.

So he was very rough on her in Nazarick but ultimately she did survive. My understanding is killing her in the LN was returning to the original plan for her unfortunately. \n\nI suspect that is why he emphasized so much about her \u201cbeing the limit of her potential\u201d etc and not actually a genius because the WN seemed to indicate she was closer to an actual genius. Even inventing her own type of magic. So acting like her potential was already used up seems to be a way to try and justify the decision to kill her off instead.",

No, they tried to find a way to slain it\n\n\n> Under that arrangement, those people who discovered ruins which had been\u00a0previously unknown to the nation or the Adventurer\u2019s Guild had unspoken\u00a0permission to kill any illegal squatters occupying the ruins.\u00a0In that respect, they had adopted a policy of \u201ckill them on suspicion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> \u201cAh, under normal circumstances, it\u2019d probably be the undead. If the undead\u00a0really have taken over these ruins, then we\u2019ll need to clear them out and\u00a0consecrate the place to disperse the negative energy, else it\u2019ll\u00a0be bad, right?\u201d\n\n\nDont get me wrong, Nazarick are evil, extremely evil. But the workers aint innocent little babies, they have basic knowledge about the tomb and willing to kill each and every monster and undead they found to take their treasure. Form the worker pov, they walk into unknow tomb, expect there may some powerful undead inside and willing to kill it to take their gold. A powerful undead did live inside the tomb and the worker lose the fight against it. Live by the sword, die by the sword, fair and square.

Then in the sheet, when the character is no longer needed, he reveals everything.  \n-In any case, she remains, together with her companions, one of the worst characters ever written.

You see him continue with this notion throughout the series, even switching what popular votes decided as survival in WN to be gruesome deaths in the LN for the same reason.\n\nAs a funny side note, I think the same blog post had him write something like, \"You didn't expect that Clementine would be the type to fall in love with Ainz-sama, huh? I want to grow/write a harem for Ainz.\" And then he also had some note about how Ainz was the second person to touch Clementine's breasts ever. . .

Her equipment (excluding Gazef's Kingsom Treasures) and martial techniques seemed better than both Gazef and Brain as well, so I doubt she was avoiding them because she couldn't kill them.

Only thing to keep his mind occupied. Knowing that his journey ended as it began, him being left alone, and forgotten. \n\nAlso, this would make sense, given how no one in the new world can kill him.

volume the whole reason he made overlord was because he was sick of the other stories such as you describe, where heroes have to be good for karma where they offer to help and risk their life for a poor sole without expecting payment.\n\n Plus shows that end of such make no sense and feel forced take death note for example the majority of people who watched it still say the first 17 episodes where the most entertaining whilst the rest was just forced for the good ending of this story\n\nI also think the way you find Ainz's  action to be cruel insanely hypocritical and extremely narrow, humans are responsible for the most extinction on this planet we separate and kill baby/kid cows for their tender and juicy meat, we bread and geneticaly design chickens for the sole process of devouring them, there is roughly about 100 to 200 billion chickens slaughtered world wide that excluding the unborn babies everyone makes their favourite breakfast with including renoun deserts such as cakes and ice creams. \n\nCan you imagine other species doing that wether it be aliens mystical creatures desighning mouth watering (to them) recipes  of how to cook a kid, a baby an unborn baby, prioritizing the body parts and such, we will be calling them demons and race to be exterminated without exception. \n\nIn parts of japan intelligent life forms like whales are being hunted to make delicacies other intelligent creature including our fellow primates like Orangutans whichs  we share a DNA similarlity of 98% with, and other  primates are being hunted to near extinction, just imagine if a more powerful an intelligent creature hunted us like so, we will refer to them as the greatest evil and a surge on the earth. \n\nEven animals that can potentially hunt us or hunt us are looked and treated with even mote animosity a bear, tiger would be tracked, targeted and euthernize for doing what a human can do to countless chickens a day. \n\nYou get it Ainz ain't human as he is now they are powerful grotesque which with their prowess don't and can't see humans as equals a True vampire, a High demon, a Dragon nor an Insectoid clearing out a kingdom of humans for their benefits is like a human smoking out a bee hive for their honey or a human kinging out a bothersome ant hive from their backyard, or eradicating a nest of hornets near their vicinity. \n\nYou'll find that equally powefull beings such as dragon lords are the same take Cure Elim sacrificing millions of humans and possibly 100s of millions of species for his experiment and to benefit his strength by becoming an undead himself  even the Platinum dragon views building nations and causing wars as meir experiments them taking the life of a human insn't even considered murder in their eyes it's like me preping a thanks giving turkey. \n\nPlus these politicians you see today don't even care going above Ainz's mental capacities and causing a mass genocide to other fellow human with equal human rights over stupid reasons, even though some might be understandable just take H*tler as an example the guy massacred nearly the same number of people as Ainz's army just cause of hes racist beliefs, unlike Ainz he wasn't trying to solidify his power as a nation thus solidifying his nations protection. \n\nAinz barely used a percentage of nazarrick's forces to finish the deed with the kingdom whilst he exhausted his nations wealth and manpower killing people who went even an enemy, even now we seeing wars that people are trying to justify as just, Russia, middle East, China also with Hong kong and it's plans for annexing Taiwan and a large number of people mostly natives call these people just not thinking of the millions who are going to loose their life ove it. \n\nThere's a reason why no nation made a stand of the Sorcerer kingdom decision to attack the Re-estize kingdom, they could see that their corruption was far from just. \n\nPlus ainz is the is one of the few rulers who want to build a kingdom where every sentient life form has equal rights to each other  and core exist, whilst the slane theocracy want's the complete opposite you see you don't even have to look far to my ealier points to get an answer from my ealier points. \n\nYou need t o also consider that the slane theocracy started a never ending war as old as Zesshi 100+ cause one of their personal got mol*st*d by the pig of an Elf king. \n\nI understand that the r*** thing is horrible but starting a 100+ year war and an international slave trade to all elves with most victims being children cause of the morality of their king when using kids in war, over a black scripture member who has killed tens of thousands if not 100 000s of people throughout her life,like why didn't they plan a grand assassination of the pig of a king, they had enough forces and material to resist and even tame a level 100 player. \n\nbut they had to envolve innocent civilians who either died or how we saw in season 3 were used as fodder or mules for the monsters, a cruel tactic which was almost implemented by the King of the East on the Angu goblin tribe which though they had brains traditions and tactic were fated to be used as emergency rations\n\nThe goal of the theocracy  was to destroy races such as goblins, lizard men, elves, even dwarves were hanging on a thread towards their desrimination, and many more races that even though showing sentience and intelligence to uphold traditions and pass knowledge down families and generations and also have the intelligence to out a floor gaurdian in battle tactics, farm fish, use magic weapons, learn writing and even communicate using the human language which is why they made guilds throughtout other nations as well. \n\nWith all these factors and candidates I see no Ainz as evil,He is just doing what humans are doing now, with atomic bombs and bio weapons stretched to the most. Our weapons are quite similar from the world items and his position now, If it's true that the corona-virus was ment to be a bio weapon you have proof of a world wide weapon there",
