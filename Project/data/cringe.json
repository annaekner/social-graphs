It doesn\u2019t need to be \u201cracist against ____\u201d to be something less then admirable.\n\nLook at people like Carlos Mencia who had a really shallow repertoire of jokes around his ethnicity, but man were they numerous. And his career did not last long, and a minute of research can show you a bunch of think pieces on why he was so damaging and arguably racist. Contrast that some one like Trevor Noah or Dave Chapelle or Bob Lang who frequently talk about their up brining, their race, their ethnic background, but are much more reflective and nuanced with the issues.\n\nFor example: he\u2019s got one joke about the methods we humans have for making rice. Dumbing it down into \u201chahaha Filipino mom taught me to make rice with the knuckle method, the Filipino people know what I\u2019m talking about\u201d is just a weird unnecessary generalization that doesn\u2019t even have a whole of accuracy. My dad taught me the knuckle method when I was like three, and he\u2019s grossly white. where as my friend whos mom emigrated herself from the Philippines had no idea what he was talking about\n\nIdk maybe that\u2019s a bad example but his jokes that were centered around \u201chow unique my experience is because of my background\u201d is just\u2026\n\nYou know what, I\u2019ll just say this: it\u2019s not funny. Maybe it\u2019s not racist, but it sure ain\u2019t an enlightened way of thinking and attacking comedy. It\u2019s not innovative, it\u2019s not new, it\u2019s stale, reductive, and derivative to the point of making people tired of hearing someone just talk about how different they are over and over. Which could be a counterproductive thing for race relations over all. \n\nBut hey idk shit, I\u2019m just saying I think the guy\u2019s done as much or more damage for Filipino culture (and specifically: everyone who wants to incorporate race into their sets) *before* he bombed then after.\n\nEdit: you know what forget everything i said and read what u/Kuyacyph wrote above: \u201cA lot of filipinos don't fw jo koy cause he makes being filipino the punchline of a joke instead of having genuine observations from within our culture. Compare his comedy to something like Rex Narette's SBC packer's bit where the humor is puns off of accent play that still presents a likable character that arguably is in on the joke\u201d\n\nBam, way more concise then what I said",

So much room in the audio.  Definitely needs some de reverb love and some compression. needs some EQ as well. \n\nVideo 4/10 - color isn\u2019t bad. Could use a little more balancing. The master shot is framed really strangely. So much head room. Bring that camera down a bit!  This makes sense as to why the boom audio is so spacey since it was framed out 2-3 feet above talent. Also, set design is pretty ugly. So much brown and that cross smack dab in the middle of the frame was definitely a choice. \n\nEditing 5/10 - decent timing here. I just wish there were some cuts to a close up or some reaction shots. A cut to her delivering the \u201cwatch what he\u2019s done\u201d line would help that hit harder. Also, give me a nice tight of the young man\u2019s reactions. He being \u201cschooled\u201d politicly. Need to see those gears turning and emotion on his face. That\u2019s no fault of the editor since it probably wasn\u2019t captured. \n\nSolid 3.5/10  Would not watch again.",

His inability to concede simple concepts like he might not like chess become ramblings on his reluctance to learn a zillion moves and how future AI and tech will eclipse the chess world. He\u2019s misunderstanding his initial premise that chess is a fundamentally simple game and that computer science has fundamentally used to build AI technology.  \nFlippantly dismissing the game because he came to a conclusion that computers will get better than humans shows his ignorance on the past three decades of work that has gone into this field from Deep Blue to Stockfish.  I would say that computers were already better than the average human back when Kasparov was battling it out with Deep Blue in the 80\u2019s but Elon\u2019s always got to prattle on about vague future tech to make himself look smart.",

It\u2019s about context and the idiot above was drawing an unnecessary and irrelevant correlation that has absolutely zero relevance to the subject matter. This entire comment thread is discussing Elon\u2019s assertion that chess is an easy game. In terms of difficulty level there is zero comparison between chess and Tic Tac Toe. Chess is a game that is \u201cunsolved\u201d in terms of gameplay and is extremely complex, Tic Tac Toe is a game that requires the strategy level of a 3-year-old and any dimwit can play.\n\nAn analogy to prove that both are games is completely unnecessary. Everybody knows they are games, nobody is challenging that. That dude really thought he was bringing something to the table by pointing that out. And you do understand that the term \u201capples and oranges\u201d refers to two things that are fundamentally different, right? That\u2019s what that means. Tic Tac Toe and chess are fundamentally different in their difficulty levels, that\u2019s the whole point of this discussion. To grasp at one single comparison - that they are both games, is pointless. You and him for some reason are so stuck on an irrelevant point and can\u2019t seem to move past it to get to the context of what this thread is about.",

A game that has held up over the centuries because it\u2019s considered \u201cunsolved\u201d in terms of gameplay. Elon claims the game is simple; it\u2019s not. Your dimwitted brain then thought to compare Tic Tac Toe, one of the easiest and least complicated game in existence to compare to chess.\n\nDoes that make sense or should I explain it like I would for a fetus?",

I was in love. it was wrong and you knew it!\n\nAt the time of the movies filming the actress that plays Marion was 30, but the novelization just states that she was 15 when their affair began. There is a transcript of the raiders of the lost arch story meetings. Its just brainstorming so not everything made it to the film, but here is where they talk about their relationship:\n\nLawrence Kasdan:\u00a0I like it if they already had a relationship at one point. Because then you don\u2019t have to build it.\n\nGeorge Lucas:\u00a0I was thinking that this old guy could have been his mentor. He could have known this little girl when she was just a kid. Had an affair with her when she was eleven.\n\nKasdan:\u00a0And he was forty-two.\n\nLucas:\u00a0He hasn\u2019t seen her in twelve years. Now she\u2019s twenty-two. It\u2019s a real strange relationship.\n\nSpielberg:\u00a0She had better be older than twenty-two.\n\nLucas:\u00a0He\u2019s thirty-five, and he knew her ten years ago when he was twenty-five and she was only twelve.\n\nLucas:\u00a0It would be amusing to make her slightly young at the time.\n\nSpielberg:\u00a0And promiscuous. She came onto him.\n\nLucas:\u00a0Fifteen is right on the edge. I know it\u2019s an outrageous idea, but it is interesting. Once she\u2019s sixteen or seventeen it\u2019s not interesting anymore. But if she was fifteen and he was twenty-five and they actually had an affair the last time they met. And she was madly in love with him and he...\n\nSpielberg:\u00a0She has pictures of him.\n\nIf you want to read more there is a Polygon article named \"Indiana Jones was an abusive creep (but he was almost much worse)\" which is where I got the information.",

If not human, then not inhumane.\n\n\n\n>let alone against the advisement of their god\n\nWhat? Religion was one of the major tools used to ***justify*** slavery... The Bible is full of talks about owning slaves as a normal thing, because it was when the Bible was written. And lines were cherry picked and interpreted to try and argue for why Africans weren't human. Same way the texts are interpreted how people want them to this day to justify all kinds of things including homophobia, and ignoring the parts that are cumbersome to their own lives.\n\n\nWhich makes it all the more tragic that the black community has so strongly adopted Christianity, a tool used to help enslave them.",

Secondly, I don't think calling the black patrons Afro-Americans did him any favors; although proper terminology, it's a little too PR and far removed from sincerity.\u00a0\n\n\nThe whole thing was bad news, and, him being a seasoned comedian and easily one of the faces of comedy during that time, he should have initially handled it better. All comedians will encounter heckling at some point, it's bullshit, and anyone worth their salt should handle it in stride. However, the event like this blew the closet doors wide open, and, although he was speaking off the cuff in his video, which is more heartfelt than reading from a script or paper, it should have been cooked a bit more.\u00a0\n\n\nHe tried what he thought was best and fell short, and, unfortunately, it wounded his career. Luckily, he's still finding work in a world where people get dragged worse/longer for less.",
