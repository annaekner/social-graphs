You can get away with a lot of flaws if a game is interesting.  We've seen that repeated over and over again.  But if your game is boring, dull, and uninteresting, nothing will fix that.\n\nWe've all heard the litany of issues, but for me, the problem was that the story itself was just dull.  I could almost excuse that if the side missions and exploration were fun, but they just weren't. The side missions were okay, I guess, but the exploration side is just sorely lacking.\n\nThere is nothing compelling you to explore.  All the procedurally generated locations are cookie cutter and once you've explored one of that type, there's really no reason to explore any further since the next \"abandoned mine\" or whatever is going to have the exact same layout and loot.  \n\nA locations in Skyrim and Fallout 4, and in all prior Bethesda games had some sort of backstory or reason for their existence.  They were unique and either tied into the story directly or added to the lore of the universe.  There was reason to keep exploring because it was fun to see what was going on at each site.\n\nWith Starfield, there is never anything interesting.  It's the same shit at every location of that type.  You can explore the marked locations, but those are a lot less common and very rarely compelling either.\n\nStarfield could have been something really interesting and fun, rather than bland and repetitive.  As it is, it turned out to be an unwise diversion of effort.  People are clamoring for more Elder Scrolls and Fallout.  Instead, we got *this*.  I don't think people are going to be yelling for more Starfield in a couple of years, but they'll still be demanding more Elder Scrolls and they won't get it soon because Bethesda wasted their time on Starfield.\n\nSorry, I realize I am being overly negative, but to say I was disappointed in this game is probably an understatement.",

'Why can't I make a base over there, why can't I land on the other side of this planet'.\n\nThe second option usually results in big expanses of cookie-cutter type environments. Here are the same 20 PoI's on different worlds.

And with no quick way to move around the planets and vast nothingness between anything of interest there was just no point.

Notice the military helmet with the physical plating covering the visor? That fits the description of the armor shielding upgrade. The other variations of that helmet fit the other upgrades as well. Those helmet models were clearly designed to visually show upgrades, but were repurposed to artificially bloat the very limited item list. My theory is that Bethesda didn't have anywhere near enough content for the game so they cannibalized everything basically at the eleventh hour. It's why the POI's all suck, why so many quests are so short and dumb, why the big \"faction quests\" all correspond to a starting origin, and why you can no longer visually customize armor or weapons.",

Not every location in space warrants a settlement in the first place.

Every region, every quest stands on its own. If we visit another world, it is carefully cordoned from interfering elements. The game is deliberatly designed to be played at short intervals. Investment in the setting is not rewarded, thus freedom ultimatly can not be rewared. As you do not build anything within the setting. All you do is fundamentally seperated from each and every interaction, quest or event.  \n  \nThey wanted features first. They did not check if those features were warranted or what kind of game they were going to make and if those features would make sense there. Its is merely checking a box on a list, not because it would benefit the game, but because \"space games\" as they understand them seem to have stuff like that and it makes great bulletin points for advertisment.",

No variation, even the placed loot is in the exact same spot every single time. The same skill magazines. The same terminal messages. Everything. I would've genuinely preferred randomly generated shlock. But instead, I saw the exact same Pharmaceutical Research site with the exact same people working in it four times in a row and realized this game was horribly shallow.\n\nIt's an incredible shame. The game was beautiful, it felt fun to play, but I realized I truly had seen literally everything already. Anything more was just aimless routine.",

You can get into his store through two different doors, and he actually sleeps, so the emergent gameplay of robbing him at night is possible.\n\nNone of the vendors in Starfield sleep so far as I'm aware.

What exactly are they measuring it by?\n\nSo the way Skyrim works, is that you have around \\~24 unique assets for each dungeon type. If you look really close, every 4 corners or so is exactly the same corner. This allowed them to create a ton of dungeons really quickly, but by playing with lighting, clutter, combos of (mis)placed rocks, the player never really notices unless you start up the creation kit or pay attention to it.\n\nIn Starfield, I think the quest  \"dungeons\" are all handcrafted. I might misremember, but most rooms/hallways in f.e. the mantis dungeon is unique and I haven't seen them used elsewhere. However, every other \"dungeon\" is just exactly the same dungeon. A research lab is a research lab, a hangar is a hanger. The second time it gave me a deja-vu, the third time I know the exact layout already. They where even too lazy to mirror the \"dungeons\".\n\nAlso don't forgot that you have a ton of ship assets which are handcrafted as well. Cities are also unique, instead of the same 3 longhouses repeated ad infinitum. So in that sense, it seems that there are more unique assets/3D models in this game. However, skyrim really used its limited assets well, while starfield is wasting them.",

They had objectives and tasks and samples to collect. They were also real people risking their actual lives doing something no one had done before.   \n\nCompare all this to Starfield. There's barely any planets which don't have a human made structure on them. There's really no sense that you're the first person to do anything in game. When you get onto a new planet, you *could* tediously scan rocks, animals, and plants, but there's no actual reward for doing so.   \n\nAnd to top it off, spend one real time hour on a planet and congratulations, you've matched in game hours to how long the first astronauts were on the moon. Spend about 3.5 real time hours and you've matched the longest stay on the actual moon.",

The number of planets makes little difference if they don't offer enough exploration fans expect and love from your previous games.",

There was also a strong adherence to realism in that game and you couldn't just screw around when the only thing protecting you from the vacuum was a few inches of glass and a space suit. It's a very humbling experience to come up on a planet or a moon that looks like a tiny spot on your ship's canopy only for it to become progressively larger until it fills your entire field of view, and when you finally stand on its surface it feels absolutely gigantic.\n\nStarfield has none of that because all you do is to click on a planet and watch a short animation of landing, and the surfaces of the planets are anything but empty. In fact, the density of man-made structures per square kilometre is almost comically large, because for every tiny square of the planet's surface that you land on, there's like half a dozen human bases all around you. The feeling that this creates is the exact opposite of loneliness because humans are literally everywhere in this universe, and you can't go to a place that wasn't already explored and settled. When I go to a remote system and land on some nameless icy moon, the last thing I wanna see is some crappy shack with a couple of people walking around it aimlessly, and with a table standing outside with some snacks and drinks strewn across it, as if someone was having a picnic... in a complete vacuum and sub-zero temperatures, lol.",

The sense of accomplishment when you finally make your first landing and plant your flag, collect a soil sample, run your goo experiment, and watch Jeb fall on his face after bunny hopping around is incredible. And even when that is over, you still have to get them home safe, which is not at all guaranteed and can result in more stories of trying to rescue your stranded Kerbals.\n\nAnd once you have been to the Mun, there are the other planets in the Kerbal system, which involves getting even better at the game, learning even more techniques to succeed. In Starfield, there is no journey or challenge to traversing the galaxy. You cannot ever get better at it, develop new skills as a player which allow you to reach new places which were previously out of reach. You just open up the map and click where you want to go.\n\nYou cannot have a sense of scale, of distance, without feeling like you are actually going on a journey.

Akila City is somewhat interesting to explore although it's a pretty confusing maze at times. New Atlantis is so sterile and bland and boring to roam around in that they added an extra fast-travel mass transit system on top of the regular fast travel system. Wander 50 yards outside of any of those cities, and it's basically untouched wilderness except for random isolated outposts every kilometer or so. There's no infrastructure or connections between any of it. Nothing that makes the planets feel lived on other than a big city that just somehow exists in the middle of nothing. It doesn't feel believable. \n\nAnd then the issue with the proc-gen content is that it's just done in the laziest way. Just straight up copy/paste of structures with basically zero variation between them. It's mind-boggling to me that they didn't include any kinds of systems to mix-up randomize the layouts and contents of the outposts.",

In the Death Stranding, you have a strategic goal - get to the point you are supposed to, you have a less strategic goal - develop the area around your path. Then you have tactical goals like delivering this or that, here or there, with some satisfaction from completing the mission or setting the new score record or something similar. And development of the area is visual, you can see and use the road you just helped to build and so on. And then there are also several mechanics that makes walking around less boring - with rains, enemies, somewhat complex mechanics of the landscape, balancing weight of the load and so on. So, the player has something to do all the time on all levels in the Death Stranding. In the Starfield we have a limited amount of air and some enemies in specific spots. And very simple landscape that can be navigated without much issues most of the time. And often there is no reason to really explore any particular area also. So, basically fewer goals, fewer things to do, less complex mechanics that make the process more interesting and challenging.",

Eve has been around so long with 20k players at any time of the day because they give a fuck about the product and not the bottom line.

How about paying attention to all the people that have taken their precious time away from gaming and telling you what their issues are on the discord and other platforms. BGS asked us to click the star to point out the issues, but they ignore all of it and give us the ability to eat?\n\nI have spent hundreds of USD in microtransaction in ESO, FO76 and enjoyed myself immensely.

When I landed and saw it was just another procedurally near-flat landscape in a different color, with the exact same POIs in the distance, that genuinely killed a lot of the sense of exploration I had at that point.

Compare all of Starfield's locations to the experience we get with, say Night City--arguably the greatest curated open-world landscape in any RPG.  We all want a huge world, but one that doesn't play on repeat.  CP2077 absolutely slam-dunked this idea.  I even reinstalled Skyrim and The Outer Worlds just to make sure I wasn't imagining things--and I wasn't.  Those worlds feel 10x better than what we get in Starfield.  Despite all the great things in Starfield, I feel this game is a bit of a step back for the genre, and that hurts when you fire up Skyrim for the first time in 12 years and realize how cohesive that world really is.",

People talk about this game being a good base for modding, but I don't want to play a game that's a template for the real game. \n\nIf Rockstar can make me care about a bunch of western stereotypes and treat them like real people, and Obsidian (using Bethesda's engine) can make me care about the politics and factions of their world, Bethesda should be able to make me feel something in a new IP where they have free rein to do whatever they want.",

So I get kinda get it. Even though this pattern has often been criticized as 'dumbing down' their games, I could see why they made a lot of those choices in those previous titles. \n\nBut Starfield feels like they've just kept going that path beyond the point where it makes sense anymore. It'd be like building a car where you took out the steering wheel and just replaced with with two buttons, one for turn left and one for turn right. Sure it's simpler to operate, but at that point you've made it so limited that it doesn't really function in the real world anymore.\n\nGame systems generally need a level of complexity to actually make them fun and give the player room to grow. Take any of the Mario 3D games. Moving Mario around is pretty intuitive and straight forward as soon as you sit down and start playing it for the first time and great for new players, but as you spend more time with the game you discover a whole deeper move set of double jumps and triple jumps and wall jumps and ground pounds and so on, and as you get further into the game it expects you to start figuring some of that stuff out. And then beyond the main storyline there's typically some 'end game' activities that require some pretty significant mastery of a lot of those skills for players who want to put the time into it. \n\nBut so many of Starfield's mechanics and systems feel like they're designed just for that starting out player. It's right there and you can get right into it, but then once you do it, there's no depth behind it. There's not much to learn, to practice, to get better at. Learning new skills is basically a binary on switch when you unlock something via the skill tree or a temple. And a lot of those skills really only serve to make tedious activities go by a little bit faster, they don't open up new parts of the game to you. \n\nI've gotten better at clearing out outposts of Spacers not because I've mastered some fun and interesting combat mechanics, but because enemies generally appear at basically the same place every time in the copy/paste structures and I've memorized them all, and because I unlocked a skill that's basically a wall hack. \n\nThe outpost building system is a big step back from what they put in Fallout 4. In FO4 I could build up almost anything I wanted from individual pieces of walls and floors and columns and so on. But in Starfield all I can do is plop down a handful of pre-built habs and then decorate them with some different objects. But there's way less room for creativity than FO4. I don't understand why they took such a big step back, other than some innate desire to continually simplify everything.",

So I remember a few games where I was having a knock out drag out fight on a two planet system, and then suddenly you realize - hey...that other planet seems to be getting really close. A split second later, the game is over, everybody dead, no more planets, no winners.",

There is just zero point in actually doing so because getting to them doesn't allow you to land or otherwise interact, and you just clip through.  But the whole solar system and even the stars themselves are moving and modeled. When you are standing on any moon or planet you can watch the other bodies in the sky moving.\n\nHere is a video about a boring ass flight from the orbit of Pluto to (and through) Pluto. Took 7 hour realistically: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3cHBEWN3xI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3cHBEWN3xI)\n\nThere is a mod that allows you to travel between planets. All it does it modifies the max speed so you can go insanely fast, so it isn't adding anything to the way solar systems are rendered or anything. Just your ability to travel within.  Modifying (increasing) speed is necessary because the base/vanilla speed of ships is actually insufficient to keep up with the speed the planets are orbiting, PLUS the actual distance things are apart from each other it'd take you days/weeks/months to travel.  But with a mod accelerating you to tens or hundreds of thousands of times faster than vanilla, you can make it and see the planets are really there. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtvOIBWFbt0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtvOIBWFbt0)\n\nHowever, you \"realize\" that without the loading screens no ships or planet surface waypoints load in.\n\nHonestly it's kind of insane that they modeled all of that (full solar systems orbiting) without the ability to land or actual-travel between (without a mod).  Your assumption that \"they are just pictures\" that don't actually orbit each other would actually make more sense in context of a game that 100% utilizes fast travel and loading screens.  I guess the orbital mechanics are just there to give us a good and accurate view while standing on a moon of the other planets/sun above?",

Coriolis Station Noob Hammers\n\nSome context here.\n\nSome Corolis type stations (They literally look like d20s) are equipped with structures that I do not know what purpose they serve, but they look like giant hammers. All stations in the game rotate to generate artificial gravity, and these giant hammer structures are on the perfect plane to maximize it.\n\nNow... A quick refresher or centripetal motion. If you put one point near the center, and the next point further out, the furthest point must move faster to stay aligned with the point near the center.\n\nThis means there's a looooot of energy on those noob hammers.\n\nSoooo. What sometimes happened is players would go to a station without knowing they are equipped with noob hammers. And will drop out of Super Cruise (In System FTL, kinda like Pulse Drives from No Mans Sky) to dock at the station at just the right angle they were in line with these hammers path.\n\nAnd the moment their ship decelates enough for them to control it... This shit happens\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NNh9rsyC6bk?si=4BJC_bjnnf9p4MbM\n\nAnd here's a second one.\n\nIn elite, you can increase your jump distance by flying into the jet cones of neutron stars and white dwarfs.

Because they are... Particularly dangerous in how massive their exclusion zones are. An exclusion zone is how close you can get to a celestial object before you're forced out of super cruise due to gravitational forces.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YQj53QKli4k?si=Hq3t0jJgUxBvjPkw\n\nAnd one last one.\n\nThis is a very interesting planet the community calls the world of death.\n\nThis planet orbits dangerously close to a neutron star. But what's more insane is that its path actually takes it through the jet cones.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4nxhxOANCj0?si=BnnXQs7VNQtYpbt_\n\nIf you're flying around in your ship, it'd kill you.

If so, you might want to learn the Home Epley maneuver! \n\n\"BPPV is caused by a problem in your inner ear. Your semicircular canals are found inside your ear. They detect motion and send this information to your brain. The utricle is a nearby part of the ear. It contains calcium crystals (canaliths) that help it detect movement.\n\nSometimes these crystals detach from the utricle and end up inside the semicircular canals. When these crystals move inside the canals, they may send incorrect signals to your brain about your position. This can make you feel like the world is spinning. This is called vertigo.\"\n\n\"Dr. John Epley designed a series of movements to dislodge the crystals from the semicircular canals. These movements bring the crystals back to the utricle, where they belong. This treats the symptoms of vertigo.\"\n\nhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/home-epley-maneuver#:~:text=The%20utricle%20is%20a%20nearby,your%20brain%20about%20your%20position",

Can the Unofficial Starfield Patch be used alongside the Starfield Community Patch, or is it a \"pick-one-or-the-other\" thing? It's been a while since I've played a Bethesda game (been playing Baldur's Gate 3 a lot), and I'm a bit rusty on which mods can coexist.\n\n***Arthmoor:*** It's more than likely going to be a one or the other setup. We'd obviously recommend sticking with USFP.\n\nNow, I have used some of Arthmoor's mods in the past (specifically the Pre-Skyrim AE Update version of Castle Volkihar Rebuilt,) and I am well aware of all the shenanigans surrounding him and his habits. I will say that I thought his answer to my question was rather civil. Do I hate the guy? No. Does he have habits that might need to be spoken about with a professional therapist? Quite possibly. Thank you all for listening. Now, if you'll please excuse me, I'm off to dig the SFCP out of storage.",

He may be a prick, but he is the prick that will be keeping the Unofficial Patch going throughout all the Starfield DLCs, all the Starfield Special Editions, and all the Starfield Anniversary Editions. We know this because that is what he did for both Skyrim and Fallout 4.\n\nWe don't know the same is true for the Community Patch. I wish them the best but they have no track record (that I am aware of) to fall back on in terms of keeping a singular modding project alive through a hundred releases. And if they do have a track record they should be publicizing it more.\n\nI personally am going to try to do without any patches or mods of any kind for at least another year or two. I really hope the Community Patch succeeds but I suspect the Unofficial Patch will always be the more popular one despite how people feel about the author.",

They didn't want them there... and they also don't make a lot of sense to be there. Like, there is one in Whiterun. If I was a resident of Whiterun during the Oblivion Crisis I wouldn't want to leave the Oblivion Gate untouched... I'd want it demolished. That goes for any Oblivion Gate that gets found.\n\nPeople asked him to remove the Oblivion Gates from the mod because they were lore breaking and immersion breaking and he got pissed.\n\nEventually, I think he made them optional... but yeah.

The issue was eventually fixed and the users who used mods requiring DAR rejoiced when the update came out.

Ive dealt with mods that add dumb shit i didnt download the mod for before (one mod that added spells in skyrim changed the daedric armor and it took ages to find out what it was to remove it. But removing it was easy once i found it.\n\nNow imagine something like that but nearly every other mod you have needs that shit mod for them to work. That means either you get rid of all those mods (and learn that nearly every popular mod relied on that mod so you have less mods to use) or you just leave the broom in your ass and accept that if you want to use the mods you enjoy, you need the stupid change you didnt want.\n\nNow imagine other modders see this and they release mods that remove the thing you hate so you can keep playing. The dick who added that shitty mod throws a fit and gets those other mods taken down. And says to you smugly \u201cif you dont like it just dont download the mod.\u201d Knowing what i said previously.\n\nSo the mod author might not do the same thing for this game. But if he does and its too late, then youll just need to hope youre ok with him deciding how your game will play. The community patch is a counter so something like that would be much less likely to happen.",

It means they are two different games now, and\u00a0 the unofficial patch team would have to support a whole new branch of the patch and re-add a whole slew of bug fixes they had removed before, just for a version that they don't play. Mods are also not supported on VR, and using unsupported means to modify the game is against their policy, because it can lead to more unanticipated bugs down the line. That's also why they waited for the ck to release their starfiled patch (the community patch used unofficial tools to release early). The unofficial patch is a huge endeavour : you have to gather reports, check the bugs, write the fixes, test the bug fixes... Many gamers are dumb and will report bugs with older versions of the patch, older versions of the game, cracked games and I believe they didn't want to add the inevitable reports from VR players using forked versions of their work. In the end they do it for free and I respect that they don't want other people taking credits for their work while multiplying their fake reports count. I wish the community patch team all the best but if they try to support everything on anything, their team is going to spend more time filtering garbage reports than fixing and playing the damn game.",

Sh__ like the saw movies sending flying cogwheels \"at you\" whilst you wore a crap pair of blue and red paper glasses lol... That was BAD. Like: I'd come out feeling carsick  and with a headache kinda bad. It was PURE gimmick. \ud83e\udd2e\n\nBut that tech has evolved a ton recently and I honestly think from a health perspective it could be so friggin good (and fun) to be able to punch a terrormorph in the face. A lot of people in office jobs sit on their as- all day in front of a laptop or PC. Would make a ton more sense instinctively if our \"fun time\" included a bit more mobility than that.\n\nAnd price wise I mean the Quest is like 200 or so these days? Which is WAY WAY less than the average pc build (that's obvs if it was able to run solo, I know a lot of the skyrim/fallout VR crowd tend to use it linked up to a PC bc of the mod availability and bc afaik right now neither of those run purely on the Quest alone? Someone correct me if I'm wrong bc I might be!). \n\nSo whilst I can see all those points as having been valid once, some of them are kinda moot these days? I'm  *cough* old enough that I remember parents outright dismissing stuff as video game = bad. And I think we've proven them wrong, very much so. So I just wonder if a general reluctance to VR is a bit like that same battle again? I dunno ig. Time will tell! :)",

Nexus being the big mod library means he just needed to kill Nexus mods he hated. They did his beck and call. The DCMA was actually because Nexus killed the mod people needed, and so they went to Dropbox. Nexus couldn't help, so he got creative.\n\nThat's the issue though. People have learned to hijack Nexus in a way that lets them run right over anyone they don't like, and arthmoor is the champion of this in Bethesda games. He changed everything, you don't like one thing? Too bad, Nexus removed your mod.\n\nBethesda only got involved once, and only because arthmoor changed something that would cost Bethesda money. Ironically the change did look like a legitimate bug. If  you look at it, it seemed like Bethesda made a fat finger mistake. They really just wanted to sell more dlc.\n\nBut Bethesda doesn't care if arthmoor or anyone else reigns like a tyrant in the mod scene anymore then EA does about the Sims.",

But no mod, especially a patch mod for the base game, is obligated to consider the impact their changes will have on other mods.\u00a0\n\n\nNothing at all?\u00a0\n\n\nHere's an example from starfield. When you confront a certain NPC in the Freestar questline you might end up in a fight with them. After the fight ends and you head back to the main town, two of the guards will start shooting at you. This has the potential to escalate into fighting the whole town if you misplace your shots or an explosive goes off. The reason these two random guards in town start fighting you is because they're assigned to the same faction as the guards you fight back during the quest, and you became hostile to that faction. Instead of being assigned to the faction the rest of the town guards are like they should be.\n\n\nIn Oblivion, say an ability gave you friendly status to animals. It would do that by making you friendly with the faction animals are assigned to. If one creature was left out due to a bug/oversight it wouldn't function for that creature.\u00a0",

The game said, \"this is an iron mine,\" when the NPCs and notes called it an iron mine. One of the village NPCs, in one of the jobs that Skyrim offers, will buy iron ore off you as though you've helped in the mines.\u00a0\n\n\nBut it was actually an ebony mine.

One to fix typos BUT NOT capitalization.\n\nThere's certainly a place for some splitting. Splitting the patch into separate files per main game and DLC, for example, so that users remain free to use or not use certain DLC. Or splitting between files for \"critical fixes\", \"cosmetic fixes\", \"consistency fixes\" and \"balance/exploit fixes\". But separate files for every little thing?

I know Bethesda menus get a lot of slack but fallout 4s pipboy was a joy to use as it was immersive, pretty quick, and expressive with lots of animations and fun details (the pipboy games were such a cool extra gimmick). I think starfield has a decent menu but inarguably a step back from fallout 4 in many ways.",

Or constant glare effects from the glass.  That's just bad game design.  I absolutely hate it when games use screenspace for effects. Vignettes, obstructing \"goggles\", oversized huds. Just awful from a design perspective.      \n\nWould have been the first thing I modded out of that was a thing.    \nFor many obstructing view breaks immersion. Like Metro's breaking gaskmasks, for a lot of people it made the experience less immersive and makes it feel like fighting with a UI instead of enjoying a game.",

                    "body": "In contrast to what people are saying about the roche limit, I actually think this is totally possible in a real life. We have a very real example of Mars' moon, Phobos, which is only 6,000 km above the surface of the planet (it literally takes up a fifth of the martian sky on it's closest days and the thing is freakin tiny) above the martian surface and only 18-22 km across and honestly doesn't have a unique density compared to the other moons in our solar system. It won't cross the roche limit for millions of years. \n\nA calculation of the roche limit on Earth in relation to the moon would allow for the centers of the 2 objects to be only 9,500 km, which would mean the surfaces are only around 2,000km, even if we are generous and allow 5,000-6,000 km for safety and other variables, this would look absolutely ludicrous from space since it would still be closer to the earth than the diameter of the earth is, and the earth is 81 times bigger than the moon with the moon only around 1.2%. Imagine if earth had a bigger moon, give it a moon big enough and dense enough, than that moon would collide with the earth before crossing the roche limit, this could almost certainly be done with other moons that already exist in the solar system. \n\nFor example, this would never happen to Pluto and Charon and they basically orbit each other they are so close in ratio. And would certainly collide with each other before one turns into a ring.\n\nSo if we have a gas giant that isn't super dense, maybe just a bit puffy (we have many examples of exoplanets that are about the mass of Jupiter but also far larger in diameter, even if most of these are this way because of how close they are to their star), and a fairly large moon. So if the ratio of the densities and the relation of the objects are good enough, I absolutely think this is possible even give how absurd it looks. not every moon is going to turn in a ring when it get's too close to the planet.",

In starfield I get off my ship and immediately get a frost bite at -10 and that just isn't possible even naked as the day I was born.",

They don't seem to understand temperatures, chemistry, and even - a problem in a space game - how simple orbital mechanics work. Spoilers for ECS Constant below  \n\n\n>!So the ECS Constant is supposed to be a huge generation ship (let's ignore the fact that it's too small for that), hanging out in orbit over Paradiso. Paradiso complains that it's a problem for tourism and they have to ROUTE FLIGHTS IN AND OUT OF THE RESORT VIA THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET TO AVOID TOURISTS SEEING THE ECS CONSTANT. WHAT? The ship would not be in a geostationary orbit, it would be going around and around the planet, not always on the same side. That's not how space works. And as big as such a ship would be, it would still be tiny compared to the size of the planet and you wouldn't need to go that far around a SPHERE to avoid anyone being able to spot it from a distance... And since we're at it: I was so excited when I realized it was a 200 years old ship I was about to walk through. Get to the bridge... And it has the exact same tech as the rest of the game world. EXACT SAME COMPUTERS. Running the same operating system. Same loot. Same random objects. So. Incredibly. Lazy. I felt so insulted. As insulted as I was that they decided to include Earth and... Well. We all know how insulting visiting Earth in Starfield is, from the people who brought us Fallout, no less.!<",

                    "body": "Anything resembling something even approaching the real thing would be tedious for anyone but the nerdiest of nerds.\n\nFirst of all, a pressure suit is a giant, human shaped bladder that\u2019s inflated to 3.5-4 PSI. It is extremely tiring to work in because the suit is constantly fighting you if you want to adopt any position other than the \u00b4rest\u2019 posture. It\u2019s also very bulky and offer limited mobility in the hip joint and the shoulders. So walking naturally is out of the question. Also, the gloves won\u2019t give you any good dexterity. So out goes the gunplay and much of the aerobatics. And forget about sneaking. Remember the inflated bladder thing we talked about ? Well if you bend your knees, the suit will pop you right back up. \n\nSecond, the thermal control would be easier to achieve. You just insulate against the outside conditions and just have to deal with the internal environmental conditions. Luckily, we have a steady source of heat inside the suit. A working, breathing human will output something like a 1000 btu/ hour. Just have to supplement this if it\u2019s too cold/ get rid of excess heat. Here we\u2019re assuming we do not run into material failure caused by extreme heat/cold conditions.\n\nPast mobility restriction, the single most problematic hazard for the low atmosphere world would be\u2026\u2026..dust. When you think about it, this dust is the result of countless impact, big and small, that crushed the rocks over eons. It\u2019s called regolith. It\u2019s very fine grained and sharp as it has not been eroded by water or wind. It\u2019s like sandblast on steroids. It\u2019s get\u2019s everywhere and will eventually abrade everything that come in contact with it. Add to that fact that this dust will not react like it does on good ole earth. Because there is no atmosphere, no fluid get between the particles to loosen them up. It\u2019s very cohesive and will seize any tight fitting parts if given half a chance. Those firearms would cease functioning as soon as they got any dust on them. The suits wouldn\u2019t fare much better. Seals, joints and latches would be trashed in very short order. The Apollo\u2019s PGA were thoroughly trashed after three 8 hours EVA.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not even talk about the obvious. A bullet ripping through the suit would probably be fatal even if it didn\u2019t hit your body. At least you would just go to sleep without realizing you\u2019ll die. An EMP frying your suit\u2019s electrical systems would also f*** your day up big time. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t agree with everything BGS did with the suits, anything close to RL, while probably providing a sense of danger, would hardly be conducive to the type of fast paced, gun blazing gameplay they were aiming for.",

The company that let's *that* logic fall through the cracks is beyond help.

And not a single motherfucker raised there hand and said \"Are you an idiot?\" That is some \"your scuba tank and rig don't let you breathe underwater\" levels of dumbass. Bethesda tried their hand at making their own IP and created a space sci-fi setting that spits in the face of every space/sci-fi that plays it. It ls worse than Cyberpunk was. Because even though cyberpunk launched like shit, and was full of bugs, atleast the fucking *writing* made sense. Cyberpunk was fixed with patches because the issues were technical. Starfield can't be fixed with patches because the problems are fundamental to the DNA of the game. They couldn't decide on what gameplay should look like, and clearly don't give two shits about gameplay mechanics making sense or *even being explained properly.*\n\nI was a gifted student in school. And I eventually just stopped trying and got by on the fact that everyone remembered me getting good test scores once upon a time. So take it from me when I say that Starfield is the pile of shit essay they wrote at the last minute just to say they did it, and they are banking on your remembering them as a good company and ignoring all the glaring flaws. They've gotten lazy, the games they make are shit, the only reason Starfield hasn't been completely dragged through the mud is because it came from Bethesda. I'm not afraid to say that Bethesda has been slipping since Fallout 4, and the success or failure of Starfield will be what decides if Bethesda tries to make good content again, or just turns into a content mill of generic action and payed-roleplay bullshit like Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, or Far Cry. Keep in mind this is the company that made a Fallout MMO *without NPCs.* They just don't give a fuck anymore.",

They didn\u2019t even bother formatting the name correctly in the subtitles. Like, to begin with, in my experience, biologists don\u2019t use scientific names when they\u2019re speaking to someone who is outside of that field because the person they\u2019re telling about this thing doesn\u2019t need that information and they\u2019re not going to know what to do with it anyway, unless they\u2019re trying to differentiate between two things that share a common name. There\u2019s only one thing called terrormorphs in this universe, unless I\u2019m sorely mistaken. If I start spouting off about *Pisaster ochraceus* when I\u2019m talking to a patron at an aquarium, they\u2019re going to look at me like I\u2019m stupid for expecting them to know what the hell that is. If I tell them to check out this cool ochre star, they\u2019re gonna get it. But on top of that, they used the naming conventions incorrectly by having both names in the subtitles capitalized. It\u2019s been a week since I experienced that and I\u2019m still upset about it. It\u2019s such a small thing but it was so much more upsetting than any of the other little type-o\u2019s I\u2019ve seen in the subtitles.",

The exploration of planets is especially egregious where there isnt even a vehicle to drive around a planet so you have to constantly run back and forth your ship and a randomized dungeon for the most part. \n\nIt's kind of pointless comparing two games like Starfield and Hi-Fi Rush; considering they are completely different genres and the size and scope of starfield is WAY beyond Hi-Fi Rush. But I personally think Hi-Fi Rush deserved game of the year because it's a finished, high polished product that is extremely well done and exciting.

Fine would have been in a different year, but with the incredible games we've had throughout the year like BG3 or Alan Wake 2 or Cocoon or Lies of P or Resident Evil 4 Remake, 'fine' is definitely not enough.",

Skyrim was a masterpiece, Fallout 4 was really good despite the lack of strong narrative and real choices, but Starfield is slow and awkward. It's just not a very good game.\n\nBethesda getting awards for making Oblivion's also boring space sequel is a testament to how meaningless these awards really are.\n\n\\#BetterThanRedfallAward",

Bethesda has lagged behind video game writing compared to its peers and starfield is riddled by poor premises.\n\nThe main quest is simply awful.  Like 2001 space Odyssey without the benefit of the writers and audience being on weed or lsd.  Simply bad.\n\nThe faction quests are also weak.  With GTA and RDR2 some of the most beloved video game franchise, and the youngs in the streets protesting over police brutality, the writers chose to make the factions...Space Cops?  \n\nYikes!  Even Ubisoft opts for Greek pirates, vikings, and revolutionaries.\n\nHowever, I believe many if not most of the critics are some of starfield's biggest fans.  They self-identity by complaining about the \"emptiness\" of the game.  The game is filled with not only empty calorie procedural stuff but the handcrafted content.  Mods and dlc will help, and I suggest people look at the empty procedural stuff more as a blank canvas then a design flaw.  The flaw was perhaps making it too accessible at this early stage.\n\nSo some notes:\n\n1) Mods may help.  One suggestion is modding the existing content to give the people what they want.  Privateer for the factions (tweaking the resale value of ships) and better pirates (big credit drops by raiding human settlements and boarding guarded treasure ships) are obvious.\n\n2) Expansions should base themselves more on grittier parts of human history.  Colonial period, wars, expansions, conquests, etc.  Think how powerful it was meeting neo-romans in fallout:Las Vegas.  There are plenty of more interesting things to bring from earth rather than just sanitized American history.  All additional factions should be awful and admirable - like our Tech bros or Imperial Rome (with its grand roads and architecture).\n\n3) Better end game and loot cycle.  You make an impossibly large  game and don't do the endless loot grind/reskin adversaries?  Why?  Cosmetic reskinning and numbers go up is super cheap.\n\n4) Some end game content should be exceptionally hard, and maybe even have roguelike elements with the challenge.  Nothing keeps engagement like a massive difficulty spike at the end with awesome rewards.  Gatcha games make massive amounts of money off of this principal of game design.\n\n5) More building content.  Fallout 4, sims, and city builders show some people will spend an insane amount of time building cool stuff.  Better yet, let them design awesome cities and submit them to Bethesda for public voting, to receive a nominal prize, a work for hire copyright contract, and automatic update to be shared with the broader community to fill in the emptiness.  Hand crafting cities and dungeons too expensive?  Cool!  Award people next to nothing to work for free.",

                    "body": "Not white knighting by any means (Starfield made me sad) but this is par for the BGS course. \n\nThe last genuinely good writing I can remember in a BGS game was the Dark Brotherhood in Oblivion. I cannot remember a single plot line from Skyrim because it was so utterly beige. In making it so the player can live out their fantasies however they like, they make it almost impossible to have narrative tension and stories with stakes. Every important dialogue has to have a \"nice\" variant, a \"mean\" variant, a \"medium\" variant, all of which have to deliver roughly the same player satisfaction outcome otherwise the formula breaks. \n\nThat is a *terrible* constraint to put on writing. The player must be able to play as whoever they like and the player can never be allowed to lose. \n\nDialogues, as a result, stop being dialogues. They're effectively quest checks that mark time as you move from one quest stage to the next.\n\nIt doesn't help that Bethesda for the most part don't make use of environmental storytelling, including dynamic environments (ie environments that change as story content requires), to deliver story information. So dialogues end up an awkward combination of info dumps that some other studios would deliver by showing the information in the world, and essentially pointless player participation just to get from one line to the next.\n\nThere's also the problem that with made up worlds, seen in all of BGS's games, it's very, very easy to invent the world on-the-fly as the plot requires it, rather than inventing solid ground rules FIRST that the stories must fit into. See most obviously Arena, for Bethesda, in which the entire universe of Tamriel etc feels like it was made up on the back of a napkin to provide plot filler, but even things like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, in which the ground rules were not properly elaborated between the Hobbit and Fellowship (the Hobbit then got retconned), but even within LOTR itself things shift to deliver a pretty abysmal deus ex machina at the end. When the rules of the game are not fixed, you end up with pretty crappy story shortcuts that feel cheap and unearned. \n\nThis has never been fatal before because BGS deliver by giving players myriad things they can do in any way they like. I think Starfield has just made apparent the inherent limitations for writing of the Bethesda formula because the open world gameplay aspect of things feels abnormally flat.",

The long term success they saw with Skyrim (which isn\u2019t even much better writing wise, showing how little they need to do improve) just isn\u2019t gonna happen with their current Mormon-adjacent approach. \n\nObviously they are making profit to some degree, but having a sustainable player base has just got to more lucrative right? \n\nTotally agree with the position that no mods or updates can fix bad writing. Nothing is going to change the god awful dialogue of their NPCs. This puts them in a situation where they have no shot of getting players back. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest at this point I\u2019m not all that invested in the success or failure of BGS, buts it\u2019s extremely interesting to talk about the how any why the quality of their writing is getting worse.",

I don\u2019t get it at all and yet people praise it. \n\nPeople shit on Starfields writing and I get why, but it truly doesn\u2019t feel any worse than other blockbuster games that I\u2019ve played. I\u2019m loving the hell out of Frontiers of Pandora for example and some of that is incredibly poorly written too.\n\nEdit: I want to add that curse words and being \u201cedgy\u201d does not make for \u201cgood\u201d writing.

Writing is crafting an engaging story where the characters go through arcs and experience situations that motivate them to act during the climax, which is often paralleled and foreshadowed by the aforementioned arcs. Starfield does this in droves. It might have some cheesy lines like I said, and you might want some more nuanced dialog options, but it's frankly just silly to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Also, those dialog options aren't meant to be what you're saying word for word, you're free to head-canon say anything you want. The dialog options are there to make it pretty clear how an NPC is going to react so you can make their response make sense for your character. This is why everybody wants silent protagonists from Bethesda, or at least so I thought.",

Primarily mechanical issues, while the art and quest design teams were working on the DLC.\n\nAs I understand, much greater changes would be required to similarly overhaul *Starfield*, and writing / rerecording dialogue probably wouldn't be among them. Many more major POI and a system for preventing repeats of any major POI in any given universe. Perhaps player discovery of content through in-system traversal and scanning.  Eliminating/shortening loading screens wherever possible. More options for non-combat resolution of quests, including persuasion and stealth. Viable combat alternatives to gunplay. At least one new companion with at best a neutral morality. And lots of flavor enhancers like open drug use or thugs in corners of Neon. \n\nI don't think the writing can be fixed, its part of the preproduction skeleton the rest of the game hangs on. And that poses huge problems for any future installments, as unlike ES or FO, I haven't seen any discussions where players came to love or hate the factions. One could argue about the merits of the Nord rebellion, Imperium, or Brotherhood of Steel, but the most I see about the UC Vanguard or Freestar Rangers amount to shrugs.",

They are unaligned fodder for you to beat the shit out of and loot without having to figure out some dodgy faction-related questions in doing so.\n\nFor example, you can be a \"bandit\" as a member of the Thieves Guild, but the bandits you come across like so much dungeon herpes are never consequential. There is no reason to not kill them, they are always hostile and unreasonable and not part of any quests.\n\nSpacers are the same. The most generic of bad guys to beat up, given a Reavers-from-Firefly ripoff story and dropped in your path. The very most interesting thing that can happen with Spacers is the result of The Mantis mission, but that gets old fast.\n\nI really kinda hate this practice in games, particularly supposedly immersive and story-rich RPGs. It's a pretty common sin. Bandits rarely ever just \"bandits\" in real life. They are typically little gangs that walk in the shadow of larger criminal outfits. For once I would really like to see random hostiles handled this way. Instead of finding a random group of nobody Spacers inhabiting an abandoned station, they could be a procedurally-generated Spacer Gang with a name. A microfaction. Take it a step further and give then faction relations and the ability to expand. It would be awesome to see a novel faction arise and become a force to reckon with in your game world.",

The issue is that you can reload and the writing is so shit that you can see the bad outcomes from a mile off. If there even IS a bad outcome, since Starfield is positively allergic to allowing the player to fail at anything or otherwise diverge from a very narrow path. That's always been true in their games, but NG+ really brings it into clear focus.\n\nAlso, NG+, by virtue of being the same character, means that you're gonna be playing the game in the same way again since you can't respec. It is, always, more mechanically interesting to play a new character because (since there aren't any story choices to make) the only meaningful impact you can have is mechanical via your perk progression.

Advances in every aspect of technology, but seemingly no need to house people. Is everyone a megamillionaire traveling the stars, or just sterile?\n\nBoth the resort board and the colonists act like oblivious hoarders - if the Constant colonised, say, on the opposite beach of the lake and established resource gathering, wouldn't they benefit from the resort bringing in trade and people? Similarly the board could hire new staff and get agriculture delivered by the local colonists instead of hiring and importing across the stars. And if it'd be more cheap to do that instead, why want the entire planet for themselves in the first place?",

From my experience there are only few that could justify it:\n\n* licensing costs\n   * E.g. if parts of the engine are not developed in-house. I doubt that would be the case for CE\n* legal\n   * Again, not a concern for CE\n* evaporating experience pool\n   * As in people with experience with the tech are becoming difficult to find. Again- unlikely to be a concern.\n* suitability for future projects\n   * If the stack is completely unsuitable for future projects, we could consider replacing it.\n   * However, this raises the question of why that project is being taken on?\n\nThe main problems I see with Starfield, seem to stem from design, more so than any technical limitations. I think Starfield could have been made to look and feel more like Cyberpunk- at the end of the day it's just a case of scripting, animations and some better writing.\n\nBut it wasn't designed to be that way. It was designed to be easily made with the existing pipelines BGS already has, and to be easily marketable.",

Like I said, I enjoyed Starfield but this team needs a fire lit underneath them. 76 got put out and was absolute trash. I know it has a community and people like it now but lets not forget the release and overall what its there for which is money. They spent years also just throwing skyrim masters everywhere hence the memes.

And in my opinion if you are getting it probed its because you like it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProstate exams, specifically digital rectal exams (DRE), are becoming less commonly recommended as part of routine prostate cancer screening due to concerns about their accuracy and the availability of better screening methods. The primary reasons are:\n\n\n1. PSA Testing: The Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) blood test is now preferred because it can detect prostate issues more reliably than a physical exam. High PSA levels can indicate prostate cancer or other prostate conditions, although it\u2019s not foolproof.\n\n\n\n\n2. Inaccuracy of DRE: Digital rectal exams have been found to have a lower sensitivity in detecting prostate cancer compared to PSA testing. This means that a DRE can miss cancers that are in early stages, leading to false negatives.\n\n\n\n\n3. Potential for Overdiagnosis: Routine DREs, combined with PSA tests, can sometimes lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of slow-growing prostate cancers that may not have caused harm during a man's lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent guidelines, such as those from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), emphasize shared decision-making around PSA testing and place less emphasis on DRE unless a patient has specific symptoms or risk factors.",

Considering how many locations and other things there are, thats a really dense map. \n\nIf we assumed that that amount of content is the limit for Bethesda (after all, I dont think Starfield has that much more raw content (i.e. assets, items, quests, etc.) than fallout 4), would it really be better if everything was spaced further apart?",

Make areas that require either vehicle travel to get to quickly and safely or foot travel to really drag the process on and put them at risk of whatever dangers are (more) easily bypassed with a vehicle. This will discourage people from venturing into advanced areas, but still leave the option open, should they feel adventurous. How cool would it be to have a vehicle break down or run out of fuel in a dangerous area? It would give the game a whole new element of survival. \n\nI\u2019ve recently been playing the 2015 Mad Max game and I love the feeling of being so exposed when you get out of your vehicle to salvage some roadside scrap. You\u2019re stooping down to pick up something\u2026 and suddenly you hear the sound of an engine approaching. You run back to your vehicle and peel out just before the crazies are upon you! It\u2019s a cool, immersive feeling!",

                    "body": "I liked the game, but it can be greatly improved. I am sure folls at Bethesda are working hard over this game, and I just wanted to add a few things that I personally feel can improve the experience greatly -\n\n1) Perk trees need to be redesigned. Some trees are not worth the cost. Fast reloading should not take a 10 point investment. Crafting sights, spacesuits or weapons should not be hidden behind Perk trees, atleast the initial levels should be free.\n\n2) Decorations should cost money, not resources. It worked in fallout because there was no functioning economy as per lore, but Starfield should not have this issue. Habs / power sources makes sense, decorations do not. Also better beds / chairs / TVs should not be locked 10 points behind a perk.\n\n3) POI generation - every planet does not need to have 5 ships landing near you, or have some cryo / robotics lab. And also it would.be great if the interiors are randomised, instead of experiencing the same 3 layouts over and over. Some POI's which were rare made me appreciate them more just because they were rare.\n\n4) A difficulty revamp. Story and medium are fine (albeit a bit too easy !), hard has way too many bullet sponges. I would prefer to fight a larger group of enemies than fighting 1 dude having 5 bars of health\n\n5) Actual survival options, it is odd that suit resistances amount to nothing. More brutal worlds would make exploration a lot better.\n\n6) Interplanetary flight / system jumping should be a lot smoother. We should be able to fly between planets of the same system (perhaps some sort of a cruise speed depending upon your reactor?). Loading screens in general could be reduced, no need to wait for airlocks and then encounter a loading screen.\n\n7) Instead of a cutscene, let us experience the entry / exit from atmosphere when landing / leaving from a planet. We can already see it when playing a few missions or when we board a ship about to take off, and it looks cool to boost away from the surface into the sky.\n\n8) A 40 FPS version for Series X. Please I beg you it would make this game play and feel 100x better just with VRR.",

The same cave, mining facility, helium factory, etc should not be the same exact thing on every planet, let alone on the same planet. It is extremely lazy, there is much more wrong with the game but this is my biggest critique. Id also like to know if you were rushed to release Starfield because of Microsoft shareholders or have you just become lazy because of the silver spoon in your mouth & thought it was perfect as is? I really wanted to enjoy Starfield, on paper it seems like it could be a g.o.a.t RPG. All your updates don't seem to address much in fixing what's truly wrong with the game. Why did you underutilize the physics engine so much too? There's a lot under the hood from what I've heard from my friends that mod your games but it's barely been tapped by you the people that created it. I'm willing to wait a couple of years to see if you can actually attempt to make Starfield a good game, if not I'm gonna just boycott the shit out of es6 & ive been a fanboy since Morrowind and aware of bethesda since daggerfall. I'm aware that this comment is partially undirected to what this post is about but I've been waiting for an opportunity to say this to Bethesda and not a stranger on the Internet",

Touch down in the predetermined landing zone for your main ship, and then take off in your 2-person shuttle to fly around. In my head, they would work a lot like the shuttles in Firefly. Add a scanner to that and all of a sudden it's useful for traveling to POIs, finding locations for outposts, joyrides, whatever. Let NPCs use their own, and now you've got dogfights above some enemy bases before you invade on ground level, or sneak in without raising the alarm so they don't launch their shuttles.",

But how long before that happens?\n\nIt wasn't like Elder Scrolls or Fallout where I felt like I wanted to get back in as soon as I was done with a playthrough, or start many new characters with different play styles. It's clear Starfield will never be that. I couldn't make myself do more than one NG+ in Starfield. Something is fundamentally wrong with the game that doesn't sound like any of these updates would address. It doesn't make it a bad game, but it also doesn't make me care about a few minor updates over a vague timeline.",

However, I do hope you continue to provide regular updates as promised.\n\n- The expansion of game features is great, but there are still game-breaking bugs to address as well. I have a random \"Locate X Trait in Y System\" that won't clear even though I have 100% on that system. Also, my Operation Starseed is broken with \"All Doors Inaccessible,\" so I can't continue the quest unless I side with a faction I do not care for on my current chBethesda!\n\n\n- Rovers. We. Need. ROVERS. It's just too time-consuming running so much to POIs while mapping worlds. It gets very repetitive very fast. I know this may also mean expansions for the ships to carry the rovers, but yes we need rovers. \n\n\n- Why is LIST nowhere to be found outside of just a few measly side quests? You find an old installation and it's intricate and winding and has 20-40 Fleet/Spacer/Ecliptic. Every damn time. But you find a civilian outpost and maybe it has 2-4 people at most. So the majority of the galaxy is settled by criminals just using old facilities? Why couldn't LIST use these old military and science outposts to set up little colonies with 1 or 2 radiant quests? Why couldn't LISTers settle into these abandoned/deserted/forgotten facilities? Just seems like repeating POIs were wasted on enemy-infested death traps rather than random little communities among the stars. Would certainly help to make the galaxy seem less barren.\n\n\n- Any way we could logos, flags, and decals for ships and outposts? Would love to use them to give each outpost a different theme, particularly in terms of the factions.\n\n\n- Any way we could get a skill or function that lets us pickpocket equipped clothing? My good character hates the thought of luring guards around corners, then save scumming until the RNG drops the outfit once I kill the guard.\n\n\n- Also, can we link together the non-resource containers? I pocket a lot of loot and would like my full containers to automatically fill the next available as my coffers increase.\n\n- Melee weapon mods, please! Speaking of mods, the ability remove and transfer mods between weapons would be CLUTCH!\n\n\nThis game has a LOT of potential. I'm looking forward to see what comes next for it, and I hope you listen to player feedback to create an experience everyone can enjoy. Thanks, Betheada!",

I also still don't have a ship services tech at Cydonia.  So in a game with only 4 major settlements, 2 of them are functionally broken in terms of swapping or repairing ships.\n \nMy play-through also still has a broken ECS Constant, which is still parked in orbit around Porrima something because someone spouting Yiddish can't find a letter in a room with all of 10 objects in it.  I suppose a non-moving ECS would be easy to find, if that quest ever became playable.\n\nThere is still the laughable bug where if I have 10 ships and  board another that has foolishly landed near my piratical heart, the thing can take off as soon as I'm through the hatch and the Klaxon sounds.  I still go through the motions of killing the crew only to find I am stuck in space forever; doomed to die of hunger after a bout of cannibalism because I can't take over the ship due to the annoying 10 ship limit.\n\nThere is still the stupid broken phased time Starborn power that never ends, with the only fix being to quit the game entirely and restart it and reload from a save.\n\nShips are still broken in the sense cargo containers and weapons can twist out of alignment at odd angles and auto turrets just have a mindless sense of where they should be pointed when 'parked'.  Turrets are also messed up in the ship builder so they spawn at right angles to a ships centreline so one can be placed on a weapon mount because it's facing away from a nearby module, but the other in a pair can't be placed in the mirror position because it's stupid sideways alignment brings it into conflict with the same adjacent module, forcing you to find a non-symmetrical alternative mount point.\n\nI still have to save the game and reload from the save every time I arrive at an outpost with crafting benches and want to use any of them because they are \u2018blocked\u2019.\n\nWhat else?  Oh, yes, ships that refuse to land on a giant landing platform with ship builder at some outposts, and force you to hike, but are fine landing on the same thing at others, and often they\u2019ll land on the smaller size pads, just to rub it in.\n\nThey haven\u2019t patched the nonsense at Titan where the stupid land and spawn outside mechanic, which I hate!, has you spawn underneath your ship with no way to get out because crouch isn\u2019t really a physical model crouch as it is in other games, just a shift of the camera position.\n\nUpdates and bug fixes should work on existing play-throughs and shouldn\u2019t require starting the game from scratch.  This game is still buggier and more annoying than the first iteration of Cyberpunk.\n\nHappy New Year, Bethesda.  Perhaps this will be the year you finally fix what I stupidly paid \u20ac80 for on pre-order.",

By that time better games will also have DLC like BG3 and CP77 not to mention the new games dropping in 24. Mods will not save this game and niether will the modders. Skyrim was BGS peak and they will never be that studio again. Truth hurts and now they're trying to ruin Skyrim, a ten year old game with their stupid creation store.",

Bethesda dungeons have always been fun and unique. Now, we have the same exact location on hundreds of planets, with the same exact clutter and the same boring fights. Explain how I can be immersed when the moon of earth has the same exact cave as a planet that is many lightyear away?\n\nWhy create an endless gameloop that doesn't have any replay value? After getting to ng+, the only thing to look forward to is faction missions because they were actually good entertainment. After playing them once and knowing the story, they aren't very fun a second time, though. Temples could have been cool if they weren't all exactly the same thing. You could have made less and made them puzzle dungeons like Zelda or something.\n\n You guys dropped the ball big time on this game. I've been a fan since Morrowind. Starfield makes me not want to spend another dollar on a Bethesda product as long as I live.  I won't blindly buy another game or dlc until I see all of the reviews, which I've never done for Betheda games before out of confidence that the product would be worth it. \n\nThe AI responses on reviews are also terrible decisions. Who thought that was a good idea? Why are you guys being so condescending to players who have trusted you for years? It's not your place to decide if people like your game or if it's a good game overall. This is for critics and fans to decide. No one cares how hard it is for you guys to make a game. Other devs have issues, too, but they put out a competent, connected, and well developed game. \n\nClean your act up, Bethesda. A lot of people are disappointed in you right now. It's been getting worse and worse since Skyrim.",

So much invaluable input and data they could have leveraged to make one of the best games ever.\n\nAnd, their main excuse is linked to this statement:\n\n>Emil Pagliarulo  \n>  \n>u/Dezinuh  \n>  \n>(9/15) See, I never knew this before, but if nothing else, video game development is a series of concessions and tough decisions. There's that perfect game you WANT to make... and then there's the game you CAN make. Sometimes, if the gods smile on you, those two are very close.  \n>  \n>8:47 AM \u00b7 Dec 13, 2023  \n>  \n>\u00b7  \n>  \n>17K  \n>  \n>Views  \n>  \n>Emil Pagliarulo  \n>  \n>u/Dezinuh  \n>  \n>\u00b7  \n>  \n>Dec 13  \n>  \n>(10/15) But in order to get there, in order to get it as close as possible to the vision, the team has to push itself harder and harder... often while dealing with devs being shuffled around (or leaving), looming deadlines, and creative decisions you wish you didn't have to make.\n\nRather than listen to the community and their customers, admit they fell short, and commit to continuing to work toward achieving the perfect game they wanted to make, they are whining, deflecting, and blaming the community and customers for being ignorant/stupid about the industry and game development.\n\nWorst of all is how they seem to completely disregard that it doesn't matter what they set out to make if the experience is not enjoyable for the players. That's the only thing that matters: the players enjoy playing the game. You can't achieve that by ignoring the players or blaming the players.\n\nAs if other studios haven't/aren't serving as great examples of what Bethesda SHOULD be doing to overcome the negative feedback.  I know, everyone keeps pointing to Larian. But, for great reasons.\n\nFollow Larian's example if you want to see an end to the negativity.\n\n* Be great listeners\n* Be open to criticism and feedback\n* Be communicative and transparent about the shortcomings and what is happening to improve the game\n* Don't blame the community or customers\n* Don't be needlessly defensive\n* Demonstrate you care through your actions and be as active as you can be in pushing updates and share news about what is happening behind the scenes\n\nLarian is continuing to listen to their community and customers, despite winning numerous awards, including game of the year. They are constantly pushing updates and positively working to improve the game. They don't need to be doing shit at this point.\n\n\u2014-\n\nReposting\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nA few things that make the game feel unfinished, since I haven't played much after reaching about mid-game (120 hours) and getting frustrated\n\n* Environment systems and their counters not properly working or having any meaningful impact (this includes spacesuit systems/traits, aid items, etc)\n* Food item mechanics make no sense and have no meaningful impact in the game\n* All your companions sharing the same opinions when commenting/engaging with you post key quests\n* Different Habs are useless \n* No meaningful faction mechanics\n   * No impact on the world or story--you can join them all without any differences or consequences or benefits...big and small.\n   * small eg: I have earned a badge...I can't use it to influence any interaction\n* You have brigs, jails, and non-lethal weapons and you can't take prisoners\n* Extremely limited outpost system that looks like a beta test run of what Fallout 4 provided us\n* Low impact or outright meaningless role-playing impact linked to your key traits picked during character creation\n* You get a few interesting dialogue options from time to time but this almost never leads to a unique outcome. It's just another way to arrive at the same cookie-cutter conclusion you would arrive at without using that option.\n* Extremely limited role-playing options regarding quest and dialogue outcomes\n   * I can't think of any unique outcomes\n   * You can kill\n   * You can attack (subdue without killing...if you have the right weapon...which the game almost always treats as the same as killing)\n   * You can persuade/intimidate but, each of these options often leads right back to the above due to the game being on rails and disregarding your own player agency--like the Hope mission.\n   * I just played the mission where you steal an artifact. I didn't want to steal it. I didn't want to use violence. But, because I asked the dude for a tour and then talked with him at the artifact I was then locked into violence because the NPC would not walk away/back to his post.\n   * There are almost no grey area options or unique options and outcomes (compared to other Bethesda games...not even making the BG3 comparison)\n   * There are so many examples of this in the game.\n   * There is no good reason to replay the game to try new builds, new playstyles, or experience new outcomes by choosing different questline paths\n* POI generation system is garbage and repeats the same stuff in almost the same combination without any meaningful diversity to make them unique and exciting\n* The procedural generation system is garbage\n   * It doesn't have any meaningful rules set to avoid endless immersion-breaking outcomes\n   * Why is there a campsite resembling one in Wyoming on a moon that is 400c?\n   * Why are there no dynamic landscapes where you can land?\n* There is no easy way to see a list of the planets you have or have not visited and the locations you have been/learned about (basic UI stuff)\n* Water and swimming are worse than in Morrowind\n* Melee mechanics are worse than Fallout 4 and there is an extremely limited pool of weapons\n* Companion interaction is garbage\n   * Why can't I command them? (Skyrim, Fallouts)\n   * Why can't I set their tactics? (New Vegas)\n   * Why can I marry them so easily?\n   * Why are they all so horny for me without me doing anything to build up toward that?\n   * Why is the wedding ceremony so weird and ignores the in-world context the game established between these characters?\n\nWhat's next would be finishing the game.

It's also a real struggle to fiddle with perk points to balance between being functional in combat and being able to craft.\n\nI would like to set forth a pedantic quibble. Interplanetary distances are still astoundingly vast. The moon is a 3 day journey for us irl. If we say 150 km/sec is an average top speed for a ship's in-system thrusters in the game, then it would take 43 minutes to get there. As annoying as a cut screen is every time, spending literal hours just pointing at a body and going towards it would be infinitely worse.

Why the odd black-and-white animation, every time? Same with takeoff and landing. Even absent seamless atmospheric player-controlled takeoff and landing (like NMS), I think the unbroken consistent perspective would do a lot for immersion. Another one I've seen mentioned a lot is grav jumping - the screen fades to white, then black loading screen, then fade from white... surely we all see why this is silly, and what could be done to fix it. \n\nI wonder if the reasoning for these decisions was technical, or from a deign philosophy standpoint.",

If they still let you buy resources to start a basic He-3 outpost, Jemison's moon has that. Load up on fuel tanks, or put the He3 in cargo if they let you move it directly from cargo to the fuel tanks. Then you can go quite far in the Frontier even before upgrading it.\n\nIf they add vehicles like people want, then ailments and temperatures will be an afterthought because you won't be exposed much except when going from your vehicle to inside the POI. Making all 5 of the ailment cures is also pretty easy, and those are light (and cheap).\n\nSurvival is going to be pretty hard to get right considering we're in a high tech civilization with unlimited resources.",

The specialized habs were to parallel settlement stores in FO4 so you could assign people to them and they'd work just like you're describing for general goods (storage bay), health items and healing (medbay), food items (mess hall), and weapons/ammo (armory). \n\nThat would also make having a crew of 8 make more sense, so 4 could be dedicated ship crew and 4 to man the \"stores.\"\n\nThere might have also been the idea that you don't get the benefit of ship weapons specialists unless you have a battle station hab, engine/drive specialists require an engineering bay, etc. \n\nThat seems like the most likely explanation as to why those specialized habs exist; they were designed for gameplay elements that got \"pruned\" in the rush to market. Maybe they'll get built out in an update down the road.",

Point being that realistic river systems would require more in depth land generation where all the small tributaries combine into stream, into rivers, into rivers that combine and flow into the ocean.

The water is cleaner underground than that exposed to the surface, and usually available in much larger quantities. So it's way less important to build next to a river as you'll likely not use that for potable water. Humans today don't really use rivers for potable water anymore either, mainly just for transportation these days. Take for instance, the Mississippi River, most of the river is polluted beyond the levels that make even fish edible by EPA standards. Same with the Neuse River in North Carolina, there's so much industrial waste dumped into it that nearly every town has stopped collecting potable water from it as the waste levels are too high to make it safe.",

But I'm just not a fan of characters who do so much almost entirely alone. It feels cheap, and plot-armor heavy. And unreasonable (because unrealistic isnt the right word tbh). Halo Reach is by far my favorite game because it's not like that. I know master chief has help sometimes but mostly it's just him.\u00a0\n\n\nThe arguement can be made that some of my favorite games are like that to a degree, but it's all about scale for me. Yes, one man can take on most of rapture, assisted. But one man taking on entire alien armies / worlds over and over is a bit much. (I know he has Cortana but she doesn't help him actually fight.)",

With the addition of chief having a real team with him that would have definitely added some extra depth to the story and overall immersion. As for him not having that introduced I believe has a lot to do with the first game being a \u201csolo\u201d game and it was originally supposed to be a top down shooter but changed it to a first person partially through development. Overall tho I agree with you and that with chief actually having his team with him would have made coop and the story much better in turn.",

In this case, the player is explicitly allowed to build a ship where the center of mass is empty space. It's also the game working normally for enemies to always target center of mass rather than, you know, an actual piece of the ship. Does this kind of break the game in the player's favor? Yes, but everything is still working as designed. \n\nAn exploit is when the player finds something that *isn't* working the way it's supposed to and uses it to their advantage. Like the ship design bug where you can attach sections that by all rights shouldn't go together, but the game breaks a bit if you flip them around enough and allows you to do it anyway. \n\nSo this is cheese.",

Nightmare. \n\nI'm in charge of the performance management group. I'm the bad guy looking at all the projects to decide who's fucking up. But because I'm not a complete idiot, I make things fair, and I work it from the \"help me help you\" angle. If I do my job well, they do their job better. Everyone wins, everyone gets to claim more accomplishments at review time, no one gets their contract terminated because they forgot you're supposed to have a functional project management plan. That way people understand the metrics and are willing to play ball. \n\nNone of them. Not one of these professional teams. Not one can agree on what a bug means. It blows my mind. \n\nSo now I have to waste time running around between six groups trying to get everyone to get off their high horse, accept that there is no industry-standard definition, and just play the game the way we set the rules.

                    "body": "I've written it up more than once. The entire premise of \"Earth got fucked three ways from Sunday because fantasy science\" that's given in the game, and *contradicted* in the game's own story, is basically total horseshit, as is the whole \"we only got a few million people out\" thing.\n\nSolar winds *wouldn't* turn Earth into a sandball in only 200 years, and in fact couldn't at all without some *serious* celestial fuckery like meteorite strikes.\n\nThe atmosphere isn't held in place by the magnetosphere (the thing early Grav Drives destroyed), but is rather held in place by *gravity,* which the Earth still *has.* It wouldn't vent into space.\n\nPlant life would basically be fine without a magnetosphere. In fact, so would fauna and humans for *hundreds* of years because *the fucking Ozone layer exists*. Really all that would change without a magnetosphere is that the Ozone layer would slowly be stripped away, causing higher levels of solar radiation, but humanity *already, today,* has the technology to largely mitigate this.\n\nDoubly so, *some* plant life would actually *thrive* at higher radiation levels, since some plants grow much, much *better* in lightly irradiated zones, meaning that increased solar radiation would be *totally fine*.\n\nBasically, the atmosphere would continue being generated so long as photosynthetic plankton still exists as it accounts for *50%* of all oxygen generation for our breathable atmosphere. Plankton *is* sensitive to UV light, but for as long as the Ozone exists, that's pretty much a non-issue compared to their vulnerability to microplastics, which is likely to kill them off *way* faster than the loss of the magnetosphere and subsequent damage to the Ozone layer. Hell, they'd stick around *even longer* since back in 2004 it was discovered that plankton is actually able to influence weather patterns and generate cloud cover to protect themselves from UV light.\n\nEarth had *50 years* to evacuate. To be clear, that's *three generations*, with the first two being adults by the time the third's time runs out. That *entire time*, not only did humanity have off-world colonies, but also access to fully liveable planets *and* prefab technology ***and*** Grav Drives. The UCS Constant left *before* Grav Drives were invented, meaning that human spaceflight and FTL travel was not only *possible*, but also *perfectly capable* for *50 fucking years*, wherein they actively *chose* to do nothing and not evacuate because all of humanity was holding an idiot ball for literally no reason.\n\nThere's more, but frankly, the entire setting is a flawed premise based on bad science and explained with completely nonsensical plot holes, which are then *totally ignored* so that a completely detached story about multiverses and space wizards can happen. Even Elder Scrolls lore makes more sense, and the lore of TES is *very literally* \"The entirety of reality is the dream of a dying man in a coma. Oh, also, aliens exist, and they're not part of the dream, but they still showed up here for some reason, and the coma guy's family and friends are actively trying to kill him for various reasons, so everything is basically pointless because it's all a dream\".",

                    "body": ">Bing did have some thoughts on the matter:  \n>  \n>*That is a very interesting question. The Van Allen belts and the Earth\u2019s atmosphere are both important factors that protect the pyramids from various forms of damage. Without them, the pyramids would be exposed to more intense solar radiation, cosmic rays, meteoroids, and temperature fluctuations. These would accelerate the erosion and deterioration of the pyramids, making them more vulnerable to collapse.*  \n>  \n>*It is hard to estimate exactly how long the pyramids would last without the Van Allen belts and the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, as there are many uncertainties and variables involved. However, based on some assumptions and calculations, we can try to make an approximate guess.*  \n>  \n>*One of the main threats to the pyramids would be the increased solar radiation, which would heat up the surface of the pyramids and cause thermal expansion and contraction of the stones. This would create cracks and fissures, weakening the structure and allowing water and sand to enter. The water would freeze and thaw, causing further damage. The sand would act as an abrasive agent, wearing away the surface of the stones. According to one study, the average erosion rate of the pyramids due to solar radiation is about 0.02 mm per year1 Without the atmosphere, this rate would be much higher, as the atmosphere blocks about 70% of the incoming solar radiation. Assuming that the erosion rate would increase by a factor of 3.3 without the atmosphere, we can estimate that the pyramids would lose about 0.066 mm of their height per year due to solar radiation alone.*  \n>  \n>*Another major threat to the pyramids would be the cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles that originate from outer space. Cosmic rays can damage the molecular structure of the stones, causing them to lose their cohesion and strength. The Van Allen belts and the atmosphere act as shields that deflect and absorb most of the cosmic rays, reducing their intensity by about 99.9%. Without them, the pyramids would be bombarded by cosmic rays at full force, which would have a significant impact on their durability. According to one estimate, the cosmic ray flux at the Earth\u2019s surface without the atmosphere and the Van Allen belts would be about 10\\^4 particles per cm\\^2 per second. Assuming that each particle causes a damage of 10\\^-6 cm\\^3 to the stone, we can estimate that the pyramids would lose about 0.1 cm of their height per year due to cosmic rays alone.*  \n>  \n>*A third major threat to the pyramids would be the meteoroids, which are small rocky or metallic objects that orbit the Sun. Meteoroids can collide with the Earth and cause impact craters, which can damage the pyramids if they are close enough. The atmosphere and the Van Allen belts help to reduce the number and size of the meteoroids that reach the Earth\u2019s surface, as they burn up or break up in the air. Without them, the pyramids would be more exposed to meteoroid impacts, which could cause severe damage or even destruction. According to one estimate, the average meteoroid flux at the Earth\u2019s surface without the atmosphere and the Van Allen belts would be about 10\\^5 particles per km\\^2 per year, with an average mass of 10\\^-3 kg and an average velocity of 20 km/s. Assuming that each particle causes a crater with a volume of 10\\^3 cm\\^3 to the stone, we can estimate that the pyramids would lose about 0.01 cm of their height per year due to meteoroid impacts alone.*  \n>  \n>*A fourth major threat to the pyramids would be the temperature fluctuations, which would be more extreme without the atmosphere and the Van Allen belts. The atmosphere acts as a blanket that moderates the temperature of the Earth, keeping it relatively stable and comfortable. Without it, the temperature would vary widely between day and night, and between seasons. The Van Allen belts also help to regulate the temperature of the Earth, as they reflect some of the solar radiation back to space. Without them, the Earth would receive more heat from the Sun, increasing its average temperature. These temperature fluctuations would cause thermal stress and fatigue to the stones, making them more prone to cracking and breaking. According to one estimate, the average temperature variation at the Earth\u2019s surface without the atmosphere and the Van Allen belts would be about 100 \u00b0C, ranging from -50 \u00b0C to +50 \u00b0C. Assuming that each degree of temperature change causes a strain of 10\\^-5 to the stone, we can estimate that the pyramids would lose about 0.1 cm of their height per year due to temperature fluctuations alone.*  \n>  \n>*Adding up all these factors, we can estimate that the pyramids would lose about 0.271 cm of their height per year without the Van Allen belts and the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The average height of the pyramids is about 140 m, so it would take about 51,661 years for them to be completely eroded and destroyed. Of course, this is a very rough and simplified estimate, and there may be other factors that could affect the longevity of the pyramids, such as earthquakes, wind, biological agents, human activities, etc. Therefore, the actual time span could be much shorter or longer than this estimate.*  \n>  \n>*The exact rate of deterioration would depend on many factors, such as the intensity and frequency of the radiation, the temperature and humidity of the climate, and the presence of other natural or human-made hazards. It is difficult to estimate how long the pyramids would last without the Van Allen Belt, but it is likely that they would suffer significant damage within a few centuries, and possibly collapse within a millennium.*",

The magnetic field protecting the earth was disrupted and the atmosphere failed.\n These same gravitational anomalies could have larger devastating effects to the environment such as earthquakes in strange places, and other such natural disasters and devastating events. The pyramids didn't erode, but rather were toppled. \nIt's a somewhat flimsy answer imo, but probably what Bethesda was going for.",

We are bombarded with hundreds of meteorites, meteors and pieces of debris on a daily basis! However, these various missiles are usually stopped short of hitting the earth with much, if any, force, due to air friction causing both terminal velocities and ablation as they fall. Without that atmosphere, the debris hits us with SHOCKING levels of force due to:\n\nNot losing any mass due to burning up in the atmosphere, and:\n\nNo longer being slowed down by air resistance, which means they will accelerate until they make impact. \n\nForce is Mass multiplied by Acceleration, so the fact that we're increasing both factors means the force of impact for each piece of space debris increases quadratically.",

Now the part that\u2019s somewhat inaccurate is that the distraction happened too fast. Basically without a magnetosphere the earth would be constantly bombarded by everything the sun could throw at it. First all life except where sunlight doesn\u2019t reach will die. (The survivors will die but not as fast). The reason for the untold death is due to massive amounts of radiation poisoning due to all light getting through the atmosphere. So in a matter of hours everything is dead and the ocean is being superheated at an alarming rate boiling the entire ocean. The atmosphere enlarges by 1000x it\u2019s current size. unsurprising earth\u2019s gravity isn\u2019t strong enough to to support the atmosphere suddenly expanding to 1000x its original size so a large amount is lost. But the sun keeps boiling the oceans. Luckily because a large amount of the atmosphere is lost it is now really thin and the atmosphere has stopped losing mass. Because of this the earth can\u2019t sustain an ecosystem and areas of the earth in the sunlight are boiling hot where parts in the dark are frozen solid. Meaning there is near constant monsoons, followed by deep freezing followed by rapid evaporation. This causes extreme erosion at a rapid pace. Now all that would probably take hundreds of years if not thousands, however it\u2019s very likely that\u2019s what would happen if the magnetosphere were to suddenly disappear like it does in the game.\nIn summary. The games depiction of earth without a magnetosphere is completely accurate though probably a bit accelerated a few hundred years.",

Are you a smuggler?!?!\u201d\n\nMy dad was considerably freaked thinking he had done something terrible and maybe the needles were antiquities until the federal police showed him the items they were talking about.\n\nHe had 4 bottles of \u201cInca Kola\u201d in his bag wrapped to go home since he thought the bottles were interesting shaped and the name was great to give to all the members of the family. \n\nThey wouldn\u2019t believe the Kola was plain kola and made him taste each to prove it was actually plain kola. \n\nHe ended up missing his flight and had to stay 2 more days and even had to call the US embassy in Lima and get them involved. They apparently felt it was hilarious and everything finally got straightened out.\n\nAnd none of ever got the Kola although I did get an empty bottle\u2026",

It\u2019s best to just prohibit the player from visiting it and coming up with a lore reason. Starfield is kinda lazy about this, but I don\u2019t really blame them that much. The only game somewhat fixing this issue that comes to my mind is Elite Dangerous, with you needing a high rank in the federation just to visit the solar system and access to earth being only authorized to important figures in the federation. I am very curious to see how Star Citizen will handle earth however, considering Sol System is planned and they already made in the current build a fully explorable mega city planet.",

So let's assume 14,000,000 kg of matter travelling at 150,000 km/h impacts earth surface. That gives you a total kinetic energy of **1.2 \\* 10^16 joules**. Now, that's a lot, but the average energy of a hurricane is **5.2 \\* 10^19** joules per day and we experience an average of 10 storms with that level of energy per year.\n\nSo, it would take 5000 years of bombardment in order to reach the level of destruction caused by hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones each year.

Imagine seeing dangerous fauna; you whip donuts around it while it tries to get you with its two attack animations until you get bored and go park on top of a mountain to snipe it. Or you lob a bunch of grenades at a spacer base then go drive to the opposite side and rush in while they're all looking for you. Or hell, just run them over. I bet it becomes really unimmersive really fast. \n\nIt also demands additional AI, attack animations, enemy vehicles, etc. \n\nALSO, It's always possible that the game just can't handle the player going any faster than a jetpack assisted hop.\n\nThey say \"intentional\" and then they're vague about the reasons, and I think that's because the reasons are practical limitations they don't want to admit to.",

This breaks the immersion and I feel like even pretty old game like Mass Effect did it better with its uncharted worlds.

If they had procgen infrastructure placed that connects Settlement-class maps through Wilderness-class maps and serves as a loading buffer between maps A and B, vehicles would make a hell of a lot more sense.

I wouldn\u2019t put automatic and random points of interest everywhere on the planet. I would get rid of making every point of interest in the UI also. Instead I would make the user have to solve clues to get to a specific destination. If you want to find an outpost with space pirates you have to get a clue first by intercepting a ship or extracting info from someone in the city. Maybe even scanning the planet if you have good sensors. That clue would point you in the right direction and then tell you where to land. Then once you land maybe like the other commenter was saying rather than fitting 5 points of interest on the map, just make it one and leave clues on how to get there. Maybe there\u2019s a satellite dish you have to hack or something to tell you where the base is. Maybe add a way to use a scope or something. \n\nThe whole concept of Skyrim in space was bound to fail. You can\u2019t populate a galaxy with thousands of points of interest. The closest you can get is No Man\u2019s Sky. Instead make it about survival and solving puzzles and using clues to find things in the vast empty landscape, thus leading to a sense of reward when you reach your destination. The problem with my approach is it\u2019s a very specific niche and won\u2019t be for everyone, but they got themselves into a mess by designing a game for everyone. \n\nThat being said I think Starfield is a pretty damn good game and people are being overly critical about it.",

I don't understand these Bethesda enabling mental gymnastics that people perform. It is mind-boggling. Why does this game company feel like a cult follows in its wake?\n\nSkyrim was great and the older Fallouts were grand, but those games are long in the past. Bethesda has been putting out leather jacket backed turds ever since, and, oddly enough, Starfield is the most milquetoast turd of them all. It is an absolute clunky, cumbersome, tedious mess of a game with lackluster story, characters, combat, and exploration (which I feel is a supremely strong word for the fast travel, cutscene mess that it is).\n\nThis mentality truly baffles me. Well, they took ten years to put out some substandard barren trash, charged us a premium for it (stole our money considering the grandiose promises), but by golly gee wilikers, I think we can put in the labor to make it bearable. It's like Stockholm syndrome or something. Bethesda is abusing the trust of their exceedingly loyal fanbase by promising lofty goals, not delivering, charging a premium, and then expecting the public to do their work for them. It's almost criminal. I feel sorry for the developers who actually put effort in their work at Bethesda to try to deliver something great; but be it poor management, abysmal creative leads, or just a general lack of vision their efforts were for naught. Well, I guess I'll go do another Returnal run.",

You're not walking from New Atlantis to Akila *and then* encountering an Abandoned Cryo Laboratory. The Lab *is* the destination now and there is nothing random to encounter in between your ship's landing zone and the POI. \n\nThat is why things feel especially disjointed in Starfield. All of that random encounter stuff is there but it's squished into one of nine settlements, and then sometimes throw you out to a POI on a planet or in space to complete a quest. All of which unavoidably requires some form of menu navigation for travel. \n\nI personally think the way they went about trying to capture the random exploration and encounters from previous Bethesda games and place it onto a Starfield multi-layered universe is a bit lacking, but I can absolutely see why it's *more* difficult than in previous games.",

That set a prededence for people to immediately try to find all the reasons it's shit. People who have never even played the game saying it's shit because they read someone else saying it's shit. Most people aren't capable going into something looking for all the reasons it's not shit when all they have heard is how shit it is. \n\nPersonally I have been playing the game for a while now.  I'm about 150 hours in and haven't even finished the first 5 main quests. I've been playing the game as I play every single Bethesda game, and I very much enjoy it.  As I said, at times I wish I had a vehicle on planets because then I could beeline to locations instead of running along mining and killing things and looting along the way, ending up with a full weight capacity before I get there.  So far my biggest complaint about this game is that they didn't make it easy enough for those of us who are hoarders to offload our hoarding without it taking ages to do.  I've yet to find what I need to build transfer containers for my outposts. I really hope that happens before I've finished the main quest line because I get bored with games when the main quest is finished. But as of now, 150 hours in, and haven't gotten very bored at all. Talking to every NPC to gain story as I've done in every Bethesda game. Reading every bit of lore I can find, and it's not in the form of books on this game - it's breaking into or opening computers to get it instead. Going through the museums as if I was a real patron there. Picking up a and finishing side quests as I get them, doing everything I can while on a planet before moving to the next mission. \n\nNo it's not perfect, but it's definitely not shit. It's the first game in a new Bethesda world and I wouldn't expect it to be Skyrim or FO4 in nature because of that.  I imagine the next game in this world will be loads better. And I imagine the DLC will also add 100's more hours on for me.",

This leads to players constantly running in to them, leading to repeats, and nonsensical worldbuilding. Barren moons have seemingly a population in the millions, mostly Pirates. This mod aims to make the worldbuilding feel more realistic, while maintaining the POIs for players who like to grind.  \n>  \n>The first change is to restrict POIs with human habitation to planets either inside the settled systems, or with breathable atmospheres close by. As there are over a hundred breathable planets in the settled systems, it was odd that anyone would choose to settle on a barren moon far away for settled space, unless there was a specific reason to do so. This leaves most of the galaxy empty as it should be according to the lore, and make settlers decisions make more sense. This massively decreases the amount of human POIs you will find at random, while still leaving an infinite amount to find in the core worlds. The only human habitation you will find outside the core systems is handcrafted, or radiantly generated for a quest.  \n>  \n>The last change is to decrease the density of the human POIs that show up, so when you land on a planet you aren't surrounded by them, there will only be one or two. This means that each one you see feels more special. The amount of the change depends on how far from the core worlds you are, Jemison is densely populated compared to far off worlds.  \n>  \n>POIs generated for radiant quests are unaffected, so there are still an infinite number to find, and each is more unique, as they will all have a context behind them. Locations you find on planet scans will also still show up, meaning each habitable planet still has some life, just not an infinite amount. As an added benefit, the Crimson Fleet is no longer the largest faction in the Settled Systems, with hundreds of bases on every planet.",

I legitimately think Bethesda is just a little high on their own supply and spent so long on their development cycles the gaming industry completely passed them by, and they just didn't notice. \n\nThey're in a weird spot. Microsoft bought them out and gambled big on Starfield and the \"Bethesda pedigree,\" and by most accounts, it seems to be backfiring a bit. I don't know what Starfield is doing money wise, but general feedback and player retention seem universally low, and that doesn't bode well. \n\nOn the plus side, maybe Starfield is a wake-up call, and they'll sit down and reassess their approach to TES6. But then, I think the reason why Skyrim was and is still such a powerhouse is pure *atmosphere.* It created a really strong foundation for molders to build on. This is something Starfield lacks, even in the hub areas. There's nothing that makes you feel like you're in a real, lived in space. So maybe the Bethesda approach to game design can still work in 2024 and beyond, it just *needs* to be drenched in atmosphere and detail first and foremost. \n\nIt's possible that if hub areas were dense and filled with rich detail and activities, it might make the vast emptiness of space feel more intentional. Everything you interact with feels very clean and sterile, with no real rhythm or routine like the towns of Skyrim. Just clumps of unamed NPCs milling around continuously in bland looking cities. Cyberpunk, for all its faults, spent a LOT of time making the cities at least feel detailed and grungy, with trash and steam, neon, and grit.",

And a 1:1 procedural recreation of the milky way.  \n\nI've never played Microsoft flight simm.  I have no desire to fly a commercial air liner from New York to France.  \n\nBut Elite just scratches my exploration/space combat itch. Dog fighting is the best I've ever seen. Especially once you master turning your stabilizing thrusters off and are constantly fighting your own inertia for a sliver of extra performance. \n\nThe ability to look at your star chart and see a gas giant in system with rings.  Letting you know it will be a viable zone to mine the ring rocks for minerals. Leading to a variety of activities ranging from protecting the miners there from pirates.  Being the pirate and extorting miners for a cut of their cargo or straight up blowing a hole in their cargo and trying to scoop it all up before the authorities arrive. Or just bounty hunting. \n\nDeep core charge mining for diamonds. And that's just one POI type.  \n\nOnly 0.3 percent of the galaxy is mapped after 10 years. Even if all the plants are barren. The process of exploration keeps you entertained in a way that click on a system and watching a loading screen doesn't.  \n\nPlanning your route around star types you can scoop for fuel.  Managing your heat while scooping and looking out for hostile ships laying in wait to ambush refuelers. Spinning up your FTL and warping to the next system. The scanning minigame is serviceable. I like feeling like I'm at my science station looking for frequencies. Triangulating the coordinates because my map is empty as this is a new system to me.  And then manually navigating to that signal curious the whole time as to what you're going to find.  \n\nThe idea of getting a taste of this and then realizing you're gonna need a lot more money and reputation to afford the kind of shit that makes 10 hours worth of exploration take 10 minutes when fully outfitted and reaching for that goal.  \n\nThe paths you can take to get there. Keep on the science path? Mine and sell ores? Get your combat legs under you and take bounties to support specific factions in combat zones. \n\nAll of these systems would be cool in a stand alone game that only offered one of them.  It's very cool to have a game that offers all of them.  But what makes it great is putting it in a world where you have to manually navigate from one type of content to the next. \n\nI'll never play euro truck simulator.  Sitting on traffic or highway driving aren't activities that grip me.  \n\nBut manually piloting from one space station to the next in Elite is pure joy. Manually doing the gravity wells of plants.  Calculating your deceleration to not overshoot.  Air/gravity breaking on planets. \n\nYou're constantly stimulated. I feel like I am a ship captain making a living on the frontier. I can dip in and out of activities and the only limit is my ships ability to keep up with the content/other players. And my willingness to invest the time to participate. \n\nI could gush about elite dangerous for days.  \n\n\n\n...we don't talk about space legs.  Space legs don't exist.  Space legs can't hurt you.",

The DLC and then all the mods, the content never ends. \n\nBethesda has to rediscover it's soul. It it really cares it should start working on a remake of Morrowind. The creation engine 2 fails for space stuff but would probably work really nice for Morrowind.\n\nHere is what they could do \n\n- replace very written line of dialogue with voice actors using a two tier system. Main characters voice actors, side characters could be AI. Artifical voices like elevenlabs have the quality to make this workable. A combination would be a good balance between two much of a scope and to much artificiality. \n\n- Take the best assets the community has created and redo them in 8K to get astonishing resolution on everything.\n\n- Ad an optional AI system to the game that can turn audio speech from the gamer in  to text , a combination of local processing and online processing already makes this possible in almost real time. But nobody has integrated this flawlessly in to a game. It will not be easy, they will have to build new technology to make it work at scale. \n\n- Then the second step after speech to text   is to have the AI integrated with a large language model. No, not chatgpt4 that won't run in real time and then your game seriously depend on your internet connection. They would have to take a base model and retrain it specifaclly with TES lore. Then they will have to figure out again, a combination between a model running locally and a model running online. That way they can seamlessly move load from local to the cloud and back depending on the situation. A gpt  3.5 quality system with every character a system prompt and the morrowind lore trained in to the system. Oh my god.\n\n- Then the final step is text to speech, again a mix of local processing and cloud.\n\nYou would now have a super big morrowind world in the creation engine 2. The dialogue system is now audio based with a mic and you can go off script and talk about anything! \n\nWhy stop there!\n\n- driven by AI a select number of NPC's could be given more freedom then a NPC has ever had. They could have a core identity that is a system prompt, they could be taske with something. Some quest, something they try to get down. They could be given the potential of having as much power as a human player if they level up. It would also be like playing online against other humans but not quiet. So we could have 5 or maybe 10 super NPC's that act almost as if they are another Morrowind soon to be hero.  The human player would be given the choice to make allies with them or enemies.  \n\n\n\nThere is so much more to do with Morrowind and a dungeon and dragon's type RPG now that we have this new AI technology.\n\nBethesda could redeem itself, absolutely. They could innovate again.",

My brother is a big fan, though, so I\u2019m at least somewhat familiar with the concept, setting, available tech, etc, and I can see where you\u2019re coming from. \n\nThat said, a lot of the tech in Starfield is contingent upon other tech that MUST exist for them to even have what they have in the game, and a ton of those intermediate steps are missing. You have laser and particle beam directed energy weapons, but not laser communication that takes way less power? Even your average schlub can afford a ship capable of traveling at some appreciable fraction of the speed of light, but that tech isn\u2019t used to automate resource delivery in a society that revolves around colonization of multiple planets in multiple systems? Ships can calculate point to point routes that avoid other massive objects in space or orbit, but saving frequent destinations is off the table? Any non-ship travel is by foot or a shuttle system? With physical directories in cities like you\u2019re at the mall? How the hell did they even build and maintain all these larger colonies without this kind of stuff? \n\nI can understand your point about prioritizing survival and technologies that assist in that, sure, but a computer that can calculate hyperspace jump routes can absolutely display in-city route guidance or allow a store to process transactions and access their bank funds electronically.

But I just want to bring out a few more things not said in game (or not set obviously enough).\n\nWhile I was signing up as Freestar Rangers, one of them revealed there are only 10-20 Rangers around, in the entire Freestar Collective.  Rangers are like detective as Security for patrol cops.  For comparison, there are 7500 detectives in London, for a 8.9 million population.  \n\nThis gave me pause.  Human population over Freestar collectives may be 2-10 millions, if that.  And UC can\u2019t be that much bigger (since they are more solid and stable).  Say 20 millions?  Tokyo is the largest city on earth with 37.4 millions.  Just 1 city.  \n\nI guess a lot of humans didn\u2019t make it out of Earth.  So you can see how easy it is to join the Rangers or Vanguards.  They just don\u2019t have thousands of people fighting for a job.  \n\nThe lack of population and the distance makes automated services a lot less feasible.  \n\nBut, pay attention to your Interstellar Cargo Link.  They are flown by ships with no pilot.  So that is evident of automation right there.  \n\nWhen things go beyond Earth, things get a lot harder.  You can\u2019t operate satellite for phones and gps because humans are so spread out in not just different planets but different systems now.",

That said, unless a bunch of this tech was developed on Earth before the collapse, it just seems off to me. Who\u2019s developing, manufacturing, and maintaining all this stuff with such a shrunken down and fragmented human population? \n\nMaybe I\u2019m thinking too hard about this, but it just seems a little incongruent to me to have colonies with such a relatively low population count but with all the fruits of advanced industry, and yet they\u2019re missing a bunch of intermediate technologies that would make that job a lot more feasible. This is after fighting some brutal wars that undoubtedly cut into their respective numbers as well. They may be above the waterline as far as colony collapse goes, but maintaining a place like Neon? Unless everyone is a trained specialist in some technical discipline, and everybody works, it just seems like they don\u2019t have the manpower to keep these big colonies going in addition to a space program way more advanced than our own. Not with what we\u2019re shown.\n\nTo me, again, the easy answer was \u201cit\u2019s enough to get the point across\u201d, and so they eschewed adding further details. It\u2019s more a sketch of the universe they intended to convey, rather than a full painting. At the end of the day it IS a game, but like, if your marketing hype is all about \u201chard sci-fi\u201d and you hand wave away a bunch of the logistics\u2026 just seems a little off, is all. The part of it that actually bothers me is when it affects gameplay. Cargo links are nice, but it seems like it was just a solution to that particular \u201chow do we make this work?\u201d gameplay situation that has no effect on the rest of the game. You can\u2019t use them to, say, shop for supplies from your ship. Maybe I\u2019m nitpicking, and the new patch with \u201cadditional transportation options\u201d sounds promising, but like, there\u2019s no way they got these colonies to a stable state without ground vehicles, drones, long range comms, and a bunch of other stuff that is currently nowhere to be found, and in fact the game seems designed around deliberately omitting.",

It makes no difference whether these will be parts with vertical or horizontal points for weapons.\n\nSome parts when moved along the Y axis cannot be lowered/raised to the required distance, then it is possible to use a weapon to move one part along the Y axis by a step of 0.5 instead of 1 as the game does by default (for this you need to bring the part to the weapon, and not weapons to the part).",
