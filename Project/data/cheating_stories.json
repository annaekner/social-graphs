            "text": "Hey everyone, sorry I've been MIA for a while now I'm writing this update to let you all know I'm alive and to give you the lowdown of what's been happening as of recent. Frist, I want to apologize to those who've worried about me the past few months. After my last post I was nowhere near okay, so I pulled back from everything I secluded myself in order to heal and cope with what is now my life. I want you to know every comment and message didn't fall on deaf ears I took all of your positive feedback and advice and worked through my problems. So, to the people who've supported me though this truly thank you I can't stress it enough when I was at the lowest I've ever been it was internet strangers that were there for me so again thank you all.\n\nIn my last post I was doing things like getting tested for std's and trying to restart my life. I'm happy to inform you all I am clean and couldn't be more relieved. I am fully moved into my new place, when I told you all about my new place, I told you it was a refurbished cabin well I might have been a little generous. It was refurbished almost 25-30 years ago so it was a bit dated. Well with all my newfound free time I decided to actually refurbish it and all that's left to do is paint the guest room I turned into an office. The only thing I didn't do myself was the electric and plumbing because I have no clue how to do it and have zero interest in being shocked or putting my hand in a shit covered pipe. Doing all the work has been incredibly stress releasing and has helped me clear my head. I still see my therapist once a week to all those who suggested it you probably saved my life so thank you being able to vent, get my frustrations out and get the advice I need has been better than anything in my life past or present. I'm still working at the same company I've become more open with my some of my coworkers that I'm closer with and my boss from my previous post's due to the advice from my therapist. Also due to her and some of your advice I've reached out to my friends and have slowly been reintegrating into the group again. \n\nNow onto the update with what's been going on between my \"family\" and ex. I decided I was ready to have a talk with my mother so a little over a month ago I unblocked her on my phone and reach out. I called and almost instantly she picked up the phone, I could tell through the tone of her voice she was panicking. Eventually after reassuring it was me, I told her we should meet and talk she agreed and a day later we met at diner near her house. She was there before I was and when she seen me, she started quietly sobbing. When I sat, she apologized over and over again telling me she could only take their word because she never thought them getting together would ever happen. I told her while I appreciate her apology the things she said to me were despicable and something no mother should ever say to their child, and it showed me exactly what she thought of me. She cried harder and promised it's not true that when she was told I hit my father for no reason she was so angry and when I showed up to the house, she just let her anger take over. Not wanting to go back and forth with her I decided to move on I said speaking of that pos what have you decided to do with him. She told me they've been separated (she just kicked him out) since the day after I sent her the video and she immediately found a lawyer. Then we moved on to my ex she said that when I pulled away, she went back into the house and threw them both out she was to disgusted to look at them. We talked for about an hour in total and before I left, I told her I was in a dark point of my life and because of the things she said to me I didn't have my mother when I needed her and because of that I don't know if I could have her in my life. I then told her I'm willing to work on my relationship with her, but it will be at my pace. \n\nShe stopped me before I could leave and told me she has to tell me something important. I sat back down, and she said L is pregnant, L apparently showed up to the house and told my mom. She said she didn't know if it's mine or my father's L asked if I had been in touch so she can let me know. Obviously, she hasn't so my mom just sent her on her way.\n\nWell, that's about it for the update I have a lot on my mind not sure what to do or feel. Thank you for reading sorry for rambling on and on.",

She knows what she said and how she reacted was wrong and is willing to be in your corner.\n\nBetter late than never really.\n\nAs for your ex, I would recommend that you maintain no-contact and firmly tell your mom to not share your number nor location (if she knows) to her.\n\nTo be honest, a baby is a big deal if she's truthful but I think most of us here believe that it's likely not yours though unfortunately, it maybe your half-sibling.\n\nDo contact your lawyer to prepare for fatherhood claims by your ex (if done so). It's always better to be prepared than be caught unaware.\n\nSpeak to your therapist too about this as you'll need to unwind and vent safely as it were.\n\nUpdate us when you can OP.\n\nGood luck and take care.",

No sorry I think they are on the same level of fucked up and sick, I hope her parents disown her and all her friends turn their backs on her.\n\nWhat\u2019s sadder about this whole situation is your dad had the balls to bring that slut to your family home and accuse you of abuse. Like you didn\u2019t have video proof! Did he not think you would show your mother the video? Honestly your dad is a piece of work. Maybe he thought she wouldn\u2019t listen to you. \n\nYour mom is fucked truly fucked up and I do understand why you cut her out. She didn\u2019t doubt his story she just accepted it. She didn\u2019t hold off on her emotions and find out your side she just trusted that what her piece of shit husband and a slut had said. You are not wrong for cutting her off and she needs to be absolutely grateful you decided to give her any kind of chance. \n\nI hope and pray the kid isn\u2019t yours I also hope though that she and your dad get the lives they deserve and is outcast and shunned by all.\n\nPlease keep us updated and I know it\u2019s been super hard for you but just try to look at the fact that at least you guys didn\u2019t get married, at least you all didn\u2019t have kids, at least this happened before she could tie you down legally to her or with a child.

I am so sorry you are going through this my man.\n\nYou are, with no exaggeration, facing one of the most difficult situations a man could face. And you are doing a phenomenal job handling it. Well done. We are all pulling for you.\n\nI don\u2019t have much to say about your gf. She is your typical trash with no morals. Streets are full with her kind. Given that you are young with a well paying job and high prospects for the future, it will take you a minute to find a far better one when you are ready. She is not worth a second thought.\n\nYour father on the other hand is the real menace. A parent capable of doing this is capable of doing anything and i mean ANYTHING! Something is very very wrong with his mind. Can you imagine, he goes home after getting busted with his son\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and still tells your mom that you attacked him while he was trying to help you. \n\nFucking psychopath.\n\nMake sure all his work, family and friend circles are well informed about this. I am genuinely concerned about anyone around this psycho with no clue who he really is. \n\nIf I was one of those people, I would wanna know for sure so I would keep my distance with him and keep my guard up. \n\nYour mom\u2026 i dont know. She\u2019s a letdown for sure but perhaps not as bad as the other two trash.\n\nLastly, I\u2019d speak to a lawyer if i were you to see if there are any grounds to sue both their asses for the emotional distress they caused you.\n\nOnce again, I am so sorry, man. Hope you are doing as best as you could. Stay strong!",

But understand this - when she said those things she was being lied to and manipulated. The same people who lied to and manipulated you did the same to your mother. What she said to you was horrible, totally, which is why I agree with mending things at YOUR pace. Just understand she is a victim in this as well, just as much as you. It was YOUR fiance and HER husband. And hopefully, that might make things a little easier for you to to mend things.\n\nIn regards to your ex being supposedly pregnant, I say, if anything, have your mom send a message to your ex for you saying you want a paternity test before anything else. No contact until then.\nIf the child does turn out to be yours, it's your choice what you want to do, whether that be being a part of the kid's life, just paying child support and being involved, or even just completely ghosting them. A lot of people would say that's horrible to just ghost them if the kid is yours, and yea, it would be shitty, but honestly, women can AND HAVE done exactly that for the same reasons. If women can make the choice to ghost the father of their children - or in some cases, even terminated - because of cheating, it's only fair for a man to be able to decide if he wants a child with a woman when she's gone and cheated on him. It's shitty, but it's fair (this is implying the cheating was before birth/conception, if the cheating happens after and the child does belong to the father then neither parent has a right to abandon their child). Now, I hope that - if the child is yours - you do remain involved with the kid in some way. But, it is fully, 100%, your choice what you want to do.\nAnd obviously if the child isn't yours, then that's your dad's mess to deal with, not yours.\n\nKeep at it with the therapy, see your friends, keep pushing through. There's still a lot of mess to clean up but I'm sure you'll come out of this ok.\n\nHope you're doing well OP, and hope to hear another update. \u2764\ufe0f",

No one can predict how they would react in a situation like this but you have done it the right way.\n\nL and your father are nothing but flith, your mother shouldn't of reacted to the fiction the way she did, her words cuts deep but you need to find it within yourself to forgive her in time, she hurts like you hurt. She wasn't the culprit, she was also a victim in all this. Only you know what she said that day, you may have sugar coated it during your previous post so you know when that time will be.\n\nIt's been 5 months since your last update. Everybody including me are eagerly waiting for an update and hoping you are still the pillar of strength you are.\n\nUpdate us when you can!!",

Just do not anyone put your name on the birth certificate until you know for sure that you are the father.    \n\nAnd if you are the father you can use your mother as the drop off person for the child.   This way you can minimize your interactions with L.   And your mom can use it to get some \"grandma time\" in - a win-win.   \n\nPlease keep updating us.

It will also have to be Lawyer to Laywer discussions, I would NEVER be able to speak to her.\nIf there is a child, how would you ever co-parent with her? It would be a life of misery and pain for you because she knows you would do the right thing which then leaves you open to L's constant manipulation. You're a toy to her not a person. \nAgain if there is a child and that child is your prodengy perhaps your father will be perfectly content fully supporting his own grandchild.

I am not sure there is any kind of longevity in their relationship given the huge age gap.  \n\\> Your mother was not part of this drama. Can you imagine the lies your father and L said to her to rile her up like that? When she heard your side she immediately took appropriate action.

She was manipulated by your dear ole dad too.  \n\\> I am happy to hear of the work you put in on the cabin and that it was therapeutic for you.

I wish you the best of luck. Take care and keep being strong.",

I didn\u2019t think much of it in the beginning but grew more uncomfortable with it as it continued almost every weekend for over a month, i even walked into the living room to see my husband cuddling with my daughters friend on my couch. 2 days ago i asked annie about the situation and found out annie had no clue this was going on and said she was going to express to bailey how uncomfortable she felt about the situation. annie also informed me of a situation bailey had with another one of my daughters friends dad where she would get him alone and talk badly about his wife to try and trick him into sleeping with her. today i got up the courage to go through my husbands phone, i know it\u2019s an invasion of privacy but a women\u2019s intuition is never wrong. the first thing i checked was his messages, i found a contact with baileys name and clicked on the messages, when i looked at the messages all i saw was a message from my husband that said \u201ci can\u2019t wait to do it again next weekend\u201d with a winking emoji. the response from bailey read \u201ci can\u2019t wait till you\u2019re out of that place and we can do it every day\u201d. I haven\u2019t said anything to husband or daughter about this yet, 1. because i don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions and ruin the past 34 years of marriage with my husband and 2. ruin my daughter\u2019s friendship and reputation at school. I want to confront my husband, but i also don\u2019t want to ruin my daughters life. what should i do?\n",

She doesn\u2019t actually LIKE your husband. She likes the thrill of it. Once she gets bored she\u2019ll move on. Whereas your husband has deluded himself into thinking this young girl actually wants him. She doesn\u2019t. \n\n\nYou need to gather the evidence and consult an attorney. There is no saving this marriage. Your daughters reputation won\u2019t be destroyed but both your husband and ~~Annie\u2019s~~ Bailey\u2019s will go down in flames. They made that decision when they started this affair. Your husband will PROBABLY come out worse, given she\u2019s only 18 and it\u2019ll be chocked up to the age gap and her not knowing any better.",

It was the most liberating moment in my life and it was hard, did I mention he had 3 kids that I adored? ugh, the pain.\n\n However I spent so much time trying to discect his mind and why he wanted a younger girl. It hurt me, made me feel insecure, in your case I am sure you are questioning if he's a pedo. You never know until you do some *real digging.* \n\nThe sad part about this is, you have so much comfort, years of kids, laughs, memories, all the lovey enjoyable stuff that will make you want to stay or work things out. You have to leave those thoughts to the side when making a logical decision about you and your daughter. \n\nHe is having sex (possibly) with an 18 year old and someone who is a friend of your daughters, even worse. He might have had other flings in the past you just havent found out. \n\nSometimes I feel like the universe gives us signs to start over, leave people that don't deserve our time, or respect us. I am sure he has made you feel like this in the past and you have ignored it. \n\nIt is time my dear, release yourself from the shackles of this unfaithful arrogant man. He doesn't deserve your light, or love for that matter. Protect your space and daughter at all costs. Like many other comments, you need to divorce him. Get into therapy, and heal from this betrayl.

I cannot imagine the heartbreak and shock. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard to grasp the depth of the betrayal that is going on. I am sorry.\n\nThere are no conclusions to jump into, only facts. \n\nThere is no coming back from this.\n\nYour husband is cheating on you and because he has the balls to do it in your house, while your daughter and you are sleeping in the next room, makes me think he did it before. This time he just got careless.\n\n2) Find an attorney, a shark. Follow their advice to a T. Do not, under any circumstances, play the pick-me-dance. Learn how to grey rock and 180.  Surviving infidelity sub here is great, too, to vent and for tons of resources.\n\n3) Please, find a therapist. It really helps.\n\n4) I would serve him papers in front of your other children and the little homewrecker and her parents. I would inflict as much pain and embarassment as I could, but I doubt a lawyer would agree with that.\n\nThe point is, start the divorce proceedings.\n\n\n5) Talk to your older kids. Let them know.\n\n6) Why is your daughter best friends with a person that tries to seduce older men? Does she do it, too? Do they both play that game?\n\n7) Your husband  will go down in flames. Once he is ostracized by the community, once his children stop talking to him, he will hit rock bottom.\n\nDo not take him back.  \n\nI am sorry",

It is notorious the instability of the girl is disgusting, she has a need for a father; maybe even problems at home so that leads her to develop this situation and it is notorious that maybe she grew up without a father or if she grew up but he was not present in her life.\n\nThere are already several stories I have read here of older men messing with girls their daughters' age (most of them with problems at home or parents getting divorced). The most cynical thing is that the girls still want friendship with the daughter, my god !!!! I know there will be comments that will say the girl is of age, the point here is that it is a glaring difference. We should not take a good look at these things. Me at 18, I wasn't interested in older men, it felt a little weird to me. But I grew up in an environment that could be said to be healthy, I had attention from my parents. Now at 27, my potential partner could be the limit of 6 years difference. But I am already more aware than in my 18 years. \n\nu/AffectionateOw12581 I am so sorry for this, a big hug. This seems to be beyond saving, your husband is blinded by this girl and the girl has trauma ( an apology for me expressing myself like this). Confront your husband and between the two of you talk to your daughter, before this blows up. Talk to a lawyer, talk to this girl's parents, most likely she will not listen to her parents and run away from home. Best of luck!",

What about women who chase men 30-40 years younger? No problem there???? If 18 is a child then raise the age of consent to the point where \"she\" isn't a child. Since you only refer to men being pigs and females being victims I'm assuming you don't think we need to change the age of consent for 18-year-olds because it's totally cool for women to go after them. Right? At least that's the way you come off. But it does happen both directions. My question was why is that the big deal if it is the age of consent? I think cheating is a way bigger deal than someone having sex with someone who is of the age of consent just because there's an age gap. The problem is that somebody was willing to ruin their life and their children's lives and their spouses lives and anyone who was close to them just so they could see what other genitalia felt like. Why is it that the big deal? What age should we raise the age of consent to? Do you care if the younger person is male or female? I have never cheated I am never will but I have been cheated on. I know what that feels like. I know what it feels like when someone younger is being chased. I have been chased my younger women and flatly refuse them. I am married. Even though my spouse is a cheater or at least supposedly was a cheater. But aren't they all no longer cheating now lol? So back to the original question, if age is the biggest problem you have within Fidelity then why not raise the age of consent to say 30?",

Relax.\n\nBut thank you for the extensive explanation, it adds to perspective and perception.\n\nI still stand by the part about the undeveloped frontal lobe and because of that twice as much obligation as in the case of an older woman initiating an affair to push her away and preferably talk to her parents so that they know what their daughter is doing and take her to a psychologist or something tho. \n\nUnfortunately without her learning consequences, taking responsibility of her own actions, it will (since she did it before) probably lead to affairs with more fathers and husbands.

Here goes nothing ig,\n\nI\u2019m gonna give the full background so everything falls into place\n\nMy wife (26F) and I (26M) have been together since we were both in 7th-grade middle school, we went through all of high school and the same college together with 0 \u201cbreaks\u201d or \u201ctime-offs\u201d, we always had a strong connection and loved each other throughout those 9 school years. Everyone in our classes knew we would get married. Got voted that at Prom lol I proposed our Jr year of college and we got married after graduating (we were both 22)\n\nMy parents got divorced when I was 6, then my mom remarried when I was 15 (Mom was 48 and he was 52). He was a basketball player, played 4 years at a D1 college, and played overseas for 5+ years (never was good enough for G-league or NBA) but he had married my mother after all that and was/is a roofer ever since. He is 63 now\n\nMe personally, I\u2019m 5\u20196 and never played any sports throughout school, don\u2019t get me wrong I always made sure to stay in shape and always went to the gym regularly my entire life but I never competitive sports mainly because of my height.\n\nAnyways, so basically my wife has known my step-father for as long as I have. Anytime he would see me, she would be with me. Fast forward now we\u2019re 4 years into marriage and 1 child (2 years old). My mother lives less than 5 minutes from us so we always see them. My wife is an engineer and I work in pharmaceutical sales. My schedule is always different daily but I\u2019m mainly always working 8-4, most of the days coming after 4.\nOne day I had nearly half my sales closed early and was headed home around 1. I pull in and see my stepfather's car parked in the street down from us. At first, I thought Oh he knows someone in the neighborhood.\n\nI go home and I always walk in through the side door, not the garage (quicker to get in, coincidently there's no ring camera there) I walk in and right away just hear loud sus noises. I go upstairs quietly, open our bedroom door, and see my 26F wife having sex with my 63-year-old stepfather in our bed. The worst part was they couldn't even see/hear me open the door, so it was maybe 12-15 seconds of me just standing there jaw-dropped speechless maybe 5-6FT away from them. Her only single repeated answer to why she did it was \u201cI just needed something different\u201d and till this day I never know when it started, I keep assuming minimum 5+ years since they have known each other for 11 years. I\u2019ll probably never know. Going through the divorce process now.\n\nAnd honestly, I felt 100x worse for my mother, the pain she\u2019s also in is terrible. And yes, I did get a paternity test and the child is mine. But in summary, i never felt being less of a man till now but working on a better self",

The whole \u201cI needed something different\u201d is such garbage. I understand the whole concept of dating around before marriage\u2014 sure but you do it BEFORE marriage. She had ample opportunity to do this. Something is telling me she stayed with OP to continue to have access to the gross ass step dad\u2014 which means they have been doing this for some time.  The levels of betrayal here is too much, and honestly the only course of action is divorce and co-parenting. She has zero remorse and it seems like the step dad just wanted a younger woman to stroke his washed up ego loser ass",

My guess is, either way, there have been cracks in their relationship for a long time.

If you want to wait and get your mind clear and do this with advised step by step guidance, do that. Do what YOU need but don\u2019t hurt yourself. What she did does not negate who you are as a person, man, husband, father or friend, it only speaks to what a diabolical human being she is. You will be alright. Give yourself the grace and the support you need to make this happen. My thoughts are with you.",

As the DNA test, tell the children how yoy feel about them, but leave it to them if they want to get DNA tested. Oh, don't for to piss on your father's grave. Please do this for your sake, more than anyone else's. Cheating is bad as it is, but cheating with your father. That's a whole new level.",

To keep it short a lot of shit went down and she said some really vicious and awful things to me. She absolutely hated me and thought I didn't deserve her man, that I'm ugly and I smell and so much other stuff. We ended up staying together, for the kids. I'm still healing and don't think the love will ever be the same for my husband, but I chose to forgive and maintain normalcy for the sake of my kids. Things are going ok. However I was informed by a mutual friend that the woman passed away a few days ago (we are all under 35 so it's definitely kind of shocking) and the person who told me knows the hell I went thru and the emotional turmoil (but they've never been cheated on so they'd never really know how it feels) and is going on about how bizarre it is and they feel terrible and asking me if I'm ok. I'm not sure if the purpose is to illicit a reaction from me or if they're genuinely concerned? I have no emotional ties to this woman nor do I feel I ower her anything. He found out this mornijg and said something like well you're probably not sad... i was like if you had left me for her and received such news would you expect her to be sad for me? AITA for not being devastated or even really that upset? He literally left the house leaving me with two screaming kids to make a private phone call to her brother in law to find out what happened, is that not supposed to get under my skin?",

Everyone is different, and deals with situations like infidelity differently. \n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge your strength and resilience in dealing with such a painful situation. It's clear that you've endured a lot, and your feelings are entirely valid. You are not obligated to feel sadness or grief for someone who caused you significant emotional pain and turmoil. It's natural not to feel compassion for someone who actively tried to harm your marriage and insulted you.\n\nYour husband's behavior, particularly leaving the house to make a private call about his former affair partner, is concerning. This shows a lack of sensitivity towards your feelings, and your reaction to his behavior is justified. It's important to communicate to him how his actions make you feel, even if it's difficult.\n\nEstablishing clear boundaries with your husband regarding his communication about his ex is crucial for your emotional well-being. He needs to understand and respect that you don't need to be involved or affected by news related to her. Seeking couples counseling might be helpful. A neutral third party can help mediate these difficult conversations and guide both of you towards better communication and understanding. Given the complexities of infidelity and its aftermath, professional help can be very beneficial.\n\nFocus on your own healing and well-being. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family, engage in activities that bring you joy, and consider individual therapy to help process your emotions. Think about what you need and want from your marriage moving forward. If staying for the sake of the children is the primary reason, consider whether this environment is truly the best for them in the long run. Children often pick up on and are affected by their parents' emotional states and relationship dynamics.\n\nTrust your instincts. If you feel that your husband is manipulating or gaslighting you, trust your instincts. Your mental and emotional health is paramount, and you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel respected and valued. Lastly, remember that you're not alone in this. Many people have faced similar situations and found ways to rebuild their lives, whether that involves working on their marriage or moving on from it. Whatever decision you make, ensure it aligns with your happiness and well-being\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

Years later Mom said she would have forgiven and taken Dad back. She said she still loved him, at least at the time she did. It's not my place to tell anyone how they should or should not deal with such a betrayal. I don't think I would be in a forgiving mood. When my wife and I got married, it was with the understanding that the only way one of us was leaving the other would be feet first. \n\nI think OP gets a gold star \u2b50 for not dancing a jig and going on a three-day bender. I, most likely, would not be as forgiving. The anger and resentment must have been \"off the charts\".  The resentment for the outlaws is probably also a significant chunk of emotional baggage. I'm all too familiar with the hypocrisy of a large chunk of \"good church-going people\". Sounds like the affair partner made a serious run and sabotaging OP's marriage. An extended period of schadenfreude is understandable, expected even. \n\nOP, I think it's time to \"call it what it is\". Sometimes you just have to \"cut a man loose\". If you don't, Asshat and the rest of the Ewing's will never forgive you for living while Whatsherface has gone to her just reward.  You deserve better, and so do your children. Good luck.

            "text": "\nAbout a month after our wedding the wife and I headed for a night away in a city about an hour from us. Checked into the hotel, got changed and headed to a bar. She  was wearing a long dress with a very low cut revealing top, no bra, showing off plenty of tit and, if you were at the right angle, a full on view of them. We went into a bar, took a seat and got a drink when a guy came over, hugged my wife and asked her how married life was. \n\nShe introduces him as a guy who works in the same company, but in the head office that was in the city. He\u2019s obviously staring at her tits  as they talk and she was quite uncomfortable, he leaves and she says we should try somewhere different. He returns with a drink for us, hangs around for a couple of minutes taking every chance to look down her top. He soon returns to his table and I notice the group of  them looking over and laughing - obviously telling his two mates how he saw his co workers tits. We finish our drinks and the wife is insistent that we move bars, that was the last I heard of him for about 4 years. \n\n\nOne day out of the blue my wife admits to sleeping with someone. I still don\u2019t know why she choose that particular time to tell me. I asked who, where, when and how it happened.  Turns out it was the fucker in the bar.  4 months before we got married, at the company Christmas party they slept together. Slipped off to his room and let him have her. \n\nSo I was sitting in the bar that night we met him thinking he was just trying to see her tits. Little did I know that he\u2019d been sucking them a few months earlier. He was obviously telling his mates when they were looking over and laughing.",

            "text": "Hey everyone, I (28M) just had a weird situation pop up, and I honestly don\u2019t know how to process it. Maybe getting it off my chest will help. Names are fake obviously. \n\nA little over a year ago, I was in a serious, three-year relationship with \"Megan\" (27F). Everything seemed great between us, at least from my perspective. We were talking about moving in together and even had casual talks about marriage someday. \n\nAround that time, I started getting into fitness and introduced Megan to my personal trainer, \u201cJake\u201d (30M). Jake was a super charismatic guy, and he and Megan hit it off, but I didn\u2019t think much of it\u2014just assumed they had a good trainer-client relationship. After a few months of them working together, Megan started acting more distant. She\u2019d be \u201cbusy\u201d after her workouts, not come home until late, and her phone would suddenly always be on do-not-disturb. I\u2019d ask her about it, but she\u2019d blow me off, saying I was being paranoid.\n\nWell, turns out I wasn\u2019t paranoid. One night, Megan left her phone on the counter while she was showering, and it lit up with texts from Jake. Let\u2019s just say they weren\u2019t talking about meal plans or workout routines. I confronted her immediately, and she broke down, admitted she\u2019d been cheating with him for months. She told me she \u201cfell in love\u201d with Jake and that it wasn\u2019t about me\u2014it was just something she couldn\u2019t help. She packed her things and moved in with him within a week.\n\nThat was the worst time of my life. It felt like my entire world had been ripped apart. I blocked her on everything and focused on picking up the pieces of my life. Therapy, gym, hanging with friends\u2014I slowly started to move on, even though it left a deep scar.\n\nThen, out of the blue, a few days ago, she reached out to me on a new number. At first, I wasn\u2019t going to reply, but curiosity got the better of me. She started off saying she missed me, that she\u2019s sorry for everything, and that she\u2019s made \u201ca huge mistake.\u201d Apparently, things with Jake went downhill fast. She found out he was cheating on her (oh, the irony), they\u2019ve broken up, and now she\u2019s stuck, lonely, and miserable. She even admitted she\u2019s been thinking about me for months but was too ashamed to reach out sooner.\n\nShe said she realizes what she had with me was real and that she \u201cwants to make things right.\u201d She claimed she\u2019s willing to do anything to prove she\u2019s changed and asked if we could meet up to talk.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, Reddit: Part of me still has some feelings for her, but another part of me is screaming to block her again and never look back. I don\u2019t know if I can ever trust her after what she did, but hearing her sound so broken on the phone stirred something up in me. Maybe it\u2019s pity, maybe it\u2019s nostalgia, or maybe I\u2019m just an idiot.\n\nSo here I am, trying to figure out if I should hear her out or tell her to stay in the past where she belongs. What would you guys do?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ll post an update after we talk. Right I haven\u2019t responded, I wanted a general consensus first. \n\nEDIT 2: Update posted!",

Okay, having said that, when are you going to meet her?\n\nShe wants to be comfortable and not have to put herself out to try and find a new love, and you fit the bill. Remember, there's a \"joke\" that women tell each other, especially after a few drinks which goes, \"I want a man who will love me, take care of me (and our children), etc. and a man who sexually will knock my socks off, and hope the two never meet.\" The relationship she had with this guy was that - it was not a \"mistake.\" A mistake is saying \"2 + 1 = 6.\" Her actions to sexually engage with this man for \"months\" were carefully planned, calculated to evade being caught by you, and gaslight you, dening the possibility that it was happening right to your face. I'm sure she originally was very convincing, wasn't she. She wanted to have her cake and eat it too, and for months she did, and you were the cuk.  \n\nRemember after meeting this guy, you became \"Plan B\" very quickly. Why would you ever believe a word she says or trust any of her actions? Remember when she told you that you were \"paranoid\" regarding your suspicions about her relationship with the trainer. Remember how she was being intimate with this guy for **months** while she also was sleeping with you and telling you she loved you? Remember how quickly she left after you confronted her with evidence about her and this guy? Why do you think this won't happen again? Be very thankful that your breakup did not involved children and or jointly held property.   \n\nDo not try to be her \"friend and confidant.\" I know it is hard to just break things off with her because you did love her and probably still have very deep feelings for her. However, letting her back in to your life will become depressing very quickly as you try to help her with her psychological problem(s) and mentally having to double-check everything she says. \n\nLastly, you have to ask yourself if you want to be her jailer? Are you going to double-check everything she says about when she doesn't return at scheduled times, who her \"friends\" really are? Is she going to be willing to turn over her phone to you? What happens if she hides a second phone from you? Having to constantly check up on her is not good for either you or her. There are other women out there who will not see you as \"Plan B\" and would love you and only you (and yes I know how hard it is to find a woman like that in today's world). \n\nBest of luck to you and stay strong.",

That means full written timeline and details on her betrayal, and a follow up session after you've read it with no questions unanswered. When you meet for the follow up, she needs to have a detailed plan on how she plans on earning back your trust that is realistic and something you can both stick to without you being her jailer. If she can't produce these things, then really there's no viable way this works well since she isn't willing to put in the effort already.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't take her back still for two reasons:\n\n1. You are still so young and, please correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds like you haven't dated much since you broke up. Change that before dating her again because you owe it to yourself to see if there is someone better for you out there. It's like when you get laid off from a job you loved, and you think the world is over and you'll never find another job you like again. Well the opposite way of thinking about it is, thinking about all the things you didn't like or thought could be better. \n\n2. Just because she has learned a tough and important lesson, doesn't mean the redemption story needs to end with you two being together. She can be a better partner to the next guy and there's no need to drag yourself back into things with her.",

They see you running, the crew says it's too late for you to get on and your ticket is in that guy's hand. Now you know she gave that ticket to him. You have to wait and hope for survival all while your partner is turning her head away thinking she upgraded. She might appear guilty and sad, but she made her choice and you are going down with the ship. You managed to pull together some boxes to float on, tied your raft to one of the last boats, and eventually the coast guard rescues everyone.

I never got with her again because she had said some pretty bad things about me behind my back to everyone we knew.\n\nBe smart like I was back then. You need to find another girl to be dating. When she meets you, say you are seeing someone, but would date her casually on the side while you figure things out. That she has to prove if you want her back. Do not commit to her easy. Make her earn it at a minimum. You are going to go back to this Megan. You seem like you still have feelings and will fall all over yourself because you never moved on.\n\nYou need to start dating again. Date a lot. If she can show she has matured and is willing to eat crow for a bit while trying to win you back, then maybe you could be with her. You should also go punch your ex-friend trainer in the gut. Tell the other guys at the gym what he did, I bet they hold him for you. Gym bros do not like when a guy brings a girl to a buddy, then he exploits that friend. So many other girls, why screw over a friend.",

I still even have some feelings for the first woman I dated that got that close too until she cheated on me. I was going to even take on the job to be a step dad to her kids and such. But she made choices to cheat and it was over. She ended up in a downward spiral after what she did to me, and got on drugs, lost her kids to child services, etc. Not my fault. It was ALL her choice to do everthing.\n\nYour EX is the same. She cheated on you BIG time. And now she sees you as her safety net for the life she wanted but can't have due to her BS. Just leave her in the muck. Your only response to her should be \"LMFAO, get bent cheating (blank-ity blank blank). LMFAO. Enjoy the life of repercussions of your choices. The life we COULD have had is over and never will be. So live in a forever state of what could have been with regrets.\"",

            "text": "  \nBack story - me 41M and my wife 40F have been together from high school. We married 17years ago, and have 2 daughters. 1 year after we married I found out in the most brutal way my wife had a one night stand.\n\n  \nHere is the story, my wife had a week off work while I was working, I had bought her some new underwear and finished a couple of hours early on a wednesday to go home with some flowers and surprise her. I rang on the way to say I had finished early, but she didnt answer. She was just getting home when I pulled up and she looked surprised to see me, we went in the house together, I gave her the flowers and the new lingerie. She seemed super excited and tried them on straight away, obviously this led to me going down on her etc etc!!\n\nThat night while she was walking our dog she had left her phone on the side, which was totally normal, however a text popped up from a guy we both knew. I never really liked him but my wife told me she had liked him before we got together. Curiosity got the better and I read the message.........basically him thanking her for earlier and how much fun he'd had! My heart sank instantly and rather than composing myself I got angry. Just then my wife got back and I confronted her about the text, she broke down and confessed that the reason she didnt answer when I rang was because she was with him. This loser still lived in his parents loft, and she went there to see him. I wish I didnt but I got her to tell me all the details, from sucking his c\\*ck to him f\\*\\*king her doggy on his couch. Then the realisation hit me, she had literally left his house and come home, he lived 10mins away. She then let me go down on her within 30mins of him f\\*\\*king her doggy even though she promised he wore a condom.\n\nIt took months to work my head out but I eventually decided to work through and not divorce.\n\nThen last week I bumped into this asshole in the grocery store, he still lives very close to us. He had the balls to come upto me and ask to talk, and wanted to apologise for what had happened all those years earlier. I accepted and told him it was a long time ago, but then he made a remark that stuck with me. My wife told me it had been a one time thing and a huge mistake, but he said to me that their affair shouldnt have happened. When I questioned him he said it had been going on for several months before she broke it off and thought I knew.\n\n  \nHelp, what do I do now?\n\nUPDATE #1 - the marriage has mainly being good over the years, but looking back I can see I have been blinded by love and just plain stupid.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbout 6/7yrs ago my wife went through a stage of dressing up in some very kinky underwear, we are talking crotchless outfits etc. She would always want me to take pics of her in various positions, now at the time I thought this was amazing. However I did eventually find out she had been sending the pics to another different guy trying to seduce him. Using me to take the pics, how stupid was I!\n\n\u00a0\n\nI had a meeting with the lawyer on Monday to understand my options and then I will confront her. I just dont want to destroy my kids lives for what she has done.\n\n\u00a0\n\nUPDATE #2\n\nWell firstly thank you to all the comments and advise, it really helped and was appreciated.\n\nAfter my meeting with the lawyer, its not going to be an easy divorce but I have decided this is where I am going.\n\nI did confront my wife last night, and asked her to explain to me exactly what happened and for how long\u2026\u2026.she was confused that I was bringing it up again but told me the same story, it was a one time thing. When I told her I had seen him and he had told me the truth I could literally see the colour drain from her face. She broke down and stuck to her story. From this I told her I was going to invite him over so we can find out the full truth.\n\nThat\u2019s when she eventually confessed to the affair. It broke me if I am honest.\n\nI asked her again if there had ever been anyone else, she denied but I honestly do not know.\n\nI left the family home there and then, I will talk to my kids later tonight so we can get through this the best we can.",

She confessed to me that roughly 2-3 months after we got married, she cheated on me with one of her exes. She says it was only hand stuff, but how can I believe that. She tells me this just four weeks after giving birth to our first child and I\u2019m torn. On top of that, the timeline has me concerned if this kid is even mine. I\u2019ve ordered a paternity test without her knowing, it comes in tomorrow, but I\u2019m truly scared. \n\nI currently want to try and work on things ONLY for our child. If we didn\u2019t have him, I would end it right away. I am severely depressed from this and hate myself because I still love her but equally hate her at the same time. I keep trying to mask my depression and act like I\u2019m okay, but I\u2019m not. \n\nI\u2019ve done EVERYTHING for this woman. I\u2019ve pushed myself in my career to make enough for her dream to be a stay at home mom, we\u2019re planning on relocating across the country to be closer to some of her family, I\u2019ve bought her a car, I never buy myself anything and give her anything she wants/asks for and this is how she repays me?!\n\nDoes anyone who\u2019s been though something like this have any thoughts/opinions? I\u2019m slowly starting to consider a divorce, but the court will likely give her majority custody because she\u2019s his mom, but she currently has no job and will have to live with her parents which just overall wouldn\u2019t be best for our kid. My thought is he would be best with both of us in the house, even if it means I have to suffer for 18 years until he can move out on his own\u2026 thoughts???\n\nEdit: It\u2019s only been a few minutes, but thank you to everyone who has posted their thoughts and opinions, it helps me more than you know. I haven\u2019t been able to talk to anyone about this and have been feeling so alone. \nA little more information, I\u2019m only 25, she\u2019s 24. I know I have a long life ahead to recover from this, it\u2019s just so hard to see that far. I want to be happy I just don\u2019t see how no matter what option I choose. She also has threatened to unalive herself if I were to leave her which scares me to death in so many different ways. ",

Then, they trickle out the truth in little bite sized chunks over time.

Not 97.8% or even 99.94%, but fucking 100%. And further, cheaters just can\u2019t tell the truth when it comes to the specifics of their affairs. They obfuscate, omit, minimize and alter every fact to make themselves look less guilty. So, 100% liars, 100% lies, that\u2019s the math. \n\nOh, and one other thing. I have found that knowing what is NOT true is almost as valuable as know what IS true. Realizing this gives you an advantage. \n\nFor instance, I know with the confidence of an admiral, that kissing and a hand job is NOT all she did. Hopefully, now you do too.

Few months ago while she was pregnant he offered his \"help\" so with his \"luck\" he can change sex of our child so unborn(known to be son already) will become daughter, funny isn't it. She said great I can book a room in hotel (by irony it was hotel where I for month asked her to book so we can enjoy a weekend there and she always denied due it's expensive  to the point it became little obsession for me). He said fine - but with your bum bed will be too small for us, so she joked they will stick tightly and not a problem. I was shocked. She noticed my emotions and immediately asked if I saw those convos. I replied yes - and she got white literally- she started to explain its all jokes and that his wife is used to their exchanges and that means nothing they all friends all the bs. I was like fucking jokes about well fucking. I said we are over  - she was shaking. She said let me call him so you'll listen it's all jokes - that they never had anything, he's married blabla blah... Earlier I, upon discovering- texted him from her account - and chatted with him few sentences until I mentioned sex and he was like ...wow and stopped answering. Like he was wtf... It was like genuine confusion. So I agreed, she called him - and he literally was like if you know - completely surprised. If they ever had sex - I would expect a completely different conversation. So he was genuinely confused like if she would say weird things and she wasn't because it was loud call. Fast forward 7 years - literally there were no suspicious events ever , suddenly I started to notice weird signs from my wife. It was after her trip to home country, during which she was love-bombing me every single day for two weeks like she wasn't even at our early days. But when she stepped off the plane uppon return - it was like she got her memory erased on the flight or something like if she was replaced like in sci-fi movies:) so after few months of me digging and adding things up - she confessed she cheated, with another guy who was her mentor at university she was platonically in love and had an online affair for 3 years prior. One night stand the very first day she arrived to our homecountry-  I found out by taxi bill and location. It didn't work like she expected(oh what a surprise like if such shit ever goes as expected) - and she decided to bury it for good. So my point you always know what to do unless you don't want to know - I just wasted few years more to know what I already knew. Cheaters are cheaters - period. Leave asap, 18years haha will make you bitter man with shaken mental health and no dignity.",

I don't say this to be harsh, but you have no control over whether or not she'll end her life. She can only decide that, but her using it to make you stay in a toxic marriage (of her own creation) is ABUSE.\n\nYou're only 25....you WILL get past this but don't PLEASE don't allow yourself to stay stuck in a marriage that you don't want. Would you want to raise children in a house where you're miserable and hurting? Do you think a child would want that for their parent?\n\n*Also ask yourself.....if you had a child go through this as an adult, would you want them to stay married to a person who could be so emotionally insensitive/cruel to them?",

I think it is likely she is looking down at this new life with a depth love she did not know was even possible. This love for her child and the love for you has caused her some very very strong pains of guilt. She did not have to tell you, but felt the need to clear her conscience, be 100% truthful with you, hope for forgiveness, and build on a STRONGER foundation for all.

I am not saying that you are stupid I am just saying that sometimes people make stupid decisions. I would take this opportunity as a wake up call and realize that you need to move on. I know you want to make sure that the baby is yours, but you are trying to make her stay home mom and she obviously can\u2019t be trusted alone. So you are going to give her more than ample opportunities to betray you. She is gaslighting you telling you that it was just either this or that. Need to drop her ass like a bad habit. If the child ends up being yours, then you all should just learn how to coparent separately.\nAnd your post you only talked about the things that you were doing to make her happy and yet she cheated on you.

She conveniently waits until after the birth of the child, who might not even be yours, to tell you she\u2019s cheated on you because now there\u2019s a child in the picture and she thinks you have no choice but to stay with her for the kid\u2019s sake. But this is what the kid will see growing up: a broken dynamic between mommy and daddy. He\u2019ll wonder why daddy is always angry and hates mommy, maybe even blame himself. He will grow up thinking it\u2019s normal and bring that same dysfunction into his own relationship one day. Is that the example you want to set for your kid? \n\nThen there\u2019s the personal effects post infidelity. You will always have to deal with doubts and suspicions for the rest of your life. You will always wonder if she\u2019ll cheat again, stress over what she\u2019s doing and question if whether or not shes actually doing what she said she\u2019s doing. Your wife will always have to walk around eggshells not to arouse any kind suspicion. She\u2019ll have to go above and beyond just to prove herself. Even if it\u2019s just her getting groceries and other simple errands. Is that a life worth living? \n\nThere are ample valid reasons why most relationships fail after infidelity. Trust is broken beyond repair, the hurt of betrayal is too much for most to look past, it\u2019s not worth working through, and simply put, if the cheater actually loves the person they cheat on, they NEVER would have done it in the first place. There are couples who go through their entire life and never strayed. Why should you, OP, stay with someone who can\u2019t do that for you?\n\nEdit: oh AND she\u2019s manipulating you with threats of self-deletion. Report that to authorities. Sure we can call it out as a bluff but that\u2019s a threat they\u2019ll have to take seriously. No sane judge is gonna give custody to an unhinged suicidal parent.

And habit of showing it.\nAffection is an active thing that is always \u201con\u201d and when we around someone who shares it with us. Like I  have affection for my wife and she also returns that affection\u2014constantly. Until one day\u2014the light switch is flipped off and the affection no longer exists. It truly is like flipping a switch. \nI\u2019ve experienced loss of affection\u2014not because of cheating but just the opposite;  because I wouldn\u2019t have sex\u2014I was in high school and didn\u2019t realize that sex was just another thing creating demands that motivate me to take action on them. So much BS\u2014woulda coulda shoulda\u2026right? \n\nBut males\u2014we are driven by system that heavily associates sex with affection and when there\u2019s a sudden loss of it all we know to do is seek it out and find it. For females the system works much the same way but for the fact that most females I\u2019ve met are capable of the kind lf self reflection needed to understand what\u2019s actually going on inside of their brains. \n\nMales are indiscriminate beasts who seek to \u201csolve \u201c rather than understand. Less talk. More action. Cheating sucks but the loss of affection is cheating times a million. \n\nThere is nothing more obvious and nothing more absolute than the loss of affection. You never get it back because once it is lost it will never return again. Even for the ones who stay together the affection of both partners is so obviously lacking and absent\u2014do it for the kids. \n\n\u2026Get ready to wake up every morning to a reality where every mrinjng you assess for the return of affection and only find it to be absent again . Every. Day. Sheesh some people are able to put up with that level of adversity. That would destroy me\u2014life.

            "text": "I (23f) met my boyfriend (24f) 2 years ago and we have been dating for 1 year. Until now our relationship has been healthy but it wasnt until recently I have noticed a slight difference in my boyfriend. He had been acting more protective of his stuff like asking me why I was using his phone to search something. I didnt really mind but it did make me slightly suspicious.\n\nMy bestfriend (23f) of 4 years had her birthday recently and invited me, my boyfriend and 5 other friends to go out to a carnival since she wanted to do something a little different. We all arrived there at 10am and had a great time. After being at the carnival for 5 hours we were preparing to leave to go to a restaurant when my bestfriend had to go to the bathroom and my other friends decided to get some snacks or go on one more ride. Me and my boyfriend were together waiting to get some cotton candy when he said that he was going to get some chips from another stall. I didnt mind and he left. After a couple minutes I got the cotton candy so I decided to go to the food stall he said he was going too but he wasn't there. I was walking around a bit to see if I could find him and walked by 3 photo booths that showed the people inside on a little screen outside of the photobooth taking their photos when I noticed familler faces. It took me a few seconds but then I relized my boyfriend and bestfriend were having a full on makeout session in there. \n\nI felt absolutely shocked and betrayed by them. I broke into slient tears but I immediately decided I wasnt going to let them get away with this so I recorded them as evidence while crying and went to the bathroom after recording them and cried for what felt like hours. They made me feel so stupid and naive. But after around 10 minutes I calmed myself down and headed back to the place where most of the foodstalls were. 2 minutes later my boyfriend comes with a smile on his face and the chips and said that there was a long line. I did my best to smile back and act okay.\n\nThen me and my friends went to the restaurant and orderd our food. I felt so broken inside and hated pretending like everything was fine and like nothing had happened between them. After 3 hours eveyone left and went home. Now I want to gather more evidence of my boyfriend and bestfriend cheating and I want to find out a way confront them the best way possible. If anyone has any ideas please let me know and I will update soon.\n\nUpdate: It has been over a day and after reading comments I decided to send to video to friends and family (inuding my now ex boyfriend and ex bestfriends family). I explained to all of them me a and my boyfriend are broken up because of obivious reasons. His family and hers have aplogized to me and most of our friends have taken my side and blocked him and her. I have blocked them both on all social medias and their numbers and emails so they cannot contact me. My favourite part about this is that he lives in my apartment because him and his family arent on good terms. While I sent the video to eveyone he was also \"at his friends house\" (Yes I know he was at my ex best friends house) and he came back after getting my message breaking up with him to see his stuff in outside of the apartment. Thank you for the advice everyone.",

Them having these types of pictures on her birthday was more important for their \u201crelationship\u201d than caring about your feelings. They wanted something special for the occasion and you nor your other friends mattered to them. So why are you waiting around for more evidence?\n\nThey\u2019re both disgusting people who don\u2019t deserve to have you in their lives. Catching them was sign so take it and leave. Regardless of whatever lies you\u2019ll be told when you decide to confront him or the both of them, you would be a fool to trust either of them ever again. Stop torturing yourself and break up with him AND her and move on with your life!!! \n\nOh and you might as well get tested for STDs. You have no idea who else either of them have been with while they\u2019ve been together and you\u2019ve been with him. \n\nUpdateme",

You may have a hard time trusting people after this, which is completely warranted. But, it may be helpful. Anyway, I hope a speedy healing recovery from this so that you can go on to be happier.",

            "text": "\n\nMy wife(42) and I m(44) have been married for 19 years. We have been together for 25 years. We have 3 great kids under the age of 14. In 2015 she lost her mother to cancer and in 2016 her father to cancer. This sends her into a deep depression.\n\n For the following two years I took care of the kids while she worked. Dead bedroom starts during this time. Nothing makes her happy. Now because she doesn\u2019t talk to me I start playing video games when the kids go to bed. After 2 years she starts coming out of her depression. She talks more and wants to do stuff with the family. We start being physical again. This went on for a year then I lost my father. This send me into a depression because we were very close. Like my wife I closed myself off to her. I started playing video games more and I ignored my wife. I never stopped saying I love you or giving hugs or take her out.  We start sleeping in different rooms because our son had a medical condition where we had to keep eye on him at night. So I slept in his room. I moved my Xbox in there and played video games for a couple of hours till I fell asleep. \n\nThen Covid happens. My kids school goes remote and my wife started working from home. My wife job required her to start looking for supplies to reopen her business when the restrictions stops. She starts working closely with another member of her company. After a few months she starts being distant and stops communicating with me. I try to keep telling her I love her and buying small gifts to show my love and appreciation.\n\nWe decided that 20-21 school we would keep our kids at home to remote learn because our son had a serious medical condition. I was so busy with kids school I really didn\u2019t notice the distance getting worse until much later. Dead bedroom starts again. Then in the summer our 2021 I start to work for Lyft because we needed extra money. I worked on the days she works from home so she could be close to our son school. In the fall of 2021 I picked up this lady from the airport and drive her to her hotel downtown. During this ride she talks to her female friend on the phone about her meeting her AP to have sex because they are both in town for business. She said her husband at home with kids and is playing video game. They haven\u2019t had sex in over a year. He is too busy to know she cheating. I start thinking this sounds like us.\n\nSo I started being more affectionate and more loving. I\u2019m already a loving and affectionate person. Nothing distance is getting worse. I write a letter telling her I love her and I know there is distance between us. I want to work it out, but she has to willing to work on us. She said she will try to be better. For the next year she shows hardly any affection and doesn\u2019t want sex because her depression pills given her no sex drive. We barely hold hands don\u2019t say she loves me unless I say it first. When we are in the car together she sleeps so she doesn\u2019t talk. \n\nD-Day was May 4th of this year. My wife went into the office. I went to work  and  I was texting her during the day no response. Then she finally called me and I tell her I have been texting her all day. She tells me she never got my text because of the signal in her office. She has google chat so I will message her there it will show up on her work computer. No responses. She gets home and after we put the kids to sleep she takes a shower. This is where I finally broke down and checked her phone. Now May 4th is a big Star Wars Day. May the 4th be with you. So I check her texts from me it true she didn\u2019t get them until she left the office. I check google chat this is where I found her cheating. She woke up this day and messaged him on google chat all the May the 4th gifs. I am a Star Wars fan also. Did I get one? Absolutely not. So I checked all their messages and the affair has been going on for almost 3 years. There was tons of I miss you and I love you.  I feel so stupid. I am completely devastated. This guys moved to Kansas in 2020, but comes into office one week a month since he works remote the other weeks. \n\nI guess when they would have zoom meetings with each other to get their business open he began to flirt. In the past guys would flirt with her she would shot them down. This guys wasn\u2019t as handsome as me. I\u2019m not 10 I have a little dad bod. Maybe I\u2019m a 6-7 he was a 4. She began to flirt back then they would go to lunch together. Then the lunches turn to going to his hotel room for lunch time sex and tell me she had work late to have more sex. I even saw a text to her friend saying the sex wasn\u2019t better. She just craves the attention. So I screenshot shot everything to myself. I didn\u2019t say anything I was having surgery in the summer and needed her help. \n\nAfter surgery we had decided to move closer to family. She barely helped me look for houses. I checked her phone again in October. I guess the relationship came to an end in June before my surgery. He was mad that she was taking time to care of me and the kids. I was wondering why she became more affectionate and loving and wanting to have sexy time with me after I healed.\n\nLast week we got a huge argument because she started being distant and wasn\u2019t communicating again. So I yelled and told her I knew she cheated with a coworker. She denied and said I was overreacting. Then I shoved the evidence in her face. Then she stops yelling and putting me down and started crying. I just left and went to my sister house. I came back home to be with the kids for Christmas. Then I will leave again. I told her I am filing for divorce after the new year. She cried and ask who will drive her to work and pick her up. Who will help her with the kids. I told her to ask AP. Then she starts crying more saying we can work it out do marriage counseling.  I will seek full custody when I file the divorce paperwork, also alimony, and child support.  Twenty five years I feel is wasted.",

The fact that it was done through work chat should be brought to her HR, but after divorce. There should be consequences on the AP doing things, and I wonder if you will slap with alienation of affection (ask a lawyer if possible, but you stated it ended in June)\n\nDo not leave the home as not give ammunition of abandonment. Try to see if her shame will make her move, bluff about marriage counseling as a way to convince you are willing to an extent to meet her needs (or go if you want to see if the marriage is salvageable). Get legal advice first, really, and make a stance on what you truly want to achieve.\n\nFrom reading, I think cutting ties is best because she lied so much to keep the bedroom dead while she was getting validation elsewhere, making you think differently.

Is that the life you want?\n\nThen I would say then provide me the divorce I want and I won\u2019t tell everyone about your affair and we can co parent.  If not I will let everyone of our friends and family know, including the children.  \n\nThen get the divorce and let them all know anyways.",

This quite often leads to the situation that others like you but the have low to no respect and stop considering your needs and wishes. They stop \"investing\" in you. In a relationship it causes that you are taken for granted and the partner looses respect for you and might even start resenting you. Sound weird but is quite common. If you do then something nice for them they even loose more respect and start even more resent you. In a way there is the same mechanic behind it as the thinking: \"What cost nothing can not be worth anything\".\n\nIf i am right here, then this is something i would work on it.

And she started talking to him on April 19th. I literally fell over on the inbankment, from an immense pressure I felt in my chest. I couldn't believe it.

            "text": "Hey everyone, I wasn\u2019t planning on doing an update, but after meeting up with my ex, I feel like I need to get this off my chest. If you didn\u2019t read my first post, the quick version is: My ex, Megan (27F), cheated on me a year ago with her trainer, Jake, and left me for him. Now, she\u2019s back, saying things went south with him, and she wants to get back together. \n\nSo, we met up yesterday for coffee. I went in not really knowing what to expect\u2014part of me wanted closure, part of me was still curious about what she had to say. We talked for a good couple of hours, and it was a lot to process.\n\nMegan started by apologizing. She admitted that leaving me for Jake was the biggest mistake of her life, and she\u2019s been paying for it ever since. Without getting into too many details, things between them weren\u2019t as perfect as she thought they\u2019d be, and the whole relationship basically crashed and burned. She\u2019s been struggling ever since\u2014mentally, emotionally, financially\u2014it\u2019s been a rough year for her.\n\nBut here\u2019s the part that I wasn\u2019t really prepared for: she also brought up a lot of things about our relationship that I never considered. She said that while cheating on me was 100% wrong, she felt like I wasn\u2019t the best boyfriend either. According to her, I didn\u2019t always make her feel appreciated, and she resented me for that. She mentioned that I was emotionally distant at times, more focused on my work or hobbies, and she felt like she wasn\u2019t a priority. She didn\u2019t use it as an excuse, but she said that built-up resentment contributed to her being tempted by someone who made her feel wanted.\n\nHearing that hit hard. I didn\u2019t see myself that way, but looking back, I can see where I might have dropped the ball. I thought I was being a good partner, but maybe I was blind to some of her needs. She said she\u2019s spent a lot of time reflecting and realizes she should have talked to me about her feelings instead of stepping out. \n\nAfter we finished talking, she asked if we could try again. She claims she\u2019s learned from her mistakes and wants to rebuild what we had. She told me she\u2019s willing to take things slow and prove she\u2019s different now, but I\u2019m torn. On one hand, I\u2019ve done a lot of healing in the past year, and I don\u2019t know if I can\u2014or should\u2014go back. On the other hand, I can\u2019t lie, hearing her admit her mistakes and explain her side of things made me feel... something. Maybe it's closure, maybe it's sympathy, maybe it's old feelings creeping back. I honestly don\u2019t know.\n\nNow I\u2019m just confused. Part of me wants to move on and never look back, but another part of me is questioning whether we both made mistakes that could be fixed now that we\u2019ve grown. I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s just trying to ease her guilt, or if there\u2019s a real chance at something better.\n\nWhat would you guys do? Is there any point in trying to rebuild, or is it better to leave the past where it belongs?\n\nEDIT: Update posted",

She needs therapy before she dates again and you need some self respect, on no damn planet does \u201cresentment\u201d towards your spouse = a reasonable excuse for having a full blown emotional & physical affair behind your back. \n\n\nUltimately the choice is yours and no one can change that but don\u2019t expect anyone to respect you the same way they used to if you get back with her, she doesn\u2019t want you back, you\u2019re her safe option.",

I'm betting she sees you as an easy mark because she thinks she has you wrapped around her finger with her punany magic. I don't believe anything she's saying is genuine other than \"things didn't work out with Jake the Chad\".\n\nMost likely scenario if you start seeing her again is a woman who will always see you as the guy she can cheat on and you will take her back. That is not a man she will respect. Sadly, if you pump her and dump her, she will actually respect you..... But if you then take her back? She will lose respect for you.

Cinderella, after midnight, wanted to go back to the ball, too...!\nWho doesn't want the good but OLD l8fe instead of misery and having NOTHING...?\n\n>Megan started by apologizing. She admitted that leaving me for Jake was the biggest mistake of her life, and she\u2019s been paying for it ever since. \n\n\"Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face...\"\nOf course she did apologize, she was looking to the man that was a gentleman, offering her EVERYTHING she needed! However, ACTIONS have CONSEQUENCES and when you get to a crossroad, you DECIDE which way to go and it is YOUR OWN DECISION. If it turns out to be THE WRONG WAY, you are supposed to go back and remedy the mistake you did.\nHowever, this is impossible for her, she can NOT GO BACK IN TIME, NOR TO UNFUCK the guy...! It is, if you want, like her car running out of gas before realizing that she is on the wrong path!\n\n>She\u2019s been struggling ever since\u2014mentally, emotionally, financially\u2014it\u2019s been a rough year for her.\n\nWHO CARES? WHY SHOULD YOU CARE? This is Karma in action...! Don't mess with it because it will come back in your face, like a boomerang!\n\n>She said that while cheating on me was 100% wrong, she felt like I wasn\u2019t the best boyfriend either. According to her, I didn\u2019t always make her feel appreciated, and she resented me for that. She mentioned that I was emotionally distant at times, more focused on my work or hobbies, and she felt like she wasn\u2019t a priority. She didn\u2019t use it as an excuse, but she said that built-up resentment contributed to her being tempted by someone who made her feel wanted.\n\nBULLSHIT! Who does she think she is, \"her majesty\"? And you, her butler?\nTHIS IS CALLED LIFE! Not every day is the same, living is throwing at you a lot of challenges, you are not all day having the same energy level, physical, emotional and mental! Your life requires you to change the focus on what is the most important thing in that moment, in order to not let things control you... Or push you on the WRONG PATH!\n\nYOU NEVER DID WRONG TO HER, ON PURPOSE! All the rest are just hot air bubbles (read farts in her manipulative head/mind!) that you must air out, unless you are a cuck, sorry, masochist!\n\n>She said she\u2019s spent a lot of time reflecting and realizes she should have talked to me about her feelings instead of stepping out. \n\nOh, she finally stumbled upon the ancestral wisdom but.. HER CAR RAN OUT OF GAS WHILE TAKING THE WRONG PATH...!\n\n>After we finished talking, she asked if we could try again.\n\nWho knows, MAYBE, but definitely in another life, assuming that you will meet again!\n\n>She claims she\u2019s learned from her mistakes... \n\nGood! Learning the hard way, chances are to forget harder... Tell her to use this lessons in her next relationship. If any! \n\n>... and wants to rebuild what we had.\n\n\"Meeting Mr. Right, the man of my dreams\nThe one who shows me true love, or at least it seems\n\n...\n\nIt seems so many times you seemed to be the one\nBut all he ever wanted was to have a little fun\nBut now you've come along and brightened up my world\nIn my heart I feel it, I'm that special kind of girl\"\n\nRebuilding... What you had... You can rebuild a house, a car but there are things that can't be rebuilt or don't make sense to do it because of the energy and time needed without even having the guarantee that you will succeed...!\n\nThe risk is too high and the reward too low to take the risk... This is what's in it for you!\n\n>She told me she\u2019s willing to take things slow and prove she\u2019s different now,\n\nYes, indeed! SHE IS SOOOO RIGHT THIS TIME...!\nShe is now someone that was extensively stretched by a fitness trainer and getting tainted in each and any possible opening that he could use, you may even risk finding out that you would penetrate a protection helmet instead of what you remember to have been between her legs. Aside the physical aspects, \"She\u2019s been struggling \u2014mentally, emotionally, financially\"... Pure definition of DAMAGED GOODS!\n\n\n>but I\u2019m torn. On one hand, I\u2019ve done a lot of healing in the past year, and I don\u2019t know if I can\u2014or should\u2014go back.\n\nYou SHOULD NOT go back, especially because YOU HAVE DONE A LOT OF HEALING IN THE PAST YEAR!\n\nIf you were in a bad place, struggling mentally, emotionally and financially, THEN YES, WOULD MAKE SENSE, hence her audacity to try this with you...!\n\n\n>Part of me wants to move on and never look back\n\nThat part is the right one. REMEMBER THE CROSSROAD...!\n\n>What would you guys do? \n\nConsider her dead and buried, never speak with or about her with anyone else. \n\n>Is there any point in trying to rebuild, or is it better to leave the past where it belongs?\n\nIf you are interested in an unorthodox experiment, like Victor Frankenstein 's Creature, try  rebuilding...\n\nBut it will be on your own time, health and sanity...!\n\nGood luck, my friend!\n\nUpdateme",

This is a significant breach of trust, and even though she\u2019s apologizing now, it doesn\u2019t change the hurt she caused or the fact that she stepped out of the relationship.\n\n2. **Her Explanation**: She admits that leaving for Jake was a mistake and that she\u2019s been suffering emotionally, mentally, and financially. However, she also explains that there were issues in their relationship, like feeling unappreciated and emotionally distant from him, which she claims contributed to her decisions. While these feelings are valid, they do not excuse her infidelity.\n\n3. **His Reflection**: He is introspective and acknowledges that maybe he wasn\u2019t fully attentive to her needs during their relationship. However, it\u2019s important to note that personal shortcomings in a relationship don\u2019t justify betrayal. His reflection shows maturity, but he shouldn\u2019t bear the full burden of the relationship\u2019s problems.\n\n4. **Her Intentions**: While she says she wants to rebuild the relationship, there\u2019s a chance she may be seeking emotional closure or trying to ease her guilt. It\u2019s also worth considering whether her current situation (emotional and financial struggles) is motivating her desire to reconcile.\n\n5. **His Confusion**: He has done significant healing and feels conflicted. On one hand, he\u2019s curious if things could work out now that both of them have grown. On the other hand, his emotional healing might be compromised if he tries to rekindle the relationship.\n\n**My take**: It\u2019s understandable to feel torn in situations like this, but reconciling with someone who broke your trust and caused significant pain can be risky. People can change, but the core issue here is trust. If she cheated once, rebuilding that trust will take considerable time and effort from both sides. If he values his own growth and well-being, it might be healthier for him to focus on moving forward rather than reopening old wounds.\n\nIt\u2019s better to kick her to the curb and leave the past where it belongs, focusing on new opportunities and continuing his personal healing journey.",

Is the reward worth the risk? Is it worth it to chance years on her and make it to the end together? Is that reward worth risking her doing this again? \n\nIf not, tell her kindly and collected that that chapter of your life is closed and bid her fairwell with hopes thar she will find the happiness you seek for your own.",

The only reason she is back, again, is that Jake didn't want her. If, Jake wanted her, then she would not be here asking for another chance. With you, who was distant and didn't show her whatever she felt she needed or deserved. Which is all BS. All she could have done was say something, and you would have made a correction. She chose the hot guy. Just be honest with yourself. \n\nShe can say she has changed, what change did she make? Doesn't seem like much, just that she came back and said she messed up - because Jake didn't want her like you did - that is the only real takeaway from her whole speech. She had a reality check. And, she figured out the market for her getting a good guy is probably only YOU. So, she isn't probably want you because she loves you, she told you before she didn't, she is just wanting to get back with you because you wanted her and wanted to be with her. Don't make any mistake, she is looking for security, not to be wowwed by you, because she isn't. She had her fling, now she is WILLING to settle for you and settle down with you. But, wait, there is more, until somebody else takes a liking to her and want a little bit of that. Then, she will mess around with them until they are down with her again.\n\nYour choice, but, you see how she wants you back, there are plenty of women out there that want a good man. Women who didn't tell you that she fell in love with some guy after a few weeks or months. Those are the facts, and not just words from her.\n\nYour choice, and, you really haven't put yourself out there to see how great a catch you because you've been pining over her. Know your worth and what you deserve, not being somebody's rebound and used up goods. That would always be in the back of my mind. And, cheaters tend to do this once they had their fun, they want to go back to the familiar, then they do it again because that is what and who they are. She was arrogant about it as well. You aren't good enough for me and I love this other person. After all you went through, she can just do that.\n\nBest of luck my friend. Hopefully, you are not back on Reddit talking about how she did it to you again if you take her back.\n\nUpdateme!",

With her it will drag you down like cinder blocks.\n\nAsk her if she would still be with him right now if he had not turned out bad. Ask her if, while you were wallowing in misery, crying, feeling like your life was ripped into shreds, and you saw the person you were supposed to trust more than anyone else cheat with a guy she only knew for months and then picked over you, was she having the time of her life?

OK it\u2019s great that she says you weren\u2019t the best boyfriend but also there\u2019s a huge problem that she could not communicate that to you at all, but chose to most likely communicate that to the trainer??? Then Natalie proceeded to sleep with him for months, but then also leave you for the guy.\nAlso, what happens if you go back to her and you are just the same as you have always been? Does she then turn around and find somebody else who pay her some attention?  Sounds like to me she doesn\u2019t have an outlet in her life to do her own thing or have certain hobbies. I always say that when you focus on the negative all you will see are the negative things. Which sounds like to me that\u2019s what she was doing when you were together the first time. She lost respect for you and eventually resented you to the point of where her resentment let her another dude hit it, becoming her side piece. \nHave you ever thought about how many times she slept with that guy and then possibly also slept with you? How many times you may have gotten sloppy seconds?? \nAnother question to ask yourself is why is she using? You are breaking up as a catalyst of her life going bad when it was her decisions that led to her life going downhill. She is trying to pull you in and technically groom you into improving whatever situation she is in at this moment. When really, it has absolutely nothing to do with you. Her life had nothing to do with you. That\u2019s why she left you for someone else. But to me it sounds like she isn\u2019t a happy person anyway, so has to have someone that provides certain things for her to feel wanted enough. Right now it\u2019s a guy\u2026 next time it\u2019s a guy or guys, etc\u2026. What I am trying to say is that the problem will continue to grow and fester with her\u2026 \nAlso the main point you need to ask yourself is CAN YOU TRUST HER? \nIf she ever gets pregnant, you will be questioning if the child is really yours. \nDon\u2019t go back\u2026 don\u2019t listen to her grooming you for her satisfaction\u2026 and go get therapy. You were in love with her it sounds like from your earlier post. But it also doesn\u2019t sound like she was in love. \nThe reason I say that is because she left you for the \u201ctrainer\u201d because he was doing his job and talking to her. Lol You could insert any title into the quotes (teacher, co-worker, pastor, yoga instructor, bag boy, etc.) and you\u2019d probably get the same out come.",

Good for her, and honestly, good for you to learn going forward with new relationships. She still did a totally horrific thing in cheating. \n\nI think learning where you may have fallen short in a relationship is an incredible lesson. But do not in any way excuse her cheating. Let\u2019s all be adults and use our words. \n\nThe truth is should you give her another chance, how often would you get a sick feeling if she was 35 minutes late. What if you call her and she does not answer? Where will your mind go? What if she falls asleep and her phone is in another room. And she does not hear you call. What will your first thought be? Will you get sick to your stomach? What if she cracks up and smiles at a guy \u2026say a bartender, and you see this as you come in to meet her? What will you think?\n\nThe problem is that even if she never does anything wrong again, it will take years to trust her. And honestly, that trust will NEVER fully be restored. My husband has never done anything!!! But my ex sure did. And there are times I get a sick feeling, and wonder where my husband is\u2026.is her really out fishing? Of course he shows up smelling like a nightmare of fish and sweat, but I still get a moment of panic. Imagine how I would feel if I was still with the ex? How much more compounded would those moments become? That is what you will go thru. Over and over. If you have moved on, keep moving. You can even try to be friends, if you want. But you have healed. I only see discomfort and sadness in your future if you give her another chance.",

And we who have been cheated on share some kind of responsibility to how our SO's felt before the cheating. But they still made their choices. Instead of trying to talk to you about her issues on you, she choose to sleep with another person. She choose to leave you for them when you found out and confronted her, instead of facing the consequences of trying to fix your relationship then. She ran to another guy, period...\n\nDo not take her back. And that is what you should tell her. You made mistakes with her. But you never knew. She never said nothing to you to try and talk them out and work on them. Despite all the plans on moving in together and even marriage; she choose to sleep with someone else for sex instead of talking to you about issues she had with your relationship. Again, she made her choices and now she can live her life with the results. Thank her for pointing some things out you did not know about such as issues she has, but at this point even though you believe it is true on her saying you was not great; you can not ever trust her again. You do not want her in your life, and you do not even want to think of being with her in a romantic relationship again with knowing she was with someone else while with you and running back to you when her life choices went to the toilet. You took time and healed, and you will not go back.\n\nBut in the end, she is trying to manipulate you into taking her back and such. She might have had issues with you, but like I said; she decided to never speak to you about it despite where it seemed your relationship was heading. She cheated on you for a while, then left you when you found out for them instead of facing the hardships of her choices for you and the relationship. Now she wants her life back, she lost, and should never get back.",

Without getting into too many details, things between them weren\u2019t as perfect as she thought they\u2019d be, and the whole relationship basically crashed and burned. She\u2019s been struggling ever since\u2014mentally, emotionally, financially\u2014it\u2019s been a rough year for her.\n\nAwww, puddin\u2019\u2026 and it was just a celebration for YOU. Brother, this woman is a narcissist. She is only thinking about herself, and not what you have been through.\n\n>But here\u2019s the part that I wasn\u2019t really prepared for: she also brought up a lot of things about our relationship that I never considered. She said that while cheating on me was 100% wrong, she felt like I wasn\u2019t the best boyfriend either. According to her, I didn\u2019t always make her feel appreciated, and she resented me for that. She mentioned that I was emotionally distant at times, more focused on my work or hobbies, and she felt like she wasn\u2019t a priority. She didn\u2019t use it as an excuse, but she said that built-up resentment contributed to her being tempted by someone who made her feel wanted.\n\nSo, she is not JUSTIFYING her actions, which means if you ARE foolish enough to take her back, there is NO GUARANTEE that she won\u2019t do this to you AGAIN. In fact, the odds are that she WILL because NO ONE is perfect. \n\nThank her for the tip and move on\u2026 NONE of this makes cheating excusable.\n\n>After we finished talking, she asked if we could try again. She claims she\u2019s learned from her mistakes and wants to rebuild what we had. \n\nYeah, she learned to justify herself. She figured out how to manipulate you and tell you what you want to hear. \n\nNO THANKS\u2026 You don\u2019t want to be her SECOND CHOICE. She DISCARDED you in the worst way when something \u201cbetter\u201d (from HER distorted perspective, not reality) came along.\n\n>She told me she\u2019s willing to take things slow and prove she\u2019s different now, but I\u2019m torn. On one hand, I\u2019ve done a lot of healing in the past year, and I don\u2019t know if I can\u2014or should\u2014go back. \n\nFor starters, she would need to have taken full responsibility for what she did\u2026 not apologize with a \u201cyeah, but\u2026\u201d (Yeah, I did this, BUT, it\u2019s because YOU sucked\u2026)\n\nYou would have to POLICE her ALL THE TIME and you will STILL doubt her. You will never feel safe with her.\n\n>On the other hand, I can\u2019t lie, hearing her admit her mistakes and explain her side of things made me feel... something. Maybe it's closure, maybe it's sympathy, maybe it's old feelings creeping back. I honestly don\u2019t know.\n\nTrust me from someone who was foolish enough to fall for this crap\u2026 she is not safe. You are setting yourself up for MORE pain. Take the closure you got and RUN AWAY. Cut her off completely. Don\u2019t TRUST YOURSELF to be \u201cjust friends\u201d with her. It will easily evolve into old habits. You will likely sleep together again\u2026\n\n>Now I\u2019m just confused. Part of me wants to move on and never look back, but another part of me is questioning whether we both made mistakes that could be fixed now that we\u2019ve grown. I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s just trying to ease her guilt, or if there\u2019s a real chance at something better.\n>What would you guys do? Is there any point in trying to rebuild, or is it better to leave the past where it belongs?\n\nNo, no, and no\u2026",

She literally told you that she views you as #2 to some rando she met at the gym...",

The best thing you can really do for her is to walk away and let her really learn and mature from the situation she put herself in. Even if you do take her back, you'll always remember what she did and wonder when the next pretty boy will come along and make her 'feel good'. She probably really does regret her choice, but instead of facing the consequences of her actions, she's hoping you'll bail her out. She made her bed. Let her lie in it.",

She can\u2019t very well ask someone to do something that she wouldn\u2019t do herself.\n\nWill you be able to fully respect yourself?\n\nWill you honestly be able to trust her a second time around, or will there always be a nagging thought in the back of your mind? A relationship without trust is very unhealthy. \n\nLast, do you see evidence in her social media that reflects the misery she claims to have been experiencing the past year? Someone pleading their case as she is will only paint a picture to draw sympathy from you, just as a lawyer would. She knows you\u2019re a kind person, so is she just pushing your buttons? Saying all the right things? Did she leave out the part when she and her friends went to the beach for a week and got hammered and drilled?\n\nOnly you can answer these questions. All we can do is tell you what we see from the outside, looking in. You\u2019ve come a long way recovering, after taking a big hit. What you\u2019re contemplating comes with the risk of undoing that. There are 8.2 billion people on this planet. Some worse, and some better.\n\nGood Luck. I hope you find happiness.",

It's not right that she went looking for that elsewhere, or that she never even communicated her needs in the first place.

Like a sports team looks out for each other and is attentive and reasuring. This strengthend the bound. Thats how it is when the relationship is healthy. Both should do so! Not only the man. Man needs the same! \n\nIf you miss attention and validation, then it should comunicated and you need find a healthy balance. But normaly you ask your partner about cerain things, what he or she things about, and get this way attention and validation when needed. When the partner is not available for some time because of life circumstances, then it will be not a problem, since your own \"happiness\" should not depend on it. You should be feeling content with your self by your own, at least in normal situations.\n\nSofar to the healthy situation! Now to the unhealthy part!\n\nWhat attention and validation should NOT be and not used as is to make the partner happy and boost the otherwise low self esteem. This ends in a unhealthy actualy \"NEED\" of constant attention and validation to hold the mood up. This can and should been seen like an addiction, like a happy pill you swollow, when you feel down. You start making your partner responsible and only him or her (some men have the same problems) for your happiness. You loose or never had other \"healthy\" ways to feel good and content with your self. And like addicts often those people crave for the attention and validation like an addict after the drugs, what leads that they loose the control and ignore/violate more and more boundaries. The number of rectifications and the blameshifting starts to increase and finaly resenments are build up.\n\nI know many women love attention and validation so do men. BUT your self esteem and feeling of self worth never should depend on it. You should not use it to feel better, \"wanted\". \n\nWhat realy causes problems in many relationships that men are overly attentive when they get to gether. They try to win with this attention and validtaion \"the love\" of women. In this early stages of dating the rules and expectations are set. The woman get some what used to it. When they feel bad they think back how much attention and valdiation they got from their partner. And they miss it, not seeing that this was not and can not be the standard. And when men stay so attentive and give as much validation like at the start, the women get used to even more and the impact of their well being get slowly lowered. It also often happends that this attention makes them build up resentments for a lot of causes, like not deserving it or feeling cornered etc. SInce the still want need the attention and valdiation and what they get from their partner is tained they start to look else where and feel totaly rectified, because the partner is not able to provide it any longer.\n\nYea, the thats the problem when attention and validation becomes a to big part of the life!",

This story is 3 years in the making and it will take a good deal of time to get through it all, but this is well worth the time (or so I've been told). Since my confrontation, I have been documenting the ups and downs of cheating, narcissist partners, child custody, divorce and moving on. This is a diary entry of sorts, cathartic in style. So buckle up, grab some snacks, and put on a pot of coffee. You can start my journey here:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating\\_stories/comments/kg886u/my\\_husband\\_is\\_currently\\_on\\_a\\_vacation\\_with\\_his/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/kg886u/my_husband_is_currently_on_a_vacation_with_his/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**The Other Mom 4/20/24**  \nOne of the great things about no contact is there is no drama. But that results in less posts to read. So I\u2019m sorry for that but things have actually been great with my ex. We speak occasionally and it\u2019s strictly about the kids.  He has even given me a date for their trip out to visit them. Only 2 months and they will be gone for 6 weeks. I desperately miss them when they are gone but I do love my solo time. Bittersweet I suppose. I plan to use the weeks they are away and really hammer out my book. I wrote several pages as a prequel to my story and got into detail about the days after I found out and how I confronted him. It has been tough to relive those moments but it actually makes me feel a bit silly. That girl thought her world was over. But in reality, it was just the beginning. I never thought I\u2019d be this happy and happiness wasn\u2019t even a thought during the early days. It was all about survival. I\u2019m slowly expanding on my post for the books and it makes me so happy to read the progress in every post. People always comment on my growth but to read it and see it as I am now I agree with you all. Oh how far I (we\u2019ve) come!\n\nBut with every stage of life there are new challenges. My new challenge is my boyfriend\u2019s ex.  When my boyfriend and I met I was officially divorced  and he was separated. Their divorce papers were at the court but they had been separated for some time. I made sure I was not the other woman and even met her. No, it wasn\u2019t like a scheduled meeting, but they lived in the same apartment complex and we were kinda neighbors. This was a choice on their end to live in very close proximity for co-parenting purposes. It was a good choice for their son but made it slightly awkward for me lol. In the 2 years that we have been together I\u2019ve done a lot for their son.  I\u2019ve treated him as one of my own. We\u2019ve gone on vacations together, birthday parties, gifts on every holiday, hosted him at my home and taken him to my family\u2019s beach house. I thought that\u2019s what co-parenting is; including your partner's child in the family you are creating, right? While I\u2019m not my ex\u2019s fiancee's biggest fan, she does take care of the boys when they visit. She makes it a bit easier for me as we never interact due to distance. But I do have her phone number and if needed we can talk. This only happens during the summer days the boys are with her.  While we will never be friends and I can\u2019t forget what she did, I have to forgive so that we can move on. It\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s the right thing to do for the kids.\n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s ex makes this a bit more difficult for me. It\u2019s almost like she refuses to acknowledge my existence. I don\u2019t ever expect us to be BFFs and braid each other's hair, but I would expect us to have an amicable relationship. And when it comes to her co-parenting their son it\u2019s even worse. In the past 2 years I've noticed behaviors that should be addressed by a neurologist and a behavioral therapist. I stayed quiet for quite some time thinking it wasn\u2019t my place, but I broke my silence when we moved in together. His ex wasn\u2019t convinced he needed assistance when he (she won't talk to me and asks not to be on speaker around me) brought it up to her. She just excused it away saying \u2018that\u2019s just the way he is\u2019. But it\u2019s not, that\u2019s how you allow him to be. After he came to stay with us for 3 weeks it was evident that there were issues. We don\u2019t get long periods of time with him often to see the extent of his issues but this last visit made it very apparent to my boyfriend. How could she be with her son everyday and not see any of this? My boyfriend said they talked about his issues/behavior when he was younger but no actions were taken. Thinking he may grow out of it. Apparently after she moved away everything became much worse and still nothing was done. The child finally saw a doctor and I was correct. The doctor said within 5 minutes of the appointment she was confident he was in need of medication and therapy. Five minutes!!! He\u2019s not my biological child, I know that, but when was she going to do something about her son if I/we did not intervene? I know I would have acknowledged the red flags and gotten him help ASAP. I know that because I did it for my son at the age of 4; her son is 9.\n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u2018they live states away, don\u2019t stress yourself out about it\u2019. But, I have to stress. After moving twice and her son attending 3 schools in 1 1/2 years, she is moving to my state to be closer to my boyfriend. I will have to interact and co-parent more frequently very soon. I hope this move brings about the stability and structure this young boy needs. Honestly, it almost seems to me that she never expected my boyfriend to move on. That he was just going to stay a bachelor and dedicate himself to her needs but disguised as their son's. For example, she would call him to carry groceries into her apartment. Like, what?! She needed help with a remote for their son and she called him over. Am I too stubborn and independent or is that what exs actually do? It was like getting a husband on call yet she filed for the divorce. When talking to my friends about this, they think she still loves my boyfriend (and she might) but she has remarried. She doesn\u2019t live with her husband as he\u2019s currently living abroad so she wants to move before he comes to live here. I know you have questions about her marital arrangement but that\u2019s not my story to tell, but it\u2019s a good one.. I\u2019ve made so much progress with my ex and resolving our issues and now that I\u2019m in a good place it feels as if there are a whole new set of problems. When does it end?? Cheating, separation, divorce, co-parenting, rebuilding yourself, finding love, blending families, dealing with the ex.... what level am I on in this game? When do I fight the big boss and end this? Who's got a cheat code for me?? But more importantly, how do I find a happy medium between us all? For coparenting to work all parties must give it their all. I plan to give it my all but I'm uncertain if she will play her part. But I will advocate for her child, nurture him and give him some much needed structure and stability, whether or not she likes the situation. As the other mom that's my responsibility and he will be treated no different than my own kids while in my care.\n\n**Rage (7/10/24)**\n\nThere is no other word to describe it. I really wish there was. Today I felt seething rage that caused me to lose my composure. The end of June the boys left to visit with my ex. There was an all too familiar meet up at the airport, one that has become our drop off/pick up routine. But this time my boyfriend join. I must say that I had so much anxiety about this moment, but when the moment did arise it was nothing special. My BF being respectful, hung back for the drop off, until I encouraged him to join. The men shook hands and exchange words about the heat. It was not eventful. Perhaps I played this all up in my mind. I think women are very different then men. It's still, 'Hey. What's up', no matter the history between men. Women? We will take that shit to the GRAVE. I think I'm envious of men for this ability. Again, I think I am. Jury is still out. Now, lets get to the rage.\n\nFor the past year my youngest son has gone through therapy to work out his trauma, join a sport he is dedicated to in which he learned discipline and structure, and has excelled behaviorally and academically in school. I'm so proud. My boyfriend is proud. This teachers and coaches are proud. We all salute this little man for his efforts. Only 2 weeks into this cross country visit do I get a text from my ex that reads:\n\n*\"I\u2019ll be honest. I\u2019m not seeing all the good you mentioned coming out of therapy. His words are really cutting lately. Saturday night driving home from the BBQ, he said he wasn\u2019t having fun here and that he wanted to go back to NJ. He\u2019s rude to anyone that has a different opinion than him.\"*\n\nGood for you kid. If you ever feel uncomfortable or unhappy, please speak your mind.  Express how you feel and never bottle anything up inside. This was something we worked on in therapy and I'm happy to see him doing this. But, this statement made me feel so angry. My son has worked so hard to 'be better' over the last year and here he i utilizing what he has learned and my ex is chastising him for it. You sir, can F all the way off. Cue the rage. This was my response:\n\n*\"\\_\\_\\_\\_ I\u2019m gunna be really honest right now but I\u2019m saying this to help, not hurt. Our son was in therapy and diagnosed with an adjustment disorder. The therapist explained it to me like PTSD stemming from the divorce and you leaving. This past year he put in work to improve. He went to therapy, played a sport multiple season for consistency and structure, made friends, his school behavior improved dramatically. I put in the work too with the sports, therapy, school meetings, play dates, and getting a house for stability. We have put in work and there was so much improvement his therapist says he doesn\u2019t need to come anymore and his teachers and coaches comment on how kind he is.*  \n*What hasn\u2019t happened is you putting in work for him to get better. Said you\u2019d come to a game, didn\u2019t come. Said you join in on therapy, didn\u2019t join. Said you\u2019d come here sometimes, you didn\u2019t come. Said you\u2019d call more often, rarely call. Why would you expect him to be on his best behavior for you when you haven\u2019t for him?*  \n*This is tough for him. He wasn\u2019t even 5 when you moved out. He doesn\u2019t know you as a dad cause he has no consistent memory of it. So because he doesn\u2019t know you as a dad, and you haven\u2019t acted like a consistent dad he is angry, confused and acting out.*  \n*I\u2019m saying this not to upset you but help you. If you wanna see change in him you have to put in the work too. You have to do more than see him for 7 weeks out of the year to build that relationship with him so he starts respecting you as a dad. There is zero excuse. If you don\u2019t do more now he will start refusing to go there when he\u2019s a teen and then your relationship is done. It\u2019s a hard truth and I\u2019m sorry.\"*\n\nHe then got angry and tried to end the conversation because I was 'finger pointing' when he was just looking for advice. What about his statement asks for advice? I get it, no one liked to hear how they messed up. No one liked their noses rubbed in their mistakes. But instead of focusing on what could be done for our son, he focuses on himself. I made an appointment with the boys' therapist today and told her all of this. I wanted her to be prepared for the 'clean up' she would have to do upon their return. She gave me advise, and assured me I was doing everything right for them. I know I am. It's always been my focus. But at what point do I put my foot down and stop the damage he does every summer (and beyond)? She is going to reach out to him and ask to suggest a virtual appointment for him and my son. Lets see if he agrees. I hope he does, but we all know he won't. He likes to complain, play victim, and demand of others but won't take and accountability or action on his end. The boys wont be home for 3 1/2 weeks. I just hope upon their return I can right the wrongs they experienced. A mother's work is never done.\n\n**The Return (9/22/24)**\n\nThe boys were set to return on August 3rd. They boarded their flight and unfortunately the weather did not cooperate and a storm cause them to divert to another city. This city was about 7 hours away. My ex let me know that all flights that evening have been grounded and they were stuck there for the night. I'm actually happy that this happened. One of the sticking point on our agreement was at which age the boys can fly solo. I pushed for 15, he wanted 12. We settled on 13. Next summer my oldest will be 13 so I knew he'd make a plea for their solo travel to save himself a buck. Now if he tries next summer I will remind him of how the boys got stuck in a city overnight, and if that happens again they will be alone. So maybe this happened for a reason. My ex opted to rent a car and drive the 7 hours, at night, through a storm. Guess he was really looking forward to returning them...\n\nThey returned at almost 6 am and the boys were a ball of energy. They were excited for their return and their adventure. I hugged them in the driveway and measured them against myself; I swear they each grew a foot. My ex looked weathered from the journey. His under eyes were puffy, his skin was pale. He was not in good shape. But I was grateful he put forth the effort to return the boys safely and promptly. I spoke to my boyfriend and he agreed if my ex needed to get some sleep he can stay for a bit and take a nap. I know what you are going to say, 'oh you're too nice!'. Yes, maybe I am, but he did just go above and beyond and I will always be the bigger person, even though he's a jerk. He had a 3pm flight booked that day so was able to get a few hours sleep. He slept through his alarm and even when I sent the children upstair to wake him he was out cold. So here I went, like I did daily for years, up the stair to shake him violently. He was fetal on top of the blankets fully dressed. I noticed his phone wallpaper was the boys and that was nice to see. I hope the reminder of them daily motivates him to call more after this trip. I shook him and he woke with a startle. I could tell he was dazed and very confused to see me over him. Did he think maybe these past few years was all a dream? His dream and my nightmare. His eyes came into focus and remembered why this was happening. He seemed a bit embarrassed, or awkward. I can't quite put my finger on why. He came downstair and had breakfast while the boys recanted their nights adventure with him. And almost as if on cue, my handsome, fit boyfriend (yea, idk how I landed this one, ladies) entered the kitchen; shirtless. He forgot my ex was there but this moment was delicious for me. Yup, I upgraded, no question about it. My ex sat there taking it in and I swear I openly smiled for him to see. My boyfriend said good morning to him and wrapped himself around me. My boyfriend must have done this on purpose, peacocking himself like this. For my benefit maybe, perhaps to prove he's the alpha in the house, I'm not sure exactly but I'm damn happy it happened. Is it petty? Sure, maybe. But I honestly don't care.\n\nMy ex walks out to the car and we exchange pleasantries. He tells the boys he will call when he gets home, he will return for a football game, and he can't wait to see them again as he already misses them. That was August 4th. As of today there has been no communication. Are you shocked? Yea, me neither. My youngest swears he attend a football game this year because, 'he said he will so he will'. I told my ex if he doesn't really plan on coming to tell me now so I can let my little one down now and not at the last game of the season. I sent him the schedule twice. He swears he will come. Let us wait and see. September is always busy. We all start school, sports, drum lessons, play dates, orthodontist appointments, etc. so i'm hoping he will forget, but I don't think he will. My little one gives him the most stress, but I think that's because he loves him so much and he is so angry and confused about the situation. The therapist agrees. I will admit the transition home has been better than I thought. Perhaps they know now how this goes; out of sight out of mind. Early September my ex reached out to my oldest telling him he would call that evening to see how their first day of school went. Spoiler: he never called. Like, why do all that? He could have just said I hope you have a great first day and eliminate the need to call. I confronted him on that and he told me a coworker died. Last time I confronted him about not calling when promised it was the stomach virus took him out. There will always be an excuse. A few days later it was my ex's birthday so the boys called him. After a few football practices or games my little ones calls him too. If you add it all up, the boys have called way more than he has. Is that sad, yea a little. But it also means eventually when the boys are older and busy with life they wont call; and my ex won't either. Relationship are two sided and my ex will eventually learn this the hard way. ",

If it gets to a point where there is negative progress, stop sending your children to him. Your ex and his AP clearly don't value them.",

I\u2019m mid way through a separation also, sadly stuck in the same house with my ex because we haven\u2019t been able to sell (it\u2019s been 2 years!) and I\u2019m sooooo desperate to start living my life with my kids without him hovering in my peripheral. I know once we are living separately he will do nothing to help or maintain contact with our kids. Your story has given me strength, I\u2019m looking forward to the next instalment x",

I figured it out using phone records and gps in her car and realized she was hiding his existence entirely from me. I waited a few months until the day after we dropped our last child at college then confronted her. She denied it and I moved out and got divorced. He\u2019s younger so I know she\u2019s since been losing weight via ozempic and posting about her wellness journey since I moved out. \n\nHave largely been no contact except for divorce and discussions regarding our children. One of our kids had a graduation last week and we had to attend the same ceremony and celebrations. I vowed to be kind and grey rock her while outwardly posing to be the happy former couple who get along. \n\nFor some reason we ended up sitting next to each other during the walk thru ceremony and had an hour to kill before the activities started. She started asking personal questions about my life, which I largely evaded. \n\nIt\u2019s important to note that over Easter break she introduced her affair partner to our children. They told me about him and asked if I knew about him, which I answered yes without providing more information to them. \n\nSince we had time to kill, I asked if my ex was happy with her boyfriend. She immediately went into a long denial about their relationship and said he was just a friend. I laughed and pointed out that she had been dating him for more than 2 years at this point and if I was him I would be pissed at not being called a boyfriend. \n\nShe started getting emotional and choked up and said she had a lot of regrets about the choices she made and doesn\u2019t like how life turned out. I asked her to be specific about what choices she regretted making but she went quiet. \n\nI ended the conversation feeling pity for her. She\u2019s been living a lie for so long that she literally has no concept of the truth of our demise nor will she take any responsibility for her role in same. \n\nI drove home feeling like a winner for the first time in this whole situation. \n\nIt gets better.

No need to gloat there is no winner, everyone lost me included.\n\nIt sounds like that\u2019s where you are OP. I hope whatever you tell your kids that you lead with love and compassion. You don\u2019t need to be empathetic but you don\u2019t need to be an ass. Be the person you want your kids to think you are. If your ex can still be a good mother don\u2019t take that away from them. They are old enough and can determine how to move forward for themselves.\n\nBest of luck and please update me!",

Me and my wife have been married just over 2 years. We just had a son and he is 3 months old. My wife has this terrible drinking problem. If she drinks liquor, of any kind, she\u2019s like a demon\u2026 like something is mentally wrong with her when she drinks. She\u2019s had this problem ever since we have gotten together. But over time it has just gotten so much worse. She will break tv\u2019s, punch me, kick me, slap me, force sex and then beat me again until she passes out on the floor and pisses herself. One time she went to the neighbors house around 2am and woke them up to try and make friends. They called the police on her. Just an example of the nightmare she becomes while drinking. \nI refused to buy her liquor (beer and wine seemed to be ok) but occasionally if she could find a way to get liquor she would. And there is no getting the bottle away from her..\nAfter I finished my first contract we moved duty stations. I invited my brother to live with us and pay rent so that he could grow up and get out of my mothers house. I figured this would be the best way for him to learn responsibility. \nHe is pretty much a loser. But he got a job and paid rent on time. I only made him pay half of what it costs him to live here so that he could save up enough to move out and start his own life. He\u2019s been with us for a year now. \nFast forward to 2 weeks ago he got fired. He is also an alcoholic and \u201chas to drink himself to sleep because he has insomnia\u201d \nThe three of us usually got along pretty well. We would play board games, disc golf, and cook for each other. But she had recently been hangin out with him in his room every so often (because he has liquor). I expressed the issues to both of them. I have threatened divorce if she kept drinking and things were fine again after one shitty night. \nLast night she had a bottle of cheap wine. Which is usually fine. We had sex and then she took a bath at around 1am. I fell asleep while she was in there. Only to wake up to my son screaming 2 hours later. I take care of him and put him to sleep. She\u2019s nowhere to be found. Walk into my brothers room and BOOM. There she is. In his arms and on his chest. \nI can\u2019t feel. I can\u2019t think. I can\u2019t breathe. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI kicked my brother out without letting him grab anything. I told him to fucking run. And he did. \nShe won\u2019t stop crying. My son won\u2019t stop crying. And I\u2019m in a world of pain",

He was like the guy I\u2019ve always thought to be with, he planned a day trip for me with his friends, took care of me, reminded me of how my dad would take care of me when we were in public,he would be protective of me till the right amount not in a toxic way, he was literally the perfect boyf. \n\nFeb 16 he asked me out at the airport when he was flying to India for holiday and I was going back to Sydney, it was cute and stuff. \n\nForgot to mention Feb 15th he also cried for me while we  were just chilling on the couch, hugged me tightly and started crying. \n\nOnce he went back to India almost everything changed, when we were in Melbourne I casually asked him how would we would do long distance when he\u2019s in India and I\u2019m in Sydney. He was there for month so I think talking about doing long distance for a month ( Mumbai and Sydney) was an important conversation to have before we separate. He told me we\u2019ll be good at it we don\u2019t need to worry, trying to comfort me, he just told me he will be meeting family and friends so he won\u2019t be using his phone that much which I thought was completely fine. \n\nWhen he went to India the texts were dry and boring, he didn\u2019t call much, I didn\u2019t think anything about it cause he did in fact tell me that that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be. I was missing him so much and I just wanted to talk to my boyfriend but i sucked it up. \n\nWe have our Snapchat locations on for each other to see, (I\u2019m 19 and he\u2019s 22) idk if older people are judging me for that cause my sister who\u2019s 25 makes fun of me and my boyfriend for keeping track of each other on Snapchat. I think it\u2019s fine and we were still building each other trust at that point cause we were still not that into the relationship. Idk we did trust each other but I feel like giving reassurance in a long distance relationship has to be done consistently at least early on. \n\nEven though his texts were lesser, calls were fewer, he always used to update me on whatever he\u2019s doing but this one day he went off for 2/3 hours and I got super anxious. I checked his location and saw he was in someone\u2019s building. I still think to this day he cheated on me that day but he always denies it and says he was with his mom- his mom had gone to a friends house to buy gold and he was just waiting in the car for 2/3 hours\u2026. That\u2019s obv a lie \n\nFew days later I was still scared that I might\u2019ve been cheated on and idk how to explain the feeling of feeling getting cheated on. \n\nI met my friends, on of my friends asked if we should check if he\u2019s on hinge and we went on to check if he\u2019s on hinge in mumbai and shockingly YES he was on huge while being my fucking boyfriend. \n\nI confronted him literally that moment- I sent him a snap of his account on hinge which was kinda funny. I asked him if he could give me an explanation. \n\nHis explanation was that it was made for his friend and he wasn\u2019t using the account. Me and my friend literally saw that \u201chis friend\u201d already has an account on hinge so idk why his friend needed his own account AND my boyfriend\u2019s hinge account to find girls to fuck. \n\n\nAnyways I didn\u2019t believe it and he kept telling me the same story, tried to convince me to still be with him because as soon as I saw the hinge account I wanted to leave the relationship. \n\nHe begged me to stay. Tried to manipulate me to stay. \n\nNow the problem is I know he\u2019s trying to manipulate me I do realise he had a fucking hinge account while being my boyfriend and I know he\u2019s a cheater and might cheat on me again. \n\nBut it\u2019s so hard to say no and move on from the relationship because we  did have plans for this relationship to work out, our friends were involved, my sister was also introduced to him by me. So even rn I do think we might work, he\u2019ll change, he won\u2019t cheat again, HE\u2019LL FINALLY REALISE who he fucking lost cause I was such a good girlfriend to him I\u2019m not boasting about myself but I genuinely gave my 100% to this guy. \n\nHe still won\u2019t agree that he made that account for him self and he is just constantly telling me the hinge account which had HIS PICTURES, were for his friend to use and not my boyf. \n\nAfter a lot of talking, him trying to convince me to stay and all that, I think his manipulation has in face affected me in a way where I can\u2019t even leave this relationship but also I do really like him I love this guy. I know he cheated I know he\u2019s on hinge but I still don\u2019t know why I do love him. I think he\u2019ll change but everyone\u2019s saying he will cheat again. \n\nAnyways it\u2019s 3 of March and I just told him to text me when he\u2019s back on the 13th because when he\u2019s in Melbourne (at least that I know of) he never behaves like this. And I think in Melbourne he doesn\u2019t cheat and stuff. I don\u2019t know how to explain this but yeah. \n\nYeah so right now CURRENTLY we are on break till he\u2019s back to melb on the 13th of March. I told him do whatever tf you want fuck whoever idc im done keeping an eye on you on snapchat it\u2019s affecting my sleep and stuff. He told me to not do all of this but then I just said we really need this break cause honestly I was too mentally exhausted by all of this. \n\nWe\u2019re on a break rn idk why I miss him so much. \n\nIdk if things in my mind will change once he\u2019s back to Melbourne I wanna get back with him but also know that I will be getting hurt in the future. I just really wanna see where this relationship goes and I might be delusional but I do see him (if he changes) things will work out beautifully for us cause we actually are really good together. \n\nIdk rn idk if I wanna be with him cause like I saw his hinge, but also I wanna be with him because of \u201cwhat if\u201d reasons. \n\nI\u2019m just really confused. \n\nIdk if he\u2019ll feel guilty idk if he\u2019ll realise what a good girl he lost cause I stg I was really good, I gave my 100% that\u2019s all.period. \n\nHe still cheated\ud83e\udd27\n\nWhy is it so hard to get over someone and move on from the relationship when they\u2019ve literally disrespected you in the worst way possible by being on hinge? \n\nAnd also I know everything happened too fast (in like 2 months) but I am attached to him.",

Then pensions cannot exceed 50%, after a 10 year marriage nor more than 65% in child support payments.\nIf married for 10 or more years and the service member is disabled the spouse cannot get any of the disability but child support can be taken.\n\nCalifornia can direct a spouse to send in a claim under their laws for a portion of military retirement and disability, under their claim of community property but it will not be approved by the federal government, DoD to be paid as it is not legal under USFSPA.\n\nWhere child support is concerned, pensions can be garnished until the legally dependant child or children become adults without advanced education or until dependant children reach a specified number of years in advanced education.\n\nWhoever says they were married for less than 10 years and is paying their military pension to that spouse, is not being honest.\nNo state or federal court can order such payments. Only the POTUS can change the policy, as commander in chief. It cannot be changed for one individual.\n\nYour friend could be giving her a portion of his retirement to compensate for civilian pay, as military retirement cannot be included as community or marital property, but DoD is not cutting her a portion of it. As is the case in marriages lasting 10 years or more or in cases of child support via DD form 2293.\n\nIf you owe spousal support and your income is less than it was during the divorce. It's on that person to address the court and update it. Or continue to pay the amount out of your pocket.",

I didn\u2019t talk to my ex (25F) for about 10 days, but we eventually agreed to meet. She was remorseful but didn\u2019t actually apologize to me. I got some more to the story. \n\nShe was at the bar and met a former local college football player who was in town. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s famous nationally (like NFL) or just locally (played only in our local college). She basically said she went to his hotel because it was gonna be one of those once in a lifetime chances. \n\nShe said it was awful and she regretted it. Painful. He didn\u2019t care. He made her buy her own Uber back to her car. She took a pregnancy test afterwards and of course I knew none of this till the chlamydia appeared weeks later.\n\nWe argued. Sleeping with a former college football player is NOT A FLEX! He sleeps with anyone, my guess would be 400 skanks\u2026 now 401.

You deserve respect, security, dignity, and above all, to be happy.\n\nIn my honest opinion, cheating is an act of cowardice based on short-term gratification. This person who cheated could have made ANY other choice if there were issues in the relationship besides cheating. They could have addressed problems with you and communicated.\n\n They could have gone to therapy or counseling, and they could have divorced and not betrayed you. Instead, they chose the most selfish option because their PP or giney was tingling. Any frothy emotional appeal is, at best, a specious form of justification and, at worst, a delusion.\n\nTheir actions, at the very least, displayed that they are a liability and weak in some way. Be strong. It hurts. It will continue to hurt. Don't let what you are feeling destroy you.\n\nMy advice is to not react emotionally. Don't give them the satisfaction or hold on you. They don't know that you know they failed and cheated. You have the tactical advantage of suprise and proof to expose them. This alone can be used in a myriad of ways such as divorce, complaint to the company, exposure to family and friends, or more.\n\nDon't act emotionally or lash out until you've decided what you want this to look like and what you want. \n\nGET LEGAL COUNSEL. FIGURE OUT YOUR OPTIONS. ACT WITH REASON.\n\n Take care of yourself. Eat, sleep, work out, focus on hobbies and those that love you. As someone who divorced, I can tell you that life goes on. \n\nYou are in a shit situation you didn't ask for. You need to decide what you want your life to look like. None of this is fair. But you are strong. You matter.\n\nGET LEGAL COUNSEL OR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE IF POSSIBLE BEFORE YOU ACT.",

I watched a true crime episode where a woman was cheating all the time and the husband had confronted his wife over six times about the men but failed to act. She was a trouble student teacher and he eventually caught her with a young student. He was finally hitting rock bottom and ready to leave. Little did he know she was recruiting this young man to harm him. In The end he was set to move out the following day but that night she killed him out of desperation. I\u2019m not suggesting your wife is capable of this, but the amount of disdain she must have for you to do this repeatedly with different men is very real. Please don\u2019t under estimate the level of hate this action takes. This is the scariest form of hate because it\u2019s hidden behind kisses and smiles and when it strikes you, you never see it coming. Think \ud83e\udd14 Scott Peterson and what was truly in his heart for his wife and daughters. He didn\u2019t just wake up one day and decide to kill his family. The cheating, the lying , the disdain and hate for his family had been brewing and one day it culminated in the deaths of his wife and daughters. It not death that\u2019s at the end of these stories. In most cases it\u2019s just the husband being blinded sided in a divorce and accused of domestic violence and being tossed out of your house and still paying all the bills. I urge you to get in front of this snake before it bites you.",

            "text": "So link the original, here\u2019s the update:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/s/IPPwzsKcRO\n\nWell, a lot has happened in the last 30 odd days since posting, it feels like I posted that months ago with how stressful everything has been. \n\nAs I kind of expected, the husband back-pedalled and decided he could save his marriage, he had no idea she had 3 different escape routes planned to run away with my ex. I had anonymously reported it but I will never get an update on it, I assume it\u2019ll just flag up when they begin the divorce proceedings. \n\nMe and my ex were still cohabiting until about a week ago after we just couldn\u2019t deal with the constant arguing. We\u2019d be fine and peaceful and then screaming at each other over the smallest thing. My final straw was when my ex decided to just completely ignore my existence after I\u2019d done him the favour of driving him to and from work due to his car being broken down, and then asking for a lift to the gym where I also got dressed to go, to be told I\u2019m not allowed to because she\u2019s there and I make HER uncomfortable\u2026 When I informed him that I wouldn\u2019t be changing anything I do for her benefit, he told me that I was a cruel and horrible person for not being more supportive of their love for each other and that I deserved to be unhappy. \n\nI laughed in his face, threw him out of my car, drove home, packed all of his belongings and dropped them off at his mother\u2019s house. By dropped, I mean threw out the car drive by style and called her to get them off the street before they got stolen. I then stewed for a bit and drove to the other woman\u2019s house. \n\nI told the family everything, her father in law was probably the angriest out of all of them. I showed them everything and gave them copies of everything. The husband and her tried to cover it up as fun \u201ccouple sex games\u201d but I gave the parents enough evidence to know that that wasn\u2019t true and even if it was, she was at least aware of me and that he was in a relationship with me. During this, the husband discovered that she had already been in contact with lawyers about how she could divorce him but stay in the country so they\u2019ve now begun divorce proceedings anyway and she is going back to her home country, she has also blocked my ex on everything because he wasn\u2019t supposed to keep her nudes / sexts etc. He\u2019d also lied to her about living with me and talking to me - as far as she was aware, once I\u2019d discovered the cheating, he\u2019d moved out and was no-contact with me and the odd occasion she\u2019d been at the gym and seen us together, he\u2019d explained it away as co-incidence. \n\nMy ex is blocked on everything and living with his mum. I\u2019ve returned his car to the dealership and accepted the payment plan they\u2019ve given me for leaving the contract early. \n\nI\u2019m just waiting to hear back from a cute little one bed 10mins from where I live now and \u00a3400 cheaper with a garden for my dogs. I\u2019ll lose my deposit, and will owe them money for the damage he\u2019s done to the house but I don\u2019t care anymore. \n\nI won\u2019t get to witness any more of the fall out but I\u2019ve seen enough to be able to carry on with my life knowing I\u2019ve hurt them as much as they\u2019ve hurt me. It\u2019s petty, but it\u2019s made me feel better. \n\nThis account will be pretty much non-active from now on as I do my best to move on and fix the insecurities, distrust and lack of self confidence that have arisen. Thank you to everyone for your support and advice - I was truly alone, and it was a comfort to know strangers from all over the world could band together for our joined hatred of cheaters \ud83d\ude02\n\n",
