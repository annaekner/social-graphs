            "text": "I voted for Trump in 2016 and 3rd party in 2020. Grew up in a Republican household listening to Rush Limbaugh because my parents did, and became an independent in college after becoming disillusioned by the GOP, but would often vote \u201csocially conservative\u201d. I still have what most of Reddit would call very conservative values, but what my Republican friends would call liberal values. I have no real political home. My ballots usually look like a weird mix of voting Republican, 3rd party, and Democrat down ballot. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n Anyway.\n\nAt the start of the year I would have told you that I would vote 3rd party, but I got into that little ballot cubicle yesterday and I just couldn\u2019t do it. Trump has given American voters a non-stop litany of reasons not to vote for him, even if you are a conservative. It\u2019s like if he said to himself \u201cwhat could I do to turn voters against me\u201d and by golly he did it. And not just reasons not to vote for him, but it\u2019s like he\u2019s screaming at us to vote against him and make sure he loses. \n\nSo I think Harris will carry Michigan because I know so many people in a similar situation. If someone like John McCain was running against Harris I could and probably would vote for him. Trump isn\u2019t a \u201cconservative\u201d. It\u2019s baffling to hear people think he is. Too much is at stake. Every 4 years it\u2019s \u201cthis is the most important election of our lifetime\u201d but now it actually feels like it. It\u2019s different than any other election in my lifetime. \n\nOne day I hope we will have two or more viable sane political parties to choose from again instead of feeling like \u201cI have to vote against the other party\u201d. But for now, this conservative stands firmly with the rest of you - and I voted Democrat in the presidential election for the first time. \n\n Last thing I would say to my Democrat friends, please don\u2019t fight and argue political issues with your conservative friends who are also voting for Harris and accidentally push them back into voting for Trump. At least not right now. I have witnessed that happen a couple of times in the heat of an argument. I feel like right now all social issues get set aside and we vote together as Americans to make sure Trump doesn\u2019t end up back in office. \n\n With that said, assume nothing and go vote. Voting early was easy. I just showed up and voted like I normally would on Election Day. Exact same process. The line looked crazy long, wrapping around the building outside, but I had voted and was gone in under an hour. ",

We aren't debating about what we should do about income inequality. About climate change. About runaway corporate power. About healthcare reform. That sort of thing.\n\nInstead we're arguing whether or not some people deserve basic human rights. Instead we're arguing about whether or not some of those issues above are *real* or if they're just some conspiracy. Instead we're afraid of helping the American people because one party has conditioned half the population to have a reflexive visceral reaction to \"socialism\".\n\nI'd love to say I'm an independent voter who doesn't care about party, but only one party lives in reality anymore, so I more or less vote blue no matter who, and hope that enough other people do that, that the Republican party dies, and the Democrats can split into \"moderate\" and \"leftist\" and we can actually start moving this country forward.",

Not his stance on the issues, because he doesn't have any.  Not his policies, again he doesn't have any.  It is his insane rhetoric.  His rhetoric is right out of the Nazi playbook.  His obvious love of dictators, and disdain for the US constitution is what takes him from just a weird-o who paints his face orange, to an actual threat to democracy.  That and his inability, unwillingness, and disinterest in actually doing the job.  He refuses to yield to experts, be it about hurricane response, pandemic response, or military treaty.  Like a true fool he thinks he is the smartest person in the room.   Hint... he isn't... like ever.   Except when he passes Melania to the toilet, then just maybe.    \n\nThe January 6th attack on the capitol was his doing.  He met with the proud boys in the previous December around Christmas.  This was Roger Stone's hair brained scheme and Trump went along with it.  \n\nNo one who values the USA way of life should make light of the attack on the capitol and the disruption of the peaceful transfer of power.",

My dad would tell me what the \"liberals\" believe and it made zero sense to me. Then I finally got my first real job outside the home/conservative Christian School/church, and actually met some of those \"liberals\" I'd heard so much about. Turns out the reason it never made sense to me was because I'd only heard about their beliefs second hand from conservatives. Once actually exposed to people on the left and found out what they actually believe and why, it made a lot more sense than conservatism. \n\nMy recommendation to all my conservative friends and family is to actually talk to people outside the bubble. Liberals do not, in fact, enjoy killing babies, don't hate Christianity on principle (most of them are some flavor of Christian), the most leftist person I know is a gunsmith, gay and trans people just want to exist and to be treated as people (that's their whole \"agenda\"). Not going to lie, there are leftist weirdos, but no one on the left likes them either. And unlike the current GOP, we don't let that guy anywhere near power, let alone be president. If you're open to learning what those on the left believe and why, you may still not agree with it, but it at least makes sense why someone might be inclined to believe what they believe. As I say to my conservative family members, \"I get where you're coming from, it's where I came from too. What I'm increasingly unable to understand is why you're staying there.\"",

Sadly, that is no longer the case for the Republican Party at this point in time, and it's beyond depressing to see how many Republican leaders have gone along with this betrayal to real conservatives. \n\nAnyway, thank you for doing what you did today.

From what I can tell, their platform would fit comfortably on the primary stage of Republican candidates in Nixon or Reagan\u2019s presidential runs.\n\nReagan wanted a form of Universal healthcare. Harris is to the right of that. Reagan never tried to outlaw abortion. He and Harris are on the same page there. Reagan could have started severe cut backs on Social Security, but he saved it. He and Harris are on the same page there - she is not talking about expanding or even shoring it up more than where it already is. Reagan raised taxes 3 times. Harris is proposing no tax increase for almost any working Americans. Adjusted for inflation our Unimaginably Enormous military budget is appreciably larger than under Reagan. Harris is certainly not talking about a reduction of the military budget.\n\nThe main difference I can see is that Reagan had a sore spot for unions and Harris has a warm spot for them. Otherwise she is almost a traditional Republican candidate as far as I can see.",

Politicians (above the state representative level) are things to be bought and sold, like the lawyers most of them used to be. So, it used to be one could tell how a politician could vote based on who they accepted donations from. \n\nThat changed with MAGA for the worse, as this cultural civil war we are in, as the Boomers die, and as a result the remaining ones lose power to control everything. And like the entitled children the Boomers are, they throw a fit collectively, which is the basis of the MAGA movement. They don't care about liberties, or rights, minus the ones they themselves endorse. As a Libertarian, that's horrific to me. \n\nI'm glad the \"Greatest Generation\" for the most part isn't alive to see the absolute cesspool of morality that the boomers (generally) represent. I personally cannot stand Kamala Harris's views on collectivization and socialism, but she's not batshit insane like Trump is. Harmful, having an axe to grind, and potentially inept as a politician, but she's not insane, nor threatening to act like a dictator on day one, or praising Hitler.

Don't get me wrong, there are issues we genuinely do deeply disagree on, but I think there are economic issues we're closer on. Democrats don't want the government to waste money, either. Most of us think you should work for your money. We want to have good jobs, affordable housing, etc. We might have different ideas on how to get there, but we want to get there.\n\nBut Trump has taken those issues off the table. Now it's about stuff like...do we want a democracy or not? Do we want to be ruled by a king again? And look, I get it, if I was convinced our elections were compromised, I'd want to fight, too. But what Trump is offering is not better elections after we get rid of all the \"enemies from within.\" He's offering, as an alternative, despotism with him in charge.\n\nAnd what it took to convince so much of the country that he actually won the election was so, freaking, little. All these years, all that bluster, and after all that, Trump goes on Joe Rogan and can't even present ONE piece of evidence he won the election? He says he'll bring it next time? When he filed all those lawsuits, his lawyers wouldn't even CLAIM there was fraud? \n\nIts frustrating to see so many people not see Trump for what he is: a con man, and not even a particularly good one. I see people talk about him and it's not even reality. Like, they just create a vision of him in their heads and pretend he's that instead of who he really is. He's pretty much become an imaginary friend to millions of people. How are we supposed to convince millions of people that their *imaginary friend* is bad? When they can just make up whatever they want about him and believe it like it's gospel truth? Joe Biden said in 2020 we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. In 2024, it feels like we're in a battle for reality itself. Like, it's a battle just to convince people that reality is what's real.\n\nImo, we are so past the old debates and arguments and things are just so far off into the weeds that the election can't even about those things anymore. I look at the times when the elections were about Medicare and social security as quaint, simple times, and it makes me sad.",

I value the melting pot of diversity I was always taught America became a beacon in the world for. Unfortunately there\u2019s become a clear voice of hatred coming from the GOP in the last decade especially that leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.\n\nI believe myself to be relatively centrist with conservative leaning individual ideals and liberal leaning social ideology. But conservatives would probably call me a liberal pussy anyway.\n\nThe Republican Party of today has become an obvious grift-a-thon set out to deregulate business in every unethical way. The tax cuts for the rich sicken me - that sweet sweet trickle down never fuckin works for the people. And the projection, hypocrisy, and lack of any moral compass anymore will ensure I never vote republican. \n\nI want to see tax dollars going to good use. Invest in education and health care and mental health and infrastructure. Set up future generations for success. I don\u2019t fucking understand how we\u2019ve allowed politics to be so blatantly toxic and parasitic to the American legislature and economy. \n\nSo while I\u2019m not out here shouting Harris from\nthe rooftops, she does have my vote so that we can squash trumps ass like a bug. I want better options. I want leaders. Real leaders who are actually passionate about putting the needs of the people first, changing bullshit in politics and in legislature, and setting our kids up for success. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too much to ask.",

Maternal and infant deaths increasing. \n\nSide note: America already had a huge problem with higher than other first world countries maternal mother deaths.

He didn\u2019t believe me and I easily found proof.\n\nNow\u2026 think about all the women who want to have babies and those babies need prenatal care and to be born. Now these moms have to drive much much further for access to care to take care of their baby.\n\nIf the mother experiences a medical emergency that fast care could save the baby\u2026 it may no longer be possible bc of these laws.\n\nThese laws don\u2019t only affect women who want to abort for whatever reason but it affects women who desperately want their baby!!!!\n\nSorry for the rant, but it may help others!",

However, right now all of our families, friends and neighbors are being threatened in various ways by a man that will stop at nothing to gain power and keep it. I wish I was saying this to be dramatic but it\u2019s the truth. We need to get past this so we can go back to our good ol political system where one person wins and the other loses but everyone respects our democracy by shaking hands and coming back to vote again in 4 years.

She had an extremely obviously photoshopped picture of herself looking professional, with a picture of her opponent, which was a screenshot from a tiktok video I guess, but with a grainy filter applied to it to make her look bad and unflattering. And then in it, went over all the things the school board lady was and what the marine biologist wasn't. Also went on about how the school board lady supports essentially outing kids sexuality to their parents and not giving them any privacy, that shes a republican, and so on. \n\n  \nAnd so I was like, ok, time to do some research on this lady, and turns out, she is apparently one of the dirtiest, conniving pieces of shit I've seen. \n\n  \nNeedless to say, she paid some sort of money to essentially lose a vote which was infinitely funny to me. Had she kept her stupid mouth shut, or rather, not been some dirty politician type, I would have voted for her, so thank god she did put that out, lol.\n\n  \nGranted its only my one vote, and the area I'm in is, predominately republican leaning, so it probably gained her more than it lost, but its like, I really hope this lady looses, when I wasn't super invested before.",

I don't call PD if I find like an old, rust coated revolver or rifle/shotgun. I will turn over more recent finds or something that could be salvageable for evidence (found 2 confirmed homicide weapons, potentially a third one recently that Lansing PD was looking for) \n\nThe firearms in the pictures below were the ones I found that I tried to turn over to Flint PD. I even tried through going to their police station, they rejected any firearm I've tried to turn in... I do end up finding ways to turn them over to my local police station, but I definitely don't wanna happened to be pulled over with stuff like that in the car and try to explain to an officer that I found them in a river then potentially get arrested anyways...\n\nThe PX4 Storm and Hi point had no paper trail, so PD surprisingly let me keep those, I am waiting to hear back about the revolver.

There must be a procedure out there in a state statute or federal law that addresses this issue, because if it could help solve a homicide case, it seems like some agency out there would want to know. My friend had 8 guns that she took from her mentally unstable boyfriend. She wanted an agency to hold them or just take them because he was having manic episodes and talking about hurting people. Ottawa county wanted nothing to do with them and didn't even ask for further information. I know this is an entirely different situation, but with the amount of crimes and tragedies that are the result of guns in the hands of the wrong people,  it seems like law enforcement agencies would have policies in place to handle these situations.

I could be wrong on that. \n\nThe first firearm I turned in that was linked to a homicide was a Beretta M9, which the guy used his own pistol (lived in Illinois) and he shot his wife and daughter, then fled up to Michigan and took the gun apart, I found the frame to the Beretta m9, police found the rest of the gun in a dumpster. The pistol frame was in maybe neat deep water, 15 feet out from shore at a park. The guy was caught in Rockford Michigan late 2021, remember exactly when. \n\nThe second gun was an M&P I found right by a railroad bridge in Grand Rapids, They already had the guy in custody but He wasn't in trial yet. I don't know if it started yet at all. I haven't gotten too much information and I haven't seen anything on the news about it. I didn't even get really a whole lot of information on who he killed or anything. All I know is he got drunk and he shot somebody and then he got scared and ditched it.",

Door guy said he would talk to the manager. While he was gone another guy came up, grabbed us and started walking us out of the building. My friend wouldn't move and was asking what the hell was going on. As we are trying to figure out what this new guy was doing the manager came up and was like \"I was going to let you in but if you are arguing with the bouncer you got to leave\".\n\nNothing we could do so we left. I went around back to where the band was loading up to give them the food. When I was gone my friend was sitting on the curb smoking a cigarette waiting for me. The bouncer came up behind him and kicked him in the head and was like \"I told you to leave, get the fuck off the property\". Then started pushing him out into the street. When I came back my friend was bleeding from his head. I grabbed some shop towels from my car and we got the hell away from that shitty venue and shitty city and never looked back.",

You can even look into easter, and its roots tying to Ishtar the fertility goddess of Babylon, whose symbols were eggs and a bunny, hmm. Everything has been perverted in this world.\n\nToo many people profess to be christion, but are wolves in sheep's clothing, turning people from Jesus.  It was foretold, so not surprising.\n\nJeremiah 101Hear what the LORD says to you, O house of Israel.2This is what the LORD says: \"Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the sky, though the nations are terrified by them.3For the customs of the peoples are worthless; they cut a tree out of the forest, and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel.4They adorn it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so it will not totter.",

They are not true christian, and worship mammon.  Christianity is supposed to be about a personal relationship with Jesus., and follow his teachings.  The Catholic Church is also a farce.  Praying to saints, Mary, etc, in addition to so much abuse.  That is not biblical, nor is confessing your sins in a little box.  They will get their just rewards when they leave this place.\nMost modern \"christians\" go to churce once a week, but  don't reflect the teachings of the bible in their life.  I can see why so many people are turned off from these places.  Jesus warned that many would come in his name, false teachers.  My advice is to read the book for yourself, and pray for discernment in this crazy world.  In Revelation, seven churches were talked about, and only one of them, Ephesus, was doing things correctly.  God gave us all free will, and its up to each of us to either follow him or \"do what thou wilt\", as Aliester Crowley stated.\n\nGalatians 1:6-9\nI am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel\u2014 not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.\n\nJohn 14:6\nJesus said to him, \u201cI am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\n\n2 Timothy 4: 3-4\nFor the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.",

The way we observe Yule will be similar to how pagans celebrate but without adherence to supernatural or mythical claims.",

It's a serious part of the whole catholic pedo issue.\n\nThis is the part where I usually direct people to the Catechism which actually explains all of this, in detail, with citations.\n\n[Catholics are called to respect human life and the dignity of others. They are also allowed to defend their own lives and their own dignity using appropriate measures, up to, and including lethal force.](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a5.htm)\n\nPart of being Catholic is realizing that you are made in the image of God, so you should treat yourself well and protect yourself from harm when and where possible. Likewise, you should not do harm onto others when it can be avoided because you are harming a person made in the likeness of God.\n\n> Also, it is evil to use the threat of hell. Hell is by definition the worst punishment possible and the only reason your ancient text has survived. It's absurdly unbelievable but is often accepted as fact by little children. Your god has all the attributes of an abusive partner.\n\nUgh, sorry but this is like the 9th time I've explained this in the thread. I, nor can any other mortal person, condemn anyone to hell. Hell is the willful separation of oneself from God. Because we have free will we \\*choose\\* hell for ourselves by either embracing sin or denying God's grace and forgiveness.\n\nOnly God knows what's going on in peoples minds/hearts, nobody else has any knowledge of who goes to hell. We know that it's difficult, and that following Christ and his Church makes the path easier, but we don't have a thetan testing device to determine whether you're going to hell or not. It's not how Christianity works.\n\nIf you kill someone, that's a sin. If you sincerely repent and seek to attone for that sin, and accept Christ's forgiveness you may get into heaven despite your sins. Likewise, if you murder someone and say \"no God, I was in the right to murder that person, they deserved it\" then you have separated yourself from God, or even if you repent but you say \"yes God, what I did was wrong, but not even you can forgive me for what I've done\". That's what hell is, separation from God.\n\nGod is our Father and he wants us to come home, but we have to leave all of our petty baggage behind. We're supposed to love and not lust, we're supposed to seek justice and not wrath. And we need to accept that we fall short, seek forgiveness, and accept forgiveness.\n\nIt is childish to use hell as an idle threat, it is likewise childish to not understand what hell actually is when you have the resources available to you to learn.",

You could have told me 50,000 and my naive ass would have believed you.\n\nThis led me to Google \"estimated crowd density\".\n\nIn a crowd where everyone is an arm's length from the people standing next to them, each person occupies 10 square feet of space.  That's 1.11 square yards, or 0.929 square meters.  In a crowd of this density you can fit 5,760 people on a football field (57,600 square feet).\n\nIn a denser crowd, each person takes up 4.5 square feet (0.5 sq. yds; 0.418 sq. meters).  That type of crowd crams 12,800 people onto a football field.\n\nThe space occupied by this crowd easily looks to exceed 1 football field worth of floor space, with very little in the way of bleacher sections.  It probably is less than 3 football field's worth of area, but it's hard to say.  Some of the crowd is seated, which is going to inherently involve spacing people out to make room for the chairs, while the rest is standing close to shoulder-to-shoulder.  So at the lower density that's 5,760 - 17,280 people (1-3 football fields).  At the higher density, that's 12,800 - 38,400 people.\n\nSo, for the crowd to actually be around 15,000 people fits inside the overlap of these two ranges, and therefore: it's actually pretty believable!",

He cared so much about it that he had his own White House shamelessly lie about his inauguration attendance, in order to make him feel better.\n\nNow, in the final three months of an uncomfortably tight presidential contest, Trump is flipping out about crowd sizes \u2014 both publicly and behind closed doors \u2014 but not, primarily, his own. According to one Republican source who\u2019s spoken to the former president in recent days, Trump is \u201cunhappy with the narrative\u201d forming that Vice President Kamala Harris has been attracting high, enthusiastic attendance at the 2024 rallies she\u2019s held since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nIn private, Trump has recently taken to griping about the media attention the Harris 2024 (now Harris-Walz 2024) rally sizes have been receiving, and at times insisting a number the Harris campaign has put out must be \u201cfake,\u201d the source and another person familiar with the matter say. Publicly, he\u2019s similarly making his displeasure very clear.\n\n\u201cIf Kamala has 1,000 people at a Rally, the Press goes \u2018crazy,\u2019 and talks about how \u2018big\u2019 it was \u2013 And she pays for her \u2018Crowd,\u2019\u201d Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social. \u201cWhen I have a Rally, and 100,000 people show up, the Fake News doesn\u2019t talk about it, THEY REFUSE TO MENTION CROWD SIZE. The Fake News is the Enemy of the People!\u201d\n\nLater on Thursday, Trump held a press conference from Mar-a-Lago, during which he again ranted about crowd sizes at length. \u201cIt\u2019s so dishonest, the press,\u201d he said, visibly frustrated, when asked about crowd sizes. \u201cI have 10 times, 20 times, 30 times the crowd size,\u201d he claimed, adding that \u201cthe Republican Party, and me as a candidate, has the enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nTrump later claimed that he may have drawn more supporters on Jan. 6, 2021 than \u201cMartin Luther King when he did his speech.\u201d\n\nTrump defends his crowd sizes: pic.twitter.com/QeHjCXvqQJ\n\n\u2014 nikki mccann ram\u00edrez (@NikkiMcR) August 8, 2024\n\nThe 2024 Harris campaign is only a couple weeks old, but it has already gotten under the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s skin in several key ways. Since Biden bowed out, national and battleground-state polls have tightened, and in some cases show Harris now leading. Trump has also expressed what confidants and aides privately concede to be genuine surprise that the Democratic vice president has managed to raise as much campaign cash as she has, and has grown visibly irritated that the Democrats\u2019 attacks on Trump and J.D. Vance for being \u201cweird\u201d have dominated news cycles lately.\n\nHarris and newly minted running mate Tim Walz packed a Philadelphia basketball arena to the rafters on Tuesday, the first stop on the ticket\u2019s swing-state tour. The Harris campaign was quick to troll Trump over the crowd size, posting side-by-side images of the crowd on Tuesday and Trump\u2019s relatively meager crowd in the same area.\n\nHarris rally vs. Trump rally - Same arena in Philly: pic.twitter.com/YqRiRIPRrW\n\n\u2014 Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) August 6, 2024\n\nThe enthusiasm for Harris and Walz didn\u2019t drop off after their kickoff event, with video showing a massive line of cars waiting to get into their rally in Wisconsin the following day hours in advance. The duo was greeted by another massive crowd in Detroit later on Wednesday.\n\nTrump only has one rally scheduled this week, in Montana on Friday. During a rally at Georgia State University in Atlanta last week, he bashed school administrators for not allowing more people into the venue, claiming that \u201cthousands of people were told no.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign itself said 600 people \u2014 not thousands \u2014 were denied entry, according to Reuters, which reported that the crowd was \u201cthinning out noticeably\u201d as Trump spoke.",

IIRC, the day Trump was inaugurated in 2017, he also filed the paperwork for his re-election in 2020 so he could collect campaign contributions. \n\nWe could have laws that state you can't file campaign paperwork until 6 months before the general election, but the people in power will never change that (plus smaller/3rd party candidates will also push back as they usually need more time to build up name recognition), or 2 months before the first primary.",

Lack of eating makes you tired and frail, you can no longer work or do anything fun that requires energy. Chemotherapy and other treatments including drugs all have very serious side effects that are terrible. This is only some of the worst parts.

I noticed I was losing weight pretty rapidly (40-50lbs in about 5 months). I went to my primary care doc and he ordered some tests. They found out I was bleeding somewhere internally so they ordered a colonoscopy. Both doctors I went to (gastroenterologist & colorectal surgeon) said \"you're too young for a colonoscopy\" until they looked at my chart. The colonoscopy resulted in them finding 2 polyps that were .5 cm each. Luckily they were not precancerous but now I have to have a colonoscopy every 5 years to be safe because non-cancerous polyps have the potential to become malignant after 10-15 years. I also developed an anal fistula and had a Fistulotomy to repair it (I don't wish this on my worst enemy). I have an appointment with a colorectal surgeon next month to make sure the fistula hasn't re-occurred because I started having the same symptoms of the last one.\n\nThey never did find out the cause of my rapid weight loss but i'm attributing it to my old drinking habits. I stopped drinking heavily (7-10 drinks/day) and now only drink on occasion. My weight is now normal and I am no longer rapidly losing weight. Colonoscopies aren't a great experience (except the fun drugs they give you) but worth it in the long run. I said all of that just to say this: when in doubt, get checked out.",

Do not swim or eat fish out of the Tittabawassee, before or after Dow, it is polluted before it even reaches Dow. There is liquid tar under the soil of Dow, right up to the river, have seen it, also have seen the ground under Dow spontaneously combust when exposed to air.

Lung cancer, esophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer, pharyngeal cancer, stomach cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, and mesothelioma are frequently caused by asbestos exposure. Asbestos-laced products were used for decades at Dow Chemical. Neither employees nor management were aware of the asbestos risk.\n\n>Asbestos is a mineral that in its natural state is harmless. It becomes harmful when it is pulled apart or ground up into flexible fibers. Then, when inhaled or swallowed, microscopic asbestos fibers may be permanently affixed to body tissue. Over many years, these fibers may cause genetic changes that can lead to cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, \"It can take from 10 to 40 years or more for asbestos-related cancers to appear.\"\n\n>To compensate cancer victims and the families of deceased cancer victims, Federal Bankruptcy Courts have required asbestos manufacturers to set aside hundreds of millions of dollars in private trusts. Through these trusts, cancer victims can receive money damages by the filing of timely, detailed, and accurate claims.\n\n>Norris Injury Lawyers has announced a specific initiative to assist Dow Chemical employees in recovering money set aside for them in these asbestos trusts. Cancer victims or the families of deceased victims who worked at the plant before 1981 may call 800-478-9578 for a free evaluation of their claim.

We see a ton of shit all the time about how fiber is good and how you should eat more fiber. But I've never seen any of those things mention how much fiber, so I looked it up. Adults should be getting 30-40g of fiber per day. Having now made it a point to hit the 30g/day threshold, I am extremely confident most Americans have never hit that amount a day in their lives.   \n    \n*Of course* we're getting colon cancer. We haven't been eating real food and have been neglecting a major important factor of our GI health.   \n     \nEDIT: Since some people are talking about how to get that much: Beans.

Near chemical plants are the worst areas. I don't doubt our food is part of this, but it's so hard to separate from the environmental factors we have. And not just because you can't control for it easily, but also because food is a big way environmental pollutants end up in our bodies. Fiber intake is also huge, I agree. We have studies showing that dietary fiber intake is associated with reduced risk of several cancers. But also we have studies suggesting that fiber supplements might not be associated with reduced cancer risks. Part of how nutrition is pushed to us, with macronutrients and specific goals, is used against us to promote supplements that might not be anywhere near an adequate replacement for the real things.

Lung cancer, esophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer, pharyngeal cancer, stomach cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, and mesothelioma are frequently caused by asbestos exposure. Asbestos-laced products were used for decades at Dow Chemical. Neither employees nor management were aware of the asbestos risk.\n\n>Asbestos is a mineral that in its natural state is harmless. It becomes harmful when it is pulled apart or ground up into flexible fibers. Then, when inhaled or swallowed, microscopic asbestos fibers may be permanently affixed to body tissue. Over many years, these fibers may cause genetic changes that can lead to cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, \"It can take from 10 to 40 years or more for asbestos-related cancers to appear.\"\n\n>To compensate cancer victims and the families of deceased cancer victims, Federal Bankruptcy Courts have required asbestos manufacturers to set aside hundreds of millions of dollars in private trusts. Through these trusts, cancer victims can receive money damages by the filing of timely, detailed, and accurate claims.\n\n>Norris Injury Lawyers has announced a specific initiative to assist Dow Chemical employees in recovering money set aside for them in these asbestos trusts. Cancer victims or the families of deceased victims who worked at the plant before 1981 may call 800-478-9578 for a free evaluation of their claim.

An auditorium for the arts; my school didn\u2019t have one at all, they had to use a cafetorium for concerts. People were forced to sit on our lunch tables and stand around the edges of the room.\n\nThey refused to expand the band program, because 1 teacher was required for all 3 schools and had to travel between all three everyday. They were having a hard time keeping band teachers and in one year they saw a loss of over 50% of the band, yet the proposal was denied. \n\nAll my area cared about was soorts, quite literally to the detriment of everyone else. During this time they started cutting AP courses because they \u201ccouldn\u2019t afford someone\u201d.

I think many of us do a lot. Personally, we help the homeless in our city in big ways. We have a man who owns an art studio in town, he offered years ago to allow us to bring items for the homeless to his studio and he would pass them out for the ones that stop by the studio and walk by. \n\nThere is one homeless woman who suffers from schizophrenia and major mood disorders. She\u2019s \u201cfamous\u201d around here. The whole city rally\u2019s together for her; but she refuses to live in a home or facility. She\u2019s been given apartments and she just won\u2019t stay. Whenever we see her, which is often, we buy her food and give her cash. We donate blankets and winter clothes. Art studio owner lets her sleep in the studio during the cold days in winter. \n\nI normally don\u2019t broadcast any of that, because I believe in giving based on doing the right thing and not for back pats. You asked so figured I would add. \n\nWe have a yearly tradition that we started back in 2015 where we randomly choose families in need and donate them Thanksgiving dinner. Everything you would need to make it. \n\nThat\u2019s all done because it\u2019s basic humanity in our opinion. It\u2019s not being a saint, because we arent saints, not even close. We can, so we do.

Elijah endured some pretty awful things and it's disgusting the Goldman's just sit there and deny all wrongdoing of blatant neglect and deny any abuse occurred at the school, despite the fact the school was shut down by government order and four staff charged with various abuse related crimes. Strong evidence the Goldmans dismiss out of hand. Isn't one of the central tenets of Christianity to basically confess and accept and own your wrongdoing (sins)? Ironic, isn't it. The Goldman's I'm willing to bet are members of one of those cults that claims to be some purified denomination. A few easily come to mind...\nAt least Elijah has a new home and an apparently caring woman to call family. He hasn't had that in a long time.\u00a0",

Age Limit: The laws cover children who are 17 years old and younger.\n3. Penalties: Abandoning a child can result in a felony conviction, with a sentence ranging from one to three years in prison",

                    "body": "After months of languishing in an abusive boarding school in Jamaica \u2014 where boys said they were beaten, waterboarded, starved and whipped \u2014 Michigan teenager Elijah Goldman begged to come home.\n\nBut his adoptive parents in Traverse City never came for him: Not even after Jamaican authorities removed him from the American-run school, placed him in a foster home, shut down the school following allegations of abuse and neglect, and arrested and charged four school officials with child abuse.\n\nRather, Elijah's mom and dad \u2014 a wealthy and conservative Christian couple who adopted him from Haiti when he was 11 \u2014 left him in Jamaica for another seven months, while his American friends were brought home.\n\nAlone and afraid, Elijah suffered in silence in a foreign land, desperate for someone to rescue him, to take him back to the quaint Michigan town where he was a track star, went to school, had a girlfriend and hung out with friends.\nThey abandoned me ... it hurts'\n\"I appreciate them for bringing me to the U.S., but they abandoned me,\" Elijah, now 17, wrote to the Free Press one recent night, while still waiting to be rescued from Jamaica. \"I'm staying strong, but it hurts.\"\n\nIn a harrowing child welfare case that has sparked international interest, including that of celebrity icon and advocate for troubled teens Paris Hilton, who has intervened in Elijah's case, children's rights activists are seeking to draw attention to a pervasive problem and dark side of adoption \u2014 abandonment of the vulnerable.\n\nIt's where parents adopt troubled children, but then change their minds in a buyer's-remorse kind of way, because the kids come with too many issues. So they send them away, never to see them again.\n\nThat's what child welfare advocates say they believe happened to Elijah, whose adoptive parents sent him to an American-run boarding school in Treasure Beach, Jamaica, in September 2023, over behavior problems \u2014 including watching pornography \u2014 and allegedly ditched him in the process.\n\nThey never visited him, nor attended any of his court hearings, where Elijah and other boys disclosed allegations of horrific abuse they endured at the school called the Atlantis Leadership Academy. Elijah said he was cut with a razor and beaten in the back with a hammer. Other boys reported being waterboarded with a hose up the nose, tied to railings by the neck and beaten, and being forced to engage in club fights, where staff and local police would place bets.\n\nThe allegations prompted Jamaican officials to remove Elijah and six other American boys from the academy in February and place them in Jamaican custody. One month later, they closed the school down.\n\nStill, Elijah's adoptive parents never came.\n\nElijah said the last time he heard from his adoptive parents was in April, when they called during a court proceeding. When asked what his adoptive parents told him, he said: \"They didn't want me home. ... And they didn't believe me about the whole court thing ... that they were abusing us.\"\n\nThe Free Press made numerous attempts to speak to Elijah's parents. Multiple voicemails and text messages were left for both parents. The mom responded by text, stating: \"If you would please send us your questions in writing we can consider responding.\" The Free Press sent a list of questions on Wednesday morning, and left more voicemails and text messages. As of Friday evening, the couple had not responded. Michigan officials reportedly told a lawyer and advocate for Elijah that the adoptive parents told them that they had a plan to get Elijah out of Jamaica but were advised not to travel there.\n\nLawyer: Biological parent would not get away with this\nElijah's case has drawn the ire of child welfare advocates, who maintain biological parents would not get away with abandoning a minor child in a foreign country for a year, especially when the child is reporting abuse.\n\n\"They were specifically told, 'Your son was abused.' And they didn\u2019t even send him clothes,\" said New York children's rights attorney Dawn Post, who traveled to Jamaica in the spring, met with Elijah, and has been fighting for him ever since.\n\n\"What makes it so astounding is that that these wealthy parents think they can get away with it,\" Post said of Elijah's adoptive parents, who live in a $1.7 million lakefront home in Traverse City that was named \"The Southern Living Home of the Year\" in 2007.\n\nPost said she believes Elijah's mom and dad are getting preferential treatment from Michigan authorities because they are adoptive parents, not biological.\n\n\"If it was a biological parent \u2014 believe me \u2014 you'd have an abandonment case against them,\" said Post, noting she has reached out to multiple government agencies in Michigan about Elijah's case, including the governor's office, Department of Health and Human Services, and Child and Protective Services in Traverse City.\n\nBut so far, she said, no one has stepped in to help Elijah resume his life in Michigan, or to hold his adoptive parents accountable for stranding him in Jamaica.\n\nElijah returns to U.S., fate uncertain\nElijah is back on American soil, though his future remains uncertain. He was returned to the U.S. on Tuesday after Jamaican authorities put him on a plane and sent him to Florida, where American officials would take over and address his needs.\n\nBut since landing in Florida, his life has been a nonstop series of traumatic events, with no government agency stepping up to take him in. Florida said he was Michigan's responsibility. Michigan said he was Florida's responsibility.\n\nHis adoptive parents did not meet him at the Miami airport.\n\nRather, Post was there. So was an abuse survivor and youth advocate named Chelsea Maldonado, who works as a consultant to Paris Hilton's charity known as 11:11 Media Impact, which works to protect vulnerable youths from mistreatment, particularly those in residential facilities.\n\n\"He\u2019s been abandoned and let down by every person who was in a position to offer him care, love and support,\" Maldonado said of Elijah, stressing the troubled teen industry preys on adopted youth. \"No child should be adopted into this country only to be abandoned, or sent to a place like Atlantis Leadership Academy ... This must end.\"\n\nElijah arrived at the airport in jeans and a pullover fleece, carrying all of his belongings in a single backpack. A fellow survivor from the now-shuttered boarding school was there to greet Elijah, who smiled as he hugged his friend in the arrivals terminal. But the nervous teen kept looking over his shoulder. And in a matter of minutes, a daunting scene played out.\n\nA U.S. embassy official from Jamaica, a police officer and a youth transport agent whom Elijah did not want to leave with, showed up. They whisked him away from his friend and advocates and took him into a room to discuss matters privately.\n\nIn the end, Elijah was spared having to leave with the transport agent \u2014 the man his adoptive parents had designated as his legal guardian; the same man they hired to take Elijah to the airport when they sent him to Jamaica against his wishes in 2023; the same man who wrote a letter of recommendation on behalf of the academy where Elijah and the others reportedly were abused.\n\nElijah said this transport agent had manipulated him into going to Jamaica and that he didn't trust him with his future.\n\nNeither did his lawyer, or his youth advocate, who both made sure to be at the airport to protect Elijah and place him in safe hands.\n\nFrom Jamaica to Florida to Michigan \u2014 Elijah finally sees his adoptive parents\nElijah arrived in Miami just before 6 p.m. Tuesday. By 8 p.m., he was in a car with the two advocates who showed up to help him, away from his adoptive parents' chosen legal guardian, eager to begin a new life.\n\n\"I'm the happiest man alive,\" he wrote in a message to the Free Press on Tuesday night.\n\nWithin 24 hours, however, he would learn that Michigan authorities said they had no legal authority over him; that housing him in Michigan was out of their hands, and that his lawyer needed to talk to Child Protective Services in Florida and find a place for him there.\n\n\"This is beyond insane,\" Post said.\n\nBy midnight Wednesday, more than 24 hours after landing in Miami, Elijah was in Florida CPS custody, housed in a children's home.\n\n\"Everything is good,\" Elijah wrote to the Free Press.\n\nBy morning, however, his life was upended again. Florida CPS placed him on a flight to Traverse City. Elijah said he didn't know who would meet him there, neither did his lawyer.\n\n\"As a mom of 4 and a owner of multiple businesses I have become incredibly passionate about empowering others to see their potential and create a life of abundance,\" her LinkedIn page reads. \"By serving and loving others and helping them to succeed I am changing lives one person at a time.\"\n\nIn a personal essay about his faith journey, Mark Goldman also discusses changing lives, specifically his own. On a faith-inspired business website called Check Your Game, Mark Goldman wrote about a prior rage issue, and how a verbal fight with his wife almost triggered a call to the police, and eventually led him to Jesus Christ.\n\n\"The following morning, I decided! I was done thinking I could fix all my issues with booze, gambling, working out and pornography. I needed to try something else,\" Mark Goldman says in the essay, which credits his mom with turning him to Jesus Christ following a 2008 fight with his wife.\n\nThe personal essay also mentions Mark Goldman \"waiting to be matched with our two kiddos from Haiti,\" how he \"left a multimillion-dollar company\" to work in a school setting, and how he and his wife \"brought our 2 kids from Haiti home with us\" in 2018.",

The family lives in a sprawling, white colonial that is listed at $1.7 million on Zillow, and $1.9 million on Realtor.com.

The opposite too - CPS hammering down on the wrong issue and being too quick to remove. It is a crapshoot. But if you\u2019re wealthy and connected? You\u2019re going to be in a lot better of a position.\n \nIt also makes me think of the case over the summer of the white parents, one of whom was a cop, took their infant on a boat during a heatwave of Arizona and left her to basically boil to death in the sun while they had some fun in the water and got to make a GoFundMe. Last I heard they were being investigated, but still; I think if they had been poor parents, allowing their infant to bake in the sun to death without protection while they splash in the pool, it would have gone down very differently for the parents. \n\nI think it also just boils down to children don\u2019t really have rights in the United States. We\u2019re the only country in the UN who has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. \n\nParental rights to choose what \u201cthey think is best\u201d for their kid supersedes kids\u2019 rights to safety all the time. I saw it all the time when I worked at the children\u2019s hospital. \n\nThis article also adds to my opinion that child welfare and CPS laws, practices and agencies shouldn\u2019t vary from state to state. It shouldn\u2019t be up to the states to decide, because then parents will hop from jurisdiction from jurisdiction (things can even get extremely messy when a family hops counties within the state, let alone state to state). There\u2019s this \u201cinfluencer\u201dfamily where they have several children and live in a bus, and they were clearly medically neglecting their poor newborn. People were calling, but if someone is going state to state it\u2019s hard for CPS to do anything because they barely have any power in their own county. It being a \u201cstates rights\u201d issue enables shitty and abusive parents (especially ones with means) to get away with doing whatever they want to their kids, and kids fall through the cracks.",

If your neighbor owned a big lifted pickup truck, does that give you an acceptable and legal right to slash their tires?\n\nDo you have evidence that the company which owned the scooters was dumping them illegally? If you accused them of that knowing that this was false and did so in a highly public manner then yes wouldn't that be defamation?

If one happened to lose power and get left close enough to look like it was lost in the river, it\u2019s a high enough risk to pay to remove. \n\nThe bounty is where they could catch some people, as the types of people to damage the scooters are totally some of the same types of people that would fraudulently break them to claim a bounty. \n\nThe bounty account would require access to your location services. Anyone who was at the same location at the same time as a scooter going in the water can be cross referenced to the scooter camera. \n\nShame we can\u2019t just have nice things",

The metaphorical Satanic construct is no more arbitrary to us than are the deeply held beliefs that we actively advocate. Are we supposed to believe that those who pledge submission to an ethereal supernatural deity hold to their values more deeply than we? Are we supposed to concede that only the superstitious are rightful recipients of religious exemption and privilege? Satanism provides all that a religion should be without a compulsory attachment to untenable items of faith-based belief. It provides a narrative structure by which we contextualize our lives and works. It also provides a body of symbolism and religious practice \u2014 a sense of identity, culture, community, and shared values.\"\n\nThey are a registered Religion so what is your point again???",

I've meet lots of people who are liberal and right and voted for Biden in 2020. Does that make them a leftist?  No. \n\nThe real problem is that the US has the electoral college and has a two party system because of it. This means that like unlike other countries where people have have multiple parties to choose from and can pick one that better fits their political stance, we are stuck having to pick between to parties that do a shitty job representing the people. Because of the two party system, neither party has to try to do much for the people who vote for them, they only have to do enough to do better than the other party in certain areas to keep people voting for them so they can keep power. \n\nMany people will vote for one party one election then vote for another party the next election. Does this mean they are jumping back and forth every couple of years from being left wing to right wing and back? No, that would be stupid to think. People don't change their political views that much. Voting democrat or republican doesn't automatically make you left wing or right wing. It just means you voted for a democrat or republican.",

But regardless, he voted for the democrat, so his claim that he's \"right\" doesn't hold water because he didn't put the right wing candidate in power. \n\nSo they don't identify with conservatives. \n\nAnd what it is to be progressive or conservative changes.

I learned later how much my husband\u2019s coworker wanted to see the Stones, so I let him go with my husband, instead of going myself.  How did he repay me?  He bought four tickets to take us to see Journey!  Since they were coming with us, we couldn\u2019t just stay home and say we went, we had to actually GO.",

I do love my coneys but I also really like Chicago style dogs and those dirty water dogs from New York City are up there too. I think the key is kosher. Natural casing all beef. They snap when you bite them, they crack when you grill them, they taste like summer even in the winter. Koegel's definitely fits this. My wife is partial to their ring baloney and that's usually in our fridge. Before we were married I don't think I even knew it was a thing and now I seek it out.",

Most of their parents are locked up. They don\u2019t care about learning and threaten to kill my mom for caring about their grades.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDo you realize Mr. Trump that they get free tutors, free tablets from our Government so they can succeed. Why cant my son get those things, do we as hard working Americans not deserve that too?\u201d Jennifer wrote.\n\nShe also wrote that her husband had \u201csuffered a stroke and a broken back and we were with just my income. Do you know how hard it is to support a family on only $40,000 a year? I couldn\u2019t qualify for State Aid. I made to \\[sic\\] much.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMr. Trump, this is why I voted for you. I see the change that we so desperately need. I see jobs coming back, people having to work for their handouts, money going to who really deserve it,\u201d she added. \u201cIf this blog even makes it to your eyes \u2026 thank you.

Was it a roulette of chance or a calculated dance of legal strategy? The mystery lingers, shrouded in the enigmatic cloak of courtroom procedure.  \nMeanwhile, amidst the storm of argument, the defense team stood steadfast, a lone warrior against the tempest, with only one attorney to navigate the treacherous waters of justice.

All those posting it\u2019s a wake up call to parents to start paying attention .. pfft! Yall are probably the ones who believe they have rights to send their kid to school and demand the school accommodate their child\u2019s special needs or ask before you go on vacation if the resort you stay at has a large gluten free selection even tho you don\u2019t have celiac disease, you just think it\u2019s better way of eating. You\u2019ve been accommodated so much you\u2019re the ones who\u2019ve made people like the Crumbley\u2019s fearful of having a child different. Yall come across demanding and self righteous vs accommodating and accepting. Don\u2019t misread my statement. Buying a gun and telling him it was his was fkn stupid and wrong. Having a child with issues is scary and most parents don\u2019t want that. You, the demanding, self righteous bunch who think you should be accommodated vs being kind and taking care of your own issues are the ones that when ppl do have serious issues are afraid of. Tone it down a bit. Realize we all live in this world. Special needs do not need to be thrust in everyday life. They should be treated differently yet with kindness. You don\u2019t want a kid with strep throat in class so why should a kid with a behavioral health issue be in class. I agree, keep your kid at home when they are ill and get them help. The factor you\u2019re missing is who decides when the child is \u201cacting out\u201d or is truly \u201cill\u201d? Remember my gluten free diet example\u2026 only true celiacs require that and it is not common most CHOSE to go gluten free. Parents always put their foot down re: medical care. Some refuse immunizations, which puts my medically fragile child at risk. It ain\u2019t right. Will that decision lead to prosecution should my child contract an illness from your decision? Think about it!! Your child can\u2019t control outbursts in class, decides to throw a book and hits my kid, who now requires stitches. You sent the kid to school. Bingo! You betcha I\u2019m calling the DA. Kids with impulse control are going to be the ones targeted here cuz schools/teachers aren\u2019t meant to control kids-you parents are. Good Luck \ud83c\udf40",

Parents can't easily access mental health reaources for themselves when needed... especially families that come from similar means as the Crumbleys.\n\nWhere this parent went horibbly and irresponsibly wrong was giving her son access to a firearm and training on how to use it.

And it's difficult to help a kid with severe issues when they are still living with abusive parents, especially if the parents are fighting against recommendations. \n\nWith a kid like EC, he was too young to move out. And I think his parents were a major factor in how poor his health was. So that would require THEM to get help, do some introspection and improve their parenting. Maybe he'd have mental health problems even if they were perfect parents, but they clearly weren't. And they both seem very narcissistic so good luck on convincing either parents that they are part of the problem and need to change. Or good luck convincing them to admit their kid needs more help than they can manage. It's an ego thing. Their son getting help or them needing help would make them look less-than-perfect so they chose to just pretend it was all ok and ignore the problems hoping it'd just be fine. Obviously that didn't work.\n\nI say this as someone who's own mental health journey started with an individual therapist who recommended a family therapist, who then recommend a couples therapist to my parents, who then recommended my Mom go back into individual therapy. Eventually my own therapist advocated to have me move out at 18 because my Mom was constantly disrupting my treatment plan and coping skills and continuing abusive behavior. I was very low-functioning at the time but even my therapist knew struggling on my own would be easier than staying with people that were actively hindering my progress. I thought it was hilarious at the time that all these professionals basically boiled down my issues into my parents having a shitty marriage and my Mom being kinda awful. But her ego was just too big for her to accept any blame or need to change. I highly suspect EC's parents are similar in this way, but likely much worse since they didn't even get Ethan into any treatment at all. \n\n(P. S. My mental health is still kinda shitty but moving out made a MASSIVE difference and allowed me to finally make progress. So if you're reading this and can relate please know it can get better. Getting away from living with abusive people was vital but it made a huge difference.)",

The level of negligence required for involuntary manslaughter is higher than normal civil negligence and requires that the defendant have acted in a very unreasonable manner. The exact language used to describe this negligence standard varies by state, but many refer to it as \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d or \u201cgross negligence.\u201d\n\nSeems like they got it right.

It was negligent of her to leave without- asking Ethan if he had gun.  Checking his backpack and clothes.  She could've stayed at the school and told her husband go home and see if the gun is there and the ammo.   She could've told the school he has a gun. Let's check his locker.   She couldn't wait to get out of there and neither of them went home to check to see if the gun was there.  They abandoned their son and didn't tell the school the important information that could've helped the school protect the other students.  I guarantee you if the parents told the school he has a gun they would have searched Ethan they had no reason to believe he had access to a gun.  The parents did.  This child was suffering and mentally ill and they rejected and abandoned him.  Changing one of these things and doing something different would have saved lives even taking Ethan home.

It was what happened leading up to the shooting.  Did they allow it to happen?  Did they encourage or enable it?  I think the answer to all three is a solid \"yes\", but the addition of the emotional witnesses kinda muddies the waters on the \"fair\" aspect of the trial.  I would have had zero problem with her having to face those at the sentencing as impact statements (which I'm sure they'll have people lined up out the door to give anyways).\n\n Any lawyer worth their salt would argue that it was prejudicial testimony that only served to inflame the jury's emotions.  I know it helped get the conviction, but I would absolutely hate to see these assholes walk or be granted a re-trial because of it.\n\nAnyways hopefully this is done and over with, and we can forget these people exist.",

They literally do exactly this. do you know how much auto manufacturers spend lobbying the government a year?\n\nthere are already several steps in place that a person goes through to obtain a gun. the biggest of which is a background check. this check includes things like criminal offenses and forced mental health care. manufacturers also can not ship a gun to a standard address, it mush be shipped to an FFL (Federal Firearm License) business where you go to fill out the paperwork for the purchase, conduct the background check and then pick up the gun. FFL licensing is directly organized and managed by the ATF, and receiving one involves several months or years of paperwork and background checks, keeping exact and accurate records for every single purchase conducted for several years after and even a single mistake in paperwork (much less directly breaking the law) will result in loss of license and federal criminal charges. so no FFL is ever going to break or bend the rules to make a sale, and neither are the manufacturers.\n\nadd into this that a majority of manufacturers get their profits from military contracts, civilian sells are just icing on their cake.\n\nthere was a point in time when machine guns were sold in the sears catalog and shipped directly to your house, and there weren't any mass shootings. (first recognized shooting was in 1949, 15 years after the national firearms act of 1934. the guns are the tool, it's society that has created people who wish to hurt, maim, and kill others on a mass scale.",

You are not the first person to make that claim, you won't be the last.  Sure, maybe this was the first time you physically typed out that idea, but if an individual user continues to see multiple opinions scattered throughout Reddit that contradicts events ... That user would begin to question their own perception and memory.  \n\nI count your contribution as part of that effort.  By definition your individual action may not be, but it can have that effect when taking other comments and posts in consideration.  If we agree to disagree on that, so be it \n\n\nAs for my argument, I'm saying a **jury** found her guilty.  It was the prosecutions job to prove their case, it was up to the defense to stop it.  The court is 'right' because the system did exactly what it was supposed to and a jury of peers decided.\n\nI don't even know where the court being right enters into this.  If you're trying to say the court is wrong because the jury used emotional reasoning instead of listening to the legal arguments, you're basically claiming jury nullification.  That's a wild accusation.  There is disagreement over what appeared at trial and there's been several comments on how some evidence was prejudicial and we'll all have to wait and see how the appeal plays out.  I'm hoping you're claiming this was emotional jury nullification because I have no idea what else you would be trying to claim.  \n\nIn the mean time, she literally had her day in court.  And lost.  For all we know it's as equally likely someone on the jury was convinced this was an illegal retribution and was convinced by the prosecution to change their mind, as it is likely someone didn't really care until the trial started and seeing how 'bad' she was decided she needed to be punished regardless of legality",

I love driving through quaint little towns all around Michigan and it makes me so sad to see multiple businesses close down while I see some big ugly yellow and black sign light up the roadway as I drive by. I hope they get punished big time for overcharging customers over the years with faulty advertising compared to when you look at your bill after you check out. At the very very least these bastards could at least make their sign more beautiful and not just some big ugly yellow block. When I see it I feel like I'm diving directly into the nastiest trailer park of all time and it's just despicable that all these towns have even let these idiotic stories come in. They're literally is no price difference they only barely beat out these crappy gas stations that are charging too much for Frito chip dip and other crap.

We are still in eastern time (if you head straight south you hit the Carolinas), have more in common with Buffalo than we do with St. Louis, and our cultural and economic \"elite\" can definitely find common ground with their east coast counterparts more than they can with wealthy Omahans or Topekans.  Our forests have most of the same biome features that you can find through Northern New England, minus the Appalachian rhododendron and Atlantic tree and shrub species.\n\nIn terms of history, while the French did range far to the west in terms of economic activities, they settled largely east of the Mississippi in those long lines stretching out from the rivers just as they did in Quebec.  Our indigenous peoples were largely Anishinaabe and had cultural and economic connections headed easterly rather than much further west than the Mississippi river.  Our regional variation of American English has much more in common with upstate New York than it does anything from, say, Central Illinois or even Indiana.  That has to do with settlement patterns; we were on a grand water highway, much of the rest of the \"Midwest\" was an overland migration through the central and southern Appalachian gaps.\n\nI've always felt that Midwest is a label that gets thrown around as a sentiment of political origin, with eastern people thinking anything west of Harrisburg is the farthest frontier still, locals in the corn belt wanting to identify as something far removed from eastern cities and immigrant populations (despite the second wave of settlement being largely of German origin itself), etc.\n\nSo you're right, we don't have a lot in common with much of the rest of the Midwest.  I also don't think we really qualify, and I usually describe the area here as Great Lakes.",

Most landlords are running through corporations even if they just have 1 house as an independent landlord. Some people don't incorporate with more.\n\nWhat there should be are additional property taxes if you own more than one habitable property that you or your dependents are not claiming residency in. Perhaps even make a tiered system. And this should *not* apply to certain cooperatives like the ones mentioned above (housing cooperatives should not be paying state property taxes in Michigan, but thanks to some legal fuckery under the definition of \"cooperative housing\" at the federal level, they still do - except in Ann Arbor, now). Maybe make the taxes based on the zoning and property type. \n\nIf it costs increasingly more in taxes for each additional property, it disincentivizes anyone (corporation or not) from accumulating property.

Housing construction essentially stopped entirely for a few years and millennials are in their prime home buying years. Add in onerous zoning restrictions and it's not going to improve, price wise, anytime soon.\n\nThere's trust planning concerns, flipping concerns (there's a lot of value in someone taking a condemned house and making it good again), and some below that come to mind (by no means an exhaustive list):\n\nMoreover, \"long term\" in the financial sense generally means 1 year or more. What if I've got a couple of friends and we each have teenage children that are planning on going to the same college. Should we be excluded from buying a place and renting it to whomever until the kids go to college just because we decided to form an llc?\n\nWhat if I'm in the construction business and I'm building a new nuclear reactor (6-8 years), liquid natural gas export terminal, or [insert large project that takes years]? Should I be excluded from buying housing as part of employee compensation?\n\nWhat if I run a shelter of some kind (recovering addicts, domestic violence victims, etc.) and split a few houses into townhouses/separate apartments? Would that be allowed?\n\nAs a seller, why should I be forced to take a lower offer?\n\nRestrictions aren't the answer, it's just going to cause more problems and there will inevitably be bigger players that get certain exemptions that work for their model that excludes others. If we want more affordable housing, it needs to start with ending zoning restrictions and allowing more dense housing in more areas. \n\nFinancial literacy is lacking for most and in today's market, in most places I've seen in my limited experience (been buying and selling the last 6 years, not moving again though, eff that) the cash offer is practically always significantly lower than the list amount (at least 10% lower). \n\nOn 2 of the places I sold (lived in both for just over 2 years) I had one offer on each come in way under list (30% under list). On the one place, my ex and I got an offer in that was well under the list price, way under the average price in the area for the time period, asked that I pay ALL their closing costs, asked for a $10k flooring allowance (all the flooring was maybe 2 years old throughout the house), and was contingent on the sale of their current place (which wasn't even on the market).Ex and I gave all that feedback to our realtor and all we heard back on that offer was, \"they're just selling to big investors for cash, they only care about money\".\n\nWell, ofc I only care about money, that's what every arm's length seller really cares about is money. There's a ton of things in place to prevent discrimination; everyone is incentivized to look at just the money portion. If people aren't getting their offers accepted, their offers probably suck comparatively. \n\nETA: each time I've sold, it's been to an individual/family and I didn't know that was the case until basically right before closing doing a final walk through with the buyer.",

So again community stakeholder accountability would be a key leverage point and balance to consider.\n\n\nMaybe have a progressive scale for the transactions, entities involved, and portfolio sizes/values + plausibly projected values (to gaurd against the John Hantz \"farms\" residential-to-agriculture rezoned land grab version of Walmart's Dark Store Tax evasion and property valuation strategy there might be some existing precedent for protection on that now though in other states: https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/local/2023/02/21/dark-store-ruling-gives-wisconsins-cities-villages-and-towns-hope/69924128007/)?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nAlso look into whatever Century Capital Partners (? Might be just called Century Partners, it's the Detroit real estate development company that gives neighbors equity on a house or in a portfolio of houses bought and sold in the neighborhood) in case there are other creative but publicly beneficial exemptions to be made for some more social/community based enterprise minded business models.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0I think there's a community real estate education nonprofit (Building Community Value is the name maybe?) in Detroit led by a Detroit born resident that would be a good stakeholder to consult, engage in, or coalesce with on this topic too.",

                    "body": "No.\n\nAt it's core a house is just a structure that people live in. If businesses see houses as an investment it's because there's something causing a supply/demand imbalance that make houses a better investment than conventional instruments like stocks and bonds. If you banned companies from owning homes you'd have the same problem as you do right now.\n\nCorporate entities' only own 3.8% of houses. And most of those are in very high rent costal areas where it would literally be cheaper to buy a house and let your employees live there than pay the employee enough to afford rent.\n\nIf we want to solve housing we need to solve what's causing the supply/demand imbalance.\n\n1. Cost of construction. Everything is expensive to build right now whether it's a single family home, an apartment complex, a road, or a park bench. The cost of lumber and concrete are impacted by industry regulations, the cost of labor is up, the cost of permitting is up, and the requirements for new construction are much more stringent then they used to be. In the 1960s they could build thousands of homes that working class Americans could buy. They were poorly insulated, single level, ranch style houses that were good for sleeping, eating, and bathing in and not much else. Today they have to be insulated, vented, sealed, and all the new appliances have to be energy star compliant to qualify for certain tax credits. All of which increases the cost of construction considerably (ever notice that the HVAC on new houses tends to kind of suck?). \n\nTo alleviate that we could loosen regulations on lumber and concrete. We could reduce the quality requirements for new construction. And we could extend the tax credits for new construction to allow for less efficient appliances and HVAC to be installed. \n\n2. Human migration. NAFTA basically gutted regional light and heavy manufacturing, which in turn gutted most of the rural American economy. Everything from tractor parts to aluminum ladders used to be produced on a local or regional level by tool & die businesses, small factories, and medium sized regional facilities. Now the only sources of income that rural communities have are farming, retail commerce, tourism, and welfare. As a result, tens of millions of rural residents have moved into the suburbs. So you have more people competing for the same plots of land, which increases demand for a product that we can't make any more of (can't make more land, and building is expensive (see point 1)). Meanwhile there are tons of cheap houses and properties out in rural America that nobody wants to live in.\n\nTo alleviate the demand glut I'd suggest levying a substantial tax on international telework to offset construction of highspeed internet infrastructure in rural areas. Then once the infrastructure is sufficiently developed, start putting hard limits on international telework and having people in rural America pick up those jobs. $24k a year for customer support is nothing somewhere like Detroit or Ann Arbor, but in Sanilac county a single family home can go for $80k which is totally affordable at that salary.\n\n3. Zoning. I think the internet is making this a bigger deal than it actually is, but it's still a problem in many communities. High and medium density buildings can make sense in some places where they're currently not available as an option. Frankly, I think a major obstacle is the common requirement that some proportion of the units be made available to low income people. I know, I'm a monster, but if you dropped that requirement it would probably take away a lot of the stigma surrounding these construction projects.\n\nRight now, when people hear \"they want to build an apartment complex down the road from my house\". We think of stairwells that reek of weed, overfilled dumpsters, cruddy car ports full of beat up cars, groups of teenagers hanging around in front of the buildings with no supervision, and garbage/clothing hanging off of balconies and blowing into the road. Start building some nice apartments at a middle class price point and over time that stigma will dissapate.\n\nAnecdotally, existing apartments only enforce this stigma. If you open up the sex offender map for your town the local apartment complexes are lit up like a Christmas tree. They get a bad reputation that needs to be repaired and eventually you'll see some movement on it.",

I understand the frustration of many when losing out on  the purchase of a property but trust me this will not have any positive impacts and likely make housing more expensive.   I\u2019ll break down this into a few key points   Also \u201cCorporations\u201d is a term used often here but doesn\u2019t actually reflect the players here which are usually investment funds or REITS 1) \u201cWall Street\u201d is really good at corporate structure management and tax avoidance\u2026 when \u201cWall Street\u201d purchases properties they don\u2019t buy then as the corporation they buy them as controlled fully or partially entities trust, lllcs, Reits just to name a few. You create a carve out for mortgages or non profits etc Wall Street will find a way to exploit it to the extent that the ban won\u2019t exists. 2) Most of those cash buyers are not corporations they are small time landlords or remote workers or something similar, sure \u201cWall Street\u201d is buying a higher percentage than they use to of new homes but they still own something like 2% of units which is tiny. It is the small investors who are the big players here fat from PPC welfare.  3) As a infill developer I\u2019ve learned that the general public really doesn\u2019t comprehend the hurdles for building and time, it can take years for what should be simple things. If an investor can\u2019t hold a property it will deter investment and new builds which will ultimately increase home prices, or you are going to have to create a big carve out again something that will be exploited. \n\nInstead of trying to create bands that will either won\u2019t work or have horrible unforeseen consequences focus on removing the reason \u201cWall Street\u201d wants to buy houses\u2026 which is the price will keep going up/they provide strong cash flow (when in desirable neighborhoods ). Why because there is usually strict zoning/density restrictions in the most in demand neighborhoods.  Fix this issue and you will stop \u201cWall Street\u201d from buying.",

And moving to cash up front, would prob cause values to go down to say 20% of their current values (the traditional down payment). So just like that the wealth owned by the lowest 90% would plummet considerably. \n\nPlummeting housing values would also lead to making it a bad decision financially to make repairs or improvements when it could just be cheaper to buy another house. Considering how much major repairs cost, when a house needed say a new roof ($15k-20k) the chances of the owner just abandoning any house worth less than $200k currently would skyrocket (you don\u2019t sink $20k in to a house you could only get $10k out of.) So the affordable housing stock would deteriorate within 10-20 years. \n\nCurrent home owners would likely hold on to their homes as long as they could. Why? Current home owners only lose the money when they sell, but the home still has value to the owner and is harder to get for the average person; that\u2019s a receipt for holding on to something for a long time. (Like my mom and her Bennie Babies when the market crashed, cause why don\u2019t keep them just in case the value somehow comes back.) When they die they\u2019ll leave their homes to their heir(s). So then only people whose parents (or someone else) leave them a house would own one.

The drivers who can\u2019t consider what everyone else around them also needs to do are the absolute worst.",

North of town, both the on and off ramps northbound and southbound start and end with long deceleration or acceleration lanes.\n\nSouth of 196, however, the on ramps and off ramps are just a few hundred feet. Wealthy Street's ramps are steep and short. If you're not familiar with them, they can be terrifying. Like, the northbound off ramp at Wealthy comes off the LEFT lane on a 45-degree angle. Thus is also where the infamous S-curve begins.\n\nI merge onto 131 south from MLK Street on a ramp that's less than half a city block on my way to work.\n\nOn my way home, I take north 131 to east 196, in the middle of downtown. The knuckleheads who designed the off ramp thought it would be a good idea to make the exit ALSO the on ramp from Pearl Street to north 131. Yes, that means you have cars speeding up and cars slowing down and sharing the same stretch of pavement. You have seconds to determine if you or the other driver goes first. Also, the off/on exit marks the end of this particular northbound lane. If you miss the off ramp, you have seconds to merge before you run out of road.\n\nBut we're not done. Exiting north 131 to east 196 now means you have a steep downward right-hand curve that turns into an on-ramp. You have four lanes crossing the bridge over the Grand River. The far right lane is the on-ramp that suddenly becomes the EXIT ONLY off ramp to Ottawa Avenue. You have seconds to merge. The next lane to the left is a main traffic lane. The next lane is a main traffic lane. The far left lane is the on-ramp from south 131. It has a double white line - you are not allowed to merge until you cross the bridge. It becomes the third main traffic lane after the Ottawa exit.\n\nSTILL, people getting off south 131 who want to go to Ottawa will illegally cross the double white line, shoot across all lanes, and enter the 131 on-ramp/Ottawa off-ramp, cutting off cars and nearly sideswiping others to get to Ottawa. It nearly happened to me with a semi who wanted to reach the Ottawa exit from the south 131 off ramp while I was using the on-ramp to east 196. \n\nOnly the strong survive here.",

Too many people try to merge immediately and block cars behind them as well.\n\n\n\nI like it when people are going below the speed limit, get in the passing lane, and stay there, even better if they cut you off first because they don't want to be behind a semi that's still 10 seconds away or because they're behind and even slower moving vehicle and either can't wait or don't pay attention to the 3.5 tons of metal already in the process of passing them. Then there's the nut going 90+ weaving through traffic as a construction zone approaches, good times. That's just the stretch of 10 I drove on the Saturday before last to 75 on way to Auburn Hills, where the drivers were somehow less ridiculous, at least until I got close to Flint where the next game of \"how big an accident can we create driving recklessly through active construction\" began\".\n\nOn my way back I did what I was going to do on the way down and took the less stressful \"scenic\" route, and took 15 up to Bay City/Essexville.

Basically there is some responsibility put on both drivers.\n\nEdit: after reading the law, it does state through traffic has the right of way and merging traffic must match the flow of traffic. However, there\u2019s also the expectation that both drivers do what they can to avoid a collision, so if the merging vehicle simply refuses to adjust their speed and a collision is imminent, a judge would put some fault on the through vehicle if they made no attempt to avoid a crash.",
