The volume is 1,508 m3.\n\nYour little pressure washer is tugging along for over 3 hours.\n\nOh and then we get to consider fun things like viscosity of water, resistance to flow when felling, and the ability for air to escape the pipe which is going to be restrict.\n\nNow lets empty the pipe by just opening it. Lets say the water collum pressure is 0,02 bars because the one end is elevated by 5 cm.  So we get a flow of like 3 l/minute (it isn't this simple but lets pretend it is), so with just gravity the pipe will drain in like 8 hours. Once again assuming that there isn't air pushing in or anything constricting the flow, and it's a straight pipe (which it isn't) at ground level that is elevated (And it clearly is not), and it drain completely cleanly (which it wont). Then you ram the compressors and open all the ends of the grid to push the water to the dryer units (Which once again can take a fucking long time - and so will vacuum drying).\n\nSo yeah... you could spend 11 hours doing this. Or you open the primary valve, let the grid equalise (Which can take a while depending on the size of the trunk line) and buy a bottle of peppermint oil, or rent of air leak scanner. Hell...

Simple T and a couple of valves.   Could have this line filled and pressured up in an hour no problem.  \nPeppermint oil-great in theory.  This line is obviously up in the ceiling.  Difficult to tell how high up, but it probably isn\u2019t close.  Dripping water would be much easier to spot than any other method.  \n\nNow.   If this air line is using enough pressure that it\u2019s better ti weld and have it inspected-it should really get a hydro anyways.  Cheap insurance.  \n\nThe part about it taking 10 hours-OP said she(?) spent all night trying to chase down this leak.   One leak.

Its actually pretty easy to weld as long as you can manage the heat properly, as it leaves the metal so quickly. ( Tig welding 16 gauge copper required around 160-240 amps which is much higher than most other metals of a similar thickness)\n\nIt was an interesting job as it helped with my puddle control and welding theory in general.\n\nFor anyone working with tig welding copper sheet metal, I recommend cutting strips of the parent material for your filler metal over using copper welding rods. \n\nCopper IMO experience seems to vary batch to batch. Copper welding rods tend to be a darker shade that is noticeable after grinding/finishing. This only matters if you are needing a consistent visual finish between welds and the base material.",

Company still makes their money, I\u2019m fabricating parts all day, and at the end of the day my weld settings are dialed in for the size of material the next time I pick some up.

For this one I mostly played with my turn table speed, amps, and getting the pulse balance where I like it.\n\nFor example I can do a weld, see how the color is, do I need to change the travel speed? The gas coverage? If those seem good I can concentrate on the bead profile. If I want a tighter bead I can just turn up the pulse frequency or drop my background amperage, and weld another one.\n\nKey thing is once you get close to what you want, change only 1 setting at a time between welds to zero in on which setting will put it in the sweet spot. Again with experience you kind of already have a general idea of what settings will work as soon as you get the parts in front of you.",

For safety, the acetylene in the tank is instead dissolved in acetone or DMF and the cylinder is full of a porous medium.\n\nIf you don't have the cylinder in the upright position or, say, shake it up a bunch and don't let it settle, you might end up sucking acetone instead of acetylene out of the tank.",

DOA (no shit) and from what we figured out, he had it in the trunk of the sedan ratchet strapped down to the trunk floor to prevent it from rolling side to side on turns, but nothing to stop it going front or back; when he hit the tree the thing basically got launched from the sudden stop up the rear seat like a ramp directly into the back of his head. Not sure if the seat was folded down before hand or not, but with how fast he had to have been going judging by the front end damage, the tank very well may have busted the seat right over.

If you tip the bottle the acetone can seep out of the \"sponge\" and sit on the top of the tank for a while, then if you open the valve without leaving it to sit upright long enough so the acetone can soak back in it can spray some of the acetone out of the tank and release way more acetylene than intended. With the standard compressed gas tanks this isn't an issue because the liquid flows to the bottom pretty much immediately, you could even technically run them on their sides if you could reliably check where the liquid levels are to be sure it is below the valve with an adequate safety margin (or in some cases intentionally run them upside down if you are performing an operation that requires the contents in liquid form, like with liquid propane evaporative cooling).",

They all the valves tightened one last time, get capped nice and snug. Lay them flat in my bed, blocked enough so they likely wouldn't move without straps and then i strap the hell out of them and make sure to leave with plenty of time to make the 1 hour trip each way to where i go.",

Same thing in commonly used to hand cleaners like gojo and fast orange). More recently i kept seeing \"diatomaceous earth\" and \"silica based\" materials. \n\nTo my understanding the acetylene gas is actually dissolved into the acetone inside the cylinder which slowly is released (think soda. The carbon dioxide is dissolved into the liquid. When left to sit the carbon dioxide will slowly escape. If opened quickly though it may \"explode\" which is comparable to having your ace regulator too high allowing the acetone to escape). The solid material inside of the cylinder stabilizes it (how? I don't remember. I'm thinking it slows the release maybe by traping the gas or maybe limit the surface area)",

In the Herzig there\u2019s long, longitudinal burner tubes which provide flame/heat for the water/steam tubes. Because this plant is more of an \u201con demand\u201d style where they crank it from 0 to 100 in a matter of minutes and then back down to 0 in the same amount of time.\n\nThe tubes go through extensive expansion and contraction, one tube we needed to cut out had a huge wow in the middle of it. Looked like a banana. And the client waited until the tube was going to almost *fall out* of its keeper before we finally cut it out. It was a hazard which we had to take into account honestly. The end of the tube was THAT close to falling out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/50talt2gd7yd1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a00f9dfcaed6f518bccc609874064d89d6f4273a",

Tough on the body (everyone has sore elbows that week, ever seasoned rock climbers) but the theory stuff is pretty straightforward. Four classroom/training centre days and one day of assessment. Most of that time will be spent practising the physical skills.",

Take a look at these [blades](https://www.zoro.com/pferd-4-125-alumaster-high-speed-disc-hsd-r-20100/i/G706375812/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=surfaces&utm_campaign=shopping%20feed&utm_content=free%20google%20shopping%20clicks&campaignid=21460994857&productid=G706375812&v=&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADw3hZdexC_60T6j8Orn8sa5k2sYY&gclid=CjwKCAjwvKi4BhABEiwAH2gcw3yzgNUakue6ETD83hDPskFUP7ujgJWyBjNGwyjIDOwuZlse5mYsuhoCv7cQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) . The teeth design reduce kick back and can also be easily used with a guard. Again, I know the price is a bit high, but you can probably get the smaller one cheaper or the same one at a discount from a local welding distributer. Note that the teeth are interchangeable and you get two uses per tooth before needing to order more.",

I had my finger between the guard and blade by mistake when I kicked the grinder on. I doubt that a layer of leather would have bogged down the grinder enough to save my finger. Although, since the glove is bulky I\u2019d imagine my finger wouldn\u2019t have fit into that spot as deep, and I probably wouldn\u2019t have hit the bone. Who knows. Either way, those gloves aren\u2019t the correct PPE so it doesn\u2019t matter at the end of the day. \n\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.",

A lot of the times the contractors only send on/off grinders instead of paddle actuated grinders which makes it extra spicy.",

Securing the part so it doesn't move is called restraint, too much and the weld can crack, too little and you get what you see here.\n\n\nYou could also make the base plate bent away from the weld so it gets pulled into position - I'm not sure if there's an official name for it but I call it prepositioning.\n\n\nThe reason any of this is even an issue is due the very nature of how material behaves as temperature changes. Temperature is just the measurement of how much the atoms in a particular substance are moving. More movement means more heat and vice versa. As atoms jiggle around they push each other away, making the affected material expand in size which is measured in volume, or the amount of stuff in a defined space - lookup press fit bearings & gaskets on YouTube for a more tangible visualization.\n\n\nSo, more heat means things expand which increases volume, measured in delta density. Since the base metal is cooler than the arc and molten metal being added, it settles into a shape consistent with it's surface tension and relationship of the joint's geometry. The weld starts to cool from the outside-in but there's a problem. As the outside of the weld (called the weld face) cools, it doesn't have enough malleability to fully shrink proportional to the decrease in temperature, so it shrinks as much as it can and is now in tension, pulling the edges of the weld (weld toes) towards the center of the weld face to equalize the difference in shrinkage to volume. As the weld toes pull inwards, the same process happens underneath the solidified face and all around. This keeps happening until the temperature reaches ambient temperature, affecting a defined area around the weld (heat affected zone or HAZ) and slightly beyond where the molecular grain structures do funny things.\n\n\nTldr; welds are hot, when they cool they shrink, when they shrink they create tension, when they create tension they pull in, when they pull in the metal turns into a potato chip.",

Of course, a good union will help the people who pay dues more than they could do on their own, but just don't automatically assume union = improvement because there are wasteful and corrupt unions out there. Do your research, know your union leaders, and make an informed decision. And know your employer, be wary, because I've seen companies totally clean house over stuff I didn't think they would, including serious union talk. \n\nI know this might seem like the most fencesitting post ever, but often the right decision is more about shades of gray.",

But when times are tough, there's no extra to take, and the company goes under. In general it will go under because of years of being unable to run as lean and competitive as it could have, as innovative as it could have, and because the lowered profits meant the company wasn't worth investing more money in.\n\nBut here's the great thing...\n\nIf a union kills a company, who cares? At worst, you're back in the same shoes you would've been before you unionized... looking for a job in a non-union competitor shop.\n\nUnions are universally a nightmare for the company owners, and a dream come true for the employees.\n\nYour company does not need your charity, and wouldn't give you any of its charity or loyalty in return.

No. I said (repeatedly) that a company has no loyalty to its employees, so show them no loyalty in return. Unionize, and take every cent you can get from them. And if the company fails, which unions play a significant role in, who cares, because you're no worse off than you are today anyways.\n\n> Please explain how unions put companies out of business\u2026\n\nI don't genuinely believe you're so stupid that I would have to explain that to you.\n\nWhat makes a company fail? When they run out of money. So what makes companies that are unionized fail more often than companies that are not? A company that is unionized has higher costs.\n\nOf course it has higher costs, that's why the union is there, it increases employee wages.\n\nUnions also stagnate innovation and cripple further investment.\n\n> there\u2019s numerous unionized companies here that have all been around for 70+ years\n\nAgain, I don't believe you're so stupid that your logic could be this bad.\n\n\"There are some unionized companies that have survived a long time, therefore there is no impact on a company's financial health by unions\" is a nonsensical argument.\n\nIt's like saying \"Seatbelts don't save lives. My uncle hasn't worn a seatbelt in 50 years and he hasn't died in a car crash.\" \n\nI did not say \"All companies that unionize soon fail\".\n\nI said that it is MORE LIKELY to fail. It is harder for it to stay in business. Of the factors that drive a company out of business, there are 3 additional ones with more weight behind them after a company unionizes.\n\n...\n\nFor what it's worth I have a degree in economics, it's not like I'm pulling this out of my ass or these are my personal theories. This is basic reasoning 101. It's not debateable, it's very, very basic and universally agreed on, and the data supports it.\n\nYou're so eager for a fight, or you lack basic literacy, that you think my point is \"Don't unionize, it takes money away from the owners.\"\n\nLearn to read.",

These gates I sorta did an experiments process of sandwiching the glass panels with silicone and CNC\u2019d patterns.  The first two man gates gave birth to more easily removed steel panels that held the glass.  These designs are solid, but if the glass was broken, I found it required re printing the cnc patterns and re sandwiching the glass for a full replacement.  So in terms of of longevity I would further the design by making the steel that sanwhiches the glass thicker so when you pull the steel plates apart they don\u2019t bend out of shape, and you can replace the glass and re sandwich the same steel CNC\u2019d panels.  Or even further, have the soldered windows sit cushioned somehow without having actually glue/silicon holding it in place.  Allowing to easy removable and fixing as needed",

I always found it difficult but only tried it a few times.. I found stainless to be alot easier. For my experience, I've mostly MIG welded and I'm very good at that but it's easy imo... TIG is an art form. Good on ya, bro. I hope you are getting paid well.",
