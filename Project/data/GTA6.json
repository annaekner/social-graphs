To me, it flashes me back to my childhood; playing that over-the-top camera on a game that challenged being bad or good. Then videogame magazines talking about GTA 3, and how it would change the franchise for ever. Then wanting a PS2 so bad until I got it from my parents.\n\nAfter that, Vice City on Internet caf\u00e9s after school. Then Vice City at home. Then GTA IV and my shitty PC not handling it properly. Thanks to that I researched in forums where I met my best friend ever.\n\nThen I finally got my first job, got a nice PC, and played GTA V with medium settings. Then I got a better job, and then a better one, and finally was able to build a BEAST of a PC. And no GTAs were emerging anywhere for me. At least I could play and enjoy RDR2...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut now, guys, full circle for me. A life of memories, of being poor and not affording the hardware required to enjoy my favorite game. Now I do, and now a new game is releasing. Just in case I already have a PS5 at the ready too (but I don't think they would separate the console launch AGAIN, it could happen, but I don't think so).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI AM READY.",

It was a lot like how Bethesda announced Fallout 4 in 2015 which was done masterfully and got the whole world excited.  \nBut with GTA VI....in 2022 they just posted a tweet saying \"btw the game is in development\" and then today just.. tell us when the trailer is going to be announced..? Boring. Imagine if they changed the pallet on their social media or website, posted a countdown, or did an ARG I dunno ANYTHING to make it more exciting.

First there is the intro bank robbery in that one snowy intro map and then upon transitioning to Franklin, I don't think the game really gives you true exploration until you get to his house.  Though I might be wrong about the second part as I think the cop chaise actually gives you a lot of freedom to go wherever you want in the map.\n\nedit: I just remembered that GTAV also implemented mid story lockouts at least on on a character basis.  Pretty sure there is a part where Michael and Trever will get a crazy wanted level if they step into the city part of the map.",

Plus they changed the damage models for the worse too, in IV parts would be flying off or deforming when you hit something, but you could still drive mostly fine. In V they were like tanks in comparison bodywork-wise, but (in SP) a lot of time your wheel would buckle and jam in a crash, making you need to switch cars which was frustrating in a chase. I still think driving was more rewarding in IV, felt awesome when you pulled a massive powerslide round a corner in a Dukes, and dodging Annihilators driving a Sentinel round the airport in MP. But yeah, I think I'd hate it too playing it the other way round tbh",

According to research on primates at Emory University, when male monkeys so much as see sexually active females, they can register a testosterone increase of up to 400 per cent.\n\nMuch like our primate cousins, researchers from Rutgers University in Germany have suggested that when male humans view adult movies, their dopamine levels increase, associated with a spike in testosterone levels. The study offers good news for all the single guys out there as researchers suggest that you do not need a real-life partner to benefit from increased testosterone, simply having an erection is all you need to spur production. In another study from 1990, Scottish scientists studied the endocrine responses to erotic stimulation. Interestingly, the study showed a non-significant rise in testosterone due to the x-rated images, however it did show a significant rise in cortisolin those who watched the neutral (non-pornographic) film, and a noticeable reduction in the levels of those who viewed the adult material. Cortisol of course, is many bodybuilders\u2019 worst enemy due to its catabolic effects when high levels are present. This change in cortisol levels may be due to reduced prolactin and thus, high dopamine levels. In perhaps the most promising study to date, a more recent investigation by Cook and Crewther examined the effects that different videos induced on participants\u2019 3 Rep Max squat performance. Participants were shown short clips of motivational, sad, training, humorous as well as erotic videos before performing their 3RM squat lift. The erotic, training and aggressive videos resulted in a significant improvement in the squat performance compared to the neutral control videos.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.predatornutrition.com/articlesdetail?cid=can-watching-porn-boost-testosterone-before-hitting-the-gym\n\nMore like weak men don\u2019t watch enough porn noob",

My understanding is that this can NOT be done with screen space effects. \n\nFor context, most reflections in games are screen space reflections. This means that they use the image already rendered onto the screen outside of the reflection and flip it for the reflection. It is why in many games, if you're looking at the water or a puddle, and you slowly pan the camera down, as you cut off the stuff that is being reflected, the reflection starts disappearing. If there is nothing on screen to reflect, no reflection occurs.\n\nWith the car mirror, we know it can't be using screen space reflections because what it is reflecting is not visible anywhere on screen. The question for me is... does that only leave ray traced reflections, or is it possible they are using some other trick?\n\nProbably ray tracing.",

The leaked diner scene showed CCTV alerting the Dade County Sheriff's Dept: but they had a response time. So hopefully if we're quick. We can get in and out before the cops rock up. \n\nThe use of Social Media in the trailer. Tells me people are going to film you. Will this bring the cops? Or just our crimes appear on Weazel News. Would be cool if a Weazel News Maverick (filmed the Triathlons in V) will show up. So you have to lose the News chopper before the VCPD Maverick shows up. Could we steal people's phone then hock it @ the Fence (from RDR2). Adding insult to injury to snitches \ud83d\udc2d.\n\nSomething else I thought of is Chinatown Wars: had CCTV cameras so maybe we can take them out to increase the cops response time. I wonder if there will be a safe we can crack or blow open w/ C4. Like in RDR2 (There was a safe in back of every store in Saints Row). Also RDR2 had back rooms. If the game has a Taser we might be able to zap clerk \u26a1, zip tie them, crack the safe then get out before the cops rock up.\n\nJust had a thought if 6 is like Saints Row 2/The Punisher on PS2: then we can take hostages. Use them as bullet shields or a bargaining chip (Rainbow Six Siege: another example of excellent destructible environments). In IV cops would arrest suspects. Cop chasing a crook, we punch 'em. Watch 'em get arrested: Good citizen bonus $50. This is Vice City \ud83c\udf34\ud83e\ude77. Hopefully we can get brass knuckles \ud83d\udc4a: POW! Right in the kisser.",

Similar to how you can switch to the dashcam or chopper view of the cops chasing you in GTA V.\n\nAnd I would be surprised (and also hope) that when you are wasted, you can potentially see NPC's reacting to the scene, especially through their phone cameras.

It's been in development about as long or longer than Star Citizen. It's crazy to think about just how much ridiculously fun and interactive stuff Rockstar can pack into a game at this point in their life as a company. They are richer than ever and have more creative people employed than ever. They have what amounts to a limitless pocketbook, so I really expect an in-depth experience that blows 5 outta the water.

Heck, I wish for vigilante missions to return where it's no longer limited to a car or a short time limit and I hope this integrates into the honor system so that the player can have a high honor system by being seen on social media for stopping criminals online with the most insane methods you can think of too.\n\nI want to have a moral decision system for an open-ended mission and I plan to make Lucia or Jason a high honor ASAP.",

Actually fun fact an AI recording you is technically possible in GTA V but with heavy modification and a script. Now In regards to what the OP said it's more then possible if they have a system set up for social media. \"If this true then this...\" basically with routes setup within the game engine via a script that turns the NPC into a camera with a generated overlay (basically would generate an overlay such as Tik Tok or Instagram live or snap chat from a predefined list of overlays(basically Procedural) as well as generated title and comments and usernames) where you can view later on. This is more than possible with today's tech and software. In lamens terms it would basically be a heavily modified version of replay mode that's been in games since the 90s/early 2000s. What about how it would be stored? Wouldn't that take up even more space on your hard drive? No, not in theory as the engine could put the footage into a predefined temp file and after so much time passes in game that social post/news story is no longer available and it deletes that footage.\n\nEdit- It is more then likely theyve used the Rockstar Editor as the foundation for this as it already stores a simplified version of your frame by frame gameplay, such as the position of every character, vehicle, object, particle effects/animations/sounds and their start time + their current % elapsed in a temp file.",

Eyebrows are also a different shape. Lucia has more of an arch to her eyebrow, and extends wider. See below comparison. I'd also suggest that her eyes don't look to be brown behind those lenses, but that's harder to determine because of the colour tint. The do look much lighter though, as though they could be blue/green, not dark brown as Lucia's are. She does have the same ear rings, and there's some other similarities, but it's not Lucia.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pied4bg1l4c1.jpeg?width=1480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1844ac045f75866e7e27bd5c5778a3d8016bcff",

The duo gains media attention via social media and this is probably Lucia doing such. What better way to grab attention than to wear a bikini in some party for someone to record her?\n\nThe same thing with that footage of the woman in the car on the causeway with her arms in the air. That woman was Lucia and the driver Jason. Someone was recording them in the car next to them. Maybe there's some sort of gameplay element, a-la hidden packages/side missions, but with building notoriety for the duo.

But now with all the debates and with me watching the trailer as many times as i have now, I don't think it's her. She resembles her but I don't think it's actually her. Lucia has more moles on her face that aren't present on the other girl. Maybe it could be makeup that is covering the other moles but i don't think so. I know about the old leaks showing Lucia having a similar hairstyle too. It could be her don't get me wrong. It's kinda 50/50. Guess we'll see in 2025.",

A physical game on the other hand usually doesn't contain all the files necessary to play the game and so players will need to take the physical copy home and the run a day 1 update to get the last minute game breaking fixes at which point the servers will be massively overloaded and angry forum posts will be made. At least that's what I've gleaned from past game releases. Please correct me of I'm wrong especially with regards to GTA6.",

GTA is a series that draws as much casuals as it does core gamers, that's why it seems like there are so many clowns in the GTA community who don't know much about gaming. The whole 'PS5  and Xbox won't gave the install base for them to just do PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions\" when we didn't even know the release or the first trailer. \n\nDon't get me started on the Twitter response to the leaks back in 2022, again a bunch of people who don't know jack squat about game development looking a bunch of pre-alpha footage and saying the game looked back, even ones who were dumb enough to look at the untextured NPCs and judge judged it as a finished product or something. Like seriously, there were people who seriously look at that and thought Rockstar would launch a game with unfinished NPCs around. \n\nI love Twitter because damn it provides plenty crazy stuff to laugh at but damn is that site a beacon of stupidity. How about the time when that dude posted the video of Niko shooting up the hospital and saying he hoped we get interiors like that again in GTA6. And you had people going all Jack Thompson talking about how they shouldn't have stuff like that in the game, and the only reason for the outrage was that he was shooting people in a building\u2026 like bro so it's acceptable to go outside and just shoot random NPCs in the game but go into an interior and it's a no-no? People really tried to argue that on there and had no go points about what the difference is. \n\nBecause I guess since a lot of mass shootings happen in buildings that it looks bad, when we had mass shootings before and around the time GTA4 came out. Yeah because no mass shootings ever took place outdoors? Around the same time GTA4 came out is also when researchers, people who were studying if video game violence influenced real life violence came to a definitive conclusion that there was no link. \n\nI remember that dude GmanLives got dragged for putting his two sense in on that. A YouTuber whose whole channel is based around reviewing shooters and other violent video games. Dude really says he doesn't kill NPCs, he kills cops and the bad guys the game tell you to and people reminded him of the content he makes.\n\nAll that but yeah, the idea that GTA6, the most anticipated video game ever and follow up to the single greatest selling and most profitable piece of media over any media ever is not going to make it's money back is a goofy ahh take. The online portion is going to make up for most of that guaranteed. Hate it all you want and I barely about GTAO myself, but it's an inevitable fact. All the pay-to-win mechanics and shark cards galore, you know it's coming back.",

                    "body": "I thought we have already figured out based on the leaks and coordinates that the map is at least twice the size of 5, just based on what we know so far. We don't know how far north it goes and how big that could be. \n\n The announcement for 5 tended to refer it to as Los Santos and not San Andreas but the announcement for 6 says \"the state of Leonida\". We already know there is at least ONE other large city besides VC, if not two as it is rumored there are two others. So the map in all likelihood is more akin to San Andreas in depicting a whole state rather than 5 in depicting just one metro and the surrounding region.\n\n I don't believe it will be just southern Florida, it will include the north and maybe even roll in part of Georgia/Alabama/South Carolina in that northern area even if it's meant to be within one state. Think how RDR2 depicted a zoomed out version of the southern West-Central portion of the U.S., even extending into the northern Rockies and Yosemite (Big Valley). 5's map depicted a zoomed out version of just SoCal and not the entire state like San Andreas yet it was twice the size of the San Andreas map. \n\nSo considering all of this I think it's gonna be more than twice the size of 5's map. How much more is the question. But if just the part based on SoFlo is itself already twice the size of 5, once you include the Northern  part of the map it could be as much as 3 to 4 times bigger than 5. I know a lot of people will say that there is no way they will make it that big but we will see. \n\nSo I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it will at least be around 250 square kilometers.",

In other games lets say Fallout or Starfield they just feel like regular rooms with rocky walls. But in rdr2 it actually feels like you exploring real caves. \n\nBut I feel like at the same time, it's easier to fill up empty lands with trees and bushes since not all of them have to be placed by hand. A lot of it can be randomly generated. With a city everything needs to be placed by hand in the right place. From garbage in alleys to shop interiors.",

                    "body": "I think that\u2019s true to a point. Now that we have begun to reach a point (especially Rockstar) where foliage and rural settings can and do look near photorealistic, as well as dynamically behave in a convincing manner, the script is a bit flipped. Despite the increasing exposure to urban environments, natural environments are hardwired into our brains, and we know how they look, to an expert degree. Natural environments also don\u2019t offer nearly as high an amount of variability as urban ones do. I don\u2019t mean of course overall, as many different natural scenery exists, and it\u2019s extremely diverse. \n\nBut in terms of believability, there\u2019s a set amount of visual aesthetics regarding trees in the south eastern US. They are going to be a shade of green, yellow, brown, or red. They will be at a specific scale, etc. Water pretty much looks and behaves identically, and therefore we know what we are aiming for there (and again this asset has really been mastered over the last decade or so.). Where as urban environments are literally artificial. The sky is the limit in terms of design, texture, shapes, behavior, etc. I think constructing urban metropolises the size of what we see in GTA and Cyberpunk is definitely a massive undertaking. Much more so than RDR2s prairies and woodlands. \n\nThere\u2019s also no expectation of composition with respect to natural elements. They can be scattered and randomly planted by a tool or algorithm and it will appear soothing and acceptable to our brains. Yet we know how exactly how intersections should be laid out. We know what the strip in Miami looks like. We know how a chicks ass jiggles as she twerks atop a four door sedan at 15-20 mph. They have to design TO those standards, in order to maintain the immersion. That takes tender love and care. \n\nEither way, I\u2019m glad people like you and Rockstar are willing and able to do it. Because that is patience I will never know. Bless you \ud83d\ude4f",

Stuff like how the engine makes a ticking sound once you get out, how you only get wet to the level you actually get in and your trainers will make squeeky noises cuz their wet, police pulling injured officers out the way, the amount of stuff just on the TV for you to watch.

Those kinds of textures are still pretty standard when you compare them to other, newer open world games.

It really makes me hyped how much better this looks compared to any of the other games I've seen advertised.\n\nHaving said that, I do think there are games which put GTA 5's graphics to shame at a grander scale (including Spider-Man more broadly), Red Dead 2, CyberPunk, etc.",

Besides that, IGN and gamespot Youtube channels both syphoned a lot of millions of views from the OG video from Rockstar channel. If one counts the views within 24 hours from the Rockstar Games channel, IGN channel and Gamespot channel, you end up with OVER 110 million views close to 111 million views. So in fact \nGTA VI BEAT BTS and factually won. When BTS released their top video with 108 million views, other channels got copyright strike so all views remained within 24 hours on the OG VIDEO. With GTA VI there was a leak first then Rockstar quickly responded with the official video and IGN and Gamestop channels stole the views without consequences and made it impossible for the official video to reach the BTS numbers within 24 hours on the main channel. It's cheating and that's a fact! One must combine the views of the 3 channels for the GTA VI trailer, only then it's fair!",

It's a big dumb action movie and that is what it should remain.\n\nI think people need to remember that Red Dead 2 and GTA are very different games in a lot of ways. Not everything that works in GTA works in Red Dead, just like not everything that works in Red Dead would work in GTA. \n\nPutting limitations on the players weapons, or some of the ither insane suggestions I have seen like a hot-wiring minigame every time you steal a car, or an even more ridiculous one that cops would chase you for speeding/running red lights would completely break the gameplay and actively spoil what makes the GTA games fun in the first place.",

But what if your car explodes? What would be the logic for the weapons to be intact? Or would you lose all of your weapons? And if the weapons do survive, you would have a hard time finding a car that can hold all of your weapons, like a van. And also, in a shootout, I think that wouldn't be fun for the majority of people to come out of the car, run to the trunk and get a gun.\n\nI think that this mechanic would be more frustrating than fun in a GTA game.

That game, especially being the next release after San Andreas, often felt more like a tech demo at times than it did a fully fleshed out GTA game. \n\nDon't get me wrong IV and V were still good games, I just feel neither were better than San Andreas was, especially relative to when they came out. I am hoping that VI can get the series back to the quality that was there with San Andreas with an interesting map, a long story with many unique and fun missions. \n\nRDR2 shows Rockstar still can produce at a higher quality than anyone else, so I expect VI's story to be high tier. My biggest worries with it are the length of the story and the freedom in the gameplay. It's no secret that GTA V and RDR2 were significantly more linearly structured in their missions that the older GTA titles were, and that's been a negative in my eyes.",

GTA IV is the perfect length for me because Liberty City is such an incredible city. Say what you want about the size of it, but every inch of that map is absolutely packed with things to see and do. That in return, makes actually doing the missions themselves more engaging.\n\nV's missions (for the most part) were consistently all good-great, and they did a good job of \"trimming off the mission fat.\" But sometimes that fat adds more flavor, and I think a quick filler mission here or there adds another layer of depth that V didn't keep. Sure, there are the Strangers & Freaks missions, which function exactly the same AS the story missions, so if you look at it that way, that means GTA V technically has 127 \"story missions.\"\n\nSan Andreas had the most potential to do what IV did before it did, but SA almost has the exact opposite problem: too much fat. There's so many missions in between all of the standout ones that are just annoying- especially in the mid game. You can really feel the mission design \"cutting room floor\" changes, and as iconic as the countryside is, driving to Angel Pine from San Fierro sucks. Every. Time. You could cut quite a few missions in this game and honestly as much as I adore it, it'd be better for it.\n\nIV's missions, while still sharing a lot of fat, worked so much better for it because you were never NOT engaged with Liberty City. The world of that game was the true star, not Niko (much love for my boy though dw) and the more basic missions could benefit from just how finely crafted that city is.",

I think this will be one of those games where, even after the story,  we still have missions to complete. Rockstar mastered that formula in online, why not bring it to single player?",

Drive to location, shoot up enemies, drive back and/or escape. It's not like the game has any diversity in approach either like stealth so it becomes dull quickly. However, including a bunch of gameplay pillars is something that kind of started happening after that era. The Ubisoft approach of open worlds where you're pretty much given a sandbox mission area and you choose to approach mostly began circa 2010 and kept opening up more and more afterwards. Now we're probably overexposed to that style of gameplay as well. I loved doing it in AC Origins and was sick of it by the time Odyssey came out. It's like comparing Uncharted 1 gameplay to Uncharted 4. They're designed quite differently in the way enemies behave and how detection works. Rockstar never really stopped doing overly scripted missions, but we've seen how capable they are at actually doing the sandbox stuff in-game. RDR2 has a bunch of open world encounters and activities that respond to your choices and actions and I feel like they've gone underappreciated with how interesting they are. Everybody focuses on the missions, but the open world has a bunch of non-linear gameplay opportunities. I would compare them slightly to the Gigs in Cyberpunk 2077 where most players probably don't know there's multiple ways to complete most of them, they just don't spell it out on the objective bar and take experimenting.",

A lot of the tension between Mike and Trevor due to Brad had to be resolved when they hung out with each other after the story completion. The story just felt rushed at times.",

Ballad on the other hand I will agree was pretty varied, one of the best DLC ever put out imo even though a lot of the side content in Ballad is kind of pointless.\n\nAs for GTAIV itself, I do agree a lot of the shootouts and car chases are pretty generic. However, I do think that a lot of the missions were creative. Almost any assassination mission has some unique bit to it. The use of the internet and the phone mechanics were a lot of what IV was built around and they used them. I mean, there's at least three missions where you use the internet to set up hits through calls or email that I can remember off the top of my head.\n\nThe missions with multiple outcomes from choices about who to spare and kill, there's a lot there.\n\nSo, while I would argue vanilla IV didn't lack mission variety, I would say you're right that the gunfights and chase scenarios do lack originality. I think that's more a set piece limitation though. IV was the most grounded and properly started the HD universe stuff so it was kind of rare to get bombastic set pieces like the bank heist.\n\nThat's something I'd give V over IV easily. The shootout scenarios always felt unique.",

The graphics, the gameplay, the depth of features, etc. For example, GTA V clearly is the better looking game compared to GTA 3, it's clearly got a bigger world, more guns, and so on. However, GTA 3 was revolutionary for its time because it was doing things that had not been done before. \n\nGTA Vice City built off of that. GTA San Andreas took it even further.\n\nGTA V didn't really hit that same level. Sure, GTA Online has turned out to be a smashing hit and could potentially be described as revolutionary for gaming, but GTA V's single player was clearly not. \n\nRelative to the other games that were released in or around 2013, GTA V did not surpass them like GTA 3, VC, or SA did in 2001, 2002, and 2004. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a more modern example. It's graphics, story, animation quality, attention to detail, etc. are all considered top notch still after nearly half a decade. It did things that modern releases are still not matching. That simply was not the case with GTA V. I know you can't discount GTA Online, but when you focus solely on the single player side of GTA V, the depth of the game, the attention to detail, none of it was pushing the industry forward as much as the other GTA games were or like RDR2 did.",

They have the resources and talent to make a colossal game the will push the hardware to it's limits.  Which hasn't been done before on the PS5 and series X as far as I'm aware.   Games for these current gen consoles. Haven't had time to catch up to its limitations.  We still haven't experienced a major leap in this console generation because developers have been hard at work making the games. And making games of that caliber takes a very long time.\n\nI've seen people on almost every post be so pessimistic saying that certain mechanics won't be achievable on this generation of console so they won't be in the game.   When you look at Red Dead redemption 2 that came out in 2018 on the PS4 and Xbox One and then compare it to GTA V that came out in 2013 on the PS 3 and Xbox 360 It shows a colossal leap In every aspect. Now what makes people think that GTA 6 won't be another colossal leap, probably double of what it was for GTA v in Red Dead 2. There is no doubt that this game is going to be setting a new bar for immersion in the gaming industry.  To underestimate rockstar's capabilities with their current track record Is like underestimating a fight with prime Mike Tyson.\n\n",

So when it came out and I put the game disc in my Xbox 360 on release day, I felt like I'd already played it before. Being *that excited* and having so many expectations definitely killed a lot of the hype for me. I thought this game was going to change my life, school was shit and it was the only thing I was looking forward to, and that I'd play it everyday... but the reality was I completed the main story within 2 weeks and left it for fucking months before I eventually ever came back to it. Started producing music even and haven't stopped since!\n\n> people want too much\n\nMy point is, I was young back then and hype got the better of me. The game was incredible for what it was, but I alone ruined it for myself. I think a lot of other people here will do that too with *VI*. Now that I'm older, it's easier to reign in expectations and not go too overkill on looking up interviews, reviews, gameplay videos, songs, etc and dreaming of all the impossible things that I would like in a GTA game.\n\nMostly, I genuinely think it's down to age. Younger people are going to be frantically obsessed with all things *Grand Theft Auto VI* until release, because it's probably the first (and only) GTA rollout in their lifetime, where they're able to go and buy the game for themselves and everything.\n\nThey've just got to keep their hype and expectations in check, ofherwise, like you implied, they're going to be beyond disappointed. \n\n(Sorry for the wall of text reply!)",

He views video games as a lower artform, he also calls it a \u201ccartoon\u201d. He doesn\u2019t like how his work on GTA overshadows everything else he does. He had small roles in Better Call Saul, WestWorld & Walking Dead.\n\nHe\u2019s getting typecast to the \u201ccrazy guy\u201d roles. Which usually most actors don\u2019t like getting typecasted.\n\nAlso fans keep calling him \u201cTrevor\u201d but don\u2019t even know his real name. \n\nI see it happen to Ned Luke & Solo in interviews too with random YouTubers who are interviewing who keep calling them Micheal/Franklin as if that\u2019s their real name. They have to sometimes remind them what their real names are, which I imagine can be annoying.\n\nTLDR; basically Steven Ogg is like my dad, he\u2019s stuck in the 80s and still thinks there\u2019s a cultural stigma against video games, and doesn\u2019t understand how mainstream & popular gaming is nowadays.",

So my theory is that they hated having to do the DLC and they hated what they came up with, at least for TLaD (and I would concur). \n\nTBoGT felt much more complete and there were several mechanics kind of play tested that made it into GTA V (base jumps, golf, mission scores), so I guess they eventually warmed up to it. TLaD felt uninspired and kind of lackluster, so my immediate thoughts when Trevor wiped them out weren't \"he's a nut job\" but \"they must have hated it too\".",

His best bet for a while was doing parodies of 1960's Batman. Family Guy helped break him out of that rut by casting him as an unhinged version of himself who got elected mayor.",

By contrast, *VI* seems more subversive and exciting ***because*** a lot more is clearly going on with Lucia. How much of her compassion is an act, how much of it is genuine yet misguided? *Can you be a good criminal?* This is the type of shit Rockstar *should* be asking, not \"lol what if she stuffed a corpse in a toilet?\"\n\nDon't get me wrong - I love T and always will.

Just look at the trailer - there's so much going on and that means there's so much that can go wrong. So they pushed it to 2025. I think spring 2025 is going to be the aim. But they've been vague because they don't want to say they've pushed it back if they do, in fact, push it back. If they say it's coming out in March we'll all be happy. If they say it's coming out in October then people will be disappointed but it's a sign that they won't release it till they are happy that everything in it is working perfectly. This isn't going to be a bugged release with a million updates in the first few months and videos of cars suddenly taking off and flying into the sky. When this game comes out it will all be perfect, I have no doubt of that.",
