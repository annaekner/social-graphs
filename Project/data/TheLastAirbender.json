Yes his ear is scarred too but its acoustic function is intact that I doubt the fire somehow damaged his eardrum.\n\nWe only see Zuko sleeping in a few cases over the show so there are only a few opportinuties to show him in different sleeping positions. \n\nIt also doesnt fit with the situations in the first place. Why would he feel safer on a boat with tons of strangers than at home, in his own bed in literally the safest place in the entire nation?",

In 9th grade, we had to write a poem, and the teacher asked for volunteers to read them out loud so that the class could interpret it. I liked to write stuff at the time so I felt quite confident to present my poem to the class.\n\nThe funny thing is how much everyone put in the usage of two different words that mean basically the same when my sole motivation for using these words was that I didn't like a word repetition at that point. When I said that eventually, the teacher pretty much said that at the point t of publishing it, the authors idea became rather meaningless in Ci trust to the publics interpretation -.- .",

I used the example in another comment of chef skinner pouring wine he twists his wrist to prevent spilling the wine. An animator had to consciously make that decision, had to specify the viscosity of the wine, the splash rate etc. it\u2019s just something that comes with the territory. I do agree that there is definitely some reaching here on this subreddit though so that\u2019s why I prefaced it with the devils advocate point of view.

In live action people have muscle memory, habits etc, so something like that in live action can be accounted for because that\u2019s something a person does. In animation, every movement, every fluid poured every object that interacts is all meticulously planned and accounted for to make it seem more lifelike that would normally happen just from what a real person would do without thinking. That\u2019s what I\u2019m referring to not that one show is so amazing or whatever. It\u2019s about the process and the differences between having a real human and a animated human",

                    "body": "I disagree with that actually. \n\n~~I think Azula was simply born a psycopath, or rather born with a high likelihood of being afflicted with psycopathy, and then contracting it at a very early age, like Ozai, and Zuko wasn't. Just as Ozai is clearly a narcissistic psycopath, and Iroh is not.~~ **Changed my mind, see: EDIT below.**\n\nThere's not a particular reason we're given for this - Ozai was born with power and let it go to his head, either simply born a psycopath, or developing as one very young from the cirumstances of being born into power.\n\nWhile Iroh may have committed many terrible atrocities in his past, this is also in parallel with people in real life. People who are not psycopaths can still do terrible things, out of a sense of duty or necessity. But Iroh, unlike Ozai, changes. He grows. \n\nZuko spent his life believing that being like Ozai and Azula was the way people are *supposed* to be. One of the reasons he's so hard on himself is because he keeps trying and failing to be like Ozai and Azula, and because he's young, he doesn't realize that the reason he's failing is because those two are broken human beings, and he isn't.\n\nThat's why >!In the final season when Zuko and Iroh reunite, Iroh says \"I was never angry with you. I was sad because I was afriad you'd lose your way.\"!< He knows Zuko has the capacity to change and learn and grow.\n\nContrast that when >!he's fighting Azula and says \"no she's crazy and needs to go down\"!<\n\nIroh knows Azula takes after Iroh's brother. She's only going to learn by force, the way psycopaths typically operate.\n\nThis is one of my favorite aspects of Avatar, actually. And probably one that, unlike the topic of this post, the showrunners most likely *did* intend. It is a very nuanced and mature depiction of psycopathy and the affect that being raised by a psycopath can have on siblings. \n\nOne of Zuko's greatest childhood tragedy is that he's someone that clearly keeps trying, and failing, to \"live down\" to the level of psycopathy of his sister and Ozai. He thinks that's aspirational, when in reality we know that Azula and Ozai are both emotionally stunted, manipulative narcissists. They have no emotional growth or development, and no capacity for it. They merely inflict pain and tragedy on everyone around them. \n\nAzula is a really, really excellent depiction of a psycopath / narcissist. She's not just a rampant serial killer. Although she's extremely violent, violence is only one tool in the toolbox of the way she interacts with people. She's charismatic, but also deeply manipulative. Her friends follow her and even initially look up to / revere her, but eventually they come to understand shes not complex. She's completely shallow, utterly and entirely self-motivated. She doesn't care about the fire kingdom or her duty or any of that. She only cares about herself and her own power.\n\nThis is how so many ambitious psycopaths will move throughout life. They gain a following, people who are attracted to their charm and charisma and ambition. But eventually, over time, over repeated abuses, those followers will realize that their relationship and loyalty never meant anything to the psycopath, because the psycopath is simply incapable of valuing them. They are not emotionally capable of reciprocating affection. \n\nZuko, on the other hand, despite being abused his entire life, despite being offered a truly horrific template of how to behave by his father and his sister, acclimates to humanity quite quickly when joining Aang & crew. Although clearly this is a struggle for him at first, he approaches them with humility. He demonstrates empathy in *being capable of understanding how HE must appear to THEM*. \n\nAzula would not be capable of that. In that situation, it would not even occur to her to consider how she must have made Aang & crew feel in the past, and she wouldn't care or feel any shame about it. \n\nZuko doesn't *appear* to be a better leader than his sister at first. Just as Iroh doesn't *appear* to be a better leader than his brother Ozai. \n\nAnd this is a tragedy often echoed in real life. Too often we gravitate towards psycopaths for their confidence and boldness. We view empathy, consideration, and mercy as weaknesses. But they are not. They are profound strengths, even if the public often does not truly appreciate them at first.\n\nThe Ozai / Iroh / Azula / Zuko dynamic is easily my absolute favorite part of the show, because I was honestly blow away by what a mature, deep and nuanced depiction of that family dynamic it was, especially for a cartoon intended for children. You rarely see that level of deep, mature and realistic characterization and its what made the biggest lasting impact on me in the series.\n\n**EDIT**: /u/Prying_Pandora [has a really great rebuttal to everything I said here](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/18d3qxe/never_noticed_this_until_now/kcfcu4g/), with links to the showrunner discusses an always-intended redemption arc for Azula as well as some very convincing arguments against diagnosing her a psyocpath in a [write up here](https://www.tumblr.com/prying-pandora666/717158028012650496/azula-diagnosis-analysis-masterpost?source=share).  \n\n\u0394+1 to /u/Prying_pandora\n\nThey came with the evidence and the proof. And they stuck through my stubbornness and changed my mind and gave me new perspective. It was a rewarding experience and I'm thankful to them and the work they put in to do so.",

Why not acknowledge that too?\n\nZuko lays out that he believed the propaganda and that it was his banishment and Iroh\u2019s guidance that helped him see the truth.\n\nAzula isn\u2019t so different from how Zuko used to be. The difference is he got out and got help. Azula got enmeshed with her abuser.\n\nYou can agree or disagree with whether you think Azula should be redeemed. But reducing the message of ATLA, which is a story of redemption and healing, to a simple \u201cyou\u2019re born good or mentally ill therefore evil\u201d does it a huge disservice.\n\nThe argument that only psychopaths learn by force is ridiculous considering Zuko had to have his entire life forcefully fall apart before he learned.

If Sokka hadn\u2019t blocked it, Suki would\u2019ve been toast. \n\nNot to mention the kids he almost runs over in the SWT and the multiple villages he attacked (even burning down Suki\u2019s entirely). \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love Zuko. I think he had a good heart. But brainwashing and cultural conditioning will do that to a person.\n\n>Zuko couldn't even bring himself to burn Zhao who constantly bullied and insulted him, and even tried to save him after Zhao attempted to have him assassinated.\n\nZhao is also one of his own people and someone of high rank and importance. It\u2019s not strange that early Zuko recognized Zhao\u2019s humanity but did not immediately empathize with the people he had been taught to conquer and oppress.\n\nLike I said, this is a product of cultural brainwashing. \n\n>The worst he did to his crew was being an ass and puff his chest up before making up with them after saving a crew member together.\n\nThis isn\u2019t true.\n\nHe told them their lives do not matter and forced them into danger. They could\u2019ve all been killed, a fact the crew brought up to Zuko, and all Zuko had to say was that their lives were disposable in service of his goals.\n\nIf the storm hadn\u2019t taught him a lesson, he wouldn\u2019t have shown remorse. Zuko learned because he had consequences. \n\n>In just the first episode of Book 2, Azula threatens to kill her captain so he makes the boat go faster, and attempts to kill Zuko, only being stopped by Iroh.\n\nAzula threatens her captain to juxtapose how much more efficient she is at controlling her men than Zuko, who would yell impudently and not get taken seriously. This signals to the audience that Azula is a bigger threat than Zuko.\n\nAzula being more competent and an efficient leader does not make her less ethical. It just means she has further to fall to face consequences and learn a lesson.\n\nShe also doesn\u2019t initially try to kill Zuko at all. She tries to deceive him so she can catch him peacefully. She only fights as a last resort, which is common for her.\n\nZuko tends to rush in with violence as a first resort. Azula prefers to try manipulation and intimidation first.\n\n>Zuko's level of moral decay in Book 1 is not comparable to Azula's.\n\nYes it is and this is most clearly demonstrated by Zuko himself who basically says as much to Ozai. That he believed the lie (same as Azula still does) that this was all the right thing to do, and that it took Iroh\u2019s guidance, experience in the EK among their people, and distance from Ozai to learn better. Azula has had none of these benefits and is in fact more enmeshed with Ozai.\n\nIn fact, it could be argued that Zuko hiring an assassin to kill Aang is a more unethical choice than anything Azula ever does. \n\nAzula tries to kill Aang while in combat and to prevent Aang from unleashing the Avatar State - a move which wiped their entire fleet at the NWT. This is an understandable motivation to prevent everyone on your side from being killed first.\n\nHowever, Zuko hires an assassin *after* he knows the war is wrong and that Aang is the only hope to stop it. Yet he does it anyway to cover his own ass and preserve his father\u2019s favor. This is a far more selfish and unethical act than Azula ever commits, arguably, and yet we understand why Zuko did it.\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t Azula be shown the same grace considering she was under the same pressures to stay in Ozai\u2019s good graces, and unlike Zuko hadn\u2019t learned that everything they were doing was wrong?",

Some people are born psycopaths. Or at least, they're born with an extremely high risk for it, and often are afflicted with it so early in life that they are considered not likely to have that condition be reversible.\n\nGood and evil aren't things that truly exist. And I wouldn't say psycopathy is a mental illness, per se, because it doesn't really impact your own functional behaviors or your ability to achieve your goals (though for some it can.). It is classified in the DSM, but it's tricky, because it doesn't necessarily cause harm to the individual at all.\n\nBut you can absolutely be born a psycopath, or born / raised as a narcissist from a very early age, and those people are not considered to have much, if any, possibility of changing. They simply don't.\n\nThat's the world. And that's the maturity I enjoyed with the initial depiction.\n\nToo many narratives act as though redemption is some universal salve. And it isn't. Some individuals are not capable of change. Part of life is understanding that. It doesn't mean we can't view them with sympathy and empathy. But it does mean not deluding ourselves into believing that everyone is capable of change, or at least, that everyone is capable of moving from psycopathy to some stable state of empathy and compassion.\n\nI would also say Iroh doing terrible things isn't demonstrative of him being a psycopath. Plenty of people can carry out atrocities without being a psycopath. They do it out of a belief in duty or some other motivating factor. But Iroh clearly has an emotional depth which we do not see in Ozai or Azula in the parts of the narrative I experienced.\n\nZuko also does terrible things. Which is why it seemed clear to me the narrative was drawing parallels between Iroh and Zuko. He recognized that Zuko was on a dark path. But also that he was cpaable of change, unlike his sister. \n\nI would say that introducing a redemption arc for Azula would be a step down from the original narrative, because then it would seem as though Iroh randomly chose one of Ozai's children to save, and one to essentially write off despite her being saveable. \n\nIn the citation I rererenced from the show Iroh *clearly* does not extend his usual dialog of tolerance and redemption when he says \"No she's crazy and she needs to be taken down\". That seems pretty clear to me.",

His friends all have elemental superpowers, one of them is the whole ass Avatar, of course they're the ones who should be saving the world - but Sokka doesn't have any of that, he's just a guy, but he's up there swinging with the big dogs. This teenager with a boomerang and some gumption faces down, outmaneuvers, and defeats seriously powerful benders on the regular, when zero other non-bender adults were even close to on his level. His own dad wasn't even the leader he was. Hell, the entire White Lotus didn't have a fraction of the impact Sokka did. The kid just saw that no one else was stepping up to the role of the general and he did the damn thing.",

There have been a lot of instances in this show where he can escape with his speed. But this is the worst one because he literally says she's to quick when that's obviously a lie.

Because maybe there's some hidden rule of the world the viewer just doesn't understand yet (like bloodbending).

Azula is a very crafty and shrewd individual on top of being agile, and they're also in an enclosed space with a bunch of Dai Li agents backing her up.\n\n\nThe writers probably didn't think about it but it's honestly not that unreasonable",

What if Aang did manage to catch up to Azula, but she panics when she realizes just how upset he is in the moment when she looks back to gauge what little distance there is. She instinctively puts everything she has into one shot of lightning, causing the lightning to change color; this will signify an exponential increase in heat and power. Aang manages to put up an earth shield just in time, and Toph realizes what he's planning and reinforces it, but the whole thing explodes and sends them flying regardless. They're both stunned from the blast giving Azula enough time to escape.\n\nNow wondering how I can bullshit my way into making this not have any lasting effects of the rest of book 3. Maybe a quick close up on Azula's eyes or an inner monolog revealing that she doesn't quite realize or even remember what she did due to how close she may have felt to death in that moment. All she remembers is wanting to stay alive long enough to escape. Even knowing that Aang is a pacifist, it's not exactly like he fight with much regard for his enemies safety. Need I mention what everyone knows Gyatso did either? Plus, maybe she could have taken some tough blows that could be deemed to be close to life threatening in order to further sell that she truly feels like she might die in this moment. In a world where one man can systematic have his entire crop of cabbages by a group of runaways in every major city he visits, I'd say anything is possible. But maybe I'm just insane, I mean, there's no such thing as a cabbage merchant... right?\n\nAnyway that's a cheap but easy and effective method in not letting it change the rest of the season. I don't like making it a cop out but personally I can't think of a, lets say smoother way to fix this scene? There are definitely better ways that actually could change the rest of the book for the better but I dont have the braincells to think of them right now.",

                    "body": "I'd like to remind you that Azula is a Master Firebender. Even during the Eclipse, she had home field advantage, and there is no way that she didn't know those maze of Bunkers and tunnels like the back of her hand. This is Azula that we are talking about. Also, both times that Aang ran like that were out of panic and with the full sky and a ton of air around him. The conditions are MUCH different in those tunnels where he does not have as much room, air, or even know where he is going. There is also no telling what would happen if he did that around Toph, because I would bet you it would make being near him very dangerous, and it isn\u2019t like Toph can see the air and know how to react. She most likely would have been blasted behind Aang and/or into a wall. Even if he thought of it at the moment, it would have been a very bad idea to try that in that situation. It actually IS very realistic for bending. It is good to remember the awesome capabilities of bending, but very few consider the gritty parts and consequences that come with it.\n\nAlso, Azula is as much of a prodigy as Aang was *without* being fueled by the past Avatars. She is also a Master of mind games and knew how to mess with her opponents while also being rightly terrifying. Even without her bending, she was toying with them and evening out the odds. When she does have her bending... heh. Another thing that I treat as Head Cannon is the ability to use Inner Fire. Like how Zuko survived diving through the artic waters *during winter*. That had been a technique that Iroh had taught him, and even if Iroh invented it and never taught it to anyone else, I am certain that people, at least his family, knew about it. And Azula is absolutely the kind of person to try and figure out how he did it on her own and teach herself the technique while coming up with her own creations. We already know that Inner Fire is possible with Firebending. It wouldn't be much of a stretch for a highly powerful prodigy genius Master Firebender like Azula to discover how to use Inner Fire to enhance her physical ability. Then imagine if she did that with her mastery over lightning... if anyone was capable of outrunning Aang going all out, it would be Azula.",

She's fresh in every one of those fights, and Aang shows up tired/exhausted (from overnight travels most of the time). The implication is that there's no believable away she can take him on when he's fully ready to go. \n\nHere, he's a far more formidable opponent and she lacks her powers. It should be an easy victory for Aang from the previous setup. Narratively, it's important he loses, and that's fine, but the execution is flawed as it doesn't fit what's been established in-universe. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I still like these episodes a lot - some of my favorites - but this entire fight has never felt like it was fully thought out in the greater context of the show. It's only gotten worse with rewatches, too!",

I\u2019m genuinely surprised Long Feng didn\u2019t bring that up considering he seems like exactly the Machivellian statesman who has been forced to do such things in the past.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nThis plot is praised by fans constantly because 'look how intelligent Azula is' but in reality it relies completely on the Dai Li being incredibly stupid.\n\nThe writers were only able to make her look smart by making everyone around her stupid. It's like Game of Thrones S7, it made Sansa seem smart by dumbing down Little Finger.\n\n>Or Azula magically making the earth cuffs Toph put her in explode without BBQ-ing her own hands (as shown by Zuko, Firebenders are NOT immune to fire\u2026). Especially since Katara later on binds Azula\u2019s hands in a similar manner with chains\n\nThis kind of makes me think of two other scenes:\n\nIn S1 we (and Katara) see Zuko heating up the water/ice after being incased in it by Katara and bursting out of it. Yet in S3's final\u00e9 Katara makes a risky move freezing a more talented Azula (during Sozin's Comet) with her in the ice. Yet Azula doesn't at all try to burst out of it yet her entire character has been completely aggressive throughout the final few episodes.",

                    "body": "I've been watching through the show just over the past week, and these fights definitely got worse than I remembered. And I remember being annoyed at the bad writing already. \n\nAzula is just protected by plot armor. It's a classic issue of pitting a group of characters against a villain that, by all accounts, cannot win, and realistically cannot escape with the tools given by the writers. It's unfortunate, because it makes these situations some of the weakest of the narrative that otherwise works so well. The desire to flesh out a villain like Azula makes the writers fail at making the episodes feel like they are coherent with the rest of the story. Which is a shame, because they do manage her character so incredibly well when they aren't forcing combat scenes that just don't work in the narrative framework they built. \n\nSetting up believable fights with obvious outcomes is one of the things they do so well in all other instances, further making this frustrating to watch. The writers are great at setting up situations that just stacks the odds against the characters in a way where losing makes sense. Most of the time it comes from tailored foes in specific circumstances, that just happens to naturally shift the odds in the way the writers wanted it to. But with Azula, they often got lazy. They wanted her in the fight, but failed at setting up the foundation for the fight, making her often feel like a walking Diabolus ex Machina more often than not. It feels very cheap when you quickly get into the thought process of \"I wonder what bullshit they'll come up with that saves Azula from a doomed fight this time\". \n\nIt's one of the only real gripes I have with the series as a whole, and my very recent rewatch really hammered home the issue. But one thing that also became clear, is that this is such a glaring issue, because the series has so few actual faults in the writing that you can otherwise point to. This just stands out a lot more than it would in most other similar types of shows. In reality, the issue isn't really that big.",

Sometimes people just have an aura around them that makes them trustworthy, or seem really capable. Everyone has met someone like this. The Dai Li entered into a partnership with Azula to take over the earth kingdom and the plan was to eventually betray her to put Long Feng at the top. Instead, Azula won over the Dai Li by some methods. Presumably, because the Dai Li followed whoever was most capable, and Azula showed herself to be far more capable than Long Feng. Long Feng understood he would not be able to beat her the same way he planned to beat the Earth King. Thus he submits. He knows he's lost. He has no more power anymore, he's simply another Dai Li agent now.\n\n  \nIn S1, Katara does not submerge then freeze Zuko. They are still speaking. She creates a barrier of Ice that presumably makes it really hard or impossible for Zuko to break out of because he's weakened by the cold and Katara is stronger under moonlight. Azula is fully submerged in water and then encased in ice. This evidenced by the fact that Katara begins \"swimming\" to tie Azula up against the grate. Azula can't move, and is currently not in her full metal capacity. Could she have simply exploded the ice? Possibly. But this would have taken some amount of thought that the mind broken Azula may not have been capable of thinking about this when put in a wholly new situation.\n\n\n\nIf anything, the correct error here is that Azula had clearly completed her lightning shooting process. The lightning should either have lost control and exploded the same way Zuko did while attempting to learn it, or the lightning should have completed and shot through Katara's face.",

The vast majority of Benders of all elements were not that powerful or skilled. Toph, Bumi, Iroh, Zuko, Azula, Ozai, Katara, and Pakku are all examples of the most incredible Benders in the world. They were geniuses,  prodigies, and Masters. They are the upper limits that the vast majority of Benders could only hope to achieve, and *they* all struggle against the Avatar when he isn\u2019t even in Avatar Mode let alone combined with THE God/Spirit King of the Ocean.\n\nAlso, even if it was within the capabilities of Airbending, suffocating people like that would take more than just overturning an extreme Pacifist's will, but also require tons of training in such a lethal and violent technique, a technique that likely wasn't within their personal skill/power. Especially in the middle of a surprise attack against comet-powered firebending soldiers who had been training and preparing for this war since before Sozin first started colonizing the Earth Kingdom.",

Likewise the role of each character isn't confirmed, beyond it being clear that the main five will all appear in some capacity. Zuko is the only one that hasn't had their VA announced which could arguably indicate he has a smaller role, but others think it's because his VA is the only one returning and Paramount is waiting on revealing that. \n\nAs i stated in another comment this art of the gaang is official, but it was made in the early 2010s not for this film. The outlet just used them because news on the film has been sparse and we had no images at the time.\n\nEdit: Leaked teaser image, released after the above was made.

                    "body": "Mh, this should be around the time when most of the team avatar members got married or had their first kids.\n\nLet\u2019s do the math here.\n\nKatara is 85 in the first season of Korra, then 86 in the second and third, and 89 in the fourth. Tenzin, her youngest kid, is the only one of Aang and Katara\u2019s children whose age we know of, which is 51 in the first season. That would mean that Aang and Katara had him respectively at 32 and 34 years old. However, before him we have Bumi and Kya. \n\nIn the graphic novel \u201cThe Promise\u201d, when the fate of the colonies is ultimately discussed, Katara claims to have seen her and Aang\u2019s future. The panel we see is of them with what we now know to be Bumi, and they look very young. Plus, in the family photo shown in LoK S2, Bumi is at least 7 years old when Tenzin is a newborn, and Kya could be between 2 and 4 years old (I\u2019d say 4 for Kya just bc her and Bumi are shown to be very close, so they must be closer in age than Kya and Tenzin).\n\nSo according to this math, Bumi is 60 and Kya is 54/56 in season 2, opposite Tenzin\u2019s confirmed 52 years of age. Aang and Katara had Bumi at 24 and 26 and Kya at 30 and 32. \n\nNow to Zuko. We know close to nothing about Izumi and her own kids and husband and whatnot, because LoK explored Kuvira\u2019s storyline rather than going with the og one centered in the fire nation. Anyways, if you look at Izumi in the one scene she\u2019s in, she has greyish hair, most likely faded from black like Mai\u2019s. Considering that basically all the team avatar daughters have grey hair by season 3, I\u2019d place Izumi and Kya in the same age range, making Izumi maybe one year older than Kya? Or two? So, either 57 or 58 in S2, meaning Zuko and Mai had her at 31 and 30 years old (a miracle baby maybe? Since she\u2019s an only child too?).\n\nShe could be younger than Kya, of course. However, regarding Izumi we must take one crucial detail in consideration. Her son, General Iroh II, is a grown adult by season 1, and is 40 in season 4. This makes him 37 in season 2. If his mother is 57 or 58, it means Izumi had him at either 20 or 21, which is pretty young for us, but not for fire nation standards (Azula had to have an arranged marriage storyline in ATLA season 3, and she was 14, so having kids at a young age isn\u2019t that odd). I\u2019m more inclined to believe her to be 58 in season 2 just to give her the time to marry and all, since I\u2019d rather believe she fell in love and married young rather than the very much implausible option that Zuko just married her off to a random guy. \n\nSo, back to the original point, according to the math I just made, Aang and Katara in the movie will either be early in the pregnancy with Bumi, at least in the second trimester, with him as a newborn, or the cliffhanger at the end of the movie will reveal that they\u2019re expecting him, which shifts Bumi\u2019s age down to 59 rather than 60. Not sure if Kya and Izumi\u2019s calculated age would change or not tho.\n\nAnyways, I like to think that in the Team Avatar movie we\u2019ll see Mai and Zuko\u2019s wedding at some point. If the plot focuses on the members living in republic city, it would be the best way to include Zuko and clarify his family\u2019s storyline, which has been kept ambiguous for a few years now. Plus, Zuko has a solo movie lined up, so bigger storylines will be explored there. If they have to make him a supporting character, let it be for a happy reason, lol.",

Actors can be listed as \"Unknown roles\" in movies but you wouldn't say that for characters. We can interpret it to mean \"these characters will be secondary to Aang and Katara\" but that's not how you'd write it if you were a professional reporter. Also, if Aaang and Katara are leads, the other characters can only be supporting characters or non-existent, so the whole thing doesn't make sense.\n\nIt's also very weird to say the ages of every single character, as if Sokka could somehow be 45 while Katara is 26. It's something only an AI or a kid would write.",

One of the accusers mentioned Ehasz disliked Bryke, and publicly Bryan has disputed Ehasz's book four claims. He's also simply busy running Wonderstorm, being the show runner of TDP and being directly involved or supervising other TDP content, all of which limit his time to work on outside projects. Mind you all of the above aside Ehasz simply hasn't been involved in the franchise for like 15 years now, and so him not returning to an old job shouldn't be seen as out of the ordinary.",

Has he worked as a journalist for some site before?  Or is credited in any actual films?\n\nWhat does he do besides make guesses about movie promos to indicate some reliability?  Or is he one of those \"scoopers\" who just says things that are vaguely likely, and then takes credit for the good guesses while ignoring all the fails?\n\n> And you can look at the promotional image they showed for the movie a year ago\n\nThat image seems to have been scrubbed off the internet (at least official news sites) due to it being a private showing, assuming you mean [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/1329i06/according_to_previous_upload_on_wire_image_this/?share_id=4p0cop8O1NLEKiLwSETaM).\n\nBut yeah, it seems likely that someone would be able to guess the characters' age ranges from seeing an image like that.  So DanielRPK made an educated guess that the movie will take place 12 years after the main show based on a piece of concept art and then AvatarNews took that information and mocked up a fake piece of concept art that they could use to pretend it was legitimate news.\n\nThat sounds like the truth of the situation to me.",

                    "body": "Here is a small FAQ, because a lot of people have the same questions and I need to get some sleep at some point. :D\n\nHow do I play this?\n\nIn order to play this you need to have the game \"Dreams\" on PlayStation 4 or 5. Inside of that game you need to search for \"Four Seasons\" in Dreamsurfing (It's the one with the orange thumbnail with the big 'ol painted Four Seasons logo.\nIf you can't find it there for some reason you can go to your profile click on the Imp in the upper right corner for players and search for \"Elca_Gaming\" in the everyone category (I'm the one with the Panda Imp), you should be able to easily locate it there in my profile.\n\n\nHow much is this?\n\nFour Seasons itself is free. Dreams is about $20 but you can often shoot it for 5. If you secured it when it was free in August for PS+ you in fact already have our Game!\nDreams is also free with PS+ Extra still.\n\n\nHow many people work on this?\n\nI started off solo but very fast expanded the team to round about 3-4 active friends at a time working on this with me.\nWe also have a full soundtrack with original music already on Spotify.\nHere are the full credits:\nhttps://trello.com/c/23WcABmc \nTruly incredible people and the most passionate Avatar fans! I couldn't ask for a better team. \n\n\nWill it come to PC/Xbox/Mobile or will we port it?\n\nNo. Four Seasons is made in Dreams and that game is a PlayStation exclusive. Update support ended for it last September but they switched to new Servers beforehand to ensure longevity. Unless Sony picks up Dreams again and ports it to other platforms it will only stay on PlayStation. \nWe can't port it because you can't export anything out of Dreams directly. (It would also come with legal problems) \n\n\nWhat about copyright? \n\nI'm under NDA but Avatar and related marks are owned by Viacom International Inc. This fan-created game is not endorsed by, sponsored by, or affiliated with Viacom/Nickelodeon.\n\n\nWho will be playable?\n\nThe game is a retelling of the story from ATLA so you will play as Aang and Momo for solving puzzles.\nWe are thinking about also making Zuko playable since a big part of Book 1 is also from his perspective but you have to understand that making a polished Character is an insane undertaking and takes alot of time. \n\n\nSo what is the scope of this project and what kind of game will this be? \n\nThis is an Action-Adventure game with light RPG elements. You will be able to re-experience the story of The Last Airbender in a fully realized 3D rendition of the world of Avatar. We recreate every location 1:1 or as close as humanly (and memory limiting) possible.\nThis is a Semi-Open World Game, every location has its HUB world with offsprings of smaller locations, like interiors. You will be able to fly to the locations via our 3D Worldmap on Appa. You can also revisit locations you previously traveled to to unlock new paths with newly gained abilities. \nThe Main Quest will follow the Story of ATLA very closely, although we have to make minor changes for gameplay purposes, I think you will enjoy those though (coming from an Avatar fan). There will be Sidequests, collectables, cabbage carts, skins to unlock, races, both for Aang and Momo and more. We try to fill up the levels with content until no more memory is left for us to use.\nYou will bend elements, mainly for Book 1 air and water since those are the elements Aang learns in Book 1. Book 2 and 3 will introduce the other elements. And yes, those will be separate games. Fighting is on the to-do list for this year, so hopefully we can show something off by the end of the year!\nThere will be NPCs and lots of Minigames, even Pai Sho.\n\nWhy Dreams and not Unreal/Unity/Godot?\n\nI didn't choose to make this game in Dreams it just happened to work out like that. When Dreams launched I had no idea what to create but I was so excited about the software itself. So I happened to rewatch ATLA at the time and thought to myself why there haven't been any Avatar Games made that get the feeling of the show across (\"Making you *feel* like the Avatar\"\u2122). So I started with some simple gameplay mechanics, made a puppet ride an Airscooter and went from there.\nIt then evolved into this huge thing, with YouTube success and everything. At the time I still had no idea what I'm doing but a vision and passion. I had no prior experience with gamedev or art for that matter and Dreams was the perfect tool get my feet wet in gamedev. It's insanely powerful and easy to use. I can think of an idea and have it working on my screen the same evening. Of course it got attention from all kinds of people and eventually also made it obvious that Dreams might just be the only way to continue the project which also turned out to be true. The rest is NDA.\nI'm also slowly learning Unreal but that knowledge will be reserved for another project. \n\n\nThing X/Y/Z looks off/unpolished!\n\nYes; this game is very much still under construction, we constantly update and improve the game in every way. People who followed this project for a long time already can confirm that I think.\nWe try to make sure that everything at the end will be up to our standards because we, as much as you, want this to be the best possible Avatar Game.\n\n\nOk but this is only one map with some movement options, where is the rest of the game?\n\nThis is just a small sneak peek at what we are working on, a small test environment for you to try out our latest somewhat polished version of Aang (and Momo for that matter). We already recreated almost every location from the first Book 1:1 and adding gameplay mechanics as we go. Alot of them are WIP and not available in this version because we only want you to play something that is acceptable and also to find Bugs that we can fix before release! If you are curious about the actual locations I can recommend either looking at some of my Instagram posts or watching the Rewinds of the previous years on my YouTube Channel (Elca Gaming).\n\n\nWhen does this come out?\n(My favorite question)\n\nWhen it's done, polished and ready. :) \n\n\nHow can I support?\n\nWe are happy with just people being excited about it and trying out the Demo already; every encouraging comment  gives us motivation to continue.\nPersonally I also always love people visiting the Streams, I stream our progress 3x a week.\nI have a Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/Elca) if you want to gift me some cookies but I'm fine with people just being excited about the project!\nAll links are in my profile.\n\n\nThis is by all means a game made by fans for fans, a loveletter to Avatar and the community. Thanks everyone for the nice comments!\n\nCan't wait to share more!",

This ends with them cutting as many corners as possible to maximize profit, a new strategy for building a game centered around a \u201cminimum viable product.\u201d This just leads to either mobile-like game releases for $60 and empty AAA games with more effort put into the in-game store/micro-transactions.\n\n\nThankfully this mentality is starting to shift. Elden Ring and Baluder\u2019s Gate 3 showed that artistic vision is what makes a game, not how recognizable it is. Even more impressive, we\u2019ve seen indie games like Battlebit and Deep Rock Galactic explode in popularity. These are small teams and they\u2019re on the verge of dominating the entire game genre over multi-million dollar gMe studios. This isn\u2019t just a flash in the pan too. Palworld has not even been out for two weeks and they recently reached **19 million users.** \n\n\n\nProps to OP for taking it into their hands to make the game Avatar fans actually want. I hope the avatar creators give you their blessing so you can officially release it to all platforms and make a killing off it. You deserve it.",

I almost hate to say it, but I think Fortnite is the best example of using a variety of balanced traversal methods in a BR successfully. Spiderman swings, grappling hooks, flying nimbus, I think they used to have roller skates, but it kept players somewhat grounded. My experience with Spellbreak was everyone basically flying or jumping around while in combat so it almost felt like a mech pilot type fight that was just flavored with magic. I absolutely love how the flying looks in the demo here though.",

What we see in this demo is a sphere asset layered on top of Aangs swimming model, with no transition animation. Also it seems forced automatically, as if you can't choose to swim regularly. Which I personally don't like.\n\nThere is no animation for bending the pocket of air around his head, and it is a simple sphere layered on top of Aang's swimming model. It isn't lore accurate and it just isn't an impressive asset. Especially compared to the many cool assets that are showcased in this demo.

No way.\n\nSecond of all, if Sozin was ready to straight up commit genocide against an ENTIRE NATION of Air Nomads just in order to destroy the Avatar - he would've easily tried to do the same for the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom. It would basically kill two birds in one stone for him - assuring the total habitation of only Fire Nation people in the whole world, and also killing the Avatar again and again until the cycle could reach the Fire Nation again, which would make Sozin or Azulon take them under their wing and raise them with their own fascist ideology in mind. Or even treating them worse, out of fear of treason.\n\nAang running away caused Sozin to get locked on his search for the last airbender, which in turn didn't lead to a potential second genocide. Eventually the Avatar was considered \"gone\", which lowered the worries of the Fire Nation, and caused it to not give a damn about destroying any more nations in finding the Avatar, instead opting for making private/low budget searches for him.\n\nSo yeah, Aang running away was not an actual crime, but more of a symbolic and personal mistake of running away from responsibility and seeing how it did have consequences.

He used her insecurities against her and gave her all the attention she wanted so she would be a puddle in his hands. \n\nAnd it worked. Until Tonraq was sent to prison (and we learned THAT entire situation was manufactured by Unalaq to KEEP HER ON HIS SIDE). Not to mention the entire civil war was planned by Unalaq, too. He never wanted a reunion of the tribes. He wanted full control.\n\n(And I do believe this plotline was handled poorly and dropped quickly, but that is not the point of this rant)\n\nThen she wanted to handle him. But she also had no way of knowing that UnaVaatu was going to rip Raava out of her and destroy her. She tried to breathe fire at him (a good defense in the moment), but he was faster and more determined. There was nothing she could have done once she was locked in the water arms with Unalaq. (Yes, she could have NOT watched as Vaatu rose out of Unalaq, but how do you process a threat that quickly and respond without getting hurt in such close quarters?).\n\nKorra was isolated until she ran away. This was definitely a mistake on The White Lotus/her parents. But given the threats to her as a child, it makes sense that she needed to be protected. She should have had more opportunities for human interaction and learning about the actual world. Unalaq used all of that to his advantage, to get a naive 16/17 year old girl to do his bidding and not realize the consequences. \n\nAbsolutely none of that is Korra's fault, and it breaks my heart that people just still blame her for \"not realizing he was an evil guy\" because she had no reason not to trust him. He had all the skills she needed to learn. She couldn't have known he was already using those for evil, let alone that she was a pawn.",

Blaming a 12 year old for freaking out and running away from the prospect of having to leave everyone he knows and loves behind to become something he wasn't ready to become in order to, ostensibly, fight or stave off a war is insane. Moreover, Aang did not start the war, nor did he contribute to its success in any way.\u00a0 Korra was 17, still a child but only just, and chose to run away to Republic City against the express wishes of her tutors and literally every adult in her life. She did so not.because she was terrified but because she was bored and thought she was entitled, as the avatar, to do as she pleased. Teenage rebellion is completely understandable and in no way out of character for someone of that age, it does however tend to annoy and frustrate anyone older and wiser who comes into contact with it. Korra repeatedly ignores the advice of those closest to her, favoring the counsel of complete strangers who pander to her self-importance as the avatar as a means of manipulating her. After suffering the consequences of this in season 1 she turns right around and does it again in season 2. Seeing a character not learn from their mistakes often tends to poison the well with respect to an audience's opinion on that character.\u00a0 Korra is believable and she's certainly not all bad, moreover her faults are understandable within the context of her upbringing--that said making your main character: arrogant, foolhardy, hot-headed, incredibly naive, and possibly not too bright leaves little room for audiences to sympathize with her. Typically writers beat their main characters down as a means of gaining reader sympathy, think Harry Potter. Aang was a survivor of genocide, hunted by an implacable foe who wanted to kill him, crushed by guilt and the weight of literally saving the world. Korra was a spoiled brat who had everything handed to her and her response was to fly off the handle and disimprove literally every circumstance she came into contact with.\u00a0 I want to clarify that I very much enjoyed 85% of Korra the series, just not Korra herself. I am not generally speaking, one of the shows detractors.\u00a0\n\n\nEdited: typo",

He might not have won against Ozai without lightning redirection but Sozin is never seen to have that level of proficiency.\n\n\nMy personal headcanon is that Aang was so focused on Tenzin because he  was dealing with intense guilt of knowing in the back of his mind that he probably would've saved his people if he accepted being the avatar instead of running. Especially since the Air Nomads specifically told him early *because* they knew they were in danger.\n\n\nI mean he would've also have definitely killed Sozin but what can you do it's not like the other airbending avatar disagreed.",

As for the authority, one pretends their thing is \"better\" than this other \"good\" thing, so the authority of all those who think the other thing is \"good\" should be applied to one's thing. This is done instead of relying on the authority of a similar agreement with a logical argument about the positive qualities of one's thing qualifying it as \"good\" (an argument which one lacks).\n\nObviously, it is nonsensical to claim a positive based upon a negative proof, but human beings appear quite susceptible to this sort of false comparison.

Even if Sozin had been stopped, another ambitious warlord or general would likely have risen to power eventually, as history shows with figures like Kuvira and Chin the Conqueror. Sozin's success was mainly due to striking at the opportune moment of Roku's death coinciding with the arrival of the comet. This is why the Fire Nation made significant advances during that time. However, over the course of the subsequent century, they struggled to expand further. They only managed to seize a small portion of Earth Kingdom territory nearby and messed up the Southern Water Tribe, which was already weakened by its civil war with the Northern Tribe. \n\nThe most notable achievements in 100 years was Azula's capture of Ba Sing Se, facilitated by Sokka in assuring the Earth King of the trust in Kyoshi Warriors (really just the Earth Kings general incompetency, youre the most powerful person to your only enemy and you dont even know what the leaders of said enemy look like??

The only flashback I remember is the whole Wan story, which doesn't indicate anything along the lines of \"Harmonic Convergence will make Vaatu strong enough to escape from a hypothetical prison if both spirit portals are open\".

By the time Unalaq revealed his intentions with that threat - and that he needed her to open the Northern Portal, contrary to what he'd told her earlier - Korra had already meditated into the spirit world and arrived at the portals, and Jinora had been captured. There was no more opportunity for her to *not* open the portal by then.\n\n>...and that still doesn't change the fact that going for him is still a much riskier move to the point of \\[recklessness\\].\n\nIt didn't work out, but as I indicated before, Korra had little-to-no reason to believe she could just sit back and let the matter resolve itself. And she certainly couldn't have predicted that Unalaq would be in the spirit world at the same time as her, or that events would lead to Jinora becoming his hostage.",

Korra was the one who practically handed Unaloq the W in the second half of season 2, and it was partly through her recklessness that the avatar spirit got killed.\n\nAang tried to fight back and protect the koi fish, yes he failed but that was failure through insufficiency. Not a failure that he actively worked for and made worse.\n\nYes Aang was selfish, but he is not comparable. Korra, though knowing better, and having people around her know better, actively worsened a global crisis, like 4 different ways. Aang made mistakes due to insufficiency or ignorance, but never did he actively and directly make a situation worse through his own informed choice.*\n\nAnd I put an asterisk on that because there is an almost exception to this, but I want yall to figure it out on yall's own. And when you do, the reason it doesn't fully count as an exception is cause for Aang that time was a true victory, if a lucky one. While Korra's season 2 victory was a pyrrhic one at best.\n\nEdit: and honestly, Korra's a victim of writing at the end of the day. Like, her series absolutely let her and her Krew down at every step, but this is a different thesis beyond the discussion point here hence why I've not brought it up.",

But as Raava gets excited about an era without Vaatu, without change, Korra does something mature and surprises her by bringing Vaatu back, saying the world needs change, that she needed to change from her younger blockhead self, and then brings both Raava and Vaatu into herself in balance, with the power now able to be controlled better by future Avatars, making them more powerful and better suited for the upcoming sci fi era.",

His decision is not a moral one, i.e. Batman not killing the Joker or some shit like that.\n\nThe point is that Aang has had his entire people ripped away from him, and most of its culture, by Ozai and his family. All the prior Avatars urge him to take drastic action to save the world, but none of them truly recognize the crux of Aang's hesitance: if he kills the Fire Lord, Ozai will have stolen yet another piece of Aang's culture away from him, the pacifism that was instilled in him from birth.\n\nI think a lot of people misunderstand the conflict to be \"Aang doesn't want to be a bad guy by killing a worse guy,\" when in reality it's \"Aang doesn't want to lose himself and have more of his culture ripped away from him in the process of saving the world.\"\n\nThe Avatar State ties into this. Aang's entire conflict rests between if he can save the world and grow as a person, without succumbing to the cosmic power of the Avatar. It's him learning he can be *both* Aang and the Avatar, not just one or the other.",

Avatars are supposed to become capable of controlling it (like we see Roku and Kyoshi do, as well as Kuruk, Yangchen and Szeto while Roku is explaining \u201cthe glow\u201d). Korra learned that at the end of book 1 (in what I consider kinda weak writing, but sort of understandable given how they didn\u2019t know if they would get a second season and had to wrap up the story). \n\nIs Korra sometimes using it in a pretty immature way? Sure. She\u2019s a teenager/young adult who was sheltered away for most of her life. Her best friends before she came to Republic City were a polar bear dog and an old lady who was married to Korra\u2019s previous incarnation. Of course she would be immature with that power. She has barely been taught how to handle that kind of responsibility, since she has barely seen anything of the world. \n\nIt\u2019s basically the big problem both Aang and Korra have. Aang was a wise monk in a time the world needed a fierce warrior. Korra was a fierce warrior in a time the world could have used a wise monk. If the roles were reversed, Korra would have made short work of Ozai because she\u2019s strong as hell, and Aang would probably have had a much easier time with Korra\u2019s villains because most of them were at least somewhat reasonable, and Aang is great at resolving conflict without necessarily fighting.",

Her story is about becoming a good person, not the avatar, in many ways the opposite story of aang. The only time she constantly enters the avatar state is season 2, which is to her detriment and leads to the avatar cycle getting fucked up irreversibly. She only uses the state one or two times a season in season 1, and 3, and in 4 a few times, including using it to save kuvira in the end, not kill her.  In many ways mirroring aangs stopping the avatar state from killing ozai. (Also her usage in season 3 is literally being forced into the avatar state which is its own analysis in itself) korras overall relationship with the state is different than aangs, but its just as much a big deal how she uses it. She always wanted to be the avatar and has to learn how to be a person, aang never wanted to be the avatar and wanted his personhood to be more in control. Both learn the balance.",

My point is that there's no difference between \"just in case\" and \"on the table with every meal\", just like there's no difference between 'offensive nukes' and 'defensive nukes'. They're just nukes, they sit in the same place every day and are always ready to fire at a moment's notice. The only thing that separates the \"just in case\"/deterrent/defensive weapons and the 'everyday arsenal' weapons is the policy of the people who use them (posturing). They are exactly the same physically and any 'defensive' weapon could be used offensively in the hands of anyone willing to do so.\n\nI think the analogy of Aang as a nuclear arsenal holds though. He *could* annihilate anyone he wants to pretty easily, just like NATO *could* use nuclear weapons to invade/destroy a peaceful country. He just chooses not to, just like most nuclear countries have openly stated that their weapons reserved for use in \"extreme circumstances\".",

It just so happened that the main character was ignorant of that cost. \n\nAdditionally, Korra\u2019s character arc is much less linear. She doesn\u2019t always learn the right lessons, and when she does learn the right lessons, sometimes it\u2019s later than someone else might have. In that regard, she\u2019s much more of a real person.",

It's great characterization but boy did they dig her into a deep hole from the very beginning. If you were at all unsure about Korra she wanted you gone... And people tuned out. It's really no surprise how the show failed in ratings when they made Korra insufferable for the first two seasons. Maybe next time we can try a sympathetic main character?",

He\u2019s just in the picture that they used. Otherwise this is mainly true. Jeong Jeong was Aang\u2019s first firebending master, Pakku was his first waterbending master, and Aang wanted Bumi to be his earthbending master. I\u2019m honestly sick of this fandom being so vitriolic to people pointing out tiny, fun details. They know it\u2019s not a big deal, it\u2019s just a cool thing they noticed. People need to stop being so pedantic about it.",

Pakku helped get him started with waterbending, but Katara takes over once they leave and teaches him for longer than Pakku did. Pakku even states that she has become a master. Aang would've liked to learn from Bumi and Jeong Jeong, but it didn't work out. He ultimately had improved experiences because of Toph being blind (listening with her feet, a valuable perspective Bumi doesn't have) and going with Zuko to see the dragons' pure form of firebending. Learning from his peers makes the Gaang feel tighter-knit overall",

Even with Aang's lessons with Pakku, I'd argue he was still somewhat of a water bending novice at that point. Their time was brief.

Nearly every comment is calling out Piandao for not training Aang when the post itself specifically mentions \"*bending* masters\", and they're making fun of *the original poster* for not understanding anything?\n\nPakku was meant to be Aang's original waterbending teacher, and he was (though Katara taught him some before reaching the North), and a member of the Gaang took over the role. None of these are mutually exclusive. Both Aang and the viewer saw Bumi as the candidate to be Aang's earthbending teacher for several episodes at the start of Book 2. It wasn't going to work out, but that doesn't change the character from having meant to be Aang's teacher to these characters. Same with Jeong Jeong; Aang, Katara, Sokka, even Jeong Jeong himself believed he would be Aang's primary firebending teacher for a time, and they began their training, though of course they barely got anywhere.\n\nYour definition of what \"were meant to be Aang's original teacher\" means allows for only the narrowest of possibilities, where a teacher agrees to teach Aang, but in the short time between agreeing and beginning training it suddenly doesn't work out. It's an overly pedantic definition that doesn't line up with how people speak and use these phrases in the real world.",

Zuko didn't want to teach him, but murder him.\n\nThe masters lack of desire to teach doesn't mean they didn't teach him sometimes it's what you dont teach that's Important, like if you never teach a kid kindness, most of the time it blooms into a kind Person.

This makes it seem like it was a change of destiny that the Gaang members stepped in, when in actuality Bumi literally said \"I can't teach you, you need someone else\". It was destiny that Aang would learn from the people he learned from. Katara needed to trust he abilities and learn humility in order to be a good teacher because at the beginning she was too proud to understand that Aang was the freaking Avatar, so of course he was going to be more naturally gifted. Toph needed to be the hard ass in Aang's life to actually get him to focus and stand firm in who he was and what he needed to do. And Zuko needed to train Aang just as much as Aang needed him so that he could help the Fire Nation return to a more peaceful monarchy and bring balance again.

Everyone of the white lotus is exceptionally talented and strong, because even if they can't commune with the other elements, they recognize the value of doing so, and all of them incorporate it into their training.  Jong Jong regrets being born into fire for example, he hasn't figured out that fire means life, just like water, wind and earth.  But honestly he is probably the weakest of the members of the white lotus grandmasters because of it.  Piandou might not be a bender, but when you listen to him teaching Sokka, you hear him talk about being flexible, to use his surroundings.  I mean i am probably wrong.

Weapons only seem to be used by benders on an individual level, kyoshi uses fans, aang uses his staff a bit, and this guy uses hammers, but if it's decently well known, I feel the different cultures would have cultural weapons, or more exploration.\n\nWater benders might use oars, or maybe a trademark non-bending style of spears and clubs. Earthbenders using hammers would make sense, or maybe shields as an aid to neutral jing. Swords or cannons might be good for the fire nation. Fans would be good for air bending and staffs are classic weapons for both monks and nomads.\n\nMaybe kyoshi uses fans because she had a little difficulty learning air bending, it being the opposite of her native element, and made it her trademark after using it for so long. Then the kyoshi warriors being earth kingdom people fighting using air nomad techniques would emphasize their emulation of an avatar.\n\nThe white lotus is an international organization, but ultimately benders can only bend their element. A non-bender, however, could learn the non-bending styles of each nation, and represent the impartiality of the avatar.\n\nThere could even be an avatar specific weapon, I'm thinking something like a Shaolin spade with a glaive blade on the other end. The spade part could be like a shovel or a fan for earth and air, and the glaive could be considered like a sword or a spear for water and fire.",

Intensely cruel at times, but effective (remember the scene where he uses his substantial military resources to capture one of the most powerful benders in the world? And then the scene when Zhao promises a 12-year-old boy - who is chained to a floor - that Zhao will keep the boy in a state of living, tortured agony forever - \u201calive\u2026 but *just* barely\u201d - chilling, right?). \n\nA man who climbs the ranks via his strength and confidence, but who sabotages himself repeatedly over his pride - like when he takes on Zuko in an Agni Kai instead of simply telling the politically mostly irrelevant banished prince to eff off and gets himself unexpectedly humiliated as a result. Or when he briefly concedes to Iroh over the Moon Spirit - whether out of fear of Iroh\u2019s abilities or maybe even thinking that Iroh might be right about the potential harm that could be done to the Fire Nation from the loss of balance, it could be both or either - but then we immediately see Zhao\u2019s face twist as his ego takes over and he strikes the spirit. Zhao\u2019s momentary submission to Iroh\u2019s commands wasn\u2019t a trick; it was one of Zhao\u2019s last chances to learn the lesson of humility before he lost his way forever. We see almost the same sequence of events at his end, when Zhao starts to reach for Zuko\u2019s hand and then, pride takes over, and he pulls away. \n\nI would have loved to have seen more of Zhao in the series.",

Its a character study of our main character. Aang always talks about how he just wants to be a normal kid, and we see glimpses of his past live but most of the show is him being the Avatar. But in this episode he really gets to be a normal kid, and fucking kills it. He's the best normal kid in the world. He's confident, and charming, and kind, and even flirts with Katara extremely well. He's truly in his element this episode and it shows. Just shines more light into the reluctance of his embracing of the role as the Avatar.",

One of the most important dynamics in the show is that because he slept through the war he has none of the direct trauma and cycle of violence everyone around him has been living through which has made the world fearful, suspicious, paranoid, and divided. Almost everyone he encounters is prickly, hostile, and paralyzed by fear and he doesn\u2019t understand why because he is not carrying any of that history on his shoulders. He is able to enter this harsh world fresh and confront its non-sense as someone who\u2019s body and memories are from a more peaceful, open, and loving time.",

Still, that isn\u2019t until the second half of the season, after the Winter Solstice episodes. The whole first half he\u2019s scared of his responsibility, trying to escape from the terrible truths of this new world he found himself in. He evaded responsibility in Kyoshi, then again he does it in Omashu. He always struck me as a scared child who (rightfully so) can\u2019t quite process his feelings at this point.\n\nFrom the Solstice arc and on he takes a more leading role, but I think it was fine in the Netflix version. Going  through the Netflix episodes he takes this wise-beyond-his-years role quite a bit, much like his animated counterpart. In the Netflix version he:\n\n- Acts as a wise mediator so that the residents of Kyoshi let them stay, using his past experiences as a motivator. \n- Takes the initiative in helping Omashu in whatever way he can, much like his animated self always stops and helps the towns they go by.\n- Convinces his old friend Bumi that all is not lost and that you *can* depend on your friends. Once again, his experience in a world without war helps him bring hope to this hopeless world.\n- Just like in the original, he promises to help the town assailed by Hei Bai in any way possible. It happens differently, but his attitude is the exact same.\n- He takes a leading role in the defense of the Northern Water Tribe, not in the frontlines but in the spiritual matters involved. Again, much like his animated counterpart.",

I am fascinated each time I see the sign, but I haven't stopped there yet. (It's a bit far afield for me otherwise, and there's no real place to park a seventy-two-foot vehicle nearby.)\n\nSeams like it reliably does a good volume of business, if the parking lot is any indication.\n\n**EDIT:** Went and found their (minimal) online presence, starting from a Google Maps retracing of my normal route in from the interstate past them. They've named a Cajun-spiced shrimp sushi roll after Bubba-Gump.\n\nBearing in mind this place is just set incongruously in between a couple of auto repair garages, a sporting goods and trophy store, a Honda and a Land Rover dealership, and in by far the tiniest building of them all, and outside of Rockford, IL, it is one of the funniest things I see at least a few times a month. It's fast food chains, burger joints, diners, maybe a steakhouse or two- bam! Big sign for \"Fuji Cajun\" and arrows to a drive-thru. One side is just a stylized image of Mt. Fuji, with the name, another side had a crab in sunglasses climbing the same mountain. It's like something made up for a cartoon or a skit.

Yes, in the end it was still abuse played for laughs. ... \n\nBut three, I think the worst part is you can imagine Eska actually like/loved Bolin. The part that always stuck out to me was the boat scene. Yes, she is creating a rage wave a hundred meters tall ... but her make up had ran. The show wasn't going to show her actually crying at the alter but she did, and I would doubt it was \"I'm so angry that my slave left me\" tears. \n\nBut yeah. Played for laughs. \"Why do you think this boat was built?\" and then the ship all but Looney Tunes grows legs and zips out of there.",

Admittedly he is a people pleaser and it\u2019s manipulative to avoid the tough conversations but clearly this is at the threat of physical violence as with Eska\u2019s reaction (not sure I got the right twin but you get it) . But really this posits men\u2019s emotional trauma as a joke and it\u2019s nice somebody caught that",

Not until the conflict of the book came to a head and she stepped up as an actual combatant at least. If feel like if he was really in danger, he could've defended himself.\n\nI think it's a side effect of Bolin being written so overly ditzy/naive/immature in general. Like when Korra kissed Mako in front of Bolin after their date and he ran away with tears and snot. It was simultaneously really sad for him but also played humorously because he's usually dramatic like that.\n\nI think it would've been much more interesting if he and Eska had been played straight as a serious romance, kinda like a callback to Sokka and Yue. This might require Eska and Desna being written as less eccentric, but imagine Unalaq's betrayal coming out and Bolin being genuinely hurt that Eska sides with her father.",

Honest to God, I feel like if they directed the story more towards Eska understanding that she can't have everything she wants but still ends up with Bolin in a more compromising relationship, it would've given a good story of abuser learning the error of their ways and growing and healing towards something better.",

Both Korra and Lin are emotionally explosive people, which is essentially the greatest flaw in their characters. Something they both overcome with time, and that's after that episode.

I also think it's still a show with kids as part of the audience so they have to lighten it. I don't know, I see them trying to walk the line here and not always succeeding. Like Bolin's relationship might be over the line, more for laughs, but the Korra/Lin stuff might be more highlighting character flaws.\n\nI don't mind when shows highlight terrible things that happen in real life.

The difference between comedy and tragedy is that tragedy frames the suffering in a way that embraces it, whereas comedy frames the suffering in a way that creates absurdity and allows us to distance ourselves from it.\n\nFor example, being struck in the head with a blunt object isn't funny in most cases.  But when Bugs Bunny drops an anvil on Yosemite Sam's head no one thinks \"HAHA That guy has brain damage now from a violent assault!  Hell, he's probably going to DIE!  Hilarious!\"\n\nAnd honestly, I definitely have seen comedy sketches where women were the subject of abusive relationship dynamics and it was definitely funny because it was [framed in a way that highlights the absurdity of the situation in a way that says \"This is not normal or okay.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy52NTKMCPo)",

In 50 shades of grey you can see how someone could fall for someone who was manipulative, high status, and sadistic, but the joke with Desna and Bolin is that she is transparently a tunnel painted on a wall, anyone with half a brain should be able to see that there is no possible romance there beyond being tortured by her, her entire vibe is \u2018I enjoy mistreating people\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s like asking cartoons not to normalize being bonked in the head with giant wooden mallets. Sometimes physical and emotional violence is so heavily parodic or stylized that it ceases to have any weight.

It's understandable that Kya and Bumi would interpret Aang's duty to the air nation as him favoring Tenzin, and they have the right to vent during a moment of frustration.

Directors have a much bigger role than we give them credit for, and they should be the first (but not only) ones to know how lines should be delivered and just how things are meant to be. They are the ones who are supposed to have the vision. You don't have a director like that, then you're probably not going to get a good show/ movie. \n\nConsidering how many of the Avatar** actors act IN REAL LIFE (or social media, which only furthers my point tbh), I *really* don't think it's a matter of acting but instead it's a combination of a bad script and bad direction.\n\nEdit: clarification* and specification**",

So only the main character got anime eyes, because he's the youngest and young people genuinely have bigger eyes in relation to their face. \n\nBut since their artstyle was otherwise more realistic, they kind of locked themselves in to having to change his eyes massively as he got older.\n\nThough to be fair even without that it makes sense that you recognize a grown up teenager easier than someone you only knew as a younger child",

That's also why Zuko and Iroh removing their buns was such a moment.(Retroactively at least) Extending this to the fire lord, the reason they always have super long flowing hair is because more hair=more honor and the fire lord is the highest social rank.\n\nWhile typing this out I realized you could apply this to Mai's bangs too. Her chopping those bangs could be a sign of rebellion. Basically the fire Nation equivalent to getting a nose piercing.",

Then we met Commander Zhao and Zuko became much more of a protagonist in his own right.  Zuko\u2019s story arguably gets just as much focus and screen time as Aang does. Fuck, it\u2019s very easy to argue that Zuko\u2019s story is one of the main reasons why this show is so acclaimed.  \n\nZuko is very much the hero of his own story arc even as early as season 1. And he is a character that we all find ourselves rooting for as early as the third episode when he wins a duel against a much more evil character. More often than not, Zuko has his own story where he absolutely is the protagonist. Fuck once Zhao really gets involved, there are times where I found myself rooting for Zuko to capture Aang and that is 100% intentional by the writers.  Thats great fucking writing \n\nThe only times Zuko ever plays the role of an antagonist is when he is sharing a specific story with Aang.  And that happens much rarer than you would think.  And that only ever really happens in Book 1 with the exception of the Book 2 finale. And that exception is arguably why he\u2019s such a fascinating and amazing character\n\nOh and I guess there\u2019s combustion man.  I always forget about combustion man",

When we followed his origin story and watched him choose to focus getting his crew out of the storm over Aanf, was he actively being an antagonist?  What about when Zuko broke into that fortress and saved Aang?\n\nFor every story where Zuko is chasing after Aang, we got a solo story of Zuko doing his own thing and absolutely being the protagonist.  Thats not \u201cactively being an antagonist\u201d\n\nAlso I want you to read my last comment carefully cause I already said that.  Yes we have more than two episodes where he\u2019s an antagonist.

                    "body": "Historically, many nomads were more like seasonally migrant, moving between known locations that had previously had suitable resources and other desirable characteristics for the given season and moving on when conditions were unfavorable (or resources were depleted, to allow them time to replenish). \n\nAlso, the Air Nomads are nomadic as a matter of spirituality, not resource scarcity. They abhor being chained down anywhere in particular. That is -not- the same thing as rejecting settled homes to come back to, training grounds and temples to train in, or a place to safeguard their society\u2019s children. And for such a spiritual people, it makes sense they would have dedicated locations to make contact with fellow Air Nomads if they needed help or wished for a reprieve from wandering other nations. \n\nPlus, they can fly on gliders or on bison. For them, a trip to a temple from anywhere in the world wouldn\u2019t take -that- long. For comparison, plot Aang\u2019s travels against what we know of the calendar. We know the midpoint of Book 1 has Aang at a Fire Nation temple (roughly equatorial latitude, with some spread) to Roku on December 21st/22nd (the winter solstice, so kind of the writers to give us something useful as an exact date). Book 3, Episode 6 cites the summer solstice as Aang communes with Roku once more, placing it firmly as June 21st/22nd. \n\nIn the span of six months, thusly, Aang was able to travel to the north pole (including a few notable detours) back to more reasonable latitudes, some detours through Omashu and the swamp as well as recruiting Toph, got lost in the desert after making it most of the way to Ba Sing Se on the eastern parts of the continent, lost Appa for several episodes (the montage from Appa\u2019s perspective in the Lost Days episode implies this probably lasted anywhere from weeks to a couple months, difficult to say since there are no other sky bison for a comparison on his condition), had enough time to hammer out part of a detailed invasion plan with the Earth King and his generals, then be comatose long enough to grow an entire head of hair only a couple episodes before meeting Roku.\n\nThat\u2019s six months. And a fair chunk of that, Appa was not able to fly them properly (either due to being MIA or Azula actively hunting them), or his transport duties were deferred to a stolen Fire Nation warship. The only thing that can keep up with Aang and Appa (even with their lackadaisical tendencies and constant distractions) is the Fire Nation\u2019s modernized warships, literal steam-powered ironclads that in our world didn\u2019t exist until the latter half of the 19th century\u2026 and unlike those, Aang and Appa can do this over any terrain, accounting for stops for food and water. \n\nAnd Aang is still a 12 year old to boot, and one for whom supply is a constant struggle (to the point he sheepishly allows Sokka to beg supplies off the village he helps at the Winter Solstice). Adult nomads could easily have made similar treks in good time if well-prepared and not being harried by an enemy military. The ease of Air Nomad travel means they can enjoy the perks of being free spirits, while also always being relatively close to a home temple.",

Having every temple wiped out, your people hunted down like animals and being forced into hiding your bending, heritage and culture likely weakened the survivors spiritually. \n\nCombine that with any remaining members having children with other people, and then you start seeing a decline in Airbenders being born. If they\u2019re even born Airbenders at all, they\u2019d be forced into hiding their Bending too, and wouldn\u2019t get the chance to build the spirituality that the Nomads seemed to survive off of.

Which would lead to the fan theories that Ty Lee and the new airbenders who gained their powers after Harmonic Convergence were descendants of old airbenders.\n\nAlso given that the Air Nomads were highly spiritual, is it that farfetch'd to think that there was some kind of religious festival associated with the comet, which might mean that there were more Air Nomads at the temples than usual.",

Once news spread about the widespread killing of Air Nomads, the nomads that were actually out in the world went into hiding. To force them out, the Fire Nation employed tactics, such as looting the temples and selling the stolen artefacts, this was revealed by Admiral Zhao in the comics. If someone inquired about an artefact, likely an Air Nomad, the merchant would reveal the Nomad's location, allowing the Fire Nation to ambush them. The process began with the temples and continued with the systematic elimination of Air Nomads, though not necessarily all of them. Over time, some Air Nomads either died of old age or integrated into other nations, resulting in the loss of their people. Some claim that Ty lee is a descendant of one of these nomads, but im not sure. She might look like Aang, but lets be honest, most people look similar in an animation, I mean Ta Min also looks like Aang.\n\nIn my head cannon, those who gained air bending after harmonic convergence are the latest descendants of Air Nomads that did not already have bending. Harmonic convergence didn't grant them the power; instead, it awakened the latent bending ability inherited from their Air Nomad ancestors given by the lion turtles. Notably, people with air bending post-harmonic convergence appear relatively young, ranging from 15 to 30 years old, the oldest is Bumi, however he is technically the youngest of his siblings without bending, as the other two have bending. it also explains why people all over the world have gotten the air bending, as the air bender ancestors are the only people that have a wide enough net to travel all over the world with their abilities and sky bison. Furthermore it seems that a human soul can only take a single bending power, which is why only those that had no bending ability awakened air bending.",

Since Yangchen and Aang were Avatars they might've been special cases. The wiki says Aang was taken to the Southern Air Temple after the toy ceremony proved he was the avatar, and all it says about Yangchen is that she was raised by Air Nuns in the Western Air Temple, Tenzin and his children aren't really helpful since they're pretty far removed from the whole thing.\n\nYou're probably right that the gender separation made it harder to find partners, and the fact that air bending seems to require a spiritual connection alongside a genetic connection wouldn't help since they'd likely be blending into the populations around them.",

That\u2019s fine, they only had to take out four temples, allegedly(I mean that\u2019s sort of the point of this discussion). Also I\u2019ve watched Korra multiple times, when exactly is it established that there were other air nomad survivors that disappeared into other societies? The closest thing I can think of is the air acolytes but like, from every indication they\u2019re just a bunch of glorified history buffs from other cultures who took up the job of restoring the air temples. Also I\u2019d think airbenders would have showed up elsewhere prior to harmonic convergence if there were descendants of other survivors running around. All I\u2019m saying is that there *should* have realistically been survivors of the genocide, or at least the initial first strike, but considering there would have been plenty of safe places to run for the time being such as the majority of the Earth Kingdom, and there\u2019s never any evidence of that, it\u2019s a bit questionable. I think I like the idea that\u2019s been suggested that maybe they were all congregating in the temples at the time for some cultural event, or perhaps the comet itself had some significance to them as well, or whatever, just would have been nice to have that explained somewhere. \n\nThat being said, that\u2019s kind of a lot to expect out of the first season of a series that aired on Nickelodeon\u2026",

                    "body": "I will add a few more points towards the viability of the Air Nation genocide:\n\n- Yes Sozin's Comet is short, but according to the wiki it was used at that time almost exclusively to hunt down the Air Nomads. Yes they likely did attack all 4 temples during the Comet, and any other Air Nation peoples they knew about besides. As we've seen a single Fire Bender can take on scores of enemy Benders while under the influence of the Comet, and there are no real tales from that time of the Comet's passing of the Fire Nation attacking any nation in a major way _besides_ the Air Nation. So I do think they performed a very concentrated purge of them using that power.\n\n- According to the wiki, the Air Benders were already the smallest nation by far even before the Fire Nation's attacks on them, and they'd also lived with a tradition of pacifism for centuries. They practiced bending forms which are like a martial art, but they weren't trained fighters like the Fire Nation's soldiers.\n\n- Also from the wiki - in the comics there's apparently a story about: \"Lord Sozin removed relics from the temples and had a number of small residences high in the mountains furnished with them, giving these places the appearance of being inhabited by other Air Nomad refugees. Using spies to spread rumors about these safe houses throughout the Earth Kingdom population.\" So it wasn't just hunting them down in the wild, the Firelord literally sprinkled traps across the nations to lure the survivors out of hiding and finish them off.\n\n- The Fire Nation also concocted the propaganda after the extermination of the Air Nomads that they had been trying to \"take over the world\" with the Avatar and the Fire Nation valiantly put a stop to it. This was probably both to clean up their own image and also convince the other nations to turn over any survivors so the Fire Nation could finish them off.\n\n>That being said, that\u2019s kind of a lot to expect out of the first season of a series that aired on Nickelodeon\u2026\n\nTrue.",

So by the time aang does get free from the ice, they are all effectively dead from everyone's perspective. Their decendants even unaware they may have airbender blood in them and so in kora, those were the ones that got their bending back.

Let me expand on that a bit \n\nIn the cartoon S1, there are about ~16 episodes between gaang first escaping Zuko at the Southern Water Tribe and arriving at the Northern Water Tribe.  \nThat's 16 adventures. 16 opportunities for the gaang to show their growth, their bending, their leadership skills, etc. Several of those episodes are also straight up about them training.  \nOn top of that, a handful of episodes make references to significant time having passed between episodes. Them sitting on Appa looking bored (*\"are we there yet?\"*) or saying something like *\"but we trained all day yesterday! Do have to do it again?!\"* It makes the world feel big and thus the journey long.   \n\nWhen Katara challenges a Master at the Northern Tribe, no one thinks she can win, but S1 has made us **feel** that she has come a long way. Dozens of adventures and training sessions makes her journey and growth **feel** worthwhile and her confidence (and a tiny hint of arrogance) in challenging a Master is earned through that.  \n\nNatla has 5 episodes for that same journey. 1.5 of those episodes are spent with Katara and Sokka stuck in spirit world limbo, while Aang fast travels across what is obviously a now ridiculously tiny world. None of the episodes include the kind of actions or comments that make us feel like something has happened between the episodes. The world feels tiny and the journey feels short. Very short.  \nSo in that show, it **feels** like Katara goes straight from learning water whip to challenging a Master. It doesn't feel earned. It doesn't feel like growth. It feels like pure arrogance with nothing behind it. And the writers know this, so they violate the golden rule of \"show, don't tell\" and have her tell us *\"I know I can't win, but yadda yadda\"* which might as well have been said straight to the camera. Because they know they didn't show us enough growth to justify this act from the character, but they had to hit that story beat.     \n\nI really enjoyed the cast, especially Zuko and Iroh. I like that, as an adaption, they don't follow 1:1 and change a few things. I don't mind the sometimes clunky dialogue. And the sets and effects look great.  \nBut this kind of story simply doesn't work in a 8 episode format. Double length doesn't matter. It just shows us more of a single point in the journey, when we need see more points of the journey. And that's why I don't think this show can be great.  \nBut I think it's good enough to enjoy for what it is.",

You *can* get good performances out of child actors, you *can* have practical sets that don't look like foam -- some choices feel less like choices and more the result of inexperience. But many of the producers and directors have fairly short resumes, with one never having been a director before. So, I am hesitant to be harsh.

They were afforded basically the same amount of time to develop that story and its always awkward af.  They thought they were doing something with Yue as a fox shift in the spirit world, but it was basically nothing.  They crammed what was supposed to be a storyline-important relationship into a few minutes and then killed her and expected everyone to be upset about it like they were in ATLA and it was never meant to be.\n\n**THAT ALL BEING SAID:**  The story wasn't bad in my opinion.  It wasn't ATLA-good, but it was ATLA-decent.  The casting was 110% though.  Zuko & Bumi are stellar at their characters.  Katara (including them expediting her to waterbending master) did great, but there's definitely a lack of sass in her writing.  Similarly, Sokka did a great job (including them writing a more sensitive backstory for him) - but there's definitely a lack of goof in his writing.\n\nI look forward to seeing who gets cast as Toph.  I've said it a few times now, this show will live or die on how well they cast and write Toph.",

I didn't get that feeling from this actor.\n\nIn general, I don't get what they were trying to do with this show. It looks amazing, and the bending effects are awesome, but what is this storyline? They just took the original show and condensed it a ton. They left no room for any character development. Like, why are Kitara and Sokka suddenly friends with Aang and ready to leave their village with him? They barely even spoke before that point. Everything felt incredibly rushed. Every time I've watched this show, I felt like I should just be watching the original animated version instead. The live-action doesn't add anything.

The dude is a monster, and they're ruining a solid story in an effort to do something nobody asked for or wants, and have made what was a much more believable redemption arc had it been left untouched all the more difficult now because...just...urgh!\n\nThis is *exactly* like Rings of Power. Studio comes in and blows a massive dollar budget on an IP thinking that people will flock to it simply because they slapped well loved characters on the packaging, pump *everything* into making it look visually stunning, and leave out almost every last bit of substance that made the original great. All because they think that will do better than if they just tried to tell their own story.\n\nBut then again, it is Netflix. After how they've completely butchered the Witcher story I'm not surprised. I mean my gosh...just...ugh...\n\nI'm rewatching the cartoon again just to remind myself how much better it is.",

But look what they did with Suki. They completely flattened her character to avoid any gender dynamics and conflict, and ironically turned her into a love-at-first-sight awkward girl who just needed to be shown the world by a foreign boy...wtf.",

A prime example of this approach is evident in Supernatural. Despite a central season-long objective, roughly 8 or 9 out of 18-24 episodes focused on plot progression, rest are \"fillers\".\n\nNetflix's decision to forgo this model in favor of a fast-paced plot may stem from the success of Stranger Things, their beloved cashcow. Notably, since the rise of Stranger Things, no Netflix show has included filler episodes. \n\nHowever, incorporating such episodes, even if they introduced new narratives or revisited past adventures, could have potentially mitigated viewer dissatisfaction with NATLA..",

Well why would Aang need to master the disciplines then? Why would he need to find a master as the Avatar when Katara can just do it by herself? \n\nIt was not well thought through or executed",

Like, if she has no one to be upset with, then how can she have that moment?\n\nSure, it would have been easy to fall into the preachy trope and get a bunch of people upset, but the original source material didn't do that.  So you had a great template to follow to keep you from falling into that problem.\n\nI think that's what the real problem is when people say they don't want such and such a show to be political.  They don't actually mind it being political, what they mind is it being preachy.  But if you follow the basic rule of \"show don't tell\" and don't give characters a soap box that isn't deserved, then most of the time people don't mind.\n\nBut instead they ended up making our girl a bit of a mary sue, as she somehow gets granted the rank of master and can take on zuko without any formal training.\n\nLike, all they needed was a \"4 months later\" screen (which would have worked out well since they set up the main story to allow a time jump) to give her time to learn bending.  It would have been an easy fix.  And that would have given a lot of insulation towards angry feminist comments.\n\nBut that's the hard thing about character arcs: you have to start your character with flaws, and these days no one can tolerate any character who isn't an absolute villian who has any character flaws.",

She just wants to be treated like a human being and that doesn't necessarily extend to other women. \n\nShe doesn't fight pakku because \"all women in the tribe should be allowed to fight\" it's because *she specifically* wanted to learn. Otherwise, she wouldn't be satisfied with just being an exception to the rule. No other women or girls are seen training with them after the fight, it's just her, and she's okay with that. \n\nWhen she calls out the betrothal necklaces, it's because she hates pakku and understand why her grandma would run from him. Otherwise, why didn't she have more to say about yue's betrothal?\n\nI'm not saying this is a bad thing either. Not every female character has to be feminist, and it's pretty neutral imo to not be super invested in politics. But the framing of her being feminist simply because she's a girl and wants things for herself is kinda ridiculous. Feminism isn't just wanting things for one woman, it's for all women to achieve equity in society. When does katara really ever call for that?",

I get where they would still have to rearrange or cut filler episodes cuz the format is different, but they shot themselves in the foot by pushing extra stuff in.\n\nIt's like since everyone already knows how it ends, they are trying to tell the whole story at once instead of doing it 1 step at a time to build on things. Instead of a well written story unfolding, it feels messy and all the character arcs are watered down bc not only do they not have the time to do them, but they're not willing to commit anyone to any character decisions that are too dark or controversial. \n\nPZuko's redemption arc only is as good as it is in the original bc he is a legit villain, but in this version they don't want to make him seem evil bc they know he changes later so they are trying to keep him \"sympathetic\" and it just takes away from the power of his story bc the changes he has to make to become good aren't that different from what he was making before",

                    "body": "The problem wasn\u2019t overall runtime for the entire season; I think it was number/length of episodes. Having 20 distinct stories, each with their own beginning, middle, and end, set apart from one another helps us to feel/imagine time passing, characters getting to know one another, lots of adventures happening, etc. Even though, returning to the original series, a lot of those 20ish-minute episodes had to move FAST to get through their stories in the time given.\n\nThe Netflix series reduces the number of distinct stories it has to tell, adds in some other stuff, and gives some stories/scenes more room to breathe. But because it\u2019s all jumbled up together in a handful of big, baggy episodes that now have to leap between all these different stories all the time, the season feels rushed and directionless even when as a whole season it\u2019s hitting mostly the same story beats in the same overall span of time.\n\nTake the Omashu episode, for instance. In the original, it\u2019s just about Bumi and Aang. Now it\u2019s about Bumi and Aang, AND the badger mole tunnels, AND the characters who are otherwise at a Wind Temple, AND Jet. These are four episodes in the original, spaced at at different points in the show, in different locations and at different times. So in the Netflix version, instead of feeling like a long journey, with new adventures around every corner, it just feels like everything is happen in at once and there\u2019s nothing solid to focus on.",

Bumi had to make decisions that caused his own civilians to starve and die. Iroh regrettably was a war lord. That\u2019s gonna come with trauma. \n\nI just thought the women, especially Katara, took a backseat. They were mostly ogling male characters.",

There feels like there's a need to hit keynotes. \n\nAnother example using Bumi as it's nice and compact, his desire to ride the mailcarts at the end feels like its totally out of left field. This Bumi is sad and dour and has no time for fun, one minor beating later and he's paying off a joke we never established because the flashback is cut short.",
