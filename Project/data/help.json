            "text": "It seems like there is a new design being rolled out, and I hate it.\n\n### Which design?\n\nThis design has a persistent left column that contains a list of Communities and Resources, plus Home, Popular, and All. This all appears to be stuff that used to be inside a dropdown menu in the site header to the left of the Search field.\n\nThe right column is all recent posts, unless I'm in a sub, and then it shows the same old sub-specific content: About, Rules, a graphic, moderator list.\n\nWhen I click on any post, it opens that post as a new page. The old design used to load the post dynamically like a modern single-page-app.\n\nETA: This is the design that uses the new `<shreddit>` components.\n\n\n### Why do I hate it?\n\nThat left bar is absolutely useless to me. I never click on it (except to collapse the lists, which are just distracting visual noise). I don't need to see a list of all the subs I've joined: I _know_ them by heart because those communities matter to me; I assume it's the same for most reddit users. When I want to browser a specific sub, I just click on a post in my feed to get there. Typing the URL is also pretty easy, because of reddit's famous and good URL scheme; a lot of my subs get auto-suggested by my browser based on my history and previous direct access.\n\nI almost never used the dropdown in the old design for the same reason. But at least the dropdown had the virtue of being tidy, rather than vomiting all its content onto my screen on every page.\n\nOpening each post in a new page sucks. It is slower, less efficient, and more inconvenient. We already had ways of opening posts in new tabs: Ctrl+click or Cmd+click. All you did was take away a useful and good feature.\n\n\n### Why it's **evil**\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the names of users no longer appear on posts in the main feed. This is a huge problem, and I'm pretty sure this one change is the _raison d'etre_ for the entire design: **reddit wants to hide the names of posters so that viewers can be exposed to the content before they can contextualize it**.\n\nIt's anybody's guess whether this is because you're trying to make it easier for AI to masquerade as humans, or for propagandists to poison public discourse. Or maybe, like Elon Musk, reddit's owners are neo-Nazis who want to create a more-welcoming environment for fascists.\n\n\n**This is not merely a design decision. It is anti-helpful.**\n\nFire your PO and UX staff. This new design is worse in every single way. Less convenient, less useful, less honest. You're bad and you should feel bad.",

It really is making the experience less enjoyable. There is also more mess on my screen now with this sidebar, and I wish we could hide it altogether.\n\nNot only color schemes, but there are also features being cut out, like you mentioned. Personally, I really hate not being able to see what comments I replied to on my profile -- now you only see the reply. This makes it annoying to check on discussions I'm interested in and continue the conversation in posts that are not my own. \n\nAt minimum, I'd also ask anyone forced to be a tester for this redesign to leave feedback and rate it. Just have a pop-up somewhere on the screen and listen to the feedback. I had to search all across Reddit to find this one subreddit where I can actually talk about this. It doesn't make sense for a business to force its users into something and just forget about their wants and needs, ignoring any feedback.",

The new design has this disgusting industrial office grey/blue/green. Like a color that can't decide what it is, so it just turns into looking like muddy water.\n\nAnd as far as i am concerned. No one. I mean literally no one, was asking for a redesign. It's the dumbest move at the dumbest time ever as well. A lot of people use reddit less right now. And even more so when spring and summer hits. When people then goes on reddit and don't get that homie feeling from it. It's more likely to have people close down the app or browser again and do something different. In the end. People will use reddit less until they find a reason to use reddit again. Unless of course they don't or if the new design is so off putting and impractical that people just don't use reddit anymore after taking a break due to the new design making everything feel foreign/strange/not homie.\n\nGoogle changing up things, Youtube changing up things, Twitter changing up things and now Reddit.  \nIt's very clear that there is some weird corporation change happening world wide making every social media change their design looks and features.

Now my karma is shot and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to get it back up since everything I post will get no traffic and my comments are collapsed. \n\nI deleted just about everything I've posted for damage control.

But if one is consistently being dwonvoted, I'd encourage some self-reflection:\n\n* is your content on-topic for the sub its being put on?\n* is your content topical, insightful, funny, or helpful?\n* does your content break the sub's rules?\n* is your content in line with the sub's cultures or does it go against it?\n* are you arguing or engaging in heated debate, or taking a controversial stance that you know most of the sub disagrees with?",

Lost my Social Credit score to a Lord of The Flies attack by a nest of Trolls.\n\nApparently, the suppression based on a low Karma score is at the discretion of the moderators of each subreddit. So theoretically, you can explain what happened, and ask the moderators to take you out or purgatory. I haven't tried that yet, but I plan to.\n\nGiving downvote authority to Trolls, is like giving loaded guns to a bunch of drunken teenagers. Of course, it's possible that a lot of the Trolls ***are*** drunken teenagers, but I have no evidence either way on that question. \n\nBut the real question is, what's to be done about it? One option I've thought about is to set up a Repair Squadron, a bunch of folks who will go around and upvote somebody who's been swarmed by Trolls.\n\nAnother option, which would require a system change, would be to only give the downvote power to non-anonymous people. Or alternatively, only give the downvote power to someone with a verified/not-free account.\n\nAbove all, I urge you not to roll over and give in! Rolling over and giving in is how bullies persists. We need to find a way to beat the Scourge of The Trolls!\n\nIf you're interested in finding ways to do that, check out:\n\nr/Trollhunters2024\n\n:-)\n\nTCS",

Look, were all human at the end of the day and I can have my opinion and people can have theirs, but it is best to keep it to yourself if you feel that it can stir up the wrong recipe. Trust me, in this day of age where social media is primarily one of the dominant forms of communication, people are going react instinctively and emotionally rather than intellectually, no matter if you pertain good intentions and are honest and sincere, if it's gonna make someone's blood boil, than don't say it. Even if you try to explain yourself, it's very difficult to understand tone and whatnot.\n\nLike you said, Reddit loves popular opinions (There's even a subreddit for it) and it's going stay that way because that's how it was designed. The infamous like/dislike or thumbs up/thumbs down mentality is a driving force for the inner workings of many of these big social media sites. The internet of full of differing opinions but whatever is the \"loudest and proudest\" is going to be spoon-fed to users. \n\nI've got opinions that I rather not share, but as I long as I don't open my mouth, nobody will ever know unless someone out there is a superhero that can read minds, so congratulations on that. \n\nIt's not just how people would react, but the consequences of that. You could get hacked, doxxed, harassed, etc. and I've seen people threating to ruin each others lives because of their views, beliefs, etc. There's so much more to life out there than arguing with random strangers.

It can cause games to take forever and just not be fun. I don't care if people wanna proxy, no complaints here, but im not gonna play with them if its gonna hinder my game/free time.

If we allowed proxies, they would have their 20 years of experience to know exactly WHAT to proxy to build the strongest decks they could think of; I would be googling \"strongest Magic cards in rakdos\" or something to try to keep up.\n\nWe're moving into Canadian Highlander now, so I've embraced proxying slightly more, but I fully expect to lose horribly over and over now that restrictions are lifted.

You get banned in one and do not get it successfully appealed and removed, you as the user are banned on all accounts forever.  They have automated detection methods to know it is you.

It's extremely rare to see a dev team scrap such a massive feature. They have sunk so much wasted resources into it by now. At best, they can try to improve it, but the insanity of it is that no matter what they do, the previous redesign is currently superior already, and does it better, except with viewing certain type of media.\n\nIt doesn't seem like the most genuine complaints ever got taken seriously even for a second. The whole platform protested the greedy API changes and as you can see, they did not care the slightest. It would be pure insanity to consider they would care about a \"small thing\" such as messing up the entire desktop UI.\n\nTL;DR: Reddit no longer cares about our most genuine problems and nothing will stop this team from ruining it in order to make a profit. It's clear that this is the motive behind EVERY decision they have made.\n\nOf course, it's normal to want to make money. But it's not OK to completely destroy what gave you the chance to make money in the first place. It is, in a big sense, theft, as the users are what drives the content and traffic here, and what makes adverts worth anything. The users got given the middle finger so hard with all of these HORRENDOUS changes.\n\nYou don't deserve this platform, current CEO/dev team. You are a disgrace and this is the truth. I may not be rich, but at least my work in IT lets me sleep like a baby, I am not hated by our users or clients.",

What's more is that I use an OLED monitor so the \"dark theme\" which uses off-black colors will inevitably cause burn-in so I would prefer to go back to my proper dark theme in the earlier version.\n\nI am using firefox, is there any way to return to the older [new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com) or am I sore outta luck?\n\nEDIT: The solution is posted by u/missing-comma in the comments below: [https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1f1s8ya/comment/lk1s940/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1f1s8ya/comment/lk1s940/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nI can verify that this solution worked for me as of today, 08/26/2024.",

Some ideas may be: to allow to hide the left bar and regain that space for the threads list, to allow users to choose to not show the image in the message list, to make the threads cards more compact, so that more threads and comments can be listed in a single page, to allow users to click the flair to select all messages with that flair even when in the New and other sort options...",

But I googled the question and it brought me to this page, so I assume other people will end up here as well with the same question.\n\nI'll tell you EXACTLY why I hate the new logo and the fact that it is 3D. It's a really simple reason.\n\nSo, Pentagram is the graphic design company that did the rebrand. When you get a brief, you're supposed to look at the company, its function or product and then abbreviate that into a corporate image.. logo, colours, text, font etc.\n\nWhen I think of Reddit, I think of \"text\" only. It's a page where people come to read and comment. It's not filled with emojis, animated images, memes (unless you're on the meme subreddit, even then, they are links to them, they're not all displayed on one ugly page)\n\nYou get my point. Simplicity. Even just looking at the page as a whole right now. The most complicated thing on it, the thing my eyes are drawn to, instead of where the information actually is - the logo. It's brash, obtrusive and anything with gradients is impossible to place onto a background without it not looking centered (yes, I did graphic design some 20 years ago. But trying to get everything to look right in both Internet Explorer and Netscape put me into the system under psychiatric care)\n\nText. This is a text based site. Information. Discussion. Rhetoric.\n\nIt's not YouTube or Imgur or Insta or Deviant... it's not a visual site.",

All these badges and medals etc. Are they adding to the quality of conversation at all ?  \n\n\nSurely, the most important question anybody creative has to continually ask themselves while building or designing or coding or woodworking or \\*anything\\* is - *is this necessary?*  \n\n\nHaving all these individual customisable avatars, seems like someone on the design team got bored one weekend and decided to code an additional 5 layers of pointlessness into the site.\n\nPlus, Reddit is unique!Sure, its kinda the spiritual successor to Slashdot and Digg. But it stands alone and successfully as a tex\n\nt based information site.\n\nIt simply doesn't need to copy or base it's design on any other comparable or competitive site.\n\nAs-is (as-was?) was just fine!\n\nA while back, I learned of [old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com).

Also, the font is harder to read.\n\nI just want to get back to the previous design, but whenever I click a notification from new.reddit , like a comment reply, I am taken to the bad UX again.\n\nWhoever created the newest UX does not care or understand desktop users at all. It's insulting, I feel so sad if this is the direction of reddit. Might have to get used to old.reddit again (edit: links are randomly disappearing when I edit on this new design. It's also buggy like that)  again and if they take that away, after also taking apps like apollo away, I think it's officially time to quit it for good.\n\nOver and over again, we are forced to jump through hoops to maintain some level of functionality. Took me a while to get used to the previous design, but I'm just not going to bother with the newest one. It might as well be 9gag or ifunny.\n\nedit: after editing this on the new UX, all URLS disappeared. Great job on QAing this.\n\nEDIT 2: You can find extensions for your browser that can force new, or \"old-new\" reddit. This is the ONLY consistent way I could find. Personally, I think I am just going to get used back to old.reddit (with RES) and be done with this nonsense! Thanks for the help in the comments :)\n\nedit3: I am using Redirector on Firefox btw.

Yet those poorly communicated and managed big changes have all cost them users and with it user data and as such devalued Reddit.  \n\n* The API changes and the way they were communicated and rolled were obviously going to cost users\n* The barely functional chat system that was rolled out another negative\n* Removal of the awards and coins system with a system that most anyone should have known was not going to be popular cost them money 2 fold.  First, it was going to cost them money in premium subscribers who lost a perk in the free coins and dropped premium.  Second, everybody dumping there coin stockpiles was also going to cost premium money as there are so much free time built up.\n* The new UI first started on desktop, then the mobile web a month later.  The fact that they did not communicate either until a few weeks after us helpers here figured it out was done poorly.  The tone deaf way they announced it.  The fact that development has been non existent for months. And so many more things are costing them users and engagement.\n* CSQ and \"more established account\".  They have been completely secretive about how they work or even how to improve your scores. The information we do have on more established account was stumbled upon and provided by Reddit.  On the surface it seems like it would increase engagement by forcing users to interact more, it is also going to cost them users who primarily just use chat.\n\nSo, they are already working to devalue Reddit on their own.

Not extremely active, but had a few comments that were upvoted and a few karma points. A week or so ago I commented on a request for a book recommendation and got a message saying the mod had deleted it because it was off topic. I felt like it had been on-topic based on the question, and just sent a very brief message to that effect, thinking it had been a mistake and hoping for a reconsideration.  I wasn\u2019t snippy or argumentative in any way.  The mod  sent me a message about being respectful to the moderator. I just let it go (feeling a little puzzled).  Within a day or two, all my comments from all subreddits, from cooking to art to books to audio and video support topics, are gone, every new comment gets deleted by bots or simply never shows up. All old comments have disappeared, even previously upvoted ones. All karma gone. I don\u2019t know what happened. It\u2019s like this one mod went in and downvoted every comment I\u2019d ever made anywhere on reddit. Can one mod disappear my whole history like that?",

The site admins are who you need to speak to about that. Perhaps they can be recovered, or will reappear when the bug is corrected, but first the admins must be made aware of it. This is best done through a bug report.\n* By what appears to be a coincidence, you also encountered a not-so-great moderator, or perhaps caught that one on a bad day. For busier mods with large workloads, clearing the modqueue, which just means responding to all the user reports filed in the subreddits they moderate, can be a tedious and exhausting task, and one foul user interaction can set the tone for a moderator's following interactions with users without them intending it to. I do not believe this encounter is related to your missing comments.\n* Your comments going missing also removed your karma, which is required in many subreddits as a way to combat trolls, since creating a new account takes mere seconds. This is why your new comments are being removed automatically.\n\nSo basically it looks like a run of bad luck. Once you regain sufficient karma or get your missing comments reinstated, things should return to normal for you.",

It was just a rule the moderator could stretch and very loosely apply because they simply didn't like what I said when they banned me. They went digging and that was the best they had. I am only speculating. That has happened to me before. Last time a subreddit banned me it was a comment from 6 months prior to the ban. \n\nIt is the harsh reality of this platform. Moderators have no accountability. There is no due process. No facing your accuser in court. No arguing your case. And unfair punishment even if you did break the rules. And you can be banned for really doing nothing wrong and just saying something a mod dislikes. \n\nI don't think permanent bans should exist at all. They certainly shouldn't be the first thing mods jump to. Banned for life... over a mod being terrible? From the whole site over some mistakes or even admins unfairly applying rules? It is excessive. A life sentence. Technically. \n\nAnyway, I wouldn't respect the rules of this place too much.",

Subreddits are created by Moderators, who develop and implement Subreddit rules.\n\nSubredditors (you and I are Subredditors of the r/Help Subreddit) must abide by the established rules of this and all Subreddits we contribute to.\n\n# Subreddit Moderation\n\nA Moderator is in control of their Subreddit and ensures adherence to all rules of their Subreddit and Reddits' Policies. Some Moderators may require:\n\n\u25a0 200 + karma before allowing a post / comment.\n\n\u25a0 due diligence on various aspects of your entire profile, or your posts / comments (which could also trigger automatic deletions of a post / comment).\n\n\u25a0 that you are automatically banned due to  posts / comments that you submitted to another Subreddit.\n\n\u25a0 the use of AutoModerators (AutoMods) to assist them in performing Moderators' duties.\n\n\u25a0 that your posts / comments are not inundated with negative (re: down votes) karma. \n\n\u25a0 that you are verified (make sure the correct email is attached to your account). \n\n\u2022 Verify you have the correct passwords for Reddit and your email account. \n\n\u2022 It's the only way to recover from certain issues (if something were to happen to your Reddit account). It's how Reddit knows it's you.\n\n# (1) Tools\n\nModerators use certain tools and mechanisms to try to track (and ultimately limit) who has access to their Subreddits. \n\nThere are many other types of checks / balances used by certain Moderators. \n\nNot all Moderators are interested in these types of mechanisms or actually use them. You will learn more about them as you experience everything Reddit has to offer.\n\n#(2) Code of Conduct\n\nAll Moderators must adhere to the [Moderator Code of Conduct](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct). Utilize this link to report all suspected [Moderator Code of Conduct Violations](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\n# What Can You Do?\n\nHow can you help yourself be a better Redditor? Try taking the following steps:\n\n\u25a0 You should start to concentrate on contributing posts and making comments to obtain more karma. Maybe try posting about a variety of topics to get exposure to more Subredditors (who will then provide karma by up voting your contributions).\n\n\u25a0 Treat all Subreddits and Subredditors with respect to avoid possible consequences. Try not to provoke implementation of a rule violation, restrictions, or other negative actions placed on your account from Moderators or others in the Reddit community. \n\n\u25a0 Read all rules of any Subreddit before making a post / comment to avoid a possible violation.\n\n# Policies and Guidelines \n\nBe respectful and mindful of the following policies: \n\n\u25a0 [Reddit Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).\n\n\u25a0  [Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette).\n\n\u25a0 [Reddit User Agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement).\n\n\u25a0 [Reddit Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy).\n\nA combination of all of the above steps will help signify to the Reddit community at large (and specifically, to Subreddits and their Moderators that check these types of things), that you have an established account and are a great Reddit contributor.\n\n# Helpful Subreddits\n\nThere are some helpful Subreddits that you can access and explore in order to learn about Reddit; and increase your karma (while contributing posts / comments).\n\n\u25a0 [r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/fSpbLwbG7f) created to ask and answer all sorts of questions. It's one of the most popular and active communities on Reddit.\n\n\u25a0 [r/findareddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/s/VfTmt0P8LM) enbles you to actually find Subreddits of interest. Post what you are looking for here, and someone will suggest a community for you.\n\n\u25a0 [General New User Wiki](https://reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/w/index/faq?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). Questions from the community with responses from other Redditors.\n\n\u25a0 [r/LearntoReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/t5_5078wg/s/OeBF4UqJR2). A community for Redditors to learn how to use Reddit either our guides, and to test post to practice. \n\n\u25a0  [r/NewToReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/s/9MLDxo4Mrk) - Unofficial help community for all Redditors to ask and learn about Redditing. It is especially useful for newbies. It was created for Redditors to learn about the Reddit experience. It is especially useful for \"newbies\".\n\n\u25a0 [New-User Friendly Subdeddits List](https://reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/w/index/newusersubs?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). This list contains Subreddits with low to no restrictions.\n\n\u25a0 [r/NoStupidQuestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/s/BvVtsbpaHR). Ask your questions - no question is too stupid.\n\n# What is an Established Account?\n\nAn established account is a new chat restriction reddit has rolled out. This is the description of an established account:\n\n>*\"Established accounts include a variety of signals such as a verified email or phone number, a history of good contributions, and past enforcement actions taken on a user\u2019s accounts.\"*\n\n# Content Quality Score (CQS)\n\nPersonally?\n\nI don't really know what qualifies as a \"good contribution\". \n\nWho does? It's really subjective to the Subredditor who is responding to your posts / comments. \n\nEvery single time a Subreadditor actually sees a post / comment that you created? They have the option to:\n\n\u25a0 down vote | \u25a0 not respond | \u25a0 respond |\n:-------------:|------------------|:------------:|\n\u25a0 ignore        | \u25a0 read                | \u25a0 up vote\n\nHowever? The requirements most likely correlate to your [Content Quality Score (CQS) - click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatIsMyCQS).\n\nYou can check your CQS score at the site link above. Create a post and you will discover your score!\n\nReddit is evolving.",

Because I pointed out a flaw in her reasoning and asked her to make an even stronger one? How\u2019s that guilting and shaming? You git triggered because I used the word baby too I see. Shoot me. \n\nI pointed out the weakness, **not even the flaw, the weakness** in her argument and said in next time, she can do better? Her argument was weak, and I pointed that out. \n\nAnd no, **she wasn\u2019t focusing on her own abortion so I wasn\u2019t focusing on her own abortion either.**  She focused on people who didn\u2019t agree with her more-so than any effects of her own abortion on herself. So why are you concerned about any effect my use of the word baby had on her? **Again, I asked her to strengthen her argument**. Had she been discussing how affected she was by her abortion, I wouldn\u2019t have din it. She mention her own abortion almost as an afterthought. If people can find my comment, they can find her post too. Of course those people will have their own opinions, and some will have opinions about whether I attempted to shame her by using the word baby once. \n\nSorry, but I don\u2019t spend so much of my time thinking about the topic of abortion that I automatically reach for the term fetus. I do spend more time talking about their babies/grandchildren so that term came to mind, **when asking OP to make her argument better.\u201d **Weird way to shame anyone.** \n\nStill, didn\u2019t know that I _had_ to say fetus instead of baby as the OP said neither term. \n\nSo stuff your opinion I tried to guilt trip her.\n\n**I don\u2019t address other people\u2019s past choices on abortion, as in I don\u2019t shame them about it. Their abortion is not my business, and I would and have comforted people over that choice. Even here on Reddit. Why don\u2019t you look _that_ up?! Her post was present as an activist argument, and I addressed it as such.** so again, no shame over her personal choice, but I did find where anti-abortion activists could quickly rebut her arguments, and told her so, so she can have better ones next time. Because I see some of Reddit as a debate forum and we can learn improve with debate. **Which is why SAID I was playing Devil\u2019s Advocate.**\n\nSeems some people want an echo chamber, not a debate nowadays. Sorry , I didn\u2019t get that memo. \n\n\nI\u2019m not a supporter, but I\u2019m not an activist either. so it was easy to spot where someone else who isn\u2019t could find fault, but OP\u2019s post had the tone of argument, not personal experience. Don\u2019t put it out there if you don\u2019t want feedback. I provided feedback and asked her to strengthen her argument. \n\nETA:  So did you dox everyone else or just me. Seems it\u2019s your biases that are showing. \n\nNote:  Last paragraph was misplaced. Incomplete, and is a repeat. I thought I cut before posting. I left it to.

We see the \" so-called right \" pointing out COVID had issues and the left claimed sadly were killing people,  evil, old people killers etc, see the Hamas marchers now all crossing Europe and the violence smashing up banks, acting police when they arrest like Manchester only a few days ago.\nIt's hard to call people like that civil or truthful.",

It really is an attempt at bullying.\n\nThen there is the bot factor. It\u2019s a strange world out there.   \n\n\nAs a personal protest, I\u2019m going to vote this post, and everyone who makes a relevant non-sounding comment.",

You just click the reddit logo, located AN INCH ABOVE HOME (assuming you have not accidentally scrolled the side bar, which is easy to do.)\n\nNow, because of these two sidebars there is no way to click back to the feed from anywhere in the post. You must scroll back up (there is no more back to top button. Genius move) and click on a tiny arrow next to the post. Why. This doesn't make sense. It can't boost engagement. It literally makes it harder to view the next post. That is the opposite of engagement. You cant even \"asshole design\" correctly. Just give us a giant obnoxious arrow that goes to the next or previous post on both sides. Boom, instant engagement.\n\nIts been 6 months. The users have told you repeatedly exactly the issues they have. This is objectively a terrible design. It is clearly designed to appeal to dumb users, but it sucks at even that. If they couldn't figure out that clicking the logo took them to home, then I don't think putting it on a bar that moves is helping the issue. \n\nForcing your users onto this UI is a terrible decision which will absolutely lead to lower site engagement. It is objectively more difficult to navigate the site.

Most of the comments in here are of the \u201cI don\u2019t like it\u201d variety from users who have not actually put time into using it.  When you get used to it, it is not as bad as it is made out to be.  The T in comments is on my list of annoyances.  There are legitimate issues that need to be addressed.  I have a list I have provided to Reddit multiple times in multiple places of 6 major issues and 10-15 annoyances over the last 6 months ago and was told they would be given to the proper teams.  Which does not mean anything.\n\nI have been fighting this fight for almost a year now and you better believe I am frustrated as well.  Every chance I get I try to bring some of the legitimate issues up with nothing to show for it.  Even here in both the weekly recap and in the pinned post announcing the shutdown of new.reddit.  It does frustrate me when I get those kinds of replies to my weekly recap comment.  Also when new UI issues I brought up are ignored in their reply.  But, they have to be one of the best admins I have seen because they actually interact with us users and there are times we have been able to get things fixed.  They respond to some negative comments as well unlike most admin interaction which is just on the overly positive comments.  This is their job though and have rules they need to follow.  \n\nI also agree it is frustrating when they push out updates that were not properly tested and break other things.  I am here helping over 40 hours a week and see the issues and get some of the hate because of my flair.  I would like to think that may be changing though.  They had said they were pushing out an app update last week.  Well we still don\u2019t have it and I would like to think they are getting it right before pushing it out.  I also concur that they manipulate down time on the status page.  No disagreement there.\n\nSaying that the other 2 are better is a matter of opinion.  They all have things I like and don\u2019t like, but because of the way I use Reddit, the newest UI is better than the previous for one thing.  It preserves formatting when pasting.  That saves me a ton of time cumulatively.  If they would fix the issue with r/ links disappearing when pasted unless clicked on, it would be even better.\n\nIf they didn\u2019t shut down the previous some would never move to the new one.  For a user new.reddit is definitively better than old Reddit, but look at how many people use it to this day",

Your whole argument is that you like the new UI better in some cases, this is subjective. What's objective is that features are missing from the new UI. They've fixed some of the dumbest things, like pictures opening in a new tab and the general lack of any polishing when it comes to displaying media, but glaring issues like the quote feature missing and text formatting tools being obfuscated are deliberate design choices. If I'm being charitable, I would say they're doing this to make it easier to maintain a mobile app and a web app on a tight budget, however even then there's no actual material benefit to forcing users onto the new UI other than analytics to prove that all of this work wasn't completely useless and wasted, which since I'm not actually being charitable, I would say is probably the case. \n\n>Saying that the other 2 are better is a matter of opinion\n\nIt's not. There are less clicks required for me to write this same comment on old reddit than there would be on the new design. I have to move my hand from my keyboard to my mouse more often, which is worse user experience, which means the design is objectively worse. Again, this is a forum. This isn't tiktok or instagram or twitter, it's a forum meant for long form content and discussions. \n\n>If they didn\u2019t shut down the previous some would never move to the new one. For a user new.reddit is definitively better than old Reddit, but look at how many people use it to this day\n\nOf course. Some people would still be using Windows XP today if they could, but that group of users is very small compared to the rest of the people who use the platform and the new users of the platform. If the new UI was actually good, willing users would switch to it over time and new users wouldn't ever even consider going to an older version of the platform. There's virtually no maintenance cost here, it can almost entirely be automated. \n\nThis is my job, by the way. I spend my time maintaining infrastructure and automating menial tasks that nobody wants to do so that users can have a good experience when they use the product I develop. There are standardized processes for all of the missteps reddit consistently takes at this point. The only excuse for this from reddit is poor communication (or rather, poor reception, the illusion of communication is strong here) and poor organization internally. Nobody would have an issue with a new UI if it was a natural continuation of the old one with the same features and functionality, without the giant performance hit that this tab takes in my browser when I'm using the new UI.\n\nIt doesn't matter how you slice it, this initiative is horribly executed and that's why people are upset with it. It would be one thing if they actually tried to work with the users of the platform to develop an attractive, functional UI that people want to use, but they won't. Instead we get forced into an objectively worse experience because internally, reddit needs to prove that this entire initiative wasn't a horrible investment.",

The page also mentions moderators, so you shouldnt be making moderation decisions based on the poster, but instead the content.\n\nYep granting downvoting powers to every member of the community it is inevitable it ended up being used for other reasons.\n\nIronically if we talking about echo chambers, which is the point I think you mentioned, if there was no mass downvotes of unpopular posts, then there would probably be a better balance in communities.

I find myself getting downvoted or getting my posts removed on some subreddits because I didn\u2019t format something correctly even if it was unintentional (and hidden under a list of rules that feel like college citation guidelines). And even when I fix it, I still experience removal and downvotes because I\u2019m told my posts usually fall under a different tag or something. How am I supposed to know what tags are usually used in a particular subreddit if I\u2019m new? I also don\u2019t really understand how Karma works but it\u2019s also sad to see my 10 karma go down when I\u2019m just genuinely interested and passionate about something. It\u2019s just frustrating, and if there\u2019s anyone with advice on how to better navigate Reddit, it would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the small rant, but thank you everyone for your help!

Yes there are subs that have lots of restrictions, but what you need to do is find something you like (mine:crochet, thrifting, splatoon3) and find the general sub for it. (R/crochet, r/thriftinghauls, r/splatoon). I joined these subs and in my main feed I get to see posts about the things I love. I can comment on and upvote posts I see every day. Sometimes my comments get up votes! But I don't think about that too much because I'm in a community that also loves the thing I love. \nI read all the rules and now I'm ready to make my own post in the sub! Let me show off my crochet project I'm working on, or a funny clip from my game, or my haul from goodwill. Sometimes no one comments and I just get a couple up votes, that's okay! I don't post again for another couple days because there was nothing for me to post about. But I left several comments on different posts with people who have questions or need advice or just showing off cute stuff! \nThe point is to have a community with other people who share your hobby or passion. Stop getting so worked up, read the rules in each sub, and follow them because some of these mods don't mess around.",

The people you meet in those subreddits can direct you to the safest places to post your questions to.  \n\nThe last chunk of advice I can give is the most important. Sit on your responses before posting them.  If you are upset, bothered, or angered by someone's post, Don't reply. It is likely a trap. If you must reply, sit on that reply until the post you are replying to does not bother you anymore and you can see it for what it is.",

Just achieve about 1k karma, more than 97.38% of the total subs can't stop you from posting and commenting. \n\nMany might downvote this post as well.",

I experienced (still experience) the same thing all the time.\n\nThere are a lot of trolls and know-it-alls on the app. The app is very much opinion driven. If someone doesn't agree with one thing you say...DOWNVOTE.\n\nEven the subreddits that are fact-base  in nature are difficult to post in. \n\nExample,  just the other day I posted a question in r/plumbing.   I thought it was a simple question and that it was clear what I was asking so I didn't even add a photo.   The responses I got were 'have no idea what your saying', 'post a picture' and downvotes.  It's fine if I am unclear...but the downvotes are ridiculous....i am obviously looking for advice on a subject I'm not familiar with and we may need a dialogue to make it clear...but the downvotes make it seem like I did something wrong. \n\nWhat I have found is you have to treat reddit like a game.  There are rules to the game you have to follow...and part of the game is to read the rules on each step (each subreddit).The end goal is to accumulate many more points than you lose. \n\n It's hard to start the game...some paths are blocked until you  reach a certain point level.  It gets easier as you gain these points and learn how to play.  Sometimes you may have to post something warm and fuzzy or brilliant to make up for a post that caused you harm.  There are monsters/bad guys in your way that will try to prevent you from reaching your goal...you have to figure out a way to either avoid them, charm them, or at least minimize the damage they may cause you.  \n\nIf you look at it this way perhaps it will be less impacting on your psyche. Hope that helps.\n\nEdit:  see, you're already playing by posting this topic that so many of us have experienced and agree on!",

Mods said they check the IP address, well the bots were wrong. I confirmed 1 profile. I can't even appeal because it states there's no restrictions??? But feel the mods did this. Maybe I'm wrong but I was tempted to share messages with this person but never did because who wants to be thrown under the bus? Treat those how you wanr to be treated? I'm sure it's a bot thing so I get what you're saying !!! It's so frustrating but just can't comment anymore in that group!! It is what it is!",

I'm active on other social media app so I couldn't be active here and I don't want to.. we have a life outside of phones! \n\nBut apparently I need to earn some karmas to post a simple get to gather invitation. I didn't know this before.. I had made one video of rain pics and posted under the photography group (I'm sure people of my city would have felt some connection as monsoon is special here, specially first rain) anyway that post was taken down and then I made another post as I had some question about books. That post didn't get any access either.\n\n\nSo when I didn't get any view on my both posts, I seeked help and someone informed me that I need karmas.. I replied to that comment that how many karmas I need in order to make a post and guess what? I had only one karma and with my question it got down voted and now my karma is in minus! \ud83d\ude2c\ud83e\udd23\n\nI was like geez.. did I enrol in Uni again!? Lol. I don't have time to earn karmas and I feel that I need to prove myself here just to invite people to my party!!  \ud83d\ude2c I'm sorry to say this but it sucks.. it should allow people to ask questions..  \n\nI'm not sure about the settings here but with my other social media app I can hide all new users and I don't get to see their posts. It's that simple but reditt seems complicated and not friendly! And can be stressful lol. \n\nI'm thinking what are the other ways to reach people because clearly this is not working for me! I mean restricting people to this extent doesn't make any sense. \n\nP.s I tried to make paragraphs lol. OP was asking for help but then everyone was going on and on about writing in paragraphs. I mean you pin point once and that's fine but whole focus was on it instead of being nice to a new member who was struggling.. crazy!",
