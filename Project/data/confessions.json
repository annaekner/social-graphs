But she hated people seeing her when she was \u2018\u2019weak\u2019 and begged me not to tell anyone - and then a day later she wasn\u2019t lucid enough to change her mind I couldn\u2019t betray her, not when I figured she would be up in a few days and angry at me for telling.\n\nI told work I had COVID so I couldn\u2019t come to the office, and worked from home or the hospital.\u00a0 She\u2019d been laid off recently with all the layoffs happening and had been quiet while recovering from it so no one suspected anything.\n\nShe was even in the hospital during my birthday, but I just posted on social media a pic of her present (neither of us were the type to wait til the day of to hand it over so I already had it) and no one questioned it.\n\nI sat through the worst conversations of my life with the doctors alone. But I truly didn\u2019t believe she was going to die.\u00a0 She was young.\u00a0 We had time.\u00a0 I was wrong. An unexpected medical issue and she's gone.\n\nNo one knows still. I can\u2019t tell them.\u00a0 But I can tell anonymous strangers on the internet as I toast our anniversary. So happy anniversary baby. I\u2019m nothing without you.",

It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re religious. They listen to problems for free all the time. It\u2019s kinda their job. Just think of it as talking to another person on the planet. You can also try a grief counselor, a grief support group or a 12 step program if that fits your needs. \n\nThere are options, you\u2019re not alone. But seriously, holding someone else\u2019s secrets can be very damaging to your body, mind and spirit. You don\u2019t have to live that way if you don\u2019t want to. \n\nMessage me if you want more suggestions. My heart is with you.",

He was in the hospital and decided to go to hospice care, but he didn't want me to tell anyone other than my spouse and children. He was a very private person that didn't want anyone to worry about him. The day before he passed, he did let me tell his siblings so they could have one final call together. It's so hard when we feel the weight of the world on our shoulders. I'm so thankful he at least let me share with some people because I needed the support.",

I don't think she told you that with the intent of causing you more anguish, more burdens, more pain. \n\nYou protected her secret to the point of it causing self harm and I don't believe for a moment she meant for that to be the outcome. \n\nYou are here, alive, you need to live and to do that it means taking care of yourself. Take care of yourself in her honor if need be, she loved you so much and would you want her to keep a secret to the point it was causing her pain and anguish? Absolutely not. She didn't want anyone fussing over her while she was in the hospital and they didn't. She didn't want anyone to know so they wouldn't worry and they didn't know and no one worried or made a fuss. Secret kept and goals accomplished.\n\nShe isn't here to worry about or fuss over. You kept her secret and it served its purpose. It's time to let go of it and get the support and help you need. I know it's hard to prioritize ourselves especially when it feels like it will be a betrayal to a loved one. This isn't a slight against her or a broken promise. Her secret was kept and served the purposes she intended it to serve. \n\nYou need to promise to take care of yourself now. You need to live a life she would you to live. Would you want her to continue to keep a secret that was no longer protecting your but destroying her from the inside out? No. \n\nI know emotions can break us sometimes. However, look at things from her life as a whole... how do you think she'd feel seeing you suffer all in the name of a promise that has been kept and its purpose fulfilled? Logic says she loved you and people that love us would never want us to suffer. She loved you and she'd want you to let this go and get the support you need. Please honor the love you had for each other and tell someone you both love and trust with this. It doesn't mean you have to tell everyone but you do need a support system. Life is crazy hard on all of us, making it harder isn't something any of us need and the people we love would agree.",

Grief is so disorienting and reality distorting, and to live one reality while everyone in your life is assuming another has to be an agony. I think if your secret becomes too heavy to carry, you can put it down and tell the truth, because your wife cannot be harmed by it or anything else ever again. In the big swirling mess of grief, it's important to connect with your people for real. The horrible immensity of it is too confusing and overwhelming alone.",

I do recommend a priest or therapist to tell your secrets too but you don't have to tell anyone who knew both of you what happened right now. Right now you need to learn how to breathe again. I nearly lost my husband to cancer 9 years ago and I was staring down the barrel you're facing. No one can know til it happens to them but my husband kept telling me I had to move on eventually but I was allowed to not be okay for a few years at least. He even then knew just how to get me to understand. \n\nYou owe no one but yourself that intimate knowledge right now. I bet it feels like lying to your mother but it's also feeling like lying to your spouse by telling everyone of her weakest days. It's a hell on earth you have to live knowing what her true weakness was at the end but that's your s cret for now. You don't owe your father in law or her bestie or anyone details on her dying breath. That kind of intimacy is meant only for your soul mate and your soul guardian (a spouse and a priest usually). That is your intimacy to keep. That's one more of those little secrets and moments and days you both had tucked away under the glowing neon sign labeled \"Spouse memories\". Not everyone is entitled to every one of those. Keep it for yourself if that's what you want to do. File it in the same place you file what name she called you in bed or what her debt pin was. There are some things that are just between spouses and your dying day is one of those things. You are not an asshole for keeping this.",

She confided in me that she started making sexual content online for extra money. Its not that big but enough to pay her rent each month ontop of her normal job. She has a full on secret insta, twitter, onlyfans etc. It came as a shock and I asked her so many questions about it and she briefly showed me her account while we talked about it. She then dropped the bombshell on me that she wanted me to help her with a video someone paid for, aparently they were tired of the solo content. I wont get into specifics cause im not sure the rules here but she wouldnt do full on sex since she doesnt like guys, it was more of a fetish thing. She made it very clear she just needed a dick for the vid and she trusted me but she was doing it for the money not cause she liked me and shed give me some of the profit if i helped her. We did it but I also memorized her username and waited a couple days and subscribed to her anonymously. Ever since then Ive been doing the same thing, paying her anonymously for videos that would include a guy just so that she keeps using me IRL.\n\nI feel bad deceiving her, especially since shes giving me back some of my own money\n\nEdit: Came here just to vent about the lie. To all of you chronically online warriors trying to make it 100x worse or ignoring context just leave. You can give me shit for lying or being a bad friend but for those of you trying to take it as far as assault or rape..touch grass and save your breath i genuinely dont care about your take when youre taking it that far. She's in control of doing stuff or not, shes not reliant on the money, she doesn't hate it and is being forced to do it, chill out, she wouldn't even consider it anything like that, just more like a normal lie which is why I'm considering telling her, shes not as delusional as some of you aparently are. We also still have occasional requewsts that are not from me that she accepts, its no different.\n\nNot sure how/where I'm supposed to do a update cause nobody would see it on my own page and by then this post will have ran its course so idk wont promise one. But thanks for all the support, yall flooded my dm's offering to help lol I cant respond to you all but I'm good. Thanks to the people who understood the weird grey area or even negative people who werent insane. Maybe I'll be back in a couple days maybe not. If the update is anything normal and not \"she tried to kill me when she found out\" the keyboard warriors will call it fake anyway cause reality doesnt fit their narrative lmao",

Ultimately, telling her the truth can possibly ruin the friendship (I don\u2019t know how deep this friendship is, but it\u2019s still a possibility). That is something you need to swallow and accept if you want to make things right. Telling her is what you should do especially if she is someone you truly care about, respect, and see as a friend. Friends don\u2019t lie to each other. You continuing to deceive her for sexual gain is not what a good friend would do. And you said it yourself, if you were to ask her for sex in return for direct payment she would say no, so how are you not crossing boundaries by doing so without her knowing? It\u2019s best to come clean now then for her to find out or to continue building the friendship under a lie. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a good person for this OP, but getting this off your shoulders will be good for her and you in the long term.

Let's say you are doing porn, and you are straight, but you know gay porn sells better so you're trying to find someone who you feel comfortable doing that with for the sake of paying your bills. You approach your best guy friend who you know likes men, but has always insisted you're just friends, nothing more. He doesn't even see you like that according to him. You offer to give him some of the money, because it's a joint business venture for two people not attracted to each other. Somehow he agrees, and you feel really lucky that he's so accommodating. \n\nSuddenly you get an influx of requests, and you keep having to approach him. You're worried you're putting a strain on your friendship by asking for his help to keep your bills paid. He's being so understanding though, and agrees each time. It's not penetrative, but it's also not something you really want to do either, so you feel lucky someone you trust is willing to help you not feel so weird about it. \n\nOne day though, you see a video of a tiktoker narrating a reddit post about a guy taking advantage of his best friend to get sexual favors, but he thinks it's okay because he's paying for it despite getting some money back from his friend for the porn vids. It makes you really uncomfortable to think about your own best friend betraying your trust like that. You discuss the Reddit post with him and notice he's visibly uncomfortable and trying to play \"Devil's Advocate\" about OP's side of things. Suddenly, you're not so comfortable around that guy bestfriend, and not long after you told him about it you see the original post was deleted. You confront him, and he gives you the whole \"You were going to do it anyways!\" guilt trip.\n\nYears worth of friendship and trust gone just because your best friend loved to bust a nut in the back of your throat more than he wanted to respect you as a person.\n\nThis is exactly what you're doing to your supposed best friend. If you wouldn't be okay with a man treating you this way with such disregard, you shouldn't be okay with you doing this to a woman, ESPECIALLY someone you claim to care for. You better pray to whatever God will pity you that she never sees this, because the more traction it gets, the less chance you have of remaining anonymous. I hope she absolutely dogwalks you if she does find out, because this is irredeemable scumbag behavior on your part.",

                    "body": "Whatever you decide just consider one unusual thing: If someone recognized her IRL would she prefer they say nothing, even if it's a lie of omission? Or would she be totally fine with them acknowledging she's kinda their sex worker even if she's with family / but only if she's alone?\n\nIf the former; if under no circumstances would she be happier knowing, then just remember that the _worst_ thing you could do is continue and escalate until you're her most considered customer, then get pissed one day and tell the truth like 'guess what you were my whore.'\n\nI don't know her but it sounds likeliest that the ability to compartmentalize things is a value to her life. She paid you for the first sex act (you're a sex worker with reasons to compartmentalize too) but she can avoid really thinking of herself as that person who pays for sex (/with men), and not really the a pimp either who objectifies you into a useful phallus even though that happened too, and not really a prostitute and still indeed a true friend who just happens to compartmentalize the same thing together in a business relationship.\n\nDon't overthink it so much that you go and hurt her on grounds she already willingly if accidentally accepted. For all you know she would have (had you been honest earlier) said \"I guess I already did that once so yes if I can film you and grow my channel/page at the same time\" or say if you were a porn promoter and producer you're the only one that could ask for certain non-lesbian progression because again she'd done it before and doesn't regret it.\n\n Finding out for sure at risk of breaking her compartmentalization (which doesn't just help her feel better about herself but protects her from doing other acts with other people for money that she'll maybe regret... and you helped her slide 'downward' by internalizing the whore label) seems disastrously inconsiderate / irrationally selfish.\n\nNo guarantee this won't lead to things being figured out, so danger, but if it's killing you, and you're going to blow up the secret if you can't get answers for how bad you should feel in some way, you could instead mention you've been \"lonely\" and since you've already been a sex worker you've changed your feelings towards being a John and need advice: \"have you regretted what we did for your page?\" (if yes delete your request account and never speak of this) if no, \"would you look down on me if I was a John, lets assume I know for a fact I wouldn't get an STI?.\" Basically you could wind up asking that since it's just money stuff do we think we would stay friends and compartmentalize it again if I paid your portion and are in it to orgasm instead of in it for money (and let you sell the video again) -- and of course we assume it was for no other reasons than her being the only sex worker you trust, same as a trusted phallus situation. Or you could get any number of delete-and-forget answers on your way there. Oh and if the answers were so relieving that you're in the clear to pay her in the open, I suggest you NOT do that for her sake and that of the friendship, say it was a stupid question and there are other ways to be safe that don't risk a friendship. If she prefers being intentionally ignorant of the people paying for it, that's a defensible line of boundaries that you are risking her breaking through forever by waving money in her face, if she just needed the cash a little more than you anticipated at the time.",

She screamed. I yelled \"OH FUCK!\" and shut the door and went to my wife's and my room. My wife asked what happened and I told her \"I'm really not sure.\" Then told her what I saw. My wife told me she'd have a talk with her and smooth things over. I don't understand why she didn't lock the door if she was going to be doing that and I'm honestly kind of pissed she stole a cucumber for whatever she was going to do with it.

First, I'm sorry, I misheard you and thought you said come in. That was my fault, and I'm perfectly fine never talking about what I totally didn't see. You're a teenager, it's normal, and if you heard about the ridiculousness that teen boys get up to well... you'd be like yeah, I'm good, nothing to be ashamed of. Second, lets get you a door lock, maybe one of those keypad ones so you don't even need a key with you. Thirdly, if you order anything off amazon from now on that's yours to open wherever you want and if you want we can get you a locking box to put in your room somewhere where you can store anything private that you don't want people stumbling upon. Fourth, when I said I'd never talk about it, I'm still going to give you shit every time we pass a farmers market. Anyways, good talk, I love you, you're always going to be my baby girl, embarrassment is part of being having parents and apparently part of being a parent, but also you owe us a cucumber because that shit better not be going back in the fridge. \"",

A girls relationship with her father is the foundation for future relationships. You don\u2019t want her feeling quiet and shameful in sexual situations. You want her to know being a sexual being is okay and you are proud of her for growing and maturing and for exploration just like graduating but obviously more awkward. It is normal and it means she is progressing normally. Women face so many obstacles when it comes to sexuality, take this opportunity to give her a leg up if you will. No pun intended lol \n\nWomen are taught that being sexual is shameful and their pleasure isn\u2019t a priority. She is also practicing in a very safe and solo way, can\u2019t knock that either. \n\nI think ur reaction is great. Sorry everyone was gross. Give her a lock. Loved that comment before.

There's probably a combination of sexual inexperience, misinformation from friends, and possibility of a genuine unconventional kink/fetish that is working here.

You are a father and a good father provided comfort in times of need. That is what you did. No one, yourself included, can hold that against you. Let me take a different slant\u2026there are numerous incidents where someone has done something horrible to a child and a parent has exacted revenge upon to and including murder. In many situations society had sided with the parent because at the end of the day no one wants to see harm to a child. All you did was tell your son what he needed to be comfortable. You didn\u2019t harm anyone, did nothing illegal and tbh I don\u2019t know if you can even say you lied. You may not believe what you said, but it doesn\u2019t make you right or wrong. What it makes you is a good father and you need to continue being a good father to your other children, which you already know of course because you recognize the alternative would harm them. As a middle aged guy who recently lost my dad and father in law let me tell you two things:\n\nI never thought much of or thought I would go to therapy. I\u2019m glad I did - please do take a look into for you and your family\u2019s well being.\n\nAnd finally, you got this.

The greatest souls that have ever set foot on planet earth since Jesus have made mistakes. We all agree we shouldn\u2019t lie, but we also will agree we all do at times. Sometimes it\u2019s our taxes, sometimes it\u2019s to our boss, sometimes it\u2019s little white lies as we like to call them that don\u2019t hurt anyone. Sometimes, we feel like it\u2019s the best thing to do. Not only because it\u2019s not hurting anything, but it\u2019s giving someone we love very much a little bit of comfort in a really hard time for them. Does that make it okay? I don\u2019t know to be honest. I do know one thing though. I would have done the same thing had I been in your shoes. Yea I claim to be a Christian. I try to do the right thing, sometimes it doesn\u2019t land that way. No sense in my trying to say I don\u2019t lie. Even if I could fool yall with it, God knows and he knows our heart. He knows our intentions. I didn\u2019t say that to make a mockery of you being an Atheist. I said it because I want you to know that I do believe there\u2019s a God. I believe he sees you and your situation. I\u2019m not trying to push anything man, but I really wish you\u2019d do me a favor and if it crosses your mind when you get a few, reach out. Try him. \u201cIf you\u2019re out there, if you really did create this huge universe, and die so that we can live eternally, show me. Help me. Take some of this hurt away so I can breathe\u201d message me sometime if you need a friend. I\u2019d love to be one. My heart goes out to you and I hope you can find this comfort. Much love from the hills of Kentucky.",

My point is that either he is no longer suffering or he exists in a way that this white lie is irrelevant to him.

I watched my mom pass away when I was about 4 years old. I know these are different situations, but throughout my life, when I think of her, what it'd be like if she were here, how things would be different, what our relationship would be like, etc., I was confused and sometimes it'd year me up. \n\nUntil one day I realized that, although she may not be able to speak to me, she wouldn't want me to be sad forever. I believe that not a single person that has passed wants us to dwell on them and ruin our lives beating ourselves up. I imagine that they want us to be happy, successful in our relationships and in life in general and wants us to live the best we can. What would you say if you went first? \"I love you. I'll always love you. Do your best. Don't worry about me. It's ok. I'll always love you.\" I think this is what anyone would say. I believe there's a lot of understanding that comes with death and that we have a duty to live out our lives in a positive way in honor of the ones who aren't here to do it with us.  \n\nThese days, when I think of her, I'm glad that I got those first 4 years with her. I know she wanted one more kid, and she had me to top it off. It's an honor to be here. I don't think of her quite as much as I used to, but I think that's ok. She'd understand.

Consider talking to a psychic medium. \n\nStart here. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@ChannelingErikOfficial](https://www.youtube.com/@ChannelingErikOfficial)\n\nPick a PM that resonates with you and book a reading. \n\nIf nothing else, work on forgiving yourself.

You are not a horrible person for making your son feel comfortable and less scared whilst he was literally on his death bed.

I like to think when we die we kinda become \u201call knowing\u201d so that being said, your son will understand your motive behind the lie and would thank you for making his last thoughts happy ones, knowing he gets to be with his dad again. \nTherapy is always a good place to start, just so you can release these thoughts that you are ruminating over, to a stranger that will not judge you and will hopefully have a positive impact on your wellbeing. \nI sincerely wish you and your family find peace one day. You are not an evil person, you are a father who has been through the trauma of not only losing a child but watching them battle cancer whilst still having a wife (assumed) and kids to think about. You deserve to be kind to yourself. Truly.\n\nEdit: spelling",

If there is a heaven, you relieved him of his mental anguish, allowing him to believe in what is to be his future. \n\nIf heaven isn't real, you alleviated a dying child of mental anguish he otherwise would have suffered. He already was getting a raw deal from the universe, so you providing comfort for your kid is what your job was.\n\nYea, it doesn't feel good, but a lot of times, I have to remind myself, \"suck it up buttercup, this isn't about you.\"\n\nI used to take care of dying people and dementia/alzheimers patients....I used to tell them the brutal honest truth, as I understood it, when they would ask and they would go through pain and forget and rinse and repeat. \n\nAnd I'd keep telling them truths as I knew them because I thought w the raw hand they are dealt they deserve the truth.....\n\nNo, that just made me feel fine not lying to them. Do what is right for the person and provide what poor can provide them when they need it. So I'd start telling them their family wasn't dead they are at work or school or something. I'd talk w them about the Beatles and Marvin Gay as if they hadn't met untimely ends. (You know what I mean). I wouldn't make them suffer through their reality. I gave them what they needed to find comfort in discomfort. To find some sort of hope in pure horrid despair.\n\nYou dealt w something that no one can imagine. I have a friend whose child has leukemia, then survived only to die later from cancer. I know someone whose child was murdered in daylight on the street, no jail time. I know another person who child was assaulted by family and trusted people for her childhood, so she became a raging addict, developed major health issues to fight through all of it and get sober and volunteer and care for ppl that are vulnerable ONLY FOR the 20 yr old daughter to die in the middle of the night alone, because of somethin I'd rather not get into. \n\nPpl will try to say, \"im sorry for your loss,\" or \"they ate in a better place now.\" God, that shit pissed me off to hear. The only thing that didn't make me want to rage is when someone just said \"......hey....that fuckin SUCKS\". So...hey man....that fuckin sucks. \n\nThe world has a general understanding of the rules and ways to deal w things... but what you've experienced is outside the realm of the life template society sells us...so...props to you for going through it. Props to you for continuing to live. Props to you for sharing and considering our words, if you do (therapy, please (trauma, grief, cbt, dbt, etc). But most of all, props to you for parenting when life did your family so dirty. Thank you for staying alive for your kids. Thank you for being the parent your kid needed in their last moments.\n\nIm coming off crazy and not making sense, coherently nor concisely. My sincerest apologies.\n\nThanks for existing.\n\n\nGood luck w your life, healing and to your family.\n\n\ud83d\udc9c\ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udda4\n\n\n\n\n\nHey side note: sorry for speaking on your real ass trauma like I know shit about it, i dont.

I wouldn't wish the loss of a child on anyone in the world. \nOP, I know say u don't believe in God. When my dad and brother committed suicide when I was 17, I hated God. I would verbally curse him, say he wasn't real and I genuinely felt betrayed, targeted, unloved, treated unfairly.. i stopped caring about everything. Then I got pregnant with my son.. when he was born, well, actually not right when he was born.. but not long after, I realized that he didn't do all the terrible things that hurt me.. he is who got me thru them. The things I endured shouldve made me hit absolute rock bottom.. but something always swooped in last second before impact and saved me. Yes, I wish that he could've just not let the tragedies happen in the first place, but I don't question that.  Bad and horrible and even gruesome things are going to happen to ppl every day.. every second.. to someone, somewhere. We don't mostly ever think about it or we have an 'it won't happen to me' kinda take on it.. but just like it happens to them,  it could be any of us. That's why God tells us to love one another.. Carry one another, have compassion,  help eachother.. cuz one-day we could be the one that lost so much that our faith is lost along with it. My heart goes out to u and i absolutely know that changes nothing in reality. But I love you and and my heart genuinely feels sorrow for yours. I hope u find your way back to God because he never left you.. he isn't a source of pain. He is a source of the greatest love.. just remember.. he GAVE his son for us... GAVE.. not one of us would  do that.. the love we have for our children is the greatest love imaginable to us.. he loves us more than that. U lost your son... and God lost a son... you. He can relate more than u can imagine.  He is real and he knows your heart.  He knows your hurt. And I believe your son is in heaven with him and that there are no feelings of fear or loneliness there. He knows that he will with his family again. And the world is a terrible place.. your son is in the most beautiful place.. i believe if we knew how heaven was then we wouldn't want to he here.. rather we would want to be there.",

Maybe there is one you went with him, and maybe there is another one he recovered and stayed with you. Therapy could help you process this, even if takes time and the process is not linear. Instead of dying for the one who can\u2019t be physically here, you can find the strength to live for him and the other two kids you still have. Remember that even if he is now resting, there were memories and parts of you with him. He wasn\u2019t alone. You also have the memories and parts of him with you still, so you will always be together in some kind of way.",

BUT movie messages CAN help and if there's one movie this makes me think of that might genuinely bring you just enough closure to push yourself into therapy/other helpful tools for mental health, then id suggest PLEASE watching 'The Invention of Lying'.  Its a 2009 film, im Canadian and its available on Netflix for me.  I'm sure there's plenty of ways to watch it for free too.  But genuinely this movie might help get you that bit of understanding of why you did it but also why its okay.  It's based on God being fake in their world to begin with, and a man essentially makes up the thought of heaven and God while his mother is dying.  Everyone believes he's heard from another because in this world no one has ever told a lie until that man did.  Its a very very wonderful film that shows why we lie and why its impossible to live in a happy world free of lies.  The overly static world we open to feels fake, and like something I'd never wanna be apart of.  Like willy Wonka's oompa loompas did their dance n song all day n long kinda vibe.  Too happy.  Point is, I hope you get help.  Get therapy.  Watch this movie n relax.  Underatand what you did is okay.",

Then my brother, my only sibling, died six years later from a ruptured aorta which pretty much left everything between me and my mom.\n\nI had started dating this girl for a couple of years. We talked about our future together and I started to become slightly bothered by her \"dream\" to be a SAHM. I make good money and get money from a trust fund but I'm not \"rich.\"\n\nMy mom died two weeks after being diagnosed with cancer last year. It was surreal. I'm the only person left in my immediate family and I'm only 36.\n\nI had moved out of state and have no interest in living in my childhood home. I put it up for sale and got 2 million (in Los Angeles). All of a sudden my girlfriend wanted to get married. It rubbed me the wrong way. It felt like she was trying to secure her future. Whereas I'm mourning, she's talking about taking a luxurious vacation that I know she can't afford but I can. Like I'm suppose to thank her for suggesting that I take her to Bali?\n\nI tested her and said that even if we get married, my family's money would stay with me. She got mad. She made all these plans of getting married, having kids and being a housewife whereas I just finance it. And if I died, then everything my parents worked for would go to her.\n\nI told her we needed to break up. She accused me of picking money over her and I told her she cared more about my money than me.\n\nThe truth is that if she had not tried to insert herself into my inheritance and let me mourn and supported me then we'd still be together.\n\nEdit: I put myself in her shoes and said that would be a wonderful thing to stay home with your kids and not worry about money. I wished I had kids because that's what I would do now.\n\nEdit: Regarding my health, I'm okay. My dad did pass away from a heart attack at 46. He was an asshole who knew he was high risk but didn't eat healthy and wasn't physically active. Also he ignored warning signs.\n\nMy brother didn't die from a heart attack. He was born with a defect that required a stent and regular checkups. My brother didn't do that. Had he done that then they would had saw that his stent was leaking. He didn't go to the doctor because he didn't want to be lectured on his weight.\n\nI get my regular physical and everything is fine but I could lose some weight. Aside from my sweet tooth, I'm healthy. I don't even drink coffee and workout 4x a week. ",

And their kids, our grandkids wouod inherit it. Even if I pass away, it goes strictly to the children. Plus if we divorce, you leave the marriage with whatever you came in with. Anything afterwards stays with me since I\u2019m the one financing it. So take it or leave it, but that\u2019s the prenup agreement if you want to marry me.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019ll 100% would of made her gasp, but make her realize no matter what happens, she isn\u2019t entitled to ANYTHING from the trust and the kids by 18, get a small stipend every month.\n\nAnyway, keep this idea in mind when going forward as well. Revisit the trust agreement with a lawyer to rework iron clad protection if you pass away and can make sure anyone who spends their life with you, can\u2019t easily get their hands on it.\n\nAlso? Do what my grandfather did if you want to use the left over money for positive reasons. Pick a school that matters to you. Set up a scholarship and have a $5,000-$10,000 amount. You get to pick from the slew of students who submit and help them get to college a bit easier financially who can\u2019t afford it. \n\nSomething to think over in case you haven\u2019t figured out how to allocate the sale of the house with those funds.",

He should want the best for his family and take pride if he is able to provide that for them. Many cant and wish they could.

And honestly, it\u2019s a little messed up that we force people to make big financial decisions while they\u2019re still grieving. \n\nBut just keep in mind that they 100% absolutely *wanted* you to have that money, and their hope was to make life a little easier during this difficult time. I know it\u2019s impossible to not feel how you feel, just try to remember that when you do. I hope it helps a little.",

I could imagine if this is a joint dream that she thought that he also supported, putting some pressure on it to happen soon would make more sense.

I could imagine after all of that stress, months of financials and planning and grieving, offering to plan a vacation might be a nice thing to get away from all the stress, especially if it's been some time, but I could understand since it sounds like she can't afford it herself how that just adds to the frustration.

I don't know if he was always like this and kept it hidden, or if something broke in him when his wife died, but for the last ten years, since she died, he's made it pretty clear he doesn't give a shit about maintaining relations with any of her relatives. For the record, he has never had a reason to suspect foul play, and the only money mom gets from grandma is because she buys groceries for her.\n\nIt's straining our relationship with my cousin as well. She keeps defending him and saying it's a misunderstanding, but this asshole tricked grandma into letting him into her online banking account, and went through her transactions line by line, asking if she knew where her money was going.\n\nAnd this guy is a retired chemical engineer who owns a house in the second largest city in Sweden.

The plan is that when my friend is done with her maternity leave, she will go back to work and her husband will be a SAHD because her earning potential is higher than his and it makes sense for their family. Personally, I would not want a house spouse because I hate working out of the home and would be jealous to be frank. Societally, women usually make less money than men, and so it could be stressful to a low earner to try and support a whole family with only 1 income (regardless of gender), and also the precedent had been set for generations that women took care of the family, but specifically that men were the \"bread winners\" so even if the wife also worked, the husband was making more.  It's 2 founded for why there's a stigma against SAHD but not the same ones for SAHM.",

She had planned everything, including her funeral right down to the music. She also did her will and made sure it was current. Now, my mum is one of 13, but at that time, one had died I think in the 60s or early 70s, and before she died (car accident) she'd fallen pregnant out of wedlock and had a child. Since she was a single mum in the 60s and my grandparents were very strictly Catholic, my grandparents took that baby in, and he is my uncle. They raised him and loved him as their own until the day they died, and that one uncle is actually just lovely. Him and his whole family are just great, happy, positive people, and the love he has for his wife... anyway. \n\nSo, with that context, my nan didn't have much, but did own a home, a modest 4 bedroom 1 bathroom, nothing fancy, on a fair amount of land. My nan wanted them to sell the home, and split the money evenly between them all, except if someone owed her money, that amount was taken off of what they were getting and split between the others. \n\nWell wouldn't you know it, my uncle, the lovely, caring, amazing dude who had been their sibling for idk, at least 50 years at this point, half of the family suddenly said \"well he isn't her birth son, so he shouldn't get anything bc grandkids aren't getting anything\". \n\nWhen I heard about this, I was so heartbroken for him. I mean, it was never a secret he was adopted. But no one ever mentioned it, it was always \"can you go tell uncle x\" or \"uncle is coming over later\" type thing. They even had this argument, iirc, in front of him. Everyone was mentioned in the will for clarity and he was mentioned. \n\nIn the end, he did get his share, and in true form, he forgave everyone saying he wasn't their sibling in this already hard time for everyone, and has seemingly forgotten about it. But it was fucking disgusting",

We went home for the night with clear plans of the morning and we didn't even make it home before she passed away. In some ways I'm glad, we got to say our goodbyes thinking we'd see her tomorrow, but they were genuine and true and caring, and we didn't have to see her final breaths, although we'd had some signs that had us worrying. Everyone in her immediate family was there to say goodbye within 20 minutes of her passing, and we turned back around and waited for the medical team to come get her. And she was ready, truly, to go. She'd made up her mind. \n\nWe, well, weren't. But death is much more about the living left behind in the end.",

            "text": "I found out when she was at work on Monday (I work from home) and her ipad kept making notification sounds. I went to go turn it off and when I opened it I saw all of the Facebook notifications from some dude and they were definitely flirtatious and sexual so I read through them. I couldn't believe it she was 100% cheating on me with this guy for several months now. All those late nights at work or outings with girlfriends must have been this dude. I didn't even know we were having problems or she wasn't happy. I had even bought a ring and was planning to propose. I was crushed and still am. I can't reconcile it. I went to the jewelry store and returned the ring and made arrangements to take today off of work. She's the primary on the lease so I'm just moving into a buddy's house and I rented a uhaul and I'm loading everything I own in there and leaving. I also took some of the furniture we bought together like our couches and our new TV. I have the receipts and they were bought with my card however she did give me half of the money. Is that fair? No, but neither is me being cheated on so I think this balances it out a bit and I don't feel particularly bad about looting the more expensive electronics and furniture we bought together given the circumstances. Also I figure her new boyfriend can help her refurnish the apartment.\n\nI wrote her a note telling her I found out about all of her meetups with this other guy and that I'm not coming back. It legitimately bothers me how easy it is for her to do this level of betrayal and be a good enough actress to where I genuinely never suspected anything. I legitimately can't ever trust her again.\n\nEdit: I'm overwhelmed by how many positive comments there are and how many dms I've gotten. Thank you all so much. It means more than you think ot does. I'm doing okay just sitting at my buddy's house and I just finished unpacking. My phone would probably be blowing up by now if I didn't block her number. I just don't want to talk to her at all. I'm not interested in trying to rub it in or be petty I just want her out of my life and to move on.\n\nUpdate: I've heard from a few people that my ex is absolute basket case right now and going apeshit trying to find me. She found the number for my brother's office who is an attorney and she went off on him and he told her if she contacts him or myself again he'll file for a restraining order and hung up on her. One of her friends texted me and said what I did to her was cruel. I told her I was ready to marry her and wanted to spend the rest of my life with her and she was fucking some guy behind my back for over 6 months as far as I can tell. What I did might have been cruel but it isn't as cruel as what she did to me. A buddy of mine and his girlfriend said saw her at a bar getting shit faced and breaking down until she got bounced. I don't take pleasure in it I just want her to stay gone.",

Her infidelity needs to be dragged out of the dark and cast into the sunlight. Let it burn in the light of day.\n\nSend yourself copies or save photos of all their messages as evidence. \n\nBlock her on everything before she gets home tonight.\n\nAgenda for tonight: \n\nYou need to put her on blast for being a cheater. Call both your parents and let them know what you found. Thank her parents for accepting you into the family and for being kind to you. \n\nThen, message both your families, friends, and mutual friends with the evidence that she was cheating on you. Tell them you left her and are ghosting her. \n\nDo this to get ahead of her. If you don't do this, she will spin this around and make you out to be the bad guy.\n\nTomorrow's agenda:\n\nMake an appointment with your doctor for an STD check. Go hang out with friends and family. \n\nNext week's agenda\n\nTalk to a therapist or a doctor if you need help with anxiety or depression. Hit the gym daily. Lose yourself in your work or school.  Eat, work, gym, sleep, repeat.\n\nFocus on becoming the best version of yourself.  Make her thirsty for you and go live your best life. \n\nHer cheating is a sign of a deep moral weakness in her character. You should feel no shame. I know you are in pain and will be for some time, but the silver lining is that you found out about this when she was your GF, not your wife. It's harder to remove cheaters from your life when you are married and have children.\n\nSo, keep your chin up, King. None of this is your fault. You are handling this like a boss. Stay strong. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

I confronted her and she plainly admitted it. We had plans to take a trip to Disneyland Paris with the kids (hers, from a previous relationship), but I just said I couldn't fake a week with her and the kids pretending to be fine while we had basically broken up. I didn't go on the trip and took the week she was gone to clear my stuff out and moved to a friends house for over a year before landing back on my feet. \n\nThe house was our property so we ended up going through a shitload of paperwork to get it all figured out and it's only  then I realised that she was completely prepared for everything to end this way. \n\nAs I was often struggling with finances during our time together, she apparently found ways to put money aside on her personal account (even though we made about the same) and when it was time to split purchases/doe valuations she just pulled out a long and detailed list of everything from the past 2 years. Talk about being prepared. I've learned a lot since that time, and so will you.\n\nTry not to let anger or grief take the upper hand, it won't help you in the least. Keep on looking forward and focus on things that will actually benefit you in the long run.\n\nWill there be times you will miss her or think back about the good times you had? Yes, of course, and there's nothing wrong with it. She'll have a part in shaping who you are/will become and as long as you grow/become better, you take that shitty experience and use it for good.\n\nGood luck!",

These cheaters basically take people for granted and let their selfish desires overcome the \u201clove\u201d  they have for their partners. They rationalize everything is okay and pretend nothing is wrong, hence why they acted so naturally. Additionally, if you find out and take them back, you unknowingly reward their shitty behavior, making them lose a little more respect for you, and probably do the same. Obviously, there are always exceptions, but I personally think it is better to move on and have them grow with someone else.\n\nYour ex sounds like this to a tee, so I really do feel for you. That being said, you did the right move because you are showing her you will not tolerate her bs and you can move on without her. Good for you!

I also fucked off that \u201cbest friend\u201d, sorry, but in my opinion, she\u2019s as worst as him. \n\nHe broke me in half for a few months but I was able to get back on my feet with the support of family and friends, but fuck it was hard. \n\nA friend of mine actually ended up seeing him at a bar a few weeks after I left and he \u201ccried\u201d to him confused about why I left. He was literally psychotic. \n\n7 years later and yeah he enters my mind here and there, with anger and betrayal, but I also think about how proud I am about closing that chapter in my life. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry OP. Feel free to reach out if you ever need to chat more.",

For me, it's the act of meeting and voicing forgiveness for the harm in the past and the promise that no harm will ever come between you ever again in the future.\n\nI always think back to the Amish parents who forgave their child's murderer in court. Intuitively, we comprehend the strength of will required to forgive the unforgivable, but it's fallen out of fashion. Most people these days are used to never forgiving, no matter how small the crime.\n\nBearing a grudge and holding it in forever is only harmful to the bearer. There's a phrase trying to recall me. ::googling:: \"Holding a grudge is like drinking poison and expecting your enemy to die.\"\n\nAll that said, I don't practice what I preach. I may die in resounding silence.\n\nI hope that OP finds peace and healing in whatever form they may take.",

The other day I was going through my old emails that I never replied to. It took hours but I finally made it down to around 2 years ago, the time of her suicide. \n\nI saw that a google doc was shared with me, titled \"I'm Sorry\". I didn't recognise the email, but I immediately recognised the profile picture as K. I immediately clicked on it, and read her suicide note.\n\nIt read: \"Hi (OP)! I hope you don't miss me too much, haha. I remember the first day I met you, and you were immediately welcoming and kind to me. You always were by my side, even when I was hurt. You got me flowers for valentines day, and showed me what true love is. I'm sorry I couldn't deal with it anymore. I love you so much, and I'm sorry if I couldn't say it enough while I was alive. I love you, and I want you to keep on going. You're one of the smartest people i've ever met, and I know one day you will be successful. One day, when you get married, settle down, and maybe have kids, tell them about me. And one day, when you've made peace with this decision, I want you to go out and treat yourself to waffles. In memory of me. I love you, and I'm sorry.\"\n\nI guess I needed to get this off my chest. I haven't gotten any work done at all today, and I've just been crying in my room. I don't know how I missed this email, but I'm really upset that I did. She was such a sweet soul, and I still love her after all these years.  \n",

She died when I was 19, though it wasn\u2019t suicide.\n\nAs I was placing the gift on a shelf, an envelope fell out. I had no idea it was even in there.\n\nIt was just a really sweet letter from her. And for a moment, it was like she was alive again, like I was hearing her voice and talking to her again for the first time in years. \n\nAnd it\u2019s hard to describe that feeling. I\u2019d like to say it brings a moment of happiness, but it honestly just gutted me. And I can imagine that feeling being even worse in your situation.\n\nK sounds so very sweet and like she loved you a lot. You were both very fortunate to have one another for the time that you did.\n\nPlease reach out to a therapist if you can. You don\u2019t have to cope with this alone.",

I've lost quite a number of people; my mom as I was holding her hand, best friends, like 20+ people I knew in High School. The older I get the more I realize how not in control we are of our lives and I realize how little of an impact I make on most people in my life. This is both horribly depressing while simultaneously being amazingly freeing. I treat life like kind of a joke where I'm just trying to make myself of others around me laugh, and it takes a very specific kind of person to laugh at some of the stuff I say. The reason I mention this is because all things are balanced on a duality in life and the irony is often where humor is found. This is not the end for you or anyone else I don't believe but try and make what you think about the end of life a positive subjective experience while knowing how beautiful life is if it's the only one we get to live. How much more everything is unique and special I would even use the word beautiful in the most pure sense I possibly can. Anyway, everything is a double edged sword, it's important not to blame yourself for the actions of others, and always try and love someone for the good moments you had with them (even sometimes when you haven't) instead of focusing on what could have been done. Saying it doesn't really feel like it means anything to me but I am getting better about accepting death and that's never something I'd thought I'd say at 39. I might add to this later for my own benefit because I have a lot to say on this topic. If you read this please try to pose me with difficult questions so I can better understand my own perspective, it's been developing for over a decade now.",

His wife only had to get involved  in that one question because his collaborator didn't know it and therefore didn't help.\n\nHe got to \u00a34,000 by the end of the first episode he appeared in, having already used two lifelines and looking like a pretty average player. Between shows, he spoke with his collaborator and obviously came up with the scheme for the next recording. This was 2001, so it was not a foolproof plan - they couldn't use Google or anything - the guy helping was just a really knowledgeable quizzer who had tried to get on a few times before and actually would make it into the hotseat afterwards - ironically only winning \u00a31,000.\n\nProducers became more suspicious as the show went on, but some admitted that if it had ended before the million, he may have gotten away with it. After winning, he and his wife were heard arguing in their dressing room, which was strange for a newly minted millionaire couple (main theory is they planned to stop earlier so as not to arouse suspicion, but he got carried away - many shots of her in the audience towards the end she looks visibly frustrated and annoyed).\n\nLast fact (I promise) - his wife was also a contestant previously on the show, as was her brother - they both won \u00a332,000. So the whole show was a bit of a family obsession.\n\nSorry, this case has fascinated me in the past, and I watched a full documentary on it and read loads about it lol.",

Like my husband, Maya was also a misfit, came from a dysfunctional family, they became bestfs.\n\nWhen they were 15, Maya was gang r*ped by her step sister's boyfriend and classmates. She was badly injured, was in coma for 2 weeks.\n\nThe r*pists, as they were minor weren't jailed I believe, they got out with minor punishments .(This is the story I have heard from my husband and in laws)\n\nMaya committed suicide right after she woke up, and wrote only one letter of goodbye which was addressed to my husband.\n\nI had never read this letter as I wanted to preserve his privacy and it always felt too personal.\n\nOnto my story - I have been noticing weird things about my husband for a while.\n\n1) We had out first baby when we were 27, I wanted to wait a little before our second but my husband wanted one when he turned 30. He would mumble things like, it has to be 30, it should be at 30.\n\n2) At 30, I had my 2nd kid, a girl,  named her Maya, now I often find him hugging her and crying, asking an infant if he is doing a good job at being a father.\n\n3) We have to go on yearly vacations, even when our kids were babies and we were busy he forced us on a vacy.\n\n4) now that he is turning 35, he insist we buy a bigger house, again keeps mumbling 'the house is at 35.'\n\nWell I read the letter.\nIt was laminated and filed. He keeps it in the safe along with other imp docs such as house property...\n\nIt was a very sweet letter, basically thanked him for being there for her, and then she concluded it with wishing he lives this \"perfect life\"\n\nLife where he graduates at 24, marries at 26, has babies at 27 and 30, moves to a big house at 35, always goes on fancy vacy...\nEnd with him being 90 reading stories to his grandkids.\n\nShe also tells him to be a good father and husband, if he ever gets tired she wants him to think for her suffering bcuz of her family.\n\n\nNow that I have read everything, and know that my husband has been planning his entire life based on that letter, it feels soo weird. \n\nI had to tell someone",

He has obviously taken them extremely literal, which I can see is weird, but it's his way of dealing with his grief.\n\nAs others have said, he would benefit from therapy as it's clear he is holding on to that grief very tightly, but it's also good to understand that from his perspective, this is how he makes it up to her. \n\nIgnore those telling you that this is so weird that you should leave. They are so far off the mark, and frankly sound like they don't have a shred of empathy. \n\nIf you take this at face value, yes it is odd. But it's not scary. It's not threatening. It's just the only thing he can do for his lost friend. \n\nYou said your self you are happy, and that you love him because he is kind and thoughtful. He is doing all he can to give you the life most would dream of. \n\nThe only reason it's weird is because of the strictness of him doing it to a timeline. If she had wished all those things without adding the ages, you wouldn't have thought anything about this was weird at all.",

So many people set age goals for the house, kids, etc. And he probably spoke with the girl about his goals and their plans together. \n\nI thought it was going to get weird like he named the baby after her or thinks the baby was this girl re-incarnated or something.\n\nBut it's honestly a very sweet story, he just needs to process it all and kind of detach his wife and kids from the memory of this girl.\n\nThis girl would obviously be insanely proud of him. He doesn't need to keep hitting goals and doing it for her. \n\nMaybe in my mind this is getting cinematic lol, but he needs to have a final letting go process where he just shows her that he's done it all and she can rest easy knowing that she gave him that push in life, and he has set up his life in the perfect way. He's done it, and she doesn't need to keep watch anymore. She can give him some final approval. And now he can tie his goals to trying to impress just his wife and kids.",

I had a long history of fear of dog because I was bit as a kid. And this little lad could definitely feel it and was always gentle with me, especially when i would give him treats. I loved spoiling him with toys, cuddles, and treats. He got an autoimmune disease, and my bf had to put him down. We were there with him for the last moment, and it broke my heart. I shared with him all my love and care. Im crying even as im writing this. Will forever miss him as he left such a huge imprint on my heart.",

Just last month, I faced the incredibly tough decision to say goodbye to my tabby, who'd been my constant companion for nearly 14 years. The realization that her quality of life had deteriorated beyond what love could heal was devastating.  \n  \nI remember sitting on the floor of the exam room, her frail body nestled in a blanket. The vet, whose gentle demeanor offered some solace, gave us all the time we needed. I talked to her about all the sunny spots she had loved to nap in, the countless times she\u2019d ambush my unsuspecting feet, and the way she\u2019d demand attention with an insistent 'meow'.  \n  \nWhen it was time, I held her close, and she slipped away peacefully, knowing she was loved to the very end. It\u2019s a painful, raw moment I\u2019ll carry with me always, but I take comfort in knowing I was there for her, just as she had been for me through so many chapters of my life.  \n  \nTo all the vets who guide us through these final acts of love and to those who stand with their pets until the very end \u2013 your strength is remarkable. I am humbled by your stories and send my deepest gratitude for sharing them. Remember, it\u2019s not just about the last moments, but celebrating the beautiful journey we shared with our faithful friends.",

I\u2019d lost pets and family before but this was the first time I was actually going to be in the room when it happened and it was terrifying for me.

We needed to get her to another clinic with a bigger surgery room and better equipment, but there was no way she'd make the drive, so we just had the doctor put her out of her misery with as little pain as possible. She'd already urinated and deficated a few times, each time she'd died, and we decided it was kinder to let her go.\n\nWe take our other two dogs to visit the cemetery every year to pray for her and give offerings of her beloved dental chews.

My point being is even though she wasnt mine i loved that cat and someone just like you showing me my emotions were valid is what allowed me to put myself through the pain of helping her out of her suffering.

I\u2019ve had to put down so many of my pets in my life and for one of them my sister didn\u2019t want me to be in the room with him because I had just lost my best friend in a car accident and was traumatized by that death and I still regret not demanding I be with him. I begged the tech to hold his tail while he slipped away because I\u2019d hold it every night when we slept. I hope he forgives me and understands why I wasn\u2019t there. \n\nI make it my mission, no matter HOW bad it kills me inside, to be there while my babies slip away. I grew up with my mom having an aversion to death and thinking it\u2019s bad luck to be around death and I had to fight everything inside of me to get through that mindset. How can something I\u2019ve loved for their entire life\u2026suddenly be \u201cbad luck\u201d because they passed away? It didn\u2019t make sense to me and so I fought that mindset. Now, I\u2019m there and I lay with them for a while afterwards so I can accept it and understand it the best I can in the moment. \n\nI lost both of my dogs last year. One to kidney failure and one to heart failure. They were mama and daughter. Mama was 12 and daughter was 11. The daughter passed away first and her favorite thing to do was bask in the sun. After being at the emergency vet for 3 days, I knew it was time. I asked the vet if we could do it outside in the sun and we did. Brought her little bed outside, she closed her eyes taking in the sun that she loved. When it was time, I just spoke to her softly, told her she\u2019d take a nap and go on a really exciting adventure. I laid with her the whole time. A few months later I had to put her mama down from heart failure and I bonded with her even more than I had throughout her entire life. She died in September and I still cry my eyes out missing both of them. I don\u2019t have any dogs anymore. I want one again but I\u2019m not ready. I have my cats for the time being. But man\u2026losing my girls was tough. \n\nThank you for loving our pets if we can\u2019t be in the room with them for some reason. It means so much\u2026thank you \u2764\ufe0f \n\n[**Here\u2019s a painting of my girls**](https://imgur.com/a/XmI1sD0) that my friend painted for me as a birthday gift. It was a surprise and I\u2019d be lying if I said I don\u2019t cry regularly at the painting. It captures them so perfectly\u2026I miss my Bella and Sapha \ud83d\udc94",

                    "body": "I was the one who made the call. For over 10 years I had been away living my 20-something life, knowing I couldn't have her live with me (single, frequent travel, broke, etc), but when I arrived at dad's that Saturday, I knew it was the last visit where I would see her. We called in the vet to get them to come in on the holiday Monday for our goodbye, and tried to enjoy the next 40 hrs. \n\nHad to call my brother to tell him (he was across the country), and my gf (wife now), sister, and mom were there. I think horror was the only thing that kept me calm until it was all over.\n\nI don't remember the after, really. I don't even remember what year it was anymore. Over ten years ago, that's all. I remember the physical pain in my chest, my vision being so sharp and surreal, an unreal place where I had just killed my good sweet girl. I remember the dam breaking and just crying, hanging off of my poor GF. The guilt made it so much worse.\n\nI tell myself it really was my call to make (only dad would have dared to make that call in my stead). But that meant I had the responsibility to *her*, so I couldn't look away from that. The end was coming fast already, but it was going to get much worse before then. I had to save her from that, and the strong possibility of ending alone while dad was at work, or of him taking her to the vet solo and having the vet do it behind closed doors while he waits. I saved my mom and sister the agony of making the decision. I even saved dad from being an asshole again, like when he put down my sister's sick cat while. The only person I couldn't save from anything was me.\n\nAnd fuck me I don't care if it sounds like martyr bullshit. I zoomed in from out of town and within a hour I *told* my whole family \"we're killing our beloved dog in two days\". If I have to live with that, then dammit I get to hold onto that martyr shit to help myself feel better about it.\n\nIt haunts me still sometimes when I think about her. My kids are young, born long after. I have a couple pics, but they don't ask me much about her because they know it makes me sad, it's a coin flip as to whether I'll cry. \n\nIt's not really *healing*, just a ten year old scab that still picks off too easily. I have a hard time with the idea of it ever really healing tho. I don't want it to not hurt? Is that stupid? Is that the guilt talking? I'm not sure if it matters. I don't enjoy the pain, but the fact that it's there is reassuring after. It's like \"It's real. She was here and she mattered so fucking much. I loved her and she was my good girl to the end.\"",

I had gotten her around 3-4 I think, the house I lived in at the time was dramatic, borderline abuse I\u2019d say, she stayed with me in my closet and slept with me in there. Now I\u2019m 18, taking a drivers test soon, graduating from highschool, have a super loving bf who is always there for me and I am for him. I can\u2019t help but to constantly think she knew I was taken care of now. \n  Apparently everything in her little body was so bad they had to gas her before they could do anything and because of that we couldn\u2019t be in the room. It makes me happy knowing they\u2019re all so taken care of behind the scenes. She was an amazing little chihuahua, pretty blue murle that was way too overpriced, \u201cpure bred our ass\u201d, $800 for a semi chihuhini.\n   I hope all of you who have either lost a pet or work with pets that have to get put down, have an amazing life and get enough time with your families, fluffy family members and lastly enough time to have to yourselves.

It\u2019s still pretty raw, but it\u2019s like this post was written at exactly the right time that I needed it, so I thank you.",

She had malformed kidneys (we didn\u2019t know) and free fluid in her abdomen and no insurance. Exploratory surgery with a very low  probability of survival was estimated at 20-30k. It was the most gut wrenching thing we had ever done. \n\nOur 5 year old husky. He started throwing up food after routine dental work. Had an EGD, had meds, improved a bit, would still throw up occasionally. And all of a sudden it came back worse and he was refusing to eat even rice and chicken. Lots and lots of vet visits. Had an ultrasound and some blood work done at another clinic with the right equipment. Were able to obtain some samples for initial (but not definitive) testing. But his abdomen was filled with a fungus. It was affecting everything. Lab came back with 2 possibilities, with less than 5% survival, on extremely expensive meds for over a year, and a feeding tube for months at minimum until/if his stomach healed. We discussed with our vet and the vets at the other clinic quality of life because at this point he was miserable. They sent us home to think about it and we preemptively scheduled a scope to get proper samples for 2 days later (the next opening). Within 1 day we were back because he wasn\u2019t drinking water anymore and kept going outside and pacing and coming in and going right back out. We knew it was time. Husband stayed with me this time. We laid on the floor and gave kisses and pets and bawled our eyes out the whole time. I threw up that time. \n\nThank you for what you do. Thank you for caring for those when the owners can\u2019t for whatever reason. I miss our babies.",

She was my best friend in a neglectful, abusive environment for 7+ years. I only found out about her passing because when I turned eighteen and began getting into contact with people from my youth, a cousin of a family I was apart of actually had their mom take the cat when the home was repossessed.   \n  \nSo, at the very least she had good people who tried to give her the best elder years she could have...but, I remember what she acted like when I visited that home three years after being taken away the first time. She acted like she hadn't seen me in eons. She wouldn't leave my side. She was probably under the impression that I was there to stay, or there to take her with me. I wasn't allowed to do either.   \n  \nI was just a kid. I didn't have that autonomy over my life...and when I finally did, she lost the autonomy over hers. What little she had, anyway...I miss her to this day. Almost twenty years after adopting her as a child. I hope that they stayed with her. I wish I could have. I'm so thankful to those of you in the workforce who offer whatever comforts you can for those of us who can't.   \n  \nPlease, cry.   \nFeel.   \n  \nIt's okay to mourn a stranger.   \nIt's okay to grieve for what you never were able to have, or never could have again.   \n  \nDon't take this message as an insult to those of us who can't be there, but as a comfort that someone was.   \nTo this day, I haven't had another pet. Some roommate's cats have gotten attached to me, and I love them, but I could never compare them and I don't think getting another pet myself would make me feel better over having to abandon someone so integral to my childhood. She was royalty, and I hope that she went quietly and in loving arms.   \n  \nShe deserved to rest after waiting for me so long...\n\nAgain.   \n  \nThank you.\n\nSincerely.",

I scheduled the vet to come to our house, and while I dreaded the thought of those final moments, the idea of not being there never crossed my mind.  \n  \nWe put her favorite blanket in the garden, where she had spent countless sunny days chasing butterflies and short-lived raindrops. As the vet prepared, I lay there with her, sharing stories of her adventures, her silly antics, and whispered promises of endless treats and belly rubs on the other side.  \n  \nShe passed peacefully, bathed in the familiar scents of home and the warmth of the afternoon sun, hearing nothing but loving reassurances. Mourning her has been incredibly hard, but I take solace in knowing her last moments were as comfortable as we could make them.  \n  \nIt's never easy, yet I truly believe these final acts of love are our last gifts to them\u2014a dignified farewell.

He was a gorgeous rare snowshoe with ice blue eyes and spotted brown and white\u2026 but he wouldn\u2019t let me get close to him for years. She\u2019d always tell me how affectionate the cat was when no one was around but it was hard to believe. \nThen she called to tell me she was sick. Pancreatic cancer, she was dying. \nI\u2019d go to her every other day and check on her, take her to her appointments. I\u2019d feed the cat and change his litter but he still wouldn\u2019t let me look at him, let alone touch him. \nWhen she became very ill\u2026 I\u2019d come to her home, at that point I had the key to get in. The cat would now wait for me on the other side of the door and lead me to her. I remember going to her bedside and the cat would hop up on the bed beside her also. Something he never did before because he wasn\u2019t allowed on the bed but that cat loved her so much. \nAfter her passing, I took that cat into my home. He was already so old (17 years) and so sad. But we loved that cat. He was always so afraid of men in his life (prior abuse before my mom adopted him) yet at the end of his life he loved my husband (and I) so much. I\u2019d come home from work or walk through the living room to see my husband and the cat hanging out on the couch with their arms around one another. \nWe had to put that cat down several years ago. I believe our veterinarian treated Hershey with dignity. I was there and the doctor and staff were the greatest. We took his remains home\u2026 my husband had already dug a hole and buried him in our back yard. Added a stone with his namesake right next to the burial stone of the dog who belonged to the previous owners of our house. \nYou do amazing work and many of us appreciate you. Believe me.",

My dog was VERY territorial and was bigger than me so I always feared taking him to strange places and him going crazy on others. He was a almost 10 year old, 175lb English Mastiff and he had bone cancer. The vet came to the house and gave the first injection through the pet gate to get him calm/sleepy, she then went out to her car until we got him settled in the living room and they came back inside to give the second dose. I will forever be grateful that we did it this way, it was much less stress for him and for me. My 30 year old son and I were by his side until the very end. They did remove the body from our home because he was truthfully too large to bury in our yard, and a week later they sent us his paw prints to remember him by. Putting him down was probably the most difficult decision, as a pet owner, that I have ever had to do but I never considered letting someone else take my place at his side for his final moments. It has been just over a year and I miss that big, smelly boy so much. \n\nOnce in the past we did have a family member stay with a dog we had to put down. Our kids loved the dog and it would have been too much for them at the time (we had just lost their Grandma to cancer), so my younger sister took her to the vet while we were out of state to have our Alaskan Malamute put down while we were gone. I regret not being there for the dog, but I don't regret keeping it from our kids for a little while.",

It might seem shallow to mention his looks, but he literally was my type that people had teased me about my entire life- my family are all farmers and had always made fun of me for liking \u2018nerds\u2019\u2026 He quickly introduced himself as \u201cSterling\u201d and asked if he could be of any assistance; so I told him all about my wedding and he showed me what the store had to offer. He confidently told me that he\u2019d helped with hundreds of weddings and fitted thousands of suits, and true to his word he helped me pick the perfect ensemble.  We chatted a bit about what theme I wanted, colors, etc. Turns out, we both loved vintage style, and had a lot of similar interests. I left the store that day very pleased to have gotten the perfect suits ordered and called my fianc\u00e9 to tell him the good news. \n\nFast forward a few months, and somewhere in the midst of all the planning, Marcus had been acting strange. He had been arguing with me nonstop over everything, getting upset when I wanted to spend time with my family, going through my phone when I slept, and on one occasion he even refused to give me my own car keys so that I could go home\u2026 It wasn\u2019t long before I found out that he was cheating on me with one of my friends, they had been texting back and forth for a few weeks and had met up already\u2026 I was utterly devastated, and thankfully had the mind to break things off, for good. Losing Marcus hurt, but being betrayed by my friend felt like a gut punch.  \n\nA few more months went by, the loneliness and anger had definitely set in, and, wanting someone to talk to, I decided eh what the heck and downloaded Tinder on a whim. I had literally only been using the app for about an hour when a familiar face popped up. Yep. \u201cSterling\u201d. I will literally never forget reading \u201cOxford dictionary in the streets, urban dictionary in the sheets.\u201d on his profile. Corny? Yes. Did I laugh though? Also yes. I swiped right, and to my surprise, he had done the same. From there, we exchanged numbers, spent nearly 6 hours talking on the phone that night, and met up just a few short days later.. Sterling was definitely surprised when I told him about what happened with Marcus, but he was incredibly sympathetic and respectful. We hit it off right away, and when I was ready, we started dating. We\u2019ve been inseparable ever since, and are now married with our 3 month old baby girl laying next to me as I type this. I\u2019m happier than I ever imagined possible, and although our story is a little different, l believe I\u2019ve truly found my soulmate :) \n\nEDIT: For those who had shown interest, Sterling gave permission to drop a little face reveal, unfortunately I have no photos of the legendary mustache he used to have \ud83d\ude2d please help me convince him to grow it back \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/u/SnooStories4091/s/5EVYDEKLum",

Jayden has a really strict mom, so he told her he was sleeping over at my place. She needed a parent\u2019s number, so he just gave her my number pretending it\u2019s my dad\u2019s.\r  \n\r  \nShe ended up calling to make sure it was okay for him to sleep over, so deepened my voice pretending to be my dad and told her that it was fine. She apologized for seeming like a helicopter mom and said she\u2019s just new to being a single parent. My dad is a single parent too, so I thought it\u2019d be nice to reassure her that it gets better. Later that night I got a text from her saying, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know there are other single parents out there :)\u201d Being the drunk dumbass I was I responded, \u201cDefinitely, I\u2019m here if you need someone :)\u201d\r  \n\r  \nIt has been two months and not a single week has passed where she hasn\u2019t texted me. Last night she tried to facetime me saying that it was \u201ca particularly lonely night,\u201d and when I said I was busy \u201cworking\u201d she sent a nude saying, \u201cAre you too busy for this?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI don\u2019t know how to tell Jayden his mom is sexting me, he doesn\u2019t even know she contacted me after the call. I can\u2019t just drop off either, Jayden and I are in theater together and we have a show coming up that both of our parents are going to. I need help. Please.\r  \n",

When you aren't, you create a complicated life for yourself. \n\nShe may have committed a crime by sending a nude photo to you. You depending upon your state may have committed a crime by enticing her to engage in sexual behaviors with a false belief about your identity. That is on the books in some states. In some states it is legally rape to have sex with a girl who consents when she thinks you're someone else for example; it isnt impossible for a prosecutor to spin this into a form of sexual assault, it goes without saying that you would be wise to be considerate and respectful and never blackmail her or there isn't really any saving you legally.\n\nDon't be dishonest. You aren't going to get to fuck her and if you do, it won't be great for your friendship. You made a mess. Don't do this again.\n\nThat all said, now maybe you should speak to your dad or he to his mom.",

I asked them to stop and they wouldn't. It felt like it went for ever. After I left and went to stay with my mom. I have been with my boyfriend for 8 months and when I spoke to him about this after he says they were just joking around and I was having fun. But I don't remember having fun I was crying.

If you cannot bring yourself to do this, at the very least. Run. Far and fast from this monster. That IS what he is, by the way... he is NOT a \"man\" or a \"boy\", or your boyfriend to you. He does not love you. He was willing to share what you wanted to share with only him, with his friend. He thinks of you as a \"thing\" to be shared and used to his liking at his discretion. Reporting him to police will stop him from hurting others, but you must first stop him from hurting you. And to do that.... Run. \n\nI know this is difficult to read/hear from a complete stranger. I am lucky to have survived the years of abuse I suffered at the hands of my abuser. Please, PLEASE. Leave him and do not go back. I promise you, as much as it hurts now, you will be happier having left in time. In a few years time, he will be nothing more than a bad memory, and you will still be alive and enjoying your life, not living under the thumb of person who no longer views you as a person, but a thing to possess and use. Please, leave him. For all of those that never got the chance to, for your life, for yourself. ~Jaclyn",

There is no way a bf that cared about you could do that, regardless of drugs. In fact for most, MDMA makes you more empathetic and caring. If he was able to be this cruel on mdma I can't imagine what lurks in his head. \n\nReporting them to law enforcement would be 100% rational and justified. But that can be hard and is ultimately just up to you. But, I'm so sorry that's what happened here, rape. It's entirely up to you how to proceed. \n\nEthically the ball is in your court now. Report em or not but I would certainly immediately remove them from my life. \n\nWhether you report is up to you. But, I would strongly suggest dumping that mother fucker and terminating that othrt friendship. And, obviously, NEVER do drugs with them again.

Do yourself and anyone else after you the favour and let authorities know what these two creatures have done (I don\u2019t know your - now hopefully ex! - boyfriend, but doing this to you is enough for me to demote him from being a decent human).\nI would also strongly advise to seek out a therapist to help with the trauma this has inflicted on you and to help you be able to talk about this freely with the according authorities.\nBut please please please, DO NOT stay silent!

You don't have to be a victim, if you want - you can be a survivor. That's how I made it through. Idk how it will make you feel, but I can share my story with you - just so you know you're not alone. \n\nOn my 21st birthday, I was living with my boyfriend and his parents. They were out of town for the weekend, so we had a party at his house. The house had a pool and was two stories. Our room was on the second floor. I went to our room to change into a swimsuit and my boyfriend was already wasted.   \nHe pulled me down on the floor and it was so rough I bled. I begged him to stop bc I was embarrassed since we had company - I wanted to be with my friends. and didn't want to do this now. \n\nFor YEARS I didn't think he raped me, he was my boyfriend and he was drunk, and for three more years I would swear he loved me. I wasn't in a position where I could easily leave him. (I'm pretty much an orphan, except for my meth head sister who was in prison at the time - and I was living with his family after a roommate situation went badly) Also for three more years I'd let my love for him conquer any logical thinking. I'm lucky to have survived another three years. I made all the excuses. \"We've been together for all this time\", \"He loves me\", \"He's just drunk/high\". There were so many things I'd tell myself, until I let him isolate me and I lost all my friends - all I had was him. \n\nSo, if you need a friend - DM me.  Most of my friends are online anyways :)   \nYou are loved. I care about you.   \nI don't want to offer any unsolicited advice, but please make yourself and your safety a priority. There's only one you, and you are so very, very important.",

Often they will remove things, but the people involved will just make new groups and profiles, and be allowed to upload it again on the same site. \n\nReport it directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and your countries federal crime agency, like the FBI. It also doesn\u2019t really matter what country you are in. They will need the evidence which is uploaded on the site allowing it in order to track down missing children, and the predators making the content. CP is circulated internationally from multiple locations, so any type of federal agency that deals with child crime will be interested in any information you pass along, and will give it to the proper division. \n\nhttps://www.missingkids.org/home\n\nhttps://report.cybertip.org/\n\nhttps://www.hg.org/legal-articles/how-to-report-child-pornography-38216\n\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/vcac",

My wife and I were sitting on the couch watching a movie and occasionally glancing at the laptop and watching the uploads scroll across the screen.  All of a sudden many, many blatantly obvious cp videos started showing up in the feed.  I was a detective for a sheriff's office at the time and immediately called NCMEC.  I stayed on the line with them providing the info they had while they verified my LE credentials with my agency.  As soon as they verified my credentials, they let me know that they were receiving numerous concurrent calls about the same thing.  Apparently, the guy responsible had his phone photos synchronized with his social media accounts through some app.  As soon as his phone connected to his wifi, it started dumping pics not just to Flickr, but also to his Facebook page.  His Facebook friends and family were calling in to report him as well.  I was on the phone with NCMEC for less than 30 minutes and before we ended the call, they let me know that local law enforcement was at his apartment taking him into custody.  I kinda wish I knew the particulars so I could see how the case ended up.  \n\n\nIf you ever come across anything like that, absolutely report it to NCMEC:  \n[https://www.missingkids.org/home](https://www.missingkids.org/home)",

You never know if maybe you will save one of those kids before they end up dead. \nAlso, my daughter and I both reported a family member to the FBI 12 years ago and nothing was done about it until about two years ago. He finally got caught and was arrested and for having over 100 pics and videos he got SEVEN years. That\u2019s it. In between when daughter and I reported him and when he was arrested he violated several children in the family and several unrelated children in the town he was living in. (Yes, some family members who KNEW still allowed children around him!) Those children didn\u2019t need to go through that. If only he had been stopped before he finally was arrested. Several family members covered for him on numerous occasions. His father died while in prison for the same thing. And it was his father\u2019s third time in prison for the same thing. Back in that time it was harder for people to find out that someone was dangerous because families didn\u2019t report as often because of \u201cthe shame it would bring on the family\u201d. \nIn the tiny town I grew up in there were at least seven pedos. How do I know this? Because my step parent (and I recently found out my mother knew and was perfectly fine with it!) rented me out to those friends of his. One of them was someone the entire town knew (mailman) and trusted. That particular person has never been arrested still to this day. \nAnyway, again, REPORT REPORT REPORT. You never know who you might save. No one saved me. I finally felt like I had two choices: speak up or possibly die because he was very physically violent as well as sexually abusive. So I spoke up. He was arrested, put on probation, I was put in foster care (BEST thing that ever happened to me!!), and once the state gave me back to her and the case was closed, she moved him right back in and then within a week we had moved yet again. It started again that same night. I felt trapped and like no one could help me. I spoke up again when I was in high school and finally that was the end of that. He got four years. That\u2019s it. He then moved to another state and did it again, again to a child whose mother knew and didn\u2019t care. The child is of course now an adult and she and I are good friends. \nPlease report it to law enforcement if you come across it. There are real human persons being abused and killed. You could stop that. \nIf you stay in motels/hotels, take pictures of your room. Those pictures help law enforcement determine location if they find commonalities between the pics you provide and the pictures of children. Everyone has to do everything they can to stop this!!",

(computer criminology- dropped it bc the proff was just bad, but i did learn a thing or two before dropping it). Mainly i think us regular people have a hard time understanding just the sheer quantity of this vile content both being created and spread across the web every single day. Unfortunately there is an ever growing market. There was a good documentary about the topic filmed in UK. Basically the cops who work on CP cases were saying \u201cevery year we arrest more and more people- with no end in sight\u201d, paraphrasing.\n\nIt seems there are those sick fucks out there who from the getgo seek cp. but there is also a pipeline from legal but sketchy af adult pornographic content/hardcore bdsm/more sadistic shit that can put people in circles with the wrong type of people and give them easy entry into CP. obviously u would think a person who did not initially seek out cp would have the common sense to remove themselves out of these circles once they know. But i also imagine if u r out here jacking it to sadistic porn of people in pain and suffering- its not too big of a jump to expand to children suffering. Overtime people get desensitized to whatever \u201chardcore\u201d shit they get off on, and choose to keep pushing the boundaries of morals and societal taboos to be able to continue getting off.\n\nUnless there is some miracle advancement with AI i dont think we r gonna be able to rid the earth entirely of the scourge that is cp. but i hope to see the fight against the normalization of sexualization of children in the mainstream media continued. It wasnt so long ago that grown adult TV personalities were talking about 16 year old Britney spears\u2019 breasts on day time television and people were laughing it off like it was a normal joke or normal thing to talk about.",

They don't take the users down, or otherwise properly punish the perpetrators. A timeout is given for a day or so, they take the images down. Then the user puts them back up, but under friends only. Then they create a group that seems on the surface to just be a group of people who have some kind of common interest, until you look just a little more closely and see that it's a network of pedophiles actively trading links to their 'friends only' images.\n\nThis example is a fetish community site, where they allow pedophiles, professed nazis, and convicted sex offenders, to insidiously mingle in a kink context. Kink is first and foremost dependent on CONSENT, which children cannot do in a sexual context. Which means they do not belong there, and yet they're very obvious and visible. \n\nSo yeah, pretty sure this particular site owner doesn't care. And I know this sweep it under the rug/close the curtains behavior is not remotely exclusive to fetlife. Site owners are looking to MAKE MONEY. Limiting their user base, and putting resources into ensuring that limitation is enforced, hurts the bottom line. This is the only thing they care about. If you don't understand that you're living in a fairy tale world. In the real world this is how capitalism corrupts.\n\nAlerting site owners who have shown a pattern of ignoring or mishandling reports, is simply giving the perpetrators themselves a chance to run away before they're caught by someone with actual power to limit their life. The site owners have very little stake in this, comparatively to potential victims. To trust them is FAR more dangerous than being honest about the fact that the owner of a given site is 1000% out for profit over all else.\n\nThe only 'authorities' with a vested interest in removing these people from the internet are those in the government, where they have the motivation and means to actually do something. It sucks that we have to rely on the government to protect children, but that's what you get when you live in a capitalism soaked landscape.",

Pedophiles who were/are incarcerated watch those YouTube family channels to look at little kids since they're so easy to access. YouTube actually had to take down comments a few years back on channels that had children in them because pedos were timestamping certain parts in videos onto the comment sections. It's so gross. I'm sure if you look on Google you can read a few articles about the youtube pedo playlists. I'm actively involved in the movement to ban children being exploited online. I hope a law soon gets passed so these children can be protected from sick fucks since their parents aren't doing their part in protecting them.",

One day while cleaning my room I put it on the floor to dust my dresser, when my sister came through the door, tripped and landed on it. Somehow, it literally exploded lol. I was so mad, and she was so sorry. I never rebuilt it due to the defeat after so much effort. She was crying so much and was going to run away, even put some clothes in her recent Easter basket and was walking out the door lol. Needless to say she didn\u2019t run away and I got over it.

Your brother would have found out somehow so I wouldn't actually fault her for (just informing him) but I doubt that's the case and they had a stupid smug look on her face while doing it too. From what you explained and after making up my own mind I think your family aren't good people who are bored so to spice things up they thrive off of drama. Again it was an accident and by standards of normal people you should be forgiven by at least apologising to him and even helping him recreate it if that's what he wants but all of this other bullshit isn't right. I don't know anything about any actions you can take but you only have two options, continue living while being at the bottom of the pack or do something about it which is easier said than done but anything you can do by getting outside help or retaliating when you are in the right.

Drunken sex with a stranger is different because they might either not be able to say no or do something they wouldn\u2019t do if they were sober and you wouldn\u2019t know about it. In a long term couple though, when you\u2019re with someone you love and want already when you\u2019re sober, you want them more when you\u2019re drunk so it\u2019s not like consent is not given here. It\u2019s not like sex with a stranger where you wouldn\u2019t know about what they actually want.\n\nThat does not mean consent isn\u2019t important. Rapes still happen in marriages and long term relationships. And yes consent can be given and also taken away. No one disagrees with that. But simply assuming her drunkenness means she necessarily wouldn\u2019t want sex so he shouldn\u2019t have it is just insane. If she gave her consent before, already wants her partner sober, goes out and comes home drunk to have sex and is obviously still very happy about it after it happens, and she even keeps going out the same way knowing what happens, why would anyone in their right mind assume it\u2019s not done with consent? She clearly wants her husband sober and drunk. If she says otherwise then you can criticize the husband but this is what happens in many relationships and is completely normal and consensual.",

They aren't black out drunk, they aren't incapacitated, they just wanna screw their spouse more than usual, because they enjoy, so they do. Based on what the poster said, this is an married woman who likes to get rowdy after a couple drinks - she's not incapacitated - and her husband who loves her, loves having passionate sex with the woman he loves. He likes it when she cuts loose. She likes it when she cuts loose. They both love to make love, because they are *married* and love each other. There is NO problem with the story as he explains it, and there is nothing to indicate that she is an alcoholic.\n\nSeriously, take a step back from your ego, and ask why nearly 100% of the people participating in these threads disagree with you - Especially all the happily married people, of both genders, sayin \"there's literally nothing weird about this\" - you *might* realize you're missing out on something. Maybe your preconceptions about this situation don't actually address the full spectrum of human behavior.\n\nAlso, no need to call me \"fucker\". I didn't call you names or curse at you.

My wife is very beautiful and feminine and up until last night has never shown any inclination of questioning her gender. Last night she told me she wanted to talk about something and we sat down and she said \"I think I might be trans.\" I will confess that I laughed because again, there has been 0 inclination that she's questioning her gender so I thought she was joking. Obviously this didn't go over well and she got very upset. I apologized but she remained volatile through the whole discussion. I asked her why she felt like a man and she couldn't answer me. I asked if she was going to transition and she said she didn't know. I asked if she was still in love with and attracted to me a s she said yes. \n\nWe talked a bit more and I tried to hear her out and be respectful but honestly I'm pretty pissed off. I didn't sign up for this at all. I'm not attracted to men and so obviously I don't want my wife to look like one. It also really bothers me that this just came out of nowhere and totally blindsided me. It's also weird that there isn't anything about my wife that seems masculine to me. I get that mot everyone fits into a perfect gender role or whatever but I just don't understand.\n\nI'm so upset I called out of work today whe she's at work and honestly I've been depressed and drinking all day and crying over the thought of my wife taking hormones to grow body hair and cutting her breasts off. I think people have a right to do that and I have nothing against trans people but if she's really wants to be a man then it's legitimately not the person that I married and I can't make that work.

And the only way through that, other than not going through it at all and leaving, was to support them while they went to therapy and then have those difficult but honest conversations. Once I could ask those questions and they could answer, we found that we could still both have what we wanted and feel fulfilled. They experimented with a lot of things and found what worked and what didn't - they hate having body hair, but they also don't like wearing dresses or skirts or makeup. \n\nStart with therapy to help your wife navigate what they're going through, and for you to navigate what you're going through. The goal is an honest discussion about what you can and can't accept. I hope this helps as a real world example if you aren't ready to end it.",

I had identified as straight my entire life and so had they. They came out to me and I panicked. The concept of being a lesbian. I grew up with plenty of gay friends, but had just never really gone through the thought process myself, and this was before trans people being an out and vocal portion of society was as much of a thing, even online, and we had no one to talk to or any real social marker for what on earth we were dealing with. None of that was anything I\u2019d ever signed up for. But they were sure. And I loved them so, so much.  \n\nThere were periods early on where I was, honestly, transphobic and mean. I didn\u2019t know, in 2008, that\u2019s I was being that way but I was. It was an identity crisis for both of us. We both almost walked away multiple times. \n\nAll I can say is that, 16 years later, we are batshit crazy for one another. There is a fierce, burning thing there that will last longer than we will. She is so, so beautiful to me. She could identify as anything and I would sign the fuck up. Am I gay? I don\u2019t know. I know I love her. I know that whatever burns inside her sets something alight in me and I am so, so preciously thankful that I didn\u2019t let fear and panic and my identity crisis drag me away from her. The love I have experienced. The raw feeling. What I would have missed out on. \n\nThat said, that is just us. There is absolutely nothing wrong with personal preference (within good reason) in regards to anything related to what you prefer in a partner regarding gender and sexuality. If you are completely sure that you can\u2019t be with this person if they transition, be kind, but be honest, and you won\u2019t be in the wrong. You can\u2019t help who or what you are attracted to.  \n\nI will say though, to give yourself a minute. I did and the thought of not doing so brings me to tears. 16 years that I would trade for absolutely nothing and the thought of what I\u2019d lose had I bailed upon my initial knee jerk breaks my heart. \n\nJust please give yourself a moment to process things before you decide.",

Especially when gender roles are different around the world and pronouns aren't universal. \n\nI'm not American, so my view is different from those in the US, and I felt I had to fit in and almost went through with getting rid of my breasts and undergoing hormones. It's a very complicated brain thing. Turns out I hated labels more than I hated myself, and i hated how i was treated differently because of my sex. This is not the reasoning for everyone. It is mine and is no means to discredit the trans community. \n\nMy trans friends went through a screening and they transitioned properly but their partner put them down, fetishized, and confused their own choices during the hormones. I told them that this is for them, not for others. They are much happier having transitioned because of their painful dysphoria. They know the risks of hormones and the stress on their body, but they are happier. We didnt demonize eachother for transitioning or not because it's not an us vs them thing. It's just what worked for us. \n\nI dont know how it is like now for people to get hormones but we had amazing therapists and they are hard to find with a niche subject such as gender dysphoria.\n\nYou should also find a professional to support you too because this is a big shift for you.",

My friend attempted to stay in the relationship, but when their partner started hormones and a wearing a strap on, he tapped out. It was incredibly hard, for both of them. She (pre transition) even offered to just stick it out as a woman so they could make it work. But he knew that meant sacrificing her happiness and identity, and he couldn't agree to it. They both loved eachother immensely, but he was firmly straight and unfortunately their dynamic changed too much with him, but he supported him through it. It was very tough, but they are and have been best friends for the last decade or so. I have them both on Facebook, one is now married to his long term girlfriend, while the other seems more himself than he probably ever was. It's hard, incredibly hard. You are mourning your relationship. I would like to say if my husbad ever came out as trans, I really would like to try and stick around, and hope that my love would see past gender. But as someone who has always identified as straight, I really don't know. Its devastating, because you know this is likely the end of your romantic relationship. The only hope is you can support eachother through this, and once the wounds are a little less raw, remain close. It's normal to feel slightly betrayed and blindsided. But chances are, she has fought with everything, not to acknowledge this reality to herself, let alone you. It wasn't malicious, she was just fighting this uncomfortable truth about herself until she couldn't most likely",

While your partner's journey to self discovery is valid and deserves support, it's just as crucial to remember that you are under no obligation to change your own orientation or preferences. What's vital is a dialogue a space where both of you can be honest about your feelings and understanding the new boundaries that might emerge. You both deserve to live authentically, and sometimes, that authenticity leads down separate paths. Transitioning is a deeply personal process and, while it doesn't invalidate any love shared, it does sometimes mean that love must transform in nature. Sailing through this storm may be painful, but in the long run, it may lead to calmer waters for both of you.

Firstly, nobody \"wants to be transgender\", they just are, some people realize they are trans earlier in life while others maybe don't connect all of the dots until much, much later in life. It's actually very common for trans people to, for a period of time, especially before coming out or while questioning, to present very feminine/masculine to try to align themselves with their bodily sex. For trans people, this will only result in deeper distress because they are needing to push down who they really are and essentially walk around in a costume, pretending to be somebody they are not. You very well may be the first person your wife confided in with this information, and they are probably very, very worried about losing you but they clearly can't cope any longer with living dishonestly.\n\nYou do not and should not have to force yourself to be with a man if you do not want to be with a man. Your wife cannot force themself to be a woman and you cannot force yourself to be into men. As far as it coming upon you without \"warning\", there isn't always going to be one. It can be just as distressing for someone to realize they're trans as it can be for their loved ones they must come out to, it's a lot to process for everyone. If you love your wife, you will accept them for who they are and try to support them, give them time and space to figure out what this means for them, they are just at the very beginning of a very long and arduous journey of self-discovery. A big part of that is going to be having to tell the truth to everyone and risking losing, even everything they have. \n\nYou are by no means obligated to stay with someone who identifies as a man if you aren't attracted to men. You don't have to be, you can't force yourself to be attracted to men, just as your wife can't force themself to be a woman. Please remember that your wife isn't doing this to hurt you. You two have a lot to process and to talk about and ultimately you will both need to decide how to proceed moving forward. Transitioning is a very long process, there are social and medical aspects that both happen separately and over a long period of time. Your wife in all likelihood doesn't even know where to go from here, either. I'm sorry this is going on for you both, I'm sorry for the distress it has caused, it's not to hurt you. Your wife is a person living in a body they feel is misaligned with who they are, they've only just realized this, they are probably terrified and unsure of what to do next with what they've realized. Your wife should talk to a psychiatrist to help them delve into these feelings more coherently to make sure that they are okay, help them understand who they are and to help guide them through this.",

Trans people, in fact *all* queer people, run immense risk of being forced into roles that they simply cannot fulfill. A decision was made at some point to spend the rest of their life with you.

But be prepared to deal with fluctuating sexuality. My wife realized she was bisexual when she started hormones",

Your wife, if transitioning, is confronting a massive life change that's essential to her sense of self. At the same time, you're facing a potential redefinition of your marriage that you never anticipated. Your feelings of confusion and uncertainty are justified. It's important to acknowledge that while your wife has every right to explore her gender identity and seek happiness, you also have the right to your own feelings and sexual orientation. If her transition means that the romantic aspect of your relationship cannot continue because you're not attracted to men, that's a valid response. It's okay to grieve for the future you thought you had and to consider ending the marriage if it's not something you can continue with sincerity. Communication, honesty, and possibly therapy will be key as you both navigate this significant transition. Remember, supporting her journey and caring for your own well-being are not mutually exclusive \u2013 it just might mean loving and supporting each other differently moving forward.",

I'm grateful for the years we have had together and the memories we created together and I'm sorry that it likely feels as though I'm abandoning you but I need to do this for my own well-being and I hope in time you'll understand that it's better for us both this way\"*\n\nAlso your spouse might not be a binary man they might be Nonbinary and as for mastectomies and taking T not all trans people do but that will be their choice not yours but you also aren't obligated to stay in a relationship if you're only into cis women\n\nWhat you absolutely shouldn't do is tell them they have to not transition if they want to stay with you or try to control that aspect of their life or to lie and stay with them when you want to leave because you think you have to be their support through this even though you aren't attracted to trans people\n\nbe honest but don't go on about how much you love their femininity or say that they somehow tricked you- they likely repressed a lot of this until they couldn't any longer and never set out to spring this on you-they probably assumed their trans feelings would fade in time because that's what everyone says especially to transmasc people it's made out to be a trend or being a bad feminist/wanting to escape misogyny ~~(lol lmao even at that 'logic' because we don't escape misogyny or gain privelige through transition unless we're white stealth/passing and hetro and even then that goes away the minute you need healthcare or are outed or hear people talking shit about trans people and have to pretend not to care or pushback without outing yourself as trans or out yourself and hope they aren't violent )~~ \n\nTherapy would help too as this is a big shock and change for you as well as them but you're not obligated to stay in a marriage/ relationship for any reason just try to not be cruel about it & don't do the \"detransition and repress or else the relationship is over\" thing - if you can't see yourself being with a transmasc person and can see yourself resenting transition it's better in the long run to divorce and leave so you can both focus on your own paths\n\nEdit idk why I'm being down voted to hell for trying to encourage him to leave in a way that's non abusive and doesn't try to coerce the spouse into detransition but okay \ud83d\ude44",

Would strongly suggest you do more 'talking' to them right now  about this in a gentle caring way . Before going off the rails right now & making rash  decisions without facts to know what is actually also going on in their head  ( don't assume ) till you know . They will & you will be in REAL shock . As the 'secret ' is out now btw you  both now .And it needed to come out .\n* Would **do some questioning & 'listening '** to your current wife / them / he . Till you get the full picture of what is actually occurring btw you both now. They have only just told you but would of had to have had some 'ideas' before now about this ( which they have kept secret from you )  . So talk to them to find out what on earth is going on  with them . ***YOu have the right to answers*** also right now . But do it nicely , & do it with kindness , & do it with respect . This is still the person you married in the past & they are still that person . They will poss only being changing their gender now  or not .\n* **Couple Therapy** --> Would **strongly recommend you talk to a therapist** about this as well  better tog ( but alone also if need be ) . To help guide your 'discussions & keep them civil now btw you both .\n* **Individual Therapy**--> Would strongly suggest they seek out a therapist suitable to their needs mentally also right now to talk to . They need to  talk to someone who can understand their mental distress this also will be causing them. . So if they are NOT already seeing someone ( a therapist ) would suggest they do so . Someone impartial to help them cope with what is suddenly occurring for them .\n* **Your wife / they** --> Is very confused , feeling alone & very unsure of what to do probably right now . So do suggest they go talk to someone to help them cope with this . Would also suggest you do also ( individual ) .They say they still love you & want to be with you . But that also will now depend on YOU 2. Will you be able to make it work or not btw you both . YOu married someone ( as your wife ) . So it is ok if you can't now stay with them if they do transition . ( But also know you will miss & grieve also 'her ' that was with you ) . Which is also ok to do . You also remember are in shock ( this came out of NO where ) so you won't be thinking clearly at all right now . So give you & them now some time to work through this . They may or may not decide to 'transition ' or might just want you to know & 'share ' their news . YOU don't & won't know until you let the dust settle for you 2  to get to the bottom of stuff & what is really going on in their head right now . So NO do not make rash decisions , think about things & work through it individually & tog as a 'couple' ( via therapy ) to help you work out longer term what will be the next steps for you both in this relo . (They were & still are your 'wife currently ) so they do also owe you explanations & the curtosy to talk to you about it . Till they decide further what they wish to do as a person about it all  . So try & remember this firstly .\n* **YOU -->** YOu will be in shock from this news . YOu won't believe it & won't want to . And won't want things to change but sorry they wouldn't have told you unless it was necessary for them to do so . It has & will now change things btw you . It 's ok if you are mad/ sad/& confused by it all . Especially if you had NO idea at all it was coming. So give yourself the time you need to digest this .So do tell them also they need to give you time as well to cope with this also . YOu also have the right to feel absolutely shocked by this news",

But to expect a partner to just accept it all with grace and to just give support I think is over asking of someone who's world completely fell into chaos probably feels betrayed and is grieving the love of his life. Who's supporting him in that journey? They can't because 1 they're the cause of all that pain and 2 they're too busy with they're own feelings and journey. And again that's not a judgement more an observation after reading several posts where the partner is just supposed to love and accept them with grace. I do believe in that don't get me wrong I preach faith over fear and treating my loved ones with the same amount of grace and forgiveness I want to be treated with to myself everyday but in these stories it, to me at least, often feels like a very big ask from someone hurting so deeply themselves.",

Why do you think so many people transition in their late 20s, 30s? It's not like they didn't have dysphoria before.\nAnd even once you know you're gonna act, often it's still not clear *how* your're gonna act.\n\nIm not saying OP and their partner should just ignore the issue and pretend everything is fine. I'm saying breaking up immediately without considering what options there are and what a possible future together or apart looks like, or even what each partner wants, is jumping the gun.\nThey should have a conversation and work towards an outcome that leaves them both happier in the long term.

I have absolutely nothing against trans people, but at the end of the day OP made a commitment under the sanctity of marriage to be wed as husband and wife, not husband and husband. That is regardless of their respective genders overtime.\n\nSecondly, I am not sure why you look at is as OP's wife being financially screwed in the case of a divorce. I see it more like they are the one who chose to break their bond of marriage as husband and wife. Since they would be the one responsible for radically changing the status quo of the marriage to something that is not viable or sustainable, then they should also be the one responsible for picking up the tab of the divorce.\n\nAt the end of the day this isn't like they suddenly got diagnosed with cancer which is clearly not a choice a person can or would make. If OP's wife chooses to become a man, that's perfectly fine, but that is also them essentially ending the marriage as a result of their decision. OP signed up to be husband and wife and his wife clearly knows full well he is heterosexual and not gay. \n\nIn this kind of situation I would say OP's wife should be responsible for paying for 100% of the cost of the divorce.\n\nAlso It's not fair for you to only consider the cost of the divorce to OP's wife and not to him. I get that divorce can get expensive and it sucks that it costs money at all. However, why should he also take a financial toll because they chose to accept who they are then communicated it?

Eventually, I realised there was never going to be a \"good time\" to call it off and he was the one creating that situation, so there was no time like the present to say I was done. The floodgates opened when I was no longer trying to bide my time and keep the peace, and I unloaded quite a bit of pent-up frustration. \n\nHe was angry because I was easily the longest relationship he'd ever had, and he was going to be royally financially fucked without me there to bankroll him. He was constantly shouting, bothering me just to argue because he felt wronged. He'd run in and out of the room where I was working and turn the light on and off over and over, or play Fleetwood Mac's \"The Chain\" on single-track loop so loud I'm sure all the neighbours could hear.\n\nBut there wasn't really much to fight over in the divorce-on-paper itself since there wasn't any substantial property between us. I signed a new lease with just me on it, releasing him from the old one. We each kept one car, one cat, and one bed. We both signed the decree to that effect.

Then you can ask yourself why even get married at all.\n\nI have a different world view. I think marriage has a very strong meaning for signaling very long term intentions and undertakings, if possible for life.\n\nSomeone going into it is planning with many long-term life goals: a home, children, etc.\n\nBy unexpectedly threatening to break this agreement she is basically no better than someone who cheats or decides to leave for selfish reasons. \n\nI think it's her right to do so, but it's also his right to be restituted for it. She cost him a few valuables years of his life. Depending on his age perhaps she cost him the most valuable years in which he could have found a partner with similar long term expectations and goals. If he's good at life then maybe he'll make up for it, if he's not maybe he'll never get to achieve his goals in life because of her.\n\nEncouraging this is just encouraging not trusting anyone in general enough to plan for long-term anything. It's basically society damaging. No wonder less and less people have children. Everyone is as fleeting as a gust of wind and apparently many people encourage this nonsense. You'll all wake up alone at old age, i wonder if you'll think these hypes and trends were worth it then.\n\nThere are many trans who make up their mind again after a few years. There are many heterosexual people who experiment with homosexuality because it's a thing today. A friend of mine now wonders what was going through her mind when she did it. You are encouraging young people to try out stuff that aren't necessarily them, and promoting individualism to the point where everyone lives only for themselves.\n\nIt's fine for gay people to be gay. It's not okay to promote the idea that everyone is on some sexual spectrum, make everyone question themselves and everyone around them, and try stuff just for the sake of trying. Either you're born gay or you're not. Either you're born trans or you're not. But you're making gay and trans some kind of fashion trend. That's wrong.",

Heteronormativity is SO ingrained into every single aspect of life. When I was a little girl even, people at my church would ask me what kind of guy I wanted to marry when I grew up. We get toys, clothes, room themes, everything, based on our assigned gender at birth. People \u201cgroom\u201d (for lack of a better word) us to be interested in people of the opposite sex from the time we\u2019re toddlers (\u201cawwww look he\u2019s flirting with her!!\u201d type comments to a little boy simply being shy around a girl). People typically ask teenagers if they have a boyfriend or girlfriend specifically, whichever the opposite gender to them is. Parents are berated all the time for letting their kid explore their gender identity (by wearing different clothes, getting their hair cut or styled a different way, letting boys paint their nails, let them go by a different name or pronouns, etc). \n\nYou really can\u2019t see how all of this can make it really difficult, and really time consuming for queer people to find out they\u2019re queer? I was married to a man for 3 years, and then was in a long term relationship with a man for several more years. I hated it. It never felt right, sex was always uncomfortable and not enjoyable. I stayed with my most recent male partner for so long because I did love him as a friend, we got along well, enjoyed living together\u2026. But it never felt right. I just assumed there was something wrong with me because there\u2019s such a huge lack of representation and normalization for queer folks (and on the rare occasion we are represented, straight people bitch and moan about how we\u2019re shoving it down their throats. They don\u2019t see the irony that we have to see straight people kissing each other, being married to each other, etc literally almost 100% of the time, but you don\u2019t see us complaining about y\u2019all shoving it down our throats, because who cares? Everyone should be able to love who they love). \n\n\nAll that to say, the queer experience is a strange, very difficult one to navigate when society pressures us SO HARD to be straight and cisgender. A staggering percentage of queer people don\u2019t come out of the closet until later in life. Sometimes because it isn\u2019t safe for them to, but a lot of times it\u2019s just because we didn\u2019t know. Not everyone knows who they are by the time they\u2019re an adult. Everyone makes mistakes and is constantly learning how to survive in a flesh prison powered by an electric steak. The reality is, it\u2019s not at all unheard of for one person in a relationship to realize they\u2019re trans after they\u2019re already married. They\u2019re not trying to trick anyone, they simply didn\u2019t know until they did. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s okay for people to grow and change, and it\u2019s also okay for their partners to leave because the other person grew and changed so much that they aren\u2019t attracted to them anymore.

But I'm aware that I am in a state of finding myself still (much to do because of those SAs, they REALLY set me back in life), so if I don't know who I am, how can I possibly be a strong, independent equal in a healthy, lasting marriage?",

You're still going to stick by your \"society pressures us SO HARD to be straight and cisgender\" when there's a trans pride flag hanging between 2 American flags at the US Capitol? When we are exposing 6 year olds to drag queens, trans people, and promoting pride etc. in elementary schools? When we are told that we can't even QUESTION if this is good/ok for people/our children without being immediately labeled a something-phobe and cancelled?\n\nThe pressure is in largely in your head, one could even argue that it goes in the opposite direction. There is a mania of \"queerness\" in young people (again, in America) that is going to lead to a lot of destroyed lives in the very near future. A generation of gay and lesbian young people that are lifted up by disillusioned parents looking for attention and convinced they are this or that, taking on permanent damage from hormones and barbaric surgeries. It's homophobic. It's anti-women. It's a major problem.\n\nAnyway, I hope you figure/figured out who you are and have been able to find lots of love in successful relationships since (sincerely). The journey of self-discovery is the most important journey we take in life.\n\nEdit: just to clarify before the swarm comes down on me, I am and have always been a friend to, and kind to all. I always end up living in gayborhoods in cities I live in (lets be real, they're usually really nice!) and have made a ton of lifelong, incredibly close relationships with many members of the LGBTQ community. I don't want to be \"that guy\", but my very best friend is a gay man. I just have questions, questions that should be asked before putting people into potentially dangerous situations that are entirely unnecessary. Situations that are permanent and cannot be undone.

Her body is like a giant pillow and I just laid on top of her with my face between her giant breasts and pounded away for as long as I could. I was like a man possessed. I couldn't think about anything but how bad I wanted to fuck her and keep fucking her. It felt so amazing I never wanted it to end. She even made me break my rule of cumming inside someone I just met. After I came she just held me against her soft plushy body while having me suck on her gigantic breasts until the vibrator we had between us made her cum too.\n\nI think I'm in love.",

She has a beautiful soul and personality! One day we were talking and I had commented on how beautiful she is. She told me that she prides herself on being the best version of herself that she can be regardless of her weight. (and this is the important part) She said that she never wants her daughter, my granddaughter, to ever be ashamed of her body, and that if she, my daughter-in-law, hid herself or was ashamed of herself because of her weight, it would send the wrong message to her daughter! So she dresses her best, looks her best, and IS her best in looks, personality, and self-esteem, so that her daughter will always see that and aspire to that in all ways!\n\nHer and my son never actually married and aren't together now, my sons fault, he got addicted to drugs and pretty much ruined his life. So she dates and meets new people in the course of her life. But I am very close with her and I can honestly say that she could have almost any man OR woman she wants! She doesn't flaunt this, and likely doesn't even realize it! But it's true!\n\nSo I guess what I'm saying is, don't hold yourself back! Be the best version of yourself every day! And there is nothing outside your reach!",

There's a gene that causes (doesn't matter your weight) hyperlipidimia and the only real way to combat it is to eat vegan and take cholesterol lowering meds but taking cholesterol medication can actually kill you in some instances when it causes kidney failure liver failure or the deconstruction of muscles (rhambadylosis). In my case the statins caused more damage than good. \n\nOn top of this I had cancer as a child and had some (7) serious chemotherapy drugs that caused a lot of problems. I was also on a ventilator when I was only 2 months old. And my body has responded by giving me rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.  So those both affect the body. And I also have CVID on top of everything else. \nI used to be able to sprint at a 10 incline on the treadmill for 30 minutes but giving birth I ended up with a torn hip labrum that they won't fix, leaving me in excruciating pain anytime I walk more than a block or two. I also used to be able to bench 220lbs. Now, I've had a calcium score, I get lipids checked every 3 months I do yoga and I pay attention to food and what's in it. \n\nSo I wasn't supposed to be here anyway, and I still am. \nBy the way, when you take prednisone at high doses to save your life, sometimes it slows your metabolism and you never get what you were born with back. My genetics say I have the muscle composition of an elite athlete but my metabolism was shut down early and I have basically been fighting for my life for 41 years. \n\nAnyway your comment means nothing as that's probably not gonna be the thing that kills me.",

And depending on the type of IUD, periods can be worse and severe cramping can last for months after insertion. Not worth it IMO. So, hope she takes her birth control seriously and religiously.",

I've read thousands of women's experiences and most of them described the pain as the most intense they'd ever felt. Also, IUD manufacturers are always under some sort of class action lawsuit for something. There's reasons for that. You have to keep that in mind. IUDs are effective and have their plus sides, but also be aware of the negatives and the risks. Be informed. I'm not saying don't get an IUD or that they don't have positives. Just know both sides and be aware of the possibilities that can happen... Because everything is always \"only a small chance\" until you're the one it happens to.",
