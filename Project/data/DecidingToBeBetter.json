            "text": "She's extremely abusive and justified it because I haven't gotten her pregnant even though we are so far from being stable enough (imo) to have a kid. \nThis has left us in a stale mate. \n\nShe hits me and my dog, keeps me up at night yelling and throwing things and claims I've done this too her because she's 28. \"I'm wasting her life\" \"how can I be ok with myself knowing I'm choosing not to give someone their dreams\" on top of cutting me off from the outside world and making me feel bad for wanting to do anything not involving her. I have no friends, she shit talks my creative endeavors and tells me I'm not a real man because I'm a line cook. I've worked this job for over a year and she has changed jobs several times. \n\nI really need support today day please. I asked my brother to pick me up after work and I'll be staying at his house. I have to leave my dog there temporarily without me and that really worries me. \nI've been luv ng like this for 3 years and I feel I'm at a really big breaking point mentally. \n\nI told her I was feeling suicidal yesterday and she made it about herself and how I just don't get why everything is my fault and then demanded I have sex with her. When I said no shit hit the fan at midnight. \n\nToday she is acting like nothing happened. \n\nUpdate: I got really worried about my dog after a lot of the comments and then she blew everyone's phone up telling me the dog was violently vomiting to the point the neighbors called the landlord and the landlord called her so I went to the house this morning to find out it was a lie. He was perfectly fine. I spent time there with him and there was no problem. \n\nI'm at work now and am going there after.\n\nUpdate 2: I'm back at the motel because I was exhausted and broke without a way to work \nIdk what I'm going to do ",

But leaving this toxic nightmare allows you to eventually make space for someone who loves you, respects you, and who\u2019ll be an awesome mother to your future happy, healthy babies. \n\nLastly have a friend, neighbor, or even an acquaintance keep the dog for now. Post on social media or call animal control and ask them what your options are, if they have any advice in a situation like this. They may have resources aren\u2019t aware of. \n\nYou will get thru this. One day at a time. \n\nAnd she will remain a miserable bitch.",

                    "body": "I went through something similar, mate, more than 25 years ago. Abusive wife, hitting, screaming, bit me, manipulative. Then she decided she had to have a baby. One month, I was very reluctant, but went along with it, then, when we were having a fight, screaming at me that I was 'killing our baby' inside her. When she got her period, it was because I had killed the child whose 'soul' was allegedly around her, wanting to be born.\n\nThen, one night, I stood up to her and told her not to touch me. She went ballistic, ran into the other room, called a friend (her ex who she still manipulated), came back into the room and 'staged' a kind of radio-play version of me hitting her or intimidating her, screaming, 'oh, no, don't hit me again,' or something like that. I was so stunned by the whole thing that I couldn't even understand what was going on.\n\nI left, went to my office, and slept on the floor for the next few nights. She bombed my voice mail, filling it with all manner of messages: crying and pleading, saying she was pregnant, cursing me, screaming into the recorder, laughing at me and saying that she could 'see right through me,' just a crazy swirl of volatile emotions. I didn't respond.\n\nI was busy online reading about wives who abused husbands. I didn't even know such a thing could happen. I read about 'borderline personality disorder' (which I know is deeply controversial), the bit of research that existed at the time about women abusing men... It sort of blew my mind. Took me days to figure out what to do. Finally, after a few days of living on the floor of my office, I called the police, and they escorted me back to get my stuff. Three officers: one giant guy, another one to watch me, and a female officer who was especially trained in domestic violence situations. Gotta say, the police were amazing. They told me I could get nothing but clothes and toiletries, and one of them watched me the whole time as well as her to make sure that neither of us attacked the other or one of the police officers.\n\nI had already called a lawyer at that point, and I was lucky to live in a state with no fault divorce. Basically told my soon-to-be ex that, if she didn't just go, I was going to tell EVERY one of our mutual friends and acquaintances, including her family members and academic advisors and former bosses, etc. what she had done. Said I had written out everything in a comprehensive letter that was just a bulleted list of every single crazy, vicious thing she had done.\n\nShe folded, but not until hundreds of recorded calls, attempts at manipulation, stalking, etc. I had to leave the city for a while (I was in a position to work from elsewhere).\n\nAbout 25 years later, I'm happily married with an amazing life, and that period married to an abusive, violent woman seems like another lifetime. My one bit of advice is to get yourself in serious counselling afterwards and don't quit prematurely, until you figure out why you put up with the abuse in the first place. I didn't get solid enough afterwards, and had to do a similar (though much less violent and scary) relationship about six years later before I got it through my thick skull that I needed to do more work on myself.\n\nHang in there. It's not a situation people talk about enough. F\\* suicide! Don't hurt yourself. Shed this life, and build up so that you can create a better one. I've been where you are, and now, I simply could not be happier. And take the dog. They are angels. I credit dogs and their amazing ability to care for us with saving my life, too.",

More than likely you're an empath, sensitive, and easy to talk to. Since opposites attract, you find yourself attracted to people that thrive on compliments. Incidentally, this is what is described as narcissistic supply and is something that people with narcissistic personality types thrive on.\n\nMy recommendation: find a therapist and discuss your current relationship. While this relationship sounds absolutely toxic, you will benefit in finding someone who can help you break these walls within yourself. I found out so much about myself during this self discovery and I feel like a new man. While we don't always choose who we fall in love with, we do have to always make sure and take care of ourselves. It's amazing how past traumas or life situations manifest in the people we date. \n\nI wish you much luck and just know that there are others going through this and this does not make you weak. You are none of the horrible things your partner has said to you. They are only true if you believe them to be. Everyone has redeeming qualities about them. Be proud of the man that you are, what you have to offer, and mostly, keep that beautiful beacon of light and love shining from within yourself. No one can break you unless you let them. You are so much stronger than you know you are. I wish someone had said those words to me a while ago. Today, I not only believe them, but they have made me into the man I have become.\n\n  \nStay strong, my friend.",

That\u2019s why she acts like that. She knows you\u2019re a good guy and will just suppress your emotions which allows her to have control and dominance. However, it\u2019s clear you\u2019re not in a good spot which is completely understandable. Make sure you document situations and have evidence of her abuse and then flip the script on her. When she starts to get crazy, breathe for a second then trip on her. I\u2019m not whatsoever saying beat her up but using a voice that over powers hers and is firm on letting her know what\u2019s up and what\u2019s not going to happen anymore will take her by surprise and honestly a lot of girls act like that to get their significant other to get a reaction like that. If she tries to hit you grab her wrist or shoulders and firmly saying to her that this shit isn\u2019t going to happen anymore. If she keeps going then prevent her from hitting you and tell her she needs to find her place before you help her find it.  If she keeps going.  Then get the hell out of there while you have the chance. This might be bad advice if  it\u2019s not clear how I explained the approach. It sounds wild but I\u2019ve been in two horrible domestic violence relationships and the one I just got away from was this way. He would be abusive knowing I would sit there and try to diffuse the situation, he would continue until something was broke or he got me to a point where I was concerned for my life. Then he would completely switch and want to have sex  ignoring the fact I was bleeding from a knife or from being hit and act like nothing happened.  It\u2019s called \u201clove bombing\u201d and \u201cgaslighting\u201d. Take care of yourself and your dog.",

If you have any documentation of receiving abuse, use it to file a no contact order AND a restraining order. Change your phone number. Drain any account you have that she doesn't have her name on. Tell all utilities (phone, electric, etc) that your wife is not allowed any information about you. 100% cut her out of your life. If she shows up at your work. Pretend like you never met her. Deny you even know who she is.  \nHonestly, you are strong for leaving. I want to say your life will get better after she is out of your life. I don't know you so I can't give direct compliments to boost you but, your worthy of respect and dignity. your opinions are important. I hope today your new chapter starts off well. I hope you find peace. I don't want you to forgive her but I hope you forgive her so you don't hold hate on your soul.  Because she abused you, I'm assuming you're a gentle soul. And as such, I hope you continue to be a loving and kind man.  She deserves someone who is exactly like her. And I hope she finds him. And I hope she gets treated exactly how she treated you.  Likewise, I hope one day, if you start to look again, I hope you find someone that lights your fire. I hope you find someone that wants to protect and grow the love you have.  \nPlease, take care of your self. And your dog.  There are people in your world that need you around, because you bring happiness to their life.  I hope your heart doesn't grow cold but, there is a YouTuber called \"redonkulas regiment\", he is more of a shot of whiskey in a world of tea cups. His mission is to save men like you and me from taking the forever nap. His views are not well accepted. So definitely be wise if you subscribe to him.  \nI hope you find peace.",

Nearly any temporary situation fostering the dog will be better than leaving him with an explosively violent person with a vendetta. I don't mean to come down on you when you're already deep in it, but it astounds me that *anyone* could do this to a beloved pet (speaking generally) without like the life of a child at risk.\n\nYou have options to get in and out without being attacked. Call and ask your sheriff's office to provide a \"civil standby.\" Call right now, requesting it when you're off work.\n\nLet them know the exact time your brother will take you to pick up your dog and your essentials. Let them know that the situation can and will be incredibly violent, and nothing short of their presence could avoid it. Once there, don't pack or take everything, the cop won't wait that long. Just grab stuff like ID+passports+crucial documents, a couple days clothes + toiletries, and a couple of the most irreplaceable or valuable items you have - what you expect she'd target out of spite.\n\nThe sheriff's duty is to keep the peace, and that includes preventing domestic violence. This is a standard service they provide. If the sheriff can't/won't, call police non-emergency and request the same thing. If they can't/won't agree to schedule it, call them when you're heading there and tell them the situation is getting out of hand.\n\nIf you can't take your dog to your brother's. Put him in a pet hotel for a night. It might be out of your budget, but if you have half a heart and something happens to that dog, you'll regret it. You'll have the night and whatever time tomorrow to make a plan for him. You can get stuff done, you just need to prioritize, and he's depending on you.\n\nI'd be surprised if the law doesn't show up; if not, get your dog anyways. Don't fight back. Have your brother record the whole thing.",

You have no idea how many people run from that, deny it, refuse to take responsibility.  It takes a very strong person to be able to admit they aren't okay and need help, and an even stronger person to get that help and stick with it.  \n\n> I\u2019ve been knitting, reading and watching movies instead of listening to my addictive behavior  \n> I havent eaten out in a month, i\u2019ve been food prepping and i\u2019ve been sticking to the food plans i have in place  \n\nAnd that shows not only emotional maturity (recognizing your own limitations and working around them), but self-discipline, another thing people in general are VERY lacking in.  Kudos.  \n\n> I\u2019m over a year sober from alcohol/it\u2019s been a year since I got out of rehab (i\u2019ve ran into other people from my program and they are not doing well at all. But i didnt let their decisions influence me and that\u2019s a new development at 35 too :) )\n\nBased on everything else you've said I would have predicted this.  It's all part of the great mindset you have- you're recognizing what's wrong and taking steps to fix it and more importantly having the drive to follow through.  You have no idea how rare that is.  That's the kind of mindset that succeeds at *anything you put your mind to*.  \n\n-----\n\nOP I'd go so far as to say you're on a better path than a majority of people who participate on this site.  Not the DecidingToBeBetter sub, I mean reddit as a whole.  \n\nIt's not about where you are now or what you screwed up in the past.  It's about ability and drive.  \n\nTake a successful driven wealthy businessperson, and take away all that they *have*.  Toss them on the street with $10 and a single set of clothes and give them a year.  Chances are they'll be doing pretty fucking well-- because it's about attitude and drive.  \nThe people who succeed take the attitude of 'let's figure out what problems I have and fix them' and then they follow through on fixes.  And 'let's figure out what opportunities I have and take advantage of them' and similarly follow through.  \n\nThe people who fail don't accept their problems, make excuses for their mistakes, and never fix anything or learn from them.  That's not you.  \n\nYou sound like the wealthy businessperson who got tossed on the street.  You're on your way to a great life.  You have my respect.",

I was only 18 and was getting ready to marry \u201cher baby\u201d very much against her wishes.  Her biggest problem with me was that I was a Presbyterian and not a southern Baptist like her family, so she thought these might instill the values in me that she wanted.  Since I was a very nice young lady and did what my elders told me, I did read them and was not really impressed.  I remember wondering why she wanted me to read these, when she practiced none of what was in them herself.  Perhaps she just wanted me to be submissive so her son could reign over me like she did her own husband. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve matured, and cut some toxic people out of my life, including MIL.  I was cleaning out my books and came across these two, and was shocked at the misogyny and sexism in them.  Perhaps my copy being older was different than yours, but I couldn\u2019t believe that I actually read that crap.  It was very cathartic to watch them disintegrate in my weekly trash burning - almost like reclaiming my autonomy again against an over-bearing MIL who took great pleasure in bullying me for so long. \n\nAnd in case you\u2019re wondering, we\u2019re still happily married and MIL still hates my guts.  She\u2019s in hospice and will still tell anyone that I ruined her life by stealing her baby boy.",

Not that there are not differences in priority due to gender, just that the division of needs between men and women seems... odd. Old-fashioned, at least.\n\nSomeone posted a list of needs from this book for each gender below in the comments. That list is super weird.\n\nI'm a woman and the assertion that sex is more important for my husband than it is for me is wacky. If anything, for us it's the opposite. Similarly with physical attractiveness.\n\nWe both desire domestic support, conversation... probably equally I'd say? We both want financial stability. We both want admiration. Me much moreso than my husband, actually.\n\nI think this book is a bit out of date. It seems very entrenched in gender norms.\n\nMost of these needs and their priorities depend more on the individuals in a relationship than on gender.\n\nIt's way more important to learn to openly and accurately communicate. If you can talk freely about what you need, then each person can learn the other's needs and work to fulfill them. Sex is important to me, so I tell my husband so. He wants to talk about his work and feel appreciated, so I provide that for him. It's not transactional though - we both love each other and thus really want to learn and fulfill these needs.\n\nSo I guess the oldest, most obvious advice ever still applies. Communication is key!",

He always talks about how good of an artist he is (he\u2019s great at it honestly) and he\u2019s just waiting for someone to discover him while he draws and does nothing to put himself out there. He keeps losing his jobs due to dumb reasons like slacking off, speaking to customers about his art, etc. And of course doing things like asking if I\u2019m cheating on him, accusing me of him not being my type, etc. We\u2019ve been together 4 years now, I\u2019ve never cheated on him or anyone for that matter.\n\nI\u2019m currently an engineer, and just when I got a new job paying very well, he got fired for slacking off yet again. He just told me now that he\u2019s 30, he needs to take his art career seriously and just needs me to provide financial support. \n\nI\u2019m sick and tired and I\u2019ve started to plan out breaking up with him.

There are the \"natural talents,\" without degrees, but more often than not they are connected via personal or family wealth or through social status. Otherwise, your talent does not matter without the credentials in the arts. The loopholes are **1)** getting 'discovered' (does he attend galas, is his art at cafe's frequented by tastemakers or at least the rich, is he rubbing shoulders with the folks that \"discover people\", is he associated with other artists like an art society or troupe so that he at least has a chance and some reference of being found? - if not, the chances of that happening are never 0...but its pretty damn close to 0) and **2)** going viral online to garner fame and attention that leads to discovery. \n\nYou are right. He cannot maintain a job as an adult and you are still a kid(relative to the scope of life), but you are faring into adulthood properly.

It\u2019s unfortunate this mental illness is being thrown around so casually. Narcissism refers to Narcissistic Personality Disorder and it\u2019s not as common as people think. \nSeems like he is just immature and lacking motivation for his life and respect for you. \nA narcissistic isolates their partners. They are reserved, lacking empathy, passive aggressive and have high amounts of charm in public, subconsciously seeking attention of others due to their god-like ego.  Behind closed doors though they will emotionally manipulate, act verbally/emotionally abusive, try to essentially take control of your life and treat you as a puppet. Accusing you of cheating is not always a symptom of NPD. Anybody with immaturity/lacking respect for partner can do that. It also can be a cause of anxiety or a projection of their own low self-worth etc. Narcissists are also typically very successful people pertaining to career. It gives them a sense of power and heightens their ego to know they are successful. Their personality is very god-like overall. Feeling superior to everyone else, believing they are ALWAYS right. \n\nMy father was a true narcissist, he had a very severe case of it and my mom\u2019s marriage counselor warned her to divorce and move away from him. Her second husband also had a case of NPD and presented those symptoms I mentioned. She subconsciously drifted towards someone just like my father.  (who she is now divorcing and wanting to finally heal and focus on herself). \nIf it\u2019s just one symptom (like accusing you of cheating) and no other symptoms are present, it is NOT NPD. People are throwing that term about too much. \n\nBUT, to the point. If he is 30 and still making these choices and not taking anything seriously, he will drag you down with him and make your life miserable as well. Not sure of total context or background, but I\u2019m guessing he was enabled by his parents? Maybe something will happen in life that will make him change. Like becoming homeless or losing all his money etc. but you cannot change it, only he can. At this point, yes it\u2019s best to walk away because you will end up wasting a large amount of your life trying to fix or help someone who is a potentially lost cause. Live your life and enjoy it! Without the stress of an immature man who lacks respect, motivation and work-ethic. \n\nNot all age gaps are predatory. If you feel he is not predatory then he definitely does not have NPD. Just an immature dude who never had the chance to grow and evolve. My boyfriend is 31, I am 24. We are 7 years apart. We are in a loving and amazing relationship. I had to begin living on my own at the age of 17 and matured/grew up much quicker than people my age, and already have high emotional/mental intelligence so it works. Age gaps can work (if both are legal) but there are certain factors that allow it to work. \n\nBest of luck! This boy is going nowhere unless something huge happens to spark a change within himself. A relationship requires BALANCE and communication, respect etc.",

He has to analyze every friggin' possibility before even thinking about taking one step forward. I've thought about faking a medical emergency while driving to get him to take the driver's seat, but I decided that would only make driving more anxiety-inducing. \n\nIt's a little different because he does have goals, but his actions don't always align with them, or he meanders towards them at turtle speed. As someone who barely thinks before she acts, I sometimes wonder how the hell this is ever going to work out and almost regret choosing someone like him. For me, his pros, though far outweigh his cons. And I won't act like my impulsiveness hasn't jeopardized me at times (I could learn to be a little more like him). \n\nBut, honey, if the pros aren't worth it, you're making the right choice.",

You are better at being an adult than he is!!!\u00a0\n\n\nIf he can make money with his art, it should be a side gig. If he has his break through later in life, that's fine but what about the here and now??\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIm close to 40 and i work in the music industry (as a both a musician and off stage gigs/event management) for almost two decades. What i have learned is that **succes in any art industry is a combination of factors and characteristics that are almost entirely decided by chance and luck**. I had an established carreer at 30, started performing in teen years without the intention of being successful at all, so it's was just an emotional coping mechanism that **accidentally** turned into my main source of income.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n**If people like your art, they will pay you for it.**\n\n\nIf you don't make enough selling, you'll get another job/career. That's called \"being an adult\".\u00a0\n\n\nI still don't understand *why* people like what i create, but they do. And that is just LUCK. Chance. Nothing Else. There is no such thing as entitlement to money because one puts so much effort in it and works overtime, which would make sense working on a target basis in a company. **But not in art.**\n\n\nBeing passionate doesn't pay the bills.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nI went to university (college in US is called??) because i never ever expected/planned this becoming a career in my late teens. Many artists do the same. Nathalie Portman studied while filming The Phantom Menace for example.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Best of luck :) you are still so young and there are so many better men out there.

I\u2019ve been with my girlfriend for 4 years now, we\u2019ve been in love with eachother for 7 since we met my sophomore and her freshman year of high school. We\u2019d have been together for 7 aswell if I wasn\u2019t so dumb when I was young and broke up with her the first time we dated. He needs to work on himself and honestly go to therapy for his own self confidence and trust issues, I also have those issues but never take them out on my girlfriend by accusing her of anything and at most I openly ask her for reassurance. Also I completely understand having a dream and wanting to pursue it, im pursuing my own dream right now and supporting the love of my life with her dreams of becoming an artist and influencer and making enough from both to make a living off of it. It does make it a lot easier to endlessly support her since she\u2019s actually extremely talented and her art is beautiful and im not even just saying that bc i love her. \ud83d\ude2d However she still works a steady job and has since we were of legal working age, she doesn\u2019t ask me to support her financially even though that\u2019s one of the many things I dream of doing for her. To cut all my yapping short, my point is if someone really loved you they wouldn\u2019t accuse you of things like that, they\u2019d feel more confident because of you even if they believed otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t want you to feel any stress because of them, they wouldn\u2019t WANT you to work your ass off just to take care of them, they\u2019d want to work their ass of to take care of you even if you didn\u2019t need it. I\u2019m sorry but the age gap just makes it even more of a red flag, a 30 year old asking a 23 year old who is freshly out of college to financially support them while they happily stay home would just be the beginning of the end. I really am sorry but for your own sanity and future you definitely need to leave him. I\u2019m here if you ever need to talk about anything, and i wish you the best of luck in life and know you\u2019ll do amazing things. :)",

I don\u2019t care how much he\u2019s making as long as he\u2019s passionate about something. I thought he just needed help. In the last few years I\u2019ve paid $1000s on certification classes, a new computer or other tech, groceries for him so I can cook a meal for him, clothes and other things so he can care for himself. I\u2019ve even paid his rent so he doesn\u2019t go homeless after losing a job, etc etc etc.\n\nI was young and also focused on college at the time so I guess I didn\u2019t notice how much it was all going to waste. He was always sleeping in or playing video games or going to see his friends to play games with them or watching YouTube videos on random topics. And then when we would talk about his art \u201ccareer\u201d he would blame me and say I always want to spend time with him so he can\u2019t work on his art which I don\u2019t think is valid considering I\u2019ve been busy working on my own goals. Or he would give me excuses in general. And he would get more and more self conscious when I would start focusing more on myself. He told me last week \u201cthe help you used to give me, you don\u2019t do that anymore\u201dand when I asked him what he meant he basically meant when I used to do everything for him and buy things for him.\n\nI still love him, so much. But I don\u2019t think I can help him, and I can\u2019t waste anymore time. This week has been busy, last Friday was my birthday so I\u2019m 24 now.

You\u2019re focusing on \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and trying to fight against societal norms of men vs women. This relationship isn\u2019t a political statement. This is my life and my precious time.\n\n\u201cWhat if he can\u2019t hold a job? Yeah, what if he can\u2019t be a provider?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not looking for a provider. I\u2019m looking for an adult. As an adult, being self sufficient and holding a job - any job - is the most basic thing you can do. It\u2019s the bare minimum. His most recent job wasn\u2019t working at Walmart. It was a doorman job in NYC that I helped him get that paid a good 70K a year. That was his highest paying job and the manager took a chance on him. And he lost it for slacking off and being unprofessional and honestly a lot of very stupid and immature decisions on the job. \n\nYou can have dreams, and you can pursue them as an adult, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. But you have to actually pursue them. Like I said, he quite literally has not applied to any art job. He doesn\u2019t have an art portfolio. He doesn\u2019t have an artists resume. He dropped out of any art school/college he\u2019s been a part of because he believes he doesn\u2019t need it because he\u2019s talented. He\u2019s been \u201cpursuing\u201d this for 10 years. Come on now. \n\n\u201cWhat if\u2026 he\u2019s an excellent fucking father?\u201d \n\nYeah, what if? Idk, maybe. But if ANYONE is going to father my children, they have to PROVE they\u2019re going to be a good father. They need to be a good influence and a good role model at the very least, and I can only go by his actions which have not proved that to me in the slightest. And even if you are right, yeah he can be a great father, but he needs to be a husband to me first. I know for sure is he\u2019ll never fully trust me. He accuses me of cheating on him every other week with no proof or reason. He tells me he \u201cknows the type of guy I like\u201d and that it\u2019s not him despite me doing everything I can to show him I love him. Everything I\u2019m seeing shows that he can\u2019t be a good husband, at least not for me. \n\nMy father is someone who thinks he doesn\u2019t have to work and hasn\u2019t supported my family financially at all. I\u2019m not passing that nonsense onto my future children. \n\nI\u2019m not going to make important life decisions based on \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and following my heart and assumptions over red flags and obvious evidence. Time is precious, and that\u2019s a very easy way to waste it. If I continued this relationship with your line of thinking, I\u2019m ignoring every single red flag I\u2019ve seen for a hypothetical future that\u2019s not based on the reality of the situation. It\u2019s just hoping things get better and that he\u2019s someone he clearly isn\u2019t.",

I\u2019ve spent hours talking to him about his family issues and being his therapist. I\u2019ve ran to his house in the middle of the night when he was feeling insecure and down about himself to cheer him up and make him feel better and console him. I\u2019ve introduced him to my family proudly, and defended him in the early years when they would question his career, living situation and trajectory in life. Even now I haven\u2019t told them anything , not out of embarrassment, but because I respect him too much to shame him or embarrass him when he isn\u2019t around. He\u2019s gotten 2 surgeries, and I was with him through all of them, cooking for him, talking to doctors, getting his prescriptions, and consoling him when he was in pain. I celebrate Christmas with him and get him gifts, and decorate his apartment because he never really got to celebrate one when he was younger. I cook for him and do his grocery shopping when I notice he isn\u2019t taking care of himself and eating properly and would rather draw or play video games all day. \n\nI\u2019ve spent over $20,000 at my young age trying to help him with his career, living situation and encouraging him to get to where he wants to be. Paying for classes for certifications that he never got that he swore he needed, and his rent when he would lose a job so he doesn\u2019t go homeless. I even bought him a dog so he doesn\u2019t get lonely when I\u2019m not there. \n\nI don\u2019t ask much of him but to just love me.\n\nIf that\u2019s not love, I don\u2019t know what is. \n\nNo, him asking me if I\u2019ve cheated doesn\u2019t make him a bad person. But that\u2019s not what he\u2019s doing. He doesn\u2019t ask me, he accuses me of it. He tells me I must be talking to someone else because I\u2019m young and \u201cthat\u2019s what young women in their 20s do.\u201d He partially blames me for him not reaching his career goals despite everything I\u2019ve done to try to help and support him. If I\u2019m crying, he doesn\u2019t console me, he tells me to toughen up and what I\u2019m crying about doesn\u2019t make sense. If I\u2019m on my phone for too long (in his opinion) he grabs it and starts going through it. Last time he did this was 3 days ago. \n\nBeing \u201ctraditional\u201d does not mean staying with someone who clearly doesn\u2019t love, respect, trust and appreciate you as much as you love, respect, trust and appreciate them.",

Without a role model or influence, it is hard to know what\u2019s right or wrong and have that motivated drive to work hard and make things happen and that will affect brain development throughout childhood, causing emotional or mental stunts. \n\nYes, definitely not narcissistic. People throw that term around without really knowing much of context, as I said narcissism is typically almost never the case! NPD is a serious personality disorder and most people who throw it around don\u2019t have the education about it and often not the experience either. You can tell someone words and advice and they can listen, but often won\u2019t actually hear or understand it. Typically it takes certain people figuring it out themselves through experience but unfortunately, you won\u2019t be there waiting by him to figure it out! I\u2019m sure deep down he appreciates your patience and trying to help him but he is not capable at the moment in acknowledging it and making himself and life better.

            "score": 792,
            "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nAfter a 10-year marriage that ultimately ended in divorce, I found myself reflecting on the entire journey\u2014what went right, what went wrong, and all the lessons that could have made a difference. I spoke with a few people, both men and women, and it hit me: many people are searching for a spouse but may not fully understand the depth of what marriage truly is.\n\nI\u2019m sharing my experiences here, not to discourage anyone but to shed light on what I wish I\u2019d known. Hopefully, these insights will be helpful to anyone seriously considering marriage or looking to strengthen their current relationship.\n\n**1. Intentions Matter More Than We Realize**\n\nWhen I first got married, I thought love alone would carry us through anything. But over the years, I realized that the foundation of a relationship isn\u2019t just emotions; it\u2019s intentions. Having clear, shared intentions from the beginning what we both wanted from life, our values, our commitment to support each other would have helped us steer through the tougher times. Start your marriage with sincerity and know why you\u2019re committing to each other.\n\n**2. Don\u2019t Overlook Small Acts of Kindness**\n\nIt\u2019s easy to assume that grand gestures will keep the spark alive, but I found that small, consistent acts of kindness build a stronger bond over time. A gentle word, a little patience, or even just a smile after a long day speaks volumes. The daily, quiet kindnesses we often overlook are the glue that holds everything together. Over time, I think we forgot this, focusing too much on what wasn\u2019t working rather than nurturing each other in small ways.\n\n**3. Communication is Hard, But it\u2019s the Backbone**\n\nPeople say \u201ccommunicate\u201d all the time, but let\u2019s be real\u2014it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. For years, I didn\u2019t know how to express my feelings without holding back or without frustration. We had different communication styles, which sometimes made us feel worlds apart. I learned that communication is a skill you work on continuously. It means being honest, patient, and humble enough to listen without ego. If I had practiced this earlier, maybe we could\u2019ve navigated conflicts better.\n\n**4. Value Growth in Yourself and Each Other**\n\nOne of my biggest regrets is that we didn\u2019t focus on growing together as individuals. Marriage should be a journey where you\u2019re both evolving, learning, and pushing each other towards personal betterment. I learned too late that a healthy marriage is one where each person is supportive of the other\u2019s growth not threatened by it. If you see your partner growing, encourage them. Celebrate their wins, and let them do the same for you.\n\n**5. Don\u2019t Carry Resentments; Address Them Early**\n\nOver time, small grievances and unspoken feelings can turn into resentment. I let issues pile up, hoping they\u2019d resolve on their own, but they rarely do. When you let them fester, they turn into silent barriers. Now I know that when something bothers you, you need to bring it up respectfully and work through it together. An open heart, no matter how difficult the conversation, will save you so much pain down the line.\n\n**6. Understand That It\u2019s Not Always About Winning**\n\nLooking back, I wish I had focused less on being \u201cright\u201d and more on understanding my partner\u2019s perspective. Sometimes, in the heat of disagreements, I felt the need to prove my point, and it drove a wedge between us. Remember that you and your spouse are on the same team. There\u2019s no winning if it comes at the cost of peace in your relationship.\n\n**7. Patience and Forgiveness Are Your Best Friends**\n\nMarriage is full of moments where you\u2019ll need patience and forgiveness. There were times when I was quick to point out flaws and mistakes, but rarely stopped to think about the effect of my words. Learning to forgive genuinely\u2014not holding grudges\u2014is key to a peaceful relationship. Forgiveness doesn\u2019t mean ignoring what hurt you; it means choosing to move forward without bitterness.\n\n**8. Remember That Faith is a Guiding Light**\n\nThroughout my journey, the principles of patience, compassion, and mutual respect kept me grounded. Whether it was enduring hardships, finding compassion during disagreements, or simply reminding myself of the blessings we shared, my faith reminded me of a bigger picture. Leaning on these values, even in the hardest times, gave me peace and perspective.\n\n**My Takeaway**\n\nWhile my marriage ultimately ended, I carry these lessons with me. I hope sharing them can help anyone else out there trying to build or sustain a marriage. Every relationship has its ups and downs, and none of us are perfect, but we can always learn from each other.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019d say to anyone getting married or working through marital challenges, it\u2019s this: cherish and respect each other, forgive easily, and grow together. Because even if things don\u2019t work out in the end, at least you\u2019ll know you did your best.",

My first marriage ended in divorce and while I could have blamed my ex, I spent a long time reflecting on what went wrong, my role in that, and how I would grow and change in my next relationship. I\u2019m now extremely happy married a second time for 9 years and I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t immediately jump into a relationship right after my first marriage ended. \n\nPlease, if your serious relationship ends take your time to really deeply reflect and process and figure out how you can grow before diving back in and making the same mistakes. Even if you feel it was the other person\u2019s fault, you may have played a role in allowing things to happen or go unchecked the way they did.\n\nTo add to OP\u2019s points, it\u2019s not only compatible intentions but compatible dispositions and personalities. Do you know what you need from your partner emotionally and personality wise to have your best life? If you don\u2019t fully know this, pump the brakes before any type of long term commitment, ESPECIALLY HAVING CHILDREN. Once kids are involved you are locked to that person for life even in divorce. \n\nThis isn\u2019t to scare anyone, it\u2019s meant to help you all have fantastic lives \ud83d\udc95.",

Believe me, it wasn\u2019t easy at first. Waking up early to go to the gym or go for a run felt like torture. But slowly, I started noticing changes. I had more energy throughout the day, my body felt stronger, and surprisingly, my mood improved.\n\nOn top of that, I also broke my bad habit of aimlessly scrolling through social media before bed. Instead, I started reading for at least half an hour every night. It was like a mental reset button \u2014 I felt more relaxed, slept better, and I even found myself learning new things and exploring different perspectives through books.\n\nThese two changes \u2014 regular exercise and reading before bed \u2014 really changed my life.

It does not \"get in your bones\", or rot your teeth, or make you gain weight or any other generalized statement. \n\nI wish sooo sooooo much that someone with 1st hand knowledge showed me these things cause I suffered for a decade longer than I needed to.

I didn\u2019t inject my entire face but even if I did, who cares. In fact, I got Botox in between my eyebrows out of curiosity when I was 25 and that kept me from ever developing wrinkles there. Micro-injections are top notch.  It boiled down, be less ashamed of the things you like.",

Firstly because I realized how selfish and unreciprocative some of my \u201cfriends\u201d were (I\u2019d drive them to the airport, drop everything to be their therapist, help them move) but if I asked to hang, they were too busy. Or if I needed help, they didn\u2019t feel like it. But I think saying no actually helped me bond closer to some friends and feel totally okay with letting other friendships end.",

Not fun for anyone honestly \ud83e\udee0 then about a year and a half ago I tripped on acid for the first time and had several epiphanies and spiritual breakthroughs, I swear I could see this beautiful web of light that connects every living thing in the universe (collective consciousness maybe?). The next day after the best sleep I've ever had, I was just.. different (in a good way!). My partner agrees that seems to be a major turning point for me because I've been on my journey of personal growth and enlightenment since then and recently I even started to like myself and enjoy my own company for the first time in my life! My inner critic is still pretty damn rude to me but that's nothing compared to the torment I used to put myself through..  I still struggle with positive affirmations but I can actually say kind things to myself and I can *almost* effortlessly make eye contact with myself in the mirror now! I'm making progress on setting boundaries and self care, standing up for myself, saying \"no\" (still hard though!) and figuring out what my needs are.",

I made some mistakes but I analyzed them and started taking action to increase my frequency and depth of conversations with others and honestly I'm really enjoying the process of taking action , making mistakes learning from mistakes and trying to improve. It's honestly a fun game where Im actually excited by negativity and see it as an opportunity to be better. \n\nIn the end action is the cure. Learn and do is my mantra here\n\nAs I take on the path of improving my social connections I can see small progress and it's making me really happy.",

                    "body": "Great question. Everyone is going to have a different set and number of values. Your values are unique as your fingertips, so there isn't a set number you should have. Some people may only have 1 and some could have 20.\n\nMost of your values will stay consistent throughout your life, but they can shift during milestone moments. \n\nSo, how do you know what your values are? There are a couple of ways. I have taken a core values quiz to get an inventory of my values. (I am happy to share that if you'd like.) \n\nAnother way is to track your values in real-time.\n\nIt's common not to know the exact words for our values, like growth, learning, health, independence, curiosity, etc. This often happens because we don\u2019t really think about whether our actions align with our values in real time.\u00a0\n\nFor instance, I enjoy situations where I have a choice I can make because it makes me feel Freedom, which is one of my core values. On the other hand, I hate situations where I feel like I can\u2019t choose because my Freedom is taken away.\u00a0\n\nThese experiences can easily be dismissed as simply liking or disliking something, but if you dig deeper, you'll find a core value at play that's either being fulfilled or suppressed.\n\nMake sense?\n\nIf you'd like to explore this further, you should start by noting these moments. Each day, write down what makes you feel most alive and what drains you. Note who you\u2019re with, what\u2019s happening, and any observations. A pocket notepad or mobile app can help keep everything in one place. You can do this in real-time or at the end of the day. Identify where your energy was high and low and note it.\n\nFor example, I feel most alive when I\u2019m in nature. Specifically:\n\n* When hiking in the mountains alone in nature, getting to see animals, feel the wind on my face, and watch the birds fly.\n\nConversely, an example of what drains me:\n\n* Attending a networking event. Feeling obligated to make small talk with people. Drained by the focus on social media photos over meaningful connections. Wishing I were home with my family instead of networking.\n\nAfter collecting these emotional data points, look at them through a values lens. Experiences that energize you likely reflect your values. Hiking embodies my values of unity with nature, connection, and inner harmony. On the flip side, draining experiences either lack your values or reflect values that don\u2019t resonate with you. I miss the values of freedom, connection, and family stability for networking events, and the emphasis on public image doesn\u2019t resonate with me.\n\nIdentify the values connected to each experience and tally them up. This helps pinpoint what motivates you and what you might need more of. Categorize your values as core (this drives me), aspirational (I wish this drove me), descriptive (this describes me), and non-resonant (this does not resonate). The quiz I took helps with this too.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s okay if certain values don\u2019t resonate with you. That's what makes us unique. This feedback helps you understand where you belong authentically, making it easier to find your people rather than forcing yourself to fit in where you don\u2019t. Not everyone or every place will click with you\u2014and that\u2019s perfectly fine. It\u2019s what makes us human.",

The idea is to train your brain into associating the bed solely with sleep. Eventually your sleep time should increase beyond 5 hours.",

The typical route is to see a family doctor and ask them about it - this process can take over a year to get results, as there are few resources and a long waiting list. You can also see a psychologist, or go to a specialty clinic - the wait time can be similar and may also cost you thousands of dollars. \nHowever; in this new modern age there are companies providing remote ADHD diagnosis and treatment, such as Frida, which is the route that I took. You fill out a questionnaire for initial eligibility, and if they suspect you have ADHD you can book an appointment for a doctor, fill out a bunch of forms with your history and experience, and then go over it on video call. They even have a reduced price option if you can prove lower income, which for me was $300 (first test I ever got such high marks on lol). \nThen, they test you on whatever meds you agree might work best for you, and check in with $79 follow up appointments monthly or so until you find the right meds at the right dose, and you stay there with less frequent check-ins as long as you like. \n\nIdk about outside of Canada. Hope that helps.\n\nEdit: I would begin by researching the DSM criteria for ADHD, and take notes comparing it to your experience. It helps to have that info on hand, getting a head start on the process instead of discovering it, perhaps clumsily or slowly, while speaking to a doctor.",

Meditated from a young age. If I got sick it was echinachea rather than Tylenol. \n\nSo, when I performed poorly in scool it wasn't given much regard. I was inattentive, disruptive, didn't care, etc. I never knew what ADHD was until much later. \n\nLife got kind of fucking crazy on several occasions over the years. It always seemed like there was a crisis or the fallout/healing afterwards to deal with. I started to wonder if I had a serious neurodivergent condition but it took a long time to take any action on it. \n\nI've had like 30+ jobs, no education, issues fitting in or belonging (which my mother always waved away with \"fitting in isn't something you should want\") -- it's not so much that I wanted to conform, I wanted a sense of acceptance and belonging. I feel my disposition and behaviour has at times been fairly disconcerting to people.. just a little unhinged or disinhibited. \n\nI gravitated towards other troubled people and that often didn't end well. Chose poorly in partners. \n\nI just couldn't connect my immediate experience to a compelling vision of the future. I also forgot things all the time and made lots of careless, even reckless, mistakes. \n\nThere were times when this worked in my favour, but on balance, not so much. \n\nFelt like there was something pretty wrong with me, so heaps of shame and guilt and anxiety. \n\nNow, with help, it's reeeeallly changing for the better. Meds are giving me the ability and campacity to thinking things through clearly and stay with them until they are done properly. It's crazy. Emotional regulation has dramatically improved. It's like the limitless pill, tbh. I'm dilligently learning and applying other tools and strategies to manage my condition, certainly not just hoping the meds fix everything. They do help a lot though. \n\nI just had lotf of feedback from people close to me that I should go see somebody. Really glad I did.",

So having good people surrounding you is a must! I also tried very hard to still expose myself to parties and social events (because I was afraid that I'll lose my social life, which I didn't) and it became more and more comfortable every time. After some time there were still situations that in my mind felt weird without drinking (like weddings and first dates) but now nothing feels uncomfortable  \nYou just gradually get used to it and realise that if you're sober and you're super ok with your drunk friends doing dumb awkward things in front of you and you even find it fun, then they definitively won't have any problem with you acting however you want (and also, for some reason you sometimes get weird drunken respect from them, like \"wow, we've danced all night and you did it with us without drinking!!\").

                    "body": "I read a book that suggested reframing the idea of your emotions into a sort of extra sensory organ that engages in response to certain stimuli (just like our five senses). \n\n\nThe main theme being our emotions are not meaningless chaos. They're subjective, but valid reactions to something real in our environment. They're trying to alert us to something important, and if we pay attention, like we would to a smell, sound, touch, etc, we can process those emotions fully & choose to follow their guidance or not. \n\n\nSome examples:\n\n-Anger engages to alert us to an injustice or unfairness. It asserts boundaries & motivates us to protect.\n\n-Sadness kicks in to tell us we've lost something. Ideally, it moves us to seek comfort & support, but sometimes just acknowledging the loss or disappointment full-on is enough.\n\n-Joy is a greenlight signaling safety & belonging. It encourages us to pursue more of the same.\n\n-Fear is notifying us of threats & guiding us to avoid that danger.\n\nAfter we process intense core emotions like these, they typically shrink enough to be understood & managed. Unprocessed core emotions (reactions that are buried, numbed, avoided, etc) get more insistent & develop into larger obfuscating mental responses like shame, guilt, & anxiety, which are trickier to untangle & have a tendency to continue to bloat/take up more of our consciousness until we finally deal with the root issue.\n\nI highly recommend the book if you're into this topic!

Also a damn good way to end up taking on everybody else\u2019s problems until I was so overloaded I was seeking an out in substances as well as feeling like I had no one I could turn to (and not really knowing how to receive or accept care or support from others as well) so again cue a kind of toxic independence and looking for substances or material comforts or all manner of things to save me or screwy relationships with people where I\u2019m in an endless push/pull of help me no don\u2019t I have to do it alone. \n\nProbably rambling though I\u2019m sure others can relate. I get lost in details and miss bigger picture stuff a lot but enjoyed seeing the bigger picture I\u2019ve been working on or learning and how it applies to this aspect of communication. I have a lot to learn on how to best communicate my own message. And not overcommunicate- autism/adhd works against me and so does that being overly worried about the other person\u2019s response or feelings. It\u2019s funny though because learning to let go of the stuff I simply can\u2019t control frees up a lot of space to communicate better in the first place!",

I wrote a longer comment to the OP where I spoke of how childhood and unhealthy family dynamics are often so at play in our communication styles or being overly concerned with how the other person will take things or feel and have personal examples of this. \n\nTeach it in primary school and in parenting classes! There\u2019s a lot of screwy things we put on kids- intentionally or not- where we silence their voices or don\u2019t give kids an appropriate amount of agency. I spoke of having too much emotional responsibility in my family- for regulating myself and learning life skills but also for my parents and their issues. I know it\u2019s just as damaging when it goes too far the other way with overly involved and overbearing parents- I\u2019m reminded of a childhood friend whose mother pulled a friend and I aside individually and basically lectured us for not being more inclusive of her daughter. Scared the crap out of me and sure didn\u2019t help that childhood friend learn to speak up for herself!",

            "text": "I'm 25, have never been with a woman, never held hand / intimacy / etc.\n\nThere was a deep sense of shame in me being 25 and still a virgin, and my lack of success in dating apps lead me to believe that my lack of confidence in women stems from a lack of intimacy with them. This unfortunately lead me down the path of sex workers, as a form of practice before the real thing. And that when I do have a real partner, I do not let her down sexually.\n\nTime was arranged, everything was with protection. The experience itself was good, and ironically I never finished but made sure she did. In either case I was more focused on her pleasure than mine. Performance anxiety was real.\n\nI still have a deep sense that a part of me has died. My first experience has been with an sex worker and I cannot undo this fact now. It doesn't help that I have nobody to turn to for releasing this guilt. Something about this experience feels morally wrong.\n\nIt has only been 28? hours since the incident and I still feel horrible.\n\nI care about this individual on a human level, I am considering seeing her again just to talk to her and make sure what she's doing is not forced or coercion. I have had this internal debate with myself and feel like it's the morally right thing to do. I know it's all an act, but this experience has taught me that I care more about women on an emotional level than I do physical. And it hurts.\n\nEDIT: I had a good cry in the shower. I realized I am not a perfect slate anymore, but nearly nobody is. Everybody has a past and history. We are in a world where sexual promiscuity is the norm. My upbringing has lead me to believe a clean slate is the only way in life.\n\nEDIT: I have decided to \\*not\\* go back and see this individual. Thank you everyone that pitched in their thoughts and made me regain composure and clarity. I feel much less physiologically taxed than before.",

You were also only 25, thats not exceedingly late for your first sexual encounter. You had time. But she is a professional who more likely than not has her life set up on the other side of the door, leave her alone. This was your first time and your 1st encounter...you already seem like you are inappropriately developing feelings and I feel that bc you have been so starved romantically, you are wishing for something that is not there. This will only end badly.\n\nI highly suggest going to a therapist and dedicating like 1 yr to solid self improvement (get on the path to a career you'd want, develop your social circle - start making friends with men and women to be most comfortable with yourself and understand how game should work from both perspectives, get in the gym and maximize your health, develop a self care routine, get on a schedule, continue to improve all the aspects of your life - family, spirituality/religion, hobbies, job, friends, etc). Just by the virtue of being out there, you will have more romance in your life. And do this the way that is best for you, if you are introverted and nerdy, find irl game lounges to find friends and females (only used females bc we love consonance, we use the term women in this home), go to fairs and fests, join D&D groups, etc. If you like going outdoors, join a sportsman's club, join a rock climbing gym, etc. Find the avenues to improve you. Bc you shouldn't feel too late for anything at 25. I am not judging what you decided to do in the bedroom, you're a grown adult. But what led you there, and what is leading you to want to develop relations with a working woman professional who dropped no signals at wanting you, even as a repeat customer, is poor self esteem. You gotta develop that and make it stronger. There are men and women just starting their associate and bachelor's degrees at 25 (as they should bc 20s is still young livin) and you're really out here feeling left behind bc you havnt had a toss in the sheets. Sir, the only problem you have is you. So work on a you that makes you prouder.",

Being that in some cases we do pay taxes .\u00a0 In my case I'm a Web cam model and I been a phone sex\u00a0 operator for over 20 years . And what I found out in my own personal journey that there more guys out there good you than you may care to realize . Please don't beat yourself up m and also realize that there are more of us in the business because we WANT to be vs those are forced and or manipulated into the business.\nkeep in mind although I'm a woman in the business I still carry my self as a woman with morals, standards principles and my own integrity.\u00a0 What stands out to me the most in your post is the fact that you said you wanted to make sure she was please more than you..\ntrust me that's commendable because there are many cases where wives are still complaining that their husbands are not pleasing them in the bedroom neither are they willing to.\u00a0 So please know that when you do get a \"real gf \" (because you will one day) you would already know how to be a gentleman. But that doesn't mean that you should not want to feel good yourself.\n\u00a0If you haven't noticed my profile I am also a certified palm reader and sex educator. In the end it's about getting educated. And do not listen to those who lack knowledge or\u00a0 wisdom.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The key thing is to remember to be safe any time you have sex with any one be it a s worker or other wise .\u00a0\nPlease don't think that you are the only guy in the world who may feel a sense of compassion of care for a womans well being and safety .\nI believe that has less to do with morals and more to do with your own integrity. Which is a good thing.\n\n\n\u00a0 In closing- I have a 27 year old son\u00a0 26 daughter and 23 son all\u00a0 grown children who know that I'm in the industry and there is a genuine respect for his I position myself in the biz . I was taught it's not what you did it's HOW you do it.\u00a0 and maybe because I don't actually have sex with my clients and 98 percent of my shows are non nude , I might not\u00a0 be allowed\u00a0 to speak on the behalf of ALL sex workers.\n\u00a0I'm more of a fetish model and I also do sexual energy readings .how ever , I still get the same stones thrown at me as if I were a street walker . But it's something I have learn to get over .\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRemember who YOU are and why you do what you do . and always be a man who stands up for he believes in even if you have to stand alone ! But also don't try to go in trying to save any one . If you are a believer which I am. Remember Jesus is the one that saves and even then God gives us free will .\u00a0 You also may be catching feelings which is natural after all she is your FIRST. But you can't go on the rest of your life feeling shame and guilt because you will carry that guilt with you into your \"real \" relationship when you get one.\nTrust me I thought your story was gonna say how\u00a0 bad SHE\u00a0 was lol and that her p*** came in on you guys lol trust me I heard some waaaaay out stories from some of my guys on how their\u00a0first time was So from where I'm sitting you did well. Sounds like you both carried yourself well.\n\u00a0 Now all you need to do is build your confidence and the first place to look at\u00a0 is how this experience is helping you to\u00a0 come into your own identity and you're discovering you're not a prick !\u00a0 And those characteristics will help you in most relationships you have .\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0You sound like you are practicing self awareness..which most men don't care to do . But at the same time don't try to take on someone else's choices as your own . If you try to \"save her \" you will with out a doubt push her away .\u00a0\n\u00a0And let's say that this person is being forced to do this ..have the conversation and then go to the authorities DISCRETELY. or anonymously. And then leave it there and know that you have done a good deed . But again, please don't assume the worse of women like us because of she is grown ( which I'm assuming she is ) things can get confusing.\u00a0\u00a0 If you are a believer just pray and if you feel that guilty ask God for forgiveness and move on . But please know that most of us genuinely ENJOY what we do . Well at least those that don't actually have to give our bodies to men .\u00a0 With hugs Jae\u00a0 Be good \ud83d\ude0a\u00a0",

When a new alpha male comes into the picture, she will sleep with him. Therefore, to expect to be the first or one and only for any future mate at your age is unrealistic. Likewise, anyone expecting you to be one is also unrealistic.

I tried it maybe 4 or 5 times; it kept being incredibly awkward, unsexy and forced, and I was never able to shake the feeling that I was abusing them.\n\nHere's an experiment you can do, if you have the money: Hire another sex worker. Maybe go to a good strip club - which is kind of harmless, because there's no sex (but looots of money if you're not very cautious! You have been warned!) If you end up feeling the same way for THAT lady, well hello, you simply are a hopeless romantic. That's not a bad thing, but since you can hardly have every single sex-worker in town as your one-and-only true love, and cannot possibly save all of them from their \"sins\", it's not a feeling you should take all too seriously.\n\n> Time was arranged, everything was with protection. The experience itself was good, and ironically I never finished but made sure she did. For whatever reason I was more focused on her pleasure than mine. Performance anxiety was real.\n\nOh hello, fellow sufferer from first-night impotence! I have the same condition. I sometimes think I'm just not made for one-night stands.\n\n(Also, sorry to burst your bubble, but you probably didn't make her finish. You're completely unexperienced, she's an experienced sex-worker. She knows how to fake it, believe me.)\n\n> I still have a deep sense that a part of me has died. My first experience has been with an sex worker and I cannot undo this fact now. It doesn't help that I have nobody to turn to for releasing this guilt. Something about this experience feels morally wrong.\n\nSure. You violated your own moral code. Just like we all do, in many ways, from time to time. I did my share of bad and stupid things. It's not the end of the world.\n\nNow, get up from your floor, march on and realize that, 20 years from now, it's just one more item in your personal history, one you used to learn a good lesson.\n\n> It has only been 28? hours since the incident and I still feel horrible.\n\nIt will go away. That's the way of emotions. Don't run away. Sit with it. Write it down. Talk with it. Realize it's just an emotion, it cannot hurt you, it can only help you grow. Find out where it sits in your body. Describe it. Ask it what it wants from you, and use the information it gives you to create your own future.\n\n> I care about this individual on a human level, I am considering seeing her again just to talk to her and make sure what she's doing is not forced or coercion. I have had this internal debate with myself and feel like it's the morally right thing to do.\n\nPersonally, I believe that one-night stands or even paid sex can be intimate, emotional experiences. If you're not a monster, you always have some form of relationship with a person with whom you exchange body fluids. I still feel like I have a sort of connection with every woman with whom I had sex, with every sex worker I saw even though we did not have sex, and with every stripper I talked with. I like those people. They gave me good experiences, even if it was for money. That doesn't mean that I'm in love with them, nor does it mean that I have any obligation towards them. It just means that I am human.\n\nHonestly, chances are you are trying to soothe your conscience. That is great! It means you have one! It means people are not objects to you. But it does not mean that you have any obligation towards her, nor that she wants or needs your help. It probably means that you're not made for paid sex, though. Get over it. You will survive this, you will not run around half-a-man, just like countless, countless others before you.",

I believe this is where infidelity comes in, when two people are not comfortable expressing their feelings and needs.

In this day and age you'd have to go pretty far out there to be outside of the socially acceptable norm. Differebt people are into different things - I'd prefer my partner be naive than experienced. Lots to explore and learn together about eachother then.\n\nMy friend too had his first experience with a sex worker. I remember him telling me and my friend about it and being surprised at how immensely shamed he felt. He literally looked down got up and walked away and left us there wondering if he was coming back or why he left. Anyway, as we said to him in that circumstance I would say the same to you here. It was a mutually agreed upon and respectful interaction between two consenting adults. Unfortunately, people do far far worse in the name of sex in 'normal' sexual interactions. Taking advantage, pushing boundaries, plenty of people are into maladaptive and anti-social sexual fantasies. It's also something all men have considered. I would posit it's less self-destructive than getting into a relationship with someone you know you don't want to be with forever. Far less time lost, far less emotions at stake needlessly, far more money saved in the long run, I imagine the interaction was private and other people don't know about it as they would ex-girlfriends or past sexual exploits causing shame or embarrassment there too.\n\nIt's the world's oldest profession for a reason. You should hold yourself in more respect for having this level of consideration and care over it, and the woman you were with. As far as looking back on this, or having this be your first sexual exploit, I think you are far more in the norm than you might realize. Everyone's first sexual encounter is a weird, uncomfortable, embarrassing and therefore shameful experience to look back on. I don't think a sex worker is too much different than two young teenagers who don't really know what sex is or what they're doing agreeing to do it not because they want to, but because it's what they're \"supposed to be doing\" and what their friends Are lying to them about them also doing. \n\nHope you can feel more encouraged and normal about it. It's really not that bad, and the only sexual partner that matters is your current/next one(s) so just make sure you're clean and no harm, no foul imo.",

Not really, but at the same time, there is a massive stigma in society for people who either pay for sex or sell sex, so almost nobody knows about it.\n\nWhy do I not feel bad about it? Well, firstly, it's legal where I live (not the US or Canada). Secondly, I didn't get the feeling that they were being coerced into it, but for whatever reason, they chose to be a sex worker. Not really my business to know exactly why. We both knew what were getting and nobody was leading anybody on.\n\nI was a 34 year old virgin (still technically am at 36 if you mean penetrative sex) and I felt like it's unlikely I'll get sex without paying for it, so I thought what the hell? But I didn't want it to become a regular habit.\n\nWould I mention in to any woman I date in future? Would she even want to know? I'm not sure. But that hasn't really been an issue so far. I haven't had a serious relationship, where I've had to address this issue. But I'm autistic and I don't believe in lying to people, so I probably wouldn't lie about it.\n\nSo yeah, it's complicated.

Today I read a post from a a kid who was 16 during the pandemic and is now 20, and he still hasn't gone to college and he felt left behind. At the tender age of 20! You are not alone in this feeling in your generation, and as you mentioned, WFH definitely exacerbates this. I remember lying in my bed looking at the ceiling and literally feeling \\~panicked\\~ that my time to shine was running out bc I would only leave my home to buy groceries and go to the gym (at like 5am when no one was even there) when I was WFH. First, time never really does run out until you die, so just make each day worth something. What helps me is imagining that I was 98 and suddenly woke up \\[decades younger than 98\\]...what would I wished I could do? It just picks me up on tough days.\n\nAlso, apps are rough. A ton of data suggests that dating apps are a place where hot people go to feel socially validated by hot matches...or at least matches in what they perceive to be their bracket. Stuff can develop ofc, but it doesn't reflect real life all the time, don't let it get you down. Also be aware of where you are swiping. When I was in college in the south I was only matching with very...unique looking people double my age, which was outside of my specifications.  When I moved to the city, I got much better matches, people i found attractive. My issue was being black in the wrong pool. And when I first made my profile, before moving to the south, my friends had pointed out how terrible my profile looked bc it was a ton of selfies so I changed it and got a much better reception(which is how I also knew being in the south was a bop bc I could match back home just fine). As you develop your social life, you'll get more pictures that may hopefully contribute to a more vibrant profile. And never discount asking friends and family to set you up. Archaic (it seems) but it can work!\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nAnd I fear for you, bc you sound exactly like me (and I could be 100% wrong bc im an internet stranger and youre an internet stranger, so my opinion can be thrown out since I really know nearly no thing about you), but I would do the 'repeat the criticism' response just to get past the moment or the criticism. Yes, all of what you said is correct (imo), but if you believe it (not saying you have to, we are all free to live our lives), you can't just say it and acknowldge what should be right. You need to get to doing it too. Recognizing what needs to change is no substitute for the change. If youre like me, you may need some momentum. If you have no one to give it to you, you gotta start trying to do it for yourself (with the help of therapy ideally). Regardless, I am rooting for you, whether this last tidbit was applicable or not.",

Sometimes I still get jitters on how I approach situations like this because I do know of a religious standpoint I will forever be judged but we all will\u00a0 forever be judged..the key again is to never judge yourself more harshly than God . But know that you are doing well. And your desire to WANT to learn is key to any aspect in life.\u00a0 \u00a0You will eventually find the ideal gf or lover but like you said all things in good timing. But regarding your first lover and seeing her again ... remember it's first transactional . In fact if we all would be honest ALL forms of relationships are transactional it's the give and take. So don't ever be embarrassed about that . But take your time with her and if she wants to continue to see you try to take things slow ..and not put your hopes too high ...but I have known people to actually marry the s worker so you CAN turn a \" h \" word into a house wife but only if she wants too be one ..in fact I was one married to man who thought by marrying me then trying to force religion on me would change me ..I ended up leaving him . Not because I wanted to be a h word but because he wanted to abuse me into submitting. So please don't be THAT guy. . there are many guys who thought he could \"save\" aka change the Roman into HIS own image and liking then have all kind of hatred and resentment toward that woman all because he realizes a little too late, that no one can change anyone. Even if that guy thinks ( key word) THINKS he's doing HER a favor .\nAny who ....if you stick with \"going with the flow \" mode and following your intuition. You'll be alright. I promise.\u00a0\nHuggs Jae\u00a0\nPs if I have typos I'm sorry but my eyes are strained lol I'm 47 and they say the first thing\u00a0 to go is your eyes lol\u00a0\nOh one more thing ..get off the dating apps ..they are a dud lol try to go out and meet a real nice girl authentically ..like the cashier at the grocery store ..or the girl at Starbuckies lol or get a pet so you can go through dog park and meet her there ..or even the library is a good place ..but definitely not CHURCH ..trust me .

You refer to them (sex workers) as 'independent providors' portraying them  in a very capitalist lense without any acknowledgement (or perhaps knowledge) of their motivations to provide this sort of physical and emotional labour. Working for a 'larger organisation' is purely reinforcing the social sense of companies have to do good - and that is far from the truth. There's a reason sex work is one of if not the oldest professions. Despite how punitive the profession is treated by the well-worriers, most SW's do the work they do for other levels of personal satisfaction - not purely money. You speak of SW's how I would discuss someone selling tuppaware!\n\nIt's a big call being the judge on the OP's level of emotional maturity.

Don\u2019t be surprised if you look her up in two years and she\u2019s still saying she\u2019ll be there for a month.\n\nBy all means, if you feel strongly about this go ahead and call her up again. Just do me a couple of favors: 1) you will NOT fall for this girl, no matter what, and 2) you will NOT mess around with a potential trafficking situation by yourself, if you learn this is the case. Call the cops.\n\nTake it easy!",

Referring to 'them' as an inanimate object as opposed to speaking to the OP as a person speaks enormously to me about who you are and your world view. If we're gonna get judgy and all. Like I said - language matters.\n\nTell me more why you feel they need to become more introspective or are a 'victim' in the waiting to be taken advantage of? Or is their comfort at pursuing this path of self exploration uncomfortable for you? I'm being quite forward here and saying they've done good by having this self-reflective moment, but also having the courage to explore their sexual and intimate self this way.\n\nMost sex workers I know are highly educated, sex/body positive people who are quite effective at dispelling myths people who have grown up in a conservative society that shames or moralises the basic human need for intimacy and connection. Not to mention their grasp on what is an ethical transaction is usually informed and based on a concept of mutuality, resiprosity and above all else consent. A lesson most 'first timers' learn the hard way where consent is blured. Virginity aside, OP is exploring it in a consensual way.\n\nOP has demonstrated a level of maturity and self reflection that far exceeds most of the comments on this thread - specifically care, compassion, empathy and a sense of social responsibility. And respectfully, it demonstrates a level of insight greater than your \"not emotionally mature enough\" feedback. I hope they take that as a key take away from this convo.",

                    "body": "A few things to clear up:\n\nA) Spot reduction isn't a thing, so to lose \"belly fat\" you have to lose fat more generally\n\nB) to lose fat requires a caloric deficit. It's not *quite* as simple as the phrase \"calories in calories out\" makes it sound, but it's close enough for your purposes. In order to lose fat you'll have to lose weight so you'll have to have a caloric deficit\n\nC) In general, it's easier to eat say, 500 calories fewer/day than it is to expend 500 calories more. You can do say 250/ea but fat loss is 90% done in the kitchen\n\nD) \"hype\" isn't going to do this long term. That's why fad diets fail generally: you'll run out of hype/bursts of motivation, and then you'll just revert back to your old habits\n\nSo your starting point can be a mixture of adding in physical activity that you enjoy regardless of type, and making sustainable substitutions i.e. diet soda for regular, 2 egg scrambles instead of 4 with breakfast ect. If you do the above for a couple months and things aren't moving, then it may be time to do things like calorie counting. \n\nI did write a whole post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/comments/17xt6fy/why_is_gym/) about the gym and dating, but that's more geared towards lonely guys who are struggling with toxic mindsets about women rather than just general fitness advice.",

            "text": "Me and my girlfriend of almost six years just broke up after a tearful conversation. She loved me way more than I loved her, I didn\u2019t treat her as good as she deserved. She deserves a better man, a man who\u2019s gonna love her and treat her the way she should be treated.\n\nI\u2019m sitting on my bed with the tv off and just staring at the wall. I don\u2019t even know what to do next. I hope she finds someone amazing, she deserves it.\n\nI deserve to be single, I need to be single. I\u2019m just a depressed negative piece of shit who was dragging down this selfless, beautiful woman, who every time she heard my voice she got overjoyed, and I couldn\u2019t even spend the time to FaceTime her at night before she went to bed I was always thinking she was interrupting whatever bullshit I was doing. And it was bullshit, playing video games, on Reddit or YouTube. Stupid shit that could\u2019ve waited, and I bitched and moaned and griped about giving her 15 minutes of my time for a quick chat.\n\nSeeing her breakdown in tears and begging me to keep her was so hard that I started to bawl. I couldn\u2019t do it, I couldn\u2019t keep this woman around who was with a man who didn\u2019t love her like she deserved. I\u2019m not gonna string her along and keep her in a relationship with someone like myself, it\u2019s not fair. She kept blaming herself for my unhappiness, as I tried to explain to her how depressed I\u2019ve been, how negative and unhappy and I am and that I shouldn\u2019t be there dragging her down no matter how much she loved me.\n\nI was her first boyfriend, I\u2019m 32 and she\u2019s 28. Been together since 2018. I hope she finds an amazing man.\n\nSorry for the rant, I\u2019m so fucking lost right now. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s next in my life. \n\n**Edit 1**: I wanna just say thanks for everyone for offering your perspectives both positive and negative. This thread has been pretty eye opening and I appreciate anyone that left a response especially those that took the time to leave long genuine response with their own perspectives and experiences. I just want to provide a little more context with our relationship and why I think I'm making the right decision despite hurting right now.\n\n1. I have a chronic illness, big time stalker of the /r/UlcerativeColitis subreddit so shoutout to them because theyre awesome and when I'm flaring have some other people to relate to me when I'm all messed up is something a lot of people take for granted. She has always supported me with my illness, theres times when I was so sick I wouldn't leave the house for days at a time and she wouldn't complain, she'd go to work and come over to be with me. During the first few times it was nice, but I felt guilty that she was giving up so much of her time for me because of my illness. Regardless of what everyone is gonna say, she doesn't need to be with someone who is chronically ill and stopping her from experiencing the world, shes never been a homebody shes always been the type to want to go for a hike, go travel, see new places and gain new experiences. She never complained once, but I won't put her through that. \n\n2. Our relationship was a little Rocky a few times a year mainly due to me not wanting to commit to things like moving in together, and planning things for our future. Money was always an issue, I don't make enough to support both of us and she hasn't made any progress in her career to help boost her income to supplement what I could not cover. Thus not being able to afford an apartment together, wedding plans were far down the road, and we had issues with how we would've wanted our wedding. She wanted a travel destination wedding, I wanted a wedding close to home as I have a larger family than her and I don't want my parents having to shell out a few grand to attend a small intimate wedding in another country. I came from a middle class background, I had both parents growing up and I believe that I should provide for my family and children the way my father provided for us or else whats the point? She came from a home with a single mom, poverty and struggles. I do not believe in making my potential future children suffer through that, no matter how much I loved her and love them. We were both stubborn when it came to this topic.\n\n3. We'd run into issues a lot where she always needed to be around me, and before anyone starts, I liked her company but at times I wanted to be alone. I'm pretty introverted, a few years back i was a truck driver and now I'm an office drone that has to be around people all day and talk, and be social and it drains my social battery pretty fast. When I get home from work I don't want to be chit chatting right off the bat, I like to destress and relax quietly. She was very social, but at the same time she did not have any hobbies of her own. I play guitar, play video games, archery, and typically I have my personal time that I like doing my stuff. She would just watch tv or maybe clean around her home, we've had talks about her needing to develop hobbies and interests serperate from mine, and that we both need to be our own persons and not just rely on their partners for entertainment. She would give me my free time but at times we would butt heads about how much time I was spending alone. \n\n4. She would hassle me about working late, I get it when your spouse is always working then when they get off a long day of work and want to be alone and want quiet it can be hard, because then how much time are you left with your spouse to discuss your day? But I needed to work late, I need money I'm struggling wit my bills and I also try to help her with her groceries, with her nails sometimes or gas when her car is low. When we went out I always paid and she was always grateful and said thanks and she appreciated it but I knew if I was gonna work late she'd call and complain and it gave me anxiety, I have a high stress job and her adding to it over the past few months was never any help. We've had discussions about this but we both never saw any improvement. \n\n\nI don't want to blame her for everything as you read above I was selfish, I would get upset because I would have a long day at work and she'd call to try and chit chat when I wanted to relax and I'd snap at her. I'd go through my bouts of depression and push her out and would want complete isolation, I saw myself putting her down and telling her to relax when she was being goofy and just aloof when we were out at the grocery store or wherever. So the people asking me if this can be mended in the future if this can be fixed, no. Not until I change as a person and even then we've had issues where we are just different people and want different things out of life. I've noticed my feelings for her change over the past 6-7 months and especially when she left the country for two weeks to attend her friends wedding, I noticed how much I really didn't miss her. I cared about her safety, I wanted her home and safe but she would call me once or twice a day for just a few minutes and that was enough for me. If you truly love someone, them being away for even a few days should be hard, for me it wasn't. Thats when I knew.",

You are not actually absolving yourself by hating yourself.\n\nThere are a lot of things that you can't control that you are blaming yourself for, but there are somethings that you can control...and blaming yourself is one of them.  Blaming yourself and hating yourself is not helping her or excusing yourself.  \n\nYou can't control your feelings, your preferences, your moods, how you physically respond to things.  You can control things that affect your moods and feelings to a certain extent, such as your response, your behavior, your coping mechanisms, whether or not you go to therapy or take medication.\n\nYou sound to me like someone that is incredibly depressed and feels incredibly trapped.  Your decision to accept this as your fault creates a dichotomy that is adding fuel to this problem.  First, deciding this is created by you gives you a sense of control because somehow you manifested it, but at the same time you can justify your behavior because you can't help it because you are an asshole.\n\nFirst of all you very simply need therapy.  Nothing crazy, just simple talk therapy.  If you can't find or afford therapy, start with a support group that you can find online.  The topic of the support group doesn't need to exactly match your issue, even AA will help.  You just need some kind of audience to work out your thoughts too.\n\nSecond of all you need medication.  I know people think of this as a crutch.  I am a type I diabetic, no amount of will power will enable me to metabolise sugar.  It is the same with your brain.  \n\nI know am telling you this when you have a minute amount of willpower, but this situation will never get better if you don't do something but it doesn't need to be big or all at once.\n\nA lot of people that need to lose a lot of weight look at the whole amount and despair.  But we forget even if we need to lose 150 pounds, just losing 5 is going to feel pretty good.\n\nIt is the same with this.  Do something that gets you enough willpower to do a little more.  Maybe go to your general practitioner and get a mild antidepressant until you can take the next step.\n\nYou are not an asshole or piece of crap, your seeking help here is evidence of that.  But if you don't change, farther down the road it won't matter if you are a piece of crap, because you will still only hurt yourself and others.   \n\nI know these sound cliche solutions and that makes it even harder to put forth the effort. But why not instead at least prove to yourself it won't work, because then you can at least scratch that off the list.\n\nBest of luck my friend.  I am rooting for you.",

And I will preface this by saying that not everything I am about to say will apply or resonate with you, but if you feel like what I\u2019m saying to you doesn\u2019t apply AT ALL, feel free to disregard..\n\nYou are not a piece of shit - you have unhealed trauma that maybe you\u2019re not aware of. My husband has dismissive avoidant attachment - he grew up in a home where his parents did not provide emotional attunement (aka \u201cstop crying or I\u2019ll give you something to cry about\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear you crying\u201d etc). A household where it was not safe to have or show emotion. When as a child you learn there\u2019s no space for your emotions, you\u2019re pushed into hyper-independence, where you learn to suppress your emotions and retract (take care of your emotional needs alone because your caregivers never helped you co-regulate and never taught you how to process your emotions). This trauma gives you a defective wound (aka I\u2019m defective, I\u2019m not good enough, I\u2019m not capable of giving her what she needs, she deserves better, etc) and it makes you scared of commitment and vulnerability and emotional intimacy because:\n1. you\u2019ve always dealt with your emotions alone. When conflict arises, your nervous system literally shuts down and goes into flight mode. \n2. The thought of having to meet someone else\u2019s needs consistently terrifies you\n3. You believe in your core that you\u2019re defective and incapable.\n4. You\u2019ve probably used hobbies in the past to distract you from your emotions\n\nShe sounds like she has anxious preoccupied attachment (APA) - which comes from a fear of abandonment. This makes sense for someone who grew up in a single parent household. As an APA, she probably has very little self-soothing ability, so if she\u2019s upset or emotional, she\u2019s looking for someone to help her talk through it and co-regulate. She\u2019s also more likely to beg and plead to not be left because her biggest fear is abandonment. An APA gets even more anxious and needy when in a relationship with someone who is a dismissive avoidant because they sense their \u201cone foot in, one foot out\u201d attitude. They can sense the partner clinging to their independence and not wanting to be around them, and they\u2019re a people pleaser at their core. Which again, comes from a fear of abandonment. They\u2019ll obsess over why the other person doesn\u2019t seem to want to spend time with them or be around them, etc. They consistently feel disconnected in their relationship so her constant need for attention is a bid for connection. A dismissive avoidant is very self-directed so they tend to be blind to everyone\u2019s needs but their own. This isn\u2019t because they\u2019re selfish - again, they grew up having to take care of their own emotions from a very young age. It\u2019s a natural consequence. \n\nWhat we found in our relationship is that because I was his partner and the person in his life who had expectations from him, I was and still am his trigger. I\u2019m the one that\u2019s going to push him into having to face his fear of commitment, his fear of emotional intimacy and vulnerability. His fear of losing his independence and his sense of self. It\u2019s instinctive to want to create distance from that person because they make someone who is dismissive avoidant face emotions which is the last thing a dismissive avoidant wants to do. So it\u2019s not that you don\u2019t love her; it\u2019s that she makes you face things you don\u2019t want to and so distance from her feels like relief.\n\nI will tell you this: again, I don\u2019t know you or her, so I\u2019m totally basing this on your description and my own experience so please take it with a grain of salt. If you don\u2019t heal that fear within you and work to learn to process your emotions and be vulnerable, you will feel like this in every and all relationships because you will continue to attract anxiously attached or fearful avoidant people. Getting to a point where you can be securely attached is the only way to then have a healthy relationship. To some extent, there needs to be a level of co-regulation in a relationship, as well as a level of self-regulation, but both need to go hand in hand. \n\nBut it is obvious that you\u2019re a good person because you care about her and how you\u2019ve hurt her and you recognize what she deserves, you just feel incapable. I suggest looking up Dr. Sarah Hensley on TikTok, YouTube and instagram. Figuring out our attachment styles has been a GAME CHANGER for my marriage. It\u2019s been life changing. I am a fearful avoidant which is an even worse pairing for the dismissive avoidant and this has changed our marriage so much. It\u2019s just so different once you can see through the person into their inner child and the trauma. It truly connects you. I\u2019ve linked some videos below that have helped us navigate our marriage and I hope this helps. I wish you the very best and hope it all works out!\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNHHS9JY/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNHu7EYq/",

I told her that I woke up every morning hoping that everything was back at the time when I was in love and that's absolutely true.\n\nI'm such an immature that started to think about everything that I missed out in my twenties and got scared about never be able to experience shit like casual sex, flirting, nights out with friends, meeting new people, etc. And I ruined everything with her.\n\nI hope to grow and be better, to become emotional mature and maybe be able to reconnect even if I don't think I deserve it.

We got back together after I explained everything a month later but since then I\u2019ve been struggling so much. My mental health has been at the lowest it\u2019s been in 4 years.\n\nI love her so much but don\u2019t know if I can give her what she wants. She\u2019s the one who always brings up the ideas of living together, marriage, etc. and I kind of passively agree. I know she loves me deeply and I love her deeply too. She\u2019s so sweet and caring and beautiful and I could never imagine a better partner. We have everything; common interests, sense of humor, loyalty, the feeling that we\u2019re best friends, sexual compatibility, etc.\n\nI know I treat her well and I deeply care but I feel like I\u2019m a burden with my anxiety and overthinking and I feel like I have to hide so much of what goes on in my head because I\u2019m scared of how she\u2019d react to the disorder. At times I feel I can be what she needs but at other times I feel so drained and scared and like the end of our relationship is inevitable.\n\nI feel like a choice has to be made. Either I change or we go our separate ways, but I\u2019ve been trying to change for months and it feels like fighting through quicksand.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

If it's not working out, and you don't want to work on it, just admit it so both of you can move on.  This way both of you don't stay depressed over it for too long.

He'd always done a stellar job of keeping me isolated, but that time came to an end when I started making new friends (he wasn't aware of this) and I experienced friendships that didn't demand every single moment of my spare time. The most striking thing was that this friendship came up in conversation with two of my new friends *who don't know each other*, and they both described him using the same words: \"a parasite.\"\n\nHe'd done countless awful things to me over the years. Crashed my dates and completely took them over; acted a total dick towards anyone who wanted to be my friend; threw literal tantrums if I chose to spend time without him. He clearly felt entitled to my time - wouldn't even ASK for favours, instead I'd get \"Need your help today, around 1pm.\"\n\nThe beginning of the slow death of our friendship, though, was witnessing how he interacts with people at work: He's a shit-stirrer of the most epic proportions I've yet seen, relentlessly plotting against everyone and actively trying to get rid of whoever he didn't like. There were rumours of multiple people who'd left the job because of him and would never work with him again. I realised I was friends with someone who is just... absolutely fucking vile, and I don't need that in my life.\n\nAnd then, after one call to the police, it was over.

We slowly lost touch after that until I went to college\u2026 I don\u2019t think he ever did anything with his life. \n\nIt\u2019s very strange how our brains process stuff like this. Despite the way he treated me, I do still have many fond memories together. And there were actually some positive aspects to his personality, which are now part of my personality, because we basically grew up together. \n\nI think this is exactly why it\u2019s so difficult to see what\u2019s right in front of your face sometimes. When you\u2019ve spent a lot of time with someone, you almost can\u2019t help it that they become part of you, for better or worse. As there were also some negative parts of his personality I adopted, that I had to work hard to recognize and change over the years.\n\nJust remember that you owe this person NOTHING!",

I was always the butt of the joke.\n\nThey used to tell me that everyone I knew in highschool hated me for one reason or another and replaced my good memories with anxiety.\n\nI was apparently the reason why her partners broke up with her or had tension - she was in love with me but I never felt the same. I guess she always hoped I'd change my mind.\n\nThey were emotionally manipulative and just so toxic, hidden beneath love bombing and the good times that existed throughout.\n\nIt was funny that no one told me how awful she was to me until after she triggered a massive panic attack and finally prompted me to say I'd had enough. When I said I needed time, she disrespected my boundaries, and ended up going no contact.\n\nI don't regret it, although I feel bad for adding to her abandonment issues. We did have genuinely good times throughout our 8 years, but it has been 8 years and I've had so many more friendships of equal exchange and ease.\n\nI'm proud of you, and feel much joy over your future friendships. May they be abundant with honesty, laughter and joy through the good times and the bad \ud83d\udc95",

No wonder he has no other friends.\n\nI started hanging out with new friends on the reg, and honestly I just couldn't bear the thought of talking to him ever again. Like your friend, mine also demanded an explanation, instead he got the police telling him to get lost.\n\nOut of curiosity, what ever happened to your ex-friend? Did they find a new victim, or did they just sorta rot away? I can imagine if mine doesn't find anyone (which is highly likely) he'll eventually go insane.",

It's a lose lose with narcissists lmao. From here on, be especially considerate of who you let into your social circle. And be considerate of the concept of \"love bombing\". Once a narc has infiltrated your personal life, you're essentially screwed. Someone will be super nice to you, and you assume \"wow this persons great\". But really they're just a narc who wants to eventually control you. They are scary people. It takes some time to realize who's genuinely sweet, and who is using their sweetness to manipulate you.",

If you are generating enormous harm in your dating life then you\u2019re still an agent of harm, regardless of how virtuous you might be elsewhere. \n\nIt also calls your other virtues into question as people will wonder if your virtue in other areas is just a mask to allow you to be a more successful predator.\n\nOften being a predator who is otherwise kind just means the person is trying to soothe their conscience because they have little enough empathy to predate upon people, but enough to know they shouldn\u2019t, so they need to construct a less offensive self within their other relationships in order to be able to live with themselves. \n\nYou can only really reflect on your relationships, behaviour, etc if you can fully accept the magnitude of your horrible actions and the harm they have caused to others and to yourself.",

            "text": "**Edit: I made a YouTube video (pretty much the article word for word but with hand-drawn visuals) called \"First 100 Days: Unf\\*cking Your Life\".**\n\n***\\*I\u2019m only speaking on what\u2019s worked for me but wrote it as a step-by-step guide***\n\nMy life hit a rock bottom about a year ago.\n\nFor health reasons outside of my control, I couldn\u2019t function like a normal human being.\n\nI couldn\u2019t go outside, I could barely eat, and every day consisted of me rotting away in my bed.\n\nIn this 8-month span, I lost 20 pounds (as someone already skinny), lost a lot of friends, and as someone known as \u201cchill\u201d my entire life, I\u2019ve had to learn to deal with anxiety attacks.\n\nI remember my only goal during this time was just to feel \u201cnormal\u201d again.\n\nI\u2019m happy to say that after a year and 93 days, I am now fully kinda recovered.\n\nThe health issues are still lingering but for everything that was in my control, I\u2019ve done the best I could have to get back to normal.\n\nThe process might have taken longer, but this was how i unf\\*cked my life in 100 days.\n\n# Step 1: Clean up Your Act\n\nWhen your life begins to slip up, I believe that so does your environment. Clothes dirty, messy workspace, it\u2019s as if the physical matches what I was feeling internally.\n\nI felt terrible so I wouldn\u2019t take care of myself or my environment.\n\nThe environment didn\u2019t allow me to change so I felt terrible.\n\nIt was like an endless loop that dug me further and further down a hole.\n\nWhen I looked in the mirror, I saw someone who couldn\u2019t even take care of their hygiene or their messy room. What life changes was I going to make?\n\nSo, I took it slow.\n\nI cleaned my room. Then I cleaned my desk. I did my laundry. I took care of my hygiene. I got some new clothes.  \nAnd guess what?\n\nAfter months of rock bottom, I felt like I could change.\n\n# Step 2: Lessen the Screen Usage\n\nOn average, my screen time during that time was 11-13 hours a day. It consisted of watching movies I\u2019ve already watched, scrolling through endless social media, and revisiting the same 4-5 websites over and over again.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to improve my life so I scrolled. When I got guilty, I would go to my desk to try and work, but would find some excuse to get back to my phone then would lose an hour.\n\nIt was the first thing I touched when I woke up.\n\nIt was the last thing I saw when I fell asleep.\n\nThere would not be minutes in the day when I didn\u2019t have my phone on me.\n\nThe turning point was when I realized that I did not have a single original thought in my day.\n\nEvery waking second was listening to a podcast, scrolling social media, or reading stuff online. Everything I thought was someone else\u2019s idea. So I had to change.\n\nThe first thing I did was get two phones. A crack phone and a kale phone.\n\nThe crack phone had every distraction app known to man. The kale phone only had access to messages and apps to help me live my life.\n\nThe crack phone I used during my break and the kale phone was the one I carried with me but since it has nothing on it, I didn\u2019t really use it.\n\nInstead of bargaining with myself when my willpower was weak, I removed the option completely. Now my screen time is around 1-2 hours every day.\n\n# Step 3: Trying out Healthy Habits\n\nAs a result of isolating myself away for so long, I started to get anxiety attacks whenever I did anything social.  \nIt felt like I couldn\u2019t control my thoughts and I would continue to spiral farther and farther until I could go home and be alone for a couple hours.\n\nI had been feeling things I\u2019ve never experienced before and it was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nSo I tried new things.\n\nJournaling for three days.\n\nPracticing gratitude for one week.\n\nTherapy for three months.\n\nConsistently going to the gym for six months. (still going)\n\nMeditation for nine months. (still continuing)\n\nNever in a million years did I think that I would be the type of person to use Therapy, but it\u2019s been an integral part of my growth overall as a person.\n\nI\u2019ve cut the things that haven\u2019t worked and worked ruthlessly on the things that have had a big impact on my life.\n\n# Step 4: Figure out what you want\n\nI was starting to get my life back together. But, I didn\u2019t have a direction that I was going in.\n\nThe habits that I continued to work on day in and day out, they were consistent but they didn\u2019t have any meaning behind them.\n\nIf you asked me, what were my goals: my answer was still the same \u201cI just wanted to feel like a normal person again.\u201d\n\nSo I spent the days learning about what I wanted out of life. Any book, article, or video on self-improvement that I could find was combined to these three things.\n\nThe first one being that there were only a few areas of my life that I really cared about.\n\nRelationships\n\nFun\n\nCareer\n\nFinances\n\nAnd Health\n\nI set two goals for each area of my life, one being a ceiling goal and the other being a floor goal.\n\nThe ceiling goal being the ambitious goal that I would be excited to hit.\n\nThe floor goal being the bare minimum that I was looking to hit.\n\nThis gave me a buffer between the two and helped me manage my expectations when working towards my goals as a person.\n\nThen came the last idea.\n\nI used to set really big goals until I was constantly disappointed. So, I started to focus on the input and not the output.\n\n# Step 5: Building your Schedule\n\nYou want to know what makes a good life? Good years.\n\nA good year is made from good months.\n\nA good month is made from good weeks.\n\nA good week is made from good days.\n\nYou get my point. I now had everything in place to start to put everything into practice.\n\nI think it was best summed up here: Your life is made up of a series of ordinary Tuesdays. Figure out what your ideal normal Tuesday looks like. Because if you can have an amazing Tuesday, you\u2019ll probably have an amazing life. (Tim Ferriss, I believe)\n\nOf course, life has glorious ups and downs but that\u2019s maybe 10% of your life. I wanted to optimize for my own regular Tuesday, so this is currently the day I try to live every single day.\n\n8-8:30 am - Morning Routine  \n8:30- 10:30 am - Work  \n10:30-11 am - Meditate and Drive to the Gym  \n11-12:30 pm - Gym  \n12:30-1:30 pm - Lunch  \n1:30-3:30 pm - Work  \n3:30-4 pm - Eat a Snack  \n4-6 pm - Work  \n6-8 pm - Hangout with Friends / Family Dinner  \n8-10 pm - Hobbies  \n10-11 pm Wrap up Work  \n11-12 pm Night Routine\n\n# Step 6: Doing what you\u2019re saying you\u2019re going to do\n\nDespite being the biggest part of the entire 100 days, this was the easiest part to continue.\n\nI knew what I had to do, when I had to do it, and why I was doing it.\n\nThere was no confusion in my mind so everything just kind of became automatic for me.\n\nThis is easily the most important part of the 100 days. You see, everything before this was just preparing and getting in the right headspace to finally tackle the goals that I said that I would.\n\nWhenever I said that I would do something and I didn\u2019t do it. It stopped any momentum of progress that I had and made me lose trust in myself.\n\nI would then be consistent with my schedule for a couple of weeks then mess it up. This cycle happened over and over again.\n\nI became confident in my abilities by doing the things over and over again.\n\nI was building evidence in the type of person that I wanted to become. And that evidence came through setting goals. Achieving them. Setting goals. Achieving them.\n\nThere came a certain level of confidence when I said I would do something and I actually did it.\n\nSomething similar that I learned from therapy was despite having all of these grand ambitions, I could still be a friend to myself.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t treat anyone else as harshly as the way I treated myself. I thought it made me better, but it didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen I criticized myself, I quit things quicker, felt the lows worse, and just felt a net negative to my overall life.\n\nWhen I treated myself better, I gave myself more opportunities, I spent longer on projects, and felt way better during the entire process.\n\nDo what you say you\u2019re going to do, but be nice to yourself in the process.\n\n# Step 7: Consistency over Everything\n\nAt this point, I could finally look at myself in the mirror. My health still wasn\u2019t 100% but it was through the habits that I was getting better.\n\nI could guarantee failure by quitting but being consistent was the only chance I had at success.\n\nI\u2019ve known this advice quite early, but I wish I could have followed it better.\n\nI always thought intensity could outwork consistency but I\u2019ve been wrong every single time.\n\nIt was actually taking walks that helped me out of that rock bottom.\n\nWhen I was nauseous and couldn\u2019t physically do anything else in the day, it was a promise to myself that I would walk for a minute outside.\n\nThat minute turned to five.\n\nThen to ten.\n\nThen to twenty.\n\nIt was the small promise to myself every single day that no matter how sick I felt, I would go for a walk.\n\nAnd it was the one habit that helped me pick myself up piece by piece to every other step of these 100 days.\n\n# Step 8: Reflecting on the Progress\n\nDespite easily being the worst couple months of my life and me never wishing for that type of sickness of even my worst enemy.\n\nI would be lying if I said that I didn\u2019t grow from it and that it is now an integral part of my life.\n\nI actually stumbled across a book called \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" while rotting away in bed. And there is a line that I have kept close to my heart and has helped me throughout everything.\n\n*\u201cThe struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man\u2019s heart.\u201d*\n\nThis was the process that I have used for unf\\*cking my life in 100 days, I hope that you\u2019ve taken something away from it.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a habit tracker to help you build a specific habit for 100 days, I made \u201cFirst Hundred\u201d on IOS. But this was primarily a way of helping me track my daily walking habit in the beginning and thought that it could be helpful for you all (no paid features or account sign ups, just a simple habit tracker).\n",

Really well done!\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention meditation!  This is by far the biggest multiplier you can practice every day.  I like to do trataka meditation which is candle gazing.  It may take a few tries, but within a minute or two, you'll be able to still your mind for roughly 12-24 hours.  It's my favorite form of meditation.",

They're literally life-changing shifts in perspective.\n\nAnd, from someone ten years into this, it gets even easier, but the requirement for diligence never lets up.  On one hand, so much of the nonsense that makes starting this so hard stops happening when you maintain your body, your environment, and your attention.

            "text": "Why delete TikTok you might ask?\n\nTo be honest, all social media has a profound impact on the way that we interact with and perceive the world. TikTok is especially egregious because there\u2019s very little control over what content the algorithm feeds you. As such, I found myself getting angry about situations I\u2019ve never personally experienced, holding some random person\u2019s opinion as a universal truth because it went viral, or scrolling for literal hours until I stopped because my thumb got sore.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize how bad my TikTok usage was until I caught the way I started thinking about dating and relationships. It\u2019s my belief that it\u2019s necessary to give people (and yourself) respect, grace, and the opportunity to build trust if you want to develop a relationship. I found myself drifting away from that mentality after consuming so many videos of men bashing women, women bashing men, stories of infidelity after years of marriage, dead bedrooms, etc. It also seemed that no matter how many times I hit \u201cnot interested\u201d on videos pertaining to this gender war (as I\u2019m calling it), TikTok didn\u2019t seem to respect my preferences. I found it so difficult to maintain my optimistic view on the kind of relationships I want to develop when I was being fed content contrary to how I want to operate, and I found myself so angry, despite my lived experiences almost entirely contradicting the virtual ones I was being shown. \n\nSo for my sanity, my peace of mind, and to be able to live as I\u2019d like, I\u2019m permanently stepping away from TikTok as I didn\u2019t like the impact it was starting to have on me. It\u2019s been about two weeks now, and I feel like I\u2019ve leveled out.\n\nAnyway, I guess the only reason that I\u2019m sharing is in case anyone else has found themselves in a similar situation.

And her friend goes \u201ctell me everything\u201d, and my girlfriend starts with \u201cHe\u2019s so ugly\u201d, followed by a text of \u201cBut sooo nice. He\u2019s nice, makes me feel good and the other things are nice too.\u201d\nThing is, throughout my whole life, I was scared of this exact situation. I\u2019ve had my fears, because my girlfriend left breadcrumbs of these feelings, despite behaving like I\u2019m the greatest thing to have happened to her, including physical affection.\nHer speech, however, have always been physical appearance centric. It was clear she has an eye for conventionally attractive guys. I am not one.\nI guess I just hoped for reality to be different. It broke my heart, and I was the one who went digging for it. It\u2019s been 7 month since then, we\u2019ve gone through a lot.\nI confessed what I\u2019ve done to her and told her what I saw. I expressed my apologies for invading her privacy, no excuses. I did also share my pain, and my fears of her finding me \u201cso ugly\u201d, and how can I trust this won\u2019t make her repeat her old ways.\nShe was devastated and seemed sincere about regretting she wrote that. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m self sabotaging.\nRegardless, in a way it\u2019s hard not to dwell in self pity. I never was under a delusion I\u2019m hot, but I just hoped this women didn\u2019t start with \u201che\u2019s so ugly\u201d when beginning to tell her friend about the man she\u2019s falling in love with.\nWeirdly, there\u2019s a sense of relief. Like I looked my greatest fear in the eyes, yet I\u2019m still standing. Maybe I\u2019m still in denial, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m holding on to her words that she doesn\u2019t see me that way. That attraction morphs.\nI just hate feeling ugly. I wish I didn\u2019t have to experience life like this. It\u2019s not the first or 5th time I am made to feel like this. And still, I try to be a good dude. And I don\u2019t resent rejection of anything like that. I just kinda wish she didn\u2019t continue dating me if that\u2019s how she saw me, even after she started feeling what she describes as love.",

                    "body": "Ok, first of all, I\u2019m very sorry for your pain, my friend. Let\u2019s acknowledge that first\u2014I\u2019m truly sorry for how you\u2019re feeling right now. But I hope to help you find a way not necessarily to \u201cbe\u201d better, but to \u201cfeel\u201d better.\n\nNow, most of my comments in communities like this revolve around two pieces of advice that can really help rebuild self-esteem, overcome feelings of depression, and live with more serenity: educating yourself on how to regulate emotions and control impulses.\n\nI\u2019m going to get a bit technical here, but trust me\u2014this explanation might give you some relief. There\u2019s a part of the brain called the \u201climbic system,\u201d which is where our impulses and emotions are generated. When you do something you later regret, procrastinate, or fall into a bad habit, it\u2019s often because this part of the brain is \u201cin control.\u201d The limbic system is not \u201crational\u201d\u2014it\u2019s an ancient part of the brain we inherited long before we became human. It\u2019s essential for survival, generating reactions that once protected us but today can sometimes lead to behaviors we find inconvenient or regrettable.\n\nIn your case, what happened that night was likely a result of this mechanism. You\u2019ve always felt a fear of being judged or unwanted because of your appearance, and so, in a moment of insecurity, the limbic system responded by pushing you to act on those fears.\n\nThe fact that you were drunk is also very important. There\u2019s a part of the brain that evolved more recently called the \u201cprefrontal cortex,\u201d which handles rational thinking, planning, decision-making, and impulse regulation. However, it struggles to function properly when we\u2019re drunk, tired, sleep-deprived, or emotionally unbalanced. In those moments, it\u2019s harder to control impulses, and we\u2019re more susceptible to acting on fears or insecurities.\n\nSo, in short, don\u2019t beat yourself up about it\u2014it was an impulse, or at the very least, an error.\n\nYou can absolutely learn to control impulses and regulate emotions using the prefrontal cortex. I won\u2019t get into more technical details, but if you want to learn more, it can be incredibly beneficial, and tools like ChatGPT can help you learn these things quickly.\n\nNow, does she truly love you? The answer is yes, absolutely. This is due to oxytocin, often called the \u201clove hormone.\u201d It\u2019s the hormone that helps us bond with others. When oxytocin is released, over time, a person\u2019s brain begins to see their partner as more physically attractive, even if they didn\u2019t feel that way initially. This is likely why she regretted what she had said.\n\nAnd you made the right choice by being honest with her. Open communication between partners is essential\u2014it maintains that bonding mechanism.\n\nI know this was a bit scientific, but I hope it helps you understand what happened so you can rationalize it and hopefully feel better about the situation.\n\nGood luck, my friend. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf40",

I think, regardless of anything else, if you want this relationship to succeed, you're gonna have to.\n\nBut I personally think you deserve better. I'm sure she's telling the truth about being in love with you, there's no reason for her to just make all of that up in a private conversation. But I will say this as someone that's (for all intents and purposes) been in her position: years ago, I started dating a guy that I initially didn't find all that attractive physically simply because we were so compatible, and god I ended up falling so hard. But the thing is, the moment I fell in love with him, I suddenly started seeing all of the beautiful parts of him. His eyes, his smile, his hands, every part of his body, everything. He became irresistible to me. I was really seeing *him*. And frankly, I felt like a dumb asshole for not seeing it before. \n\nI'm sure she's in love with you, but you deserve to be with someone who sees you the way I saw him. You deserve to be with someone who doesn't behave in ways that end up leaving you wondering if you're attractive to them. And if you're still feeling physically insecure after being with someone for 8 months, either something is wrong with the relationship and/or you should look into seeking counseling for yourself. I mean really, counseling is always a great option in any situation. My therapy helped me tremendously with both of those scenarios.\n\nEdit: came back to this after getting upvotes and noticed that you definitely already talked to her, thank you adhd brain \ud83e\udee0\n\nAlso, I just wanna clarify, everything I've said (except for the part about the therapy) is subjective. Nobody knows your relationship better than you. Take what resonates and leave the rest \ud83e\ude77",

Turns out her friends were telling her \"he's not ugly at all, what are you talking about?\", so I got a laugh and a little ego-boost out of it too.\n\nI'm certainly no Brad Pitt, and I assume most ladies aren't even giving me a second look.

This would make me feel so uncomfortable, that I'd want to get in first and be the one to own the comments about appearances, and once I'd depracated, then I'd feel like I no longer was at the mercy of those comments. Also, FWIW, speaking for myself, quite often, I'll fall for someone, and the more we connect, the more I find them attractive, so 8 months in, my appearance assessment will be different to 4 weeks in, as looks never really matter, but the emphasis for others fades over time too. I know it's hard, but my advice would be to try and put the conversation out of your mind, because her using the term ugly doesn't accurately describe who or what you are, now, or even then. Be kind to yourself. Work on yourself, and seek out therapy to work through these feelings, and hopefully you find a place where you are comfortable with yourself, and those comments won't cut so deep.",

This is the type of stories they made movies out of.\n\nI grew up with a lot of insecurities, and I am still working on it everyday, so I know when it's your inner demons at work. You feel insecure about your looks, so you went hunting for it, and you found exactly what your inner demons wanted to see. Now you are fixated on the actual words \"he's so ugly\" and perhaps not the context.\n\nWe all say stupid shit we don't mean. We all do stupid shit we don't mean. Should we call our partners ugly? No. Should we go through our partner's phone? No.\n\nBoth of these could've stemmed from exactly the same reason, both of your insecurities.\n\nYour insecurity pushed you to do something you know is not right, ie going through her phone. And she forgave you for it, it sounds like.\n\nPerhaps her insecurity pushed her to use words to describe you so that her friends won't judge her for not going for the conventionally \"hot\" guys. \n\n\"He's so ugly\" hurts you so much because YOU believe those words. Honestly if my wife said that to a friend, I would brush that off, because I don't believe it. But if she called me things like \"poor\" or \"coward\", I would be hurt. The amount of hurt you are feeling is from your insecurity, not the \"betrayal\".

I have learned that one of the most telling words is \"but\". We say a sentence then follow it with \"but\" because we want to present one idea that aligns with the audience first so that they feel we are connected with them, and then what we really want to say comes after the \"but\". I have learned to ignore what people say before the \"but\".\n\nIt's like when me and my rich friends talk about our homes, I may probably start with \"It's soooo small but I love it, it's cozy, a bit crowded but we make it work.\" I say \"it's so small\" so that my friends won't think I have low ambitions or some stupid shit like that (my insecurities).\n\nShe said \"he's so ugly BUT he's soooo nice, makes me feel good...\" Just take out the part before the \"but\", even if just for a minute, and truly TRULY think about the rest of that message.",

It likely won\u2019t matter how much she tries to reassure\u00a0you. You are wise to be seeking insight. Some people don\u2019t put as much weight or importance on initial physical looks. I don\u2019t. The women I know don\u2019t. I have\u00a0learned it\u2019s why I don\u2019t enjoy sex until I know someone. We are ALL ugly until we get to know each other\u2019s adorable mannerisms.\u00a0Looks are fleeting & 1 diagnosis or car crash can take it away. They mean little.\u00a0 Sometimes people need to say the most shocking, unsayable thought to get it out of their system. (Maybe just me?) I\u00a0agree w top comment who said statement was for a unique audience & not how she felt.\u00a0 Don\u2019t let this become a self fulfilling prophesy.\u00a0She hasn\u2019t stayed with you for this long if she doesn\u2019t have real feelings for you. It\u2019s someone\u2019s personality that makes them adorable. How they treat you & having the honor of knowing what makes someone tick is attractive. Having a partner wash dishes, mop the floor or treat my fam kindly is what makes me smile when I imagine their face.\u00a0 Get out & do some fun stuff . Go to a wreck room & destroy this stupid event instead of the relationship. Dig some holes to throw this negative crap in & plant some bulbs for spring. Go on jet skis together? Do an activity away from home that you both have to actually DO. If the relationship is generally happy, don\u2019t let this win. Do some things to lift your mood by yourself. Go work out, buy a few shirts you like at a thrift store, use tinted sunscreen from Dr Jart or concealer to even out skin tone. The world feels darker than ever, so give yourself a break. You aren\u2019t ugly. She doesn\u2019t believe that. You aren\u2019t. People don\u2019t stay with someone for days, months + that they believe are ugly. You sound like such a compassionate, adorable, kind, fun person. You are going to know what to do. Give yourself grace & love. Breathe before acting.\u00a0 Wishing you all the happiness life has to offer & comfort for you both.\u00a0",

It is, rather, something that screams: Ladies, abandon your boring, mundane, unfulfilled lives and step into my exciting world, full of interesting people, new experiences, good times, easy living, and dreams fulfilled.

Go to med spas and plastic surgeons for consultations on what in your appearance can be improved.  Ask your girlfriend for her opinion on what can be improved in your appearance.  And then do it!  Even if you have to finance it and it takes a couple years.  Hire a stylist to help you with your wardrobe.  Get a personal trainer.  Go on a diet.  Talk to a counselor to help you get over your thoughts and feelings and shame and insecurities about your looks and what people think about you.

Not how one would behave with a person they find disgusting. \n\n\nA large part of it is my anxiety and childhood trauma that caused a fear of cheating.

                    "body": "This is what I was thinking! I am 45 (f) and quit dating the so called hot men because they were not hot! Abusive, and or rude, expected the 1940\u2019s ish gf/wife that did everything for him and not lift a finger etc. \n\nWhen I met my current partner five years ago, I was not immediately attracted to his features, looks, body. I texted a good friend \n\u201c meh not sure yet, he\u2019s below average, whatever that means I suppose. But we stayed up chatting for hours\u201d.\n\nWe did stay up and talked for hours that first night. And I became\nMore and more attracted to his little quirks,  the way his lazy eye squints, and how beautifully blue his eyes are. He has amazing long eyelashes I wish I could steal. The way he has a crooked smile that is very genuine and how he talks with hands like I do. \n\nWhen he gets excited about a story he situates himself in a different sitting position and it\u2019s just cute. He has a bubble butt and looks amazing in slacks. I even love how he has little grey hairs in his ears, and how his ears are just perfect, it\u2019s cute. And I love his beard, and what is underneath it when he shaves. \n\n*Edit for more context: He is very smart, has work and home ethics, takes care of himself independently, honest, and has integrity. He loves me even though I have messed up with a few things in my own life regarding alcoholism (I am a woman in recovery), and he could have very well left me then, does not excuse any behavior on my end but I got help. \n\nHe does little things for me out of the blue that I don\u2019t expect. I live it when we are watching a show and he\u2019s just looking at me smiling. \n\nI was told something once; don\u2019t compare your insides to someone else\u2019s outsides. This totally opened me up and made sense to how shallow I was in my past. And I am grateful today I don\u2019t feel like that anymore what so ever. *\n\nThat night I knew I met someone that I could definitely fall for. He was sweet, kind, didn\u2019t try any\nMoves on me and we slept in my bed together. That next morning he got up to leave and he left. Then the door opened right back up and he came in kissed me like no other kiss I\u2019ve ever had and he just left that and walked back out. I was just like holy hell that just happened. And my heart fluttered and melted. \n\nI was very insecure from abuse from my mother also, and another relationship that was abusive where we both cheated as well. \n\nI got therapy. Lots of it. Still in therapy. I have a similar background as OPs partner. For me when I texted my friend, I didn\u2019t give her all the details. I did justify this to my friend because my guy is not conventionally attractive. But to me he is very sexy and attractive. I even told him that I wasn\u2019t attracted to his looks at first until we spent those hours together talking about life, and things we want and do for our individual futures etc. I was honest because I have to be. \n\nI can\u2019t necessarily explain why I wasn\u2019t attracted to him because now I don\u2019t see that one bit. Everyone makes mistakes. Not all cheaters keep cheating. I cheated because I wanted something nice and not abuse. It was wrong of course, but I haven\u2019t done it since. I also haven\u2019t been abused since that relationship ended. \n\nAnyhow I don\u2019t know if this will help the OP at all considering similar stories, but there is hope. If you can try and let it go do it. \n\nMy guy has insecurities also. Whenever I distract him from reading just to tell him he\u2019s sexy he covers his face with his book or hat. And shakes his head no. He truly doesn\u2019t think hes good looking. But he super is to me, compared to the very beginning. \n\nI wish you luck OP. \n\nAnd @Xixii thanks for saying what you did. This is def what I\u2019ve been through in this aspect.\n\nEdit: typos\n\n*Edit 2: more story context\n\nEdit 3: typo",

One night she really wanted to come over, before me and her ever meeting IRL. I said no at the time, and our chats fizzled out. \n\n\nCut to this year, we match again and talk. I find out back then, she was in a long term relationship - she was cheating on him. So basically, I got a first hand glimpse into her behavior/impulsivity in this context. \n\n\nNow, I'm choosing to be in a relationship with her, so I need to control my paranoia and how to self soothe. I'm trying to do that via therapy.\n\n\nShe's a complicated person. Clearly so am I, but I'm generally responsible.\nShe hid the cheating from her ex for years, up until he kissed a girl and they broke up. I guess this made me very scared about her ability to lie. \n\n\nShe promises to never hurt me, and she did confess early on to what she did.\nIt feels like she's trying to be very honest with me, and wishes to be accepted.\n\n\nShe does still hang out with a friend of hers that to this day still cheats on her partner regularly, even goes on dates. Apparently that was their thing, how they bonded. \n\n\nThis leaves me scared I'm actually in a relationship with a very manipulative, exploitative person. That I'm being used or played. I know that reading this, one might ask \"Why are you with her?\" - I currently have faith of her changing and try to trust her that they were in a miserable relationship that lasted close to a decade. \n\n\nDeep down, I'm very fearful. It's constant and hard. Sometimes I do feel like maybe I should look for someone that has a different past, or a different environment. That feels more secure, and doesn't flare up my greatest fears, like being secretly cheated on and lied to. \n\n\nIt's a hard situation. Regardless, I should work on my shit",

An unhealthy lifestyle is not an excuse.\n\nYou're also presuming that there is no attraction to personality and it's all based on looks. No. You have both. You find someone you find physically attractive and mentally attractive. Both.\n\n\nEdit: I will add that the other side of the coin is also bad. Getting together solely due to physical attraction and there was never any mental attraction. And then a dead bedroom starts when the relationship inevitably deteriates or someone's physical attraction declines due to weight gain. Yes that's a thing that goes on and it's bad. Like I said, both looks and personality/mental are important. Not having either one can result in a dead bedroom because good sex doesn't happen if there isn't both, and you are supposed to be in a sexual relationship.",

For starters, I'm already working with my doctor to sort out my depression and get tested for neuro-divergency. I'm also getting back into the gym tomorrow.\n\nI would really just appreciate some words/testimonials from people who have done it. Turned things around from being a 25 y/o screw-up.

I was feeling pretty alone in this so you guys sharing your stories and giving such amazing words of encouragement means a lot.

Started taking life seriously, completed an apprenticeship and then enrolled into university to study psychology after that. My advice would be invest in yourself, if you find a good partner invest in them also, don't be selfish. I've had my ups and downs and landed on my feet with a high paying job and surrounded myself with good people and support my wife and she supports me. But I started by investing in myself, health and education wise. Recessions provide a great opportunity to invest in oneself. I started in 08. Good luck and don't forget to enjoy the ride",

This helped me get to a more stable ground, and then built up my sense of self worth and confidence which subsequently made me better in work and how I presented myself to others.\n\n- Started working out seriously for the first time in my life.

Tried new hobbies, took the initiative to meet new people, applied for jobs and projects that I would have thought I was unqualified for before. \n\n- Soul searching on what really mattered to me, not what other people thought should matter or view as a marker of success.

Where you are, where you aren't, who you are with/not with, how much time you have wasted or how much time you think you got to do something.\n\nTake all those thoughts and throw that sh** out the window. Focus on one goal, that should be what you breath, what you eat and the only thing you do. If you got a s/o and they don't get why this is important? Then they go out the window too. This should be the case for everything. Habits, friends, spouces,jobs and even family. If they aren't helping you achieve your goal, you can love them as much as you want but your sole focus is you. \n\nI'll keep it short. I was 27 no job, no money, no future... Nothing. I was a textbook fu** up.  But I always wanted and education from a prestigious institution (my family is highly educated and I was frowned upon for not getting one). I had nothing, I couldn't even get into college bc I fluncked out so many times. \n\nI threw everything out and was given a last opportunity to attend a no name school. And man for the next 3 years that's all I did. School. I ate school for breakfast lunch and dinner. My last year I did an internship for 1500  bucks total for 40 hour work week for a whole summer. I didn't have gas money and couldn't afford to take my girl out. She left me for someone who had it \"together\". It was brutal. \n\nBut I graduated.... Top of my class, I was given offers to attend medical school and an offer to get a business degree on a full ride at a very prestigious institution. I took the latter. I was broke for another 2 years. But I never stopped grinding. \n\nToday I have a job making more money than I know what to do with. Working a in a very prestigious industry rubbing shoulders with some of the wealthiest individuals in the country creating biotech companies. \n\nThe struggle was necessary, I'm not going to sugar coat it for you. It's hard. It will always be hard. I woke up many days thinking why am I doing this. I can just go get a regular job. But I just didn't want to be a regular guy. \n\nBut that struggle taught me lessons no one could give you advice on. You have to go through it. \n\nKeep your eye on the ball, if you want it enough you will find a way. But keep in mind the path wasn't t always clear. In the process you might find yourself and you might find your dream job. If your going to dream... Dream BIG, I legit always dreamed of being a CEO of a company today am #2 in one of the companies I created (I have 2 jobs). But I just started my career, CEO is my next milestone.\n\nGet out there and do what you have to do.. Dont let anyone stop you. If I had listened to my \"friends\" that told me I was to stupid to go to school for medicine I'd be living with my parents like they do..... I was diagnosed with a learning disability have a back injury the list goes on... But it never stopped me. \n\nI'm 36 now and I still \"struggle\" (mentally) but I wouldn't trade where I am for anything in the world. I'm happier than I ever been and whenever I look back, I'm proud of the things I accomplished on my own. I don't owe anyone squat. It was me, ALL ME. No one will ever take that from me. \n\nGo be the person you want to be. Stop wasting time. None of it matters....",

I am far from perfect, I still use drugs a little too often and need to work out more - much as I hate to say it the advice about good sleep, workout and get out more is helpful but therapy can help you understand why you aren\u2019t able to do it. \n\nPick one thing, don\u2019t overwhelm yourself and change everything just choose one thing you find challenging but want to do and focus on that for now. I promise once you overcome the first hurdle everything becomes easier. Gradual improvement over time combined with understanding your own brain is the key in my opinion and never listen to people who say \u201cit\u2019s too late\u201d etc with job market.

If you have a 1-2 hours a day, go every day. Eat at least 100 grams of protein a day followed by 20 grams of fiber. Once this routine becomes your lifestyle. Work on increasing the protein and fiber and trying to eat 5-6 servings of fruits and or vegetables a day.\n\nNext work on getting a job. It could be anything. But try to make sure this job isn\u2019t going to completely drain you. Like requiring you to work everyday, or work long hours. \n\nTry to establish a certain amount of savings. Both in retirement accounts and in personal savings. You need to have a retirement account so that you can survive in your old age. But you also need to have savings both for an emergency and as \u201cfuck you money\u201d in case you need to quit your job and pursue something else. \n\nThese things need to take priority before you worry about your social life. Don\u2019t jump on Instagram to see other people in which you end up comparing your life to and feeling worse. \n\nAll of this being said, you\u2019re going to have set backs, hardships, and tragedies, it\u2019s inevitable in life. If something pushes you off track you are allowed to feel sad, and take a break. But you need to eventually get back on track. \n\nAt age 25 you still have so much time for the rest of your life. I think in our society today, there are many people feeling lost in their 20\u2019s. So don\u2019t beat yourself up too much.",

Focus on yourself like you are, surround yourself with people (and animals, many many animals! I like reptiles and fish and dogs) that will love you unconditionally. It takes time to sort through the riff-raff, and people will surprise you for the good and for the bad, but learn from everyone and everything. You will lose friends or just fall out of touch, and that\u2019s okay, just work for the relationships that work for yours. This includes family. Find a hobby or volunteer somewhere or do something that makes you feel productive. That\u2019s what helped me the most! Once you accomplish something you will want to accomplish more! Try to set clear goals for yourself and stick to them! Be your own drill sergeant or enlist a friend to keep you on track! If you hit speed bumps,  re-think the situation and see what you can do to change it. It helps to look at it as if you were someone else, like a stranger overhearing it, because it makes it easier to remove emotion when decision making. What would they do? Does that work for you? It\u2019s all about exploring and adventuring and finding what works for you. If it doesn\u2019t work you don\u2019t need it! I\u2019m by no means RICH, but I count myself as very successful because I am comfortable and happy and I have a good tribe around me. I was at zero, broke, doing drugs and drinking, trusting the worst people, and worrying my family sick, but those memories are so far away now, they seem like a book I read when I was a kid. Find your thing, find your people, and good luck! It\u2019s rough out there but it gets better! Feel free to reach out if you just need someone to talk to. I definitely did.",

I believe I have finally found my way but throughout all of my attempts, however I feel there was a missing link that held me back. \n\nI personally believe that building a good internal relationship with yourself is crucial to building a great life. By this I mean you literally have to love yourself like your life depends on it. For all of my life, my internal voice was either neutral or more often than not, negative. I've come to realise that all the external validation I looked for could only actually be provided for by myself. I had to become my own loving parent, friend and companion. This isn't to say that I don't have amazing people in my life, I definitely do, but they can never truly provide me with the depth of love and support I can provide for myself. \n\nI am still in the process of reprogramming my internal landscape. I tell myself tons of times throughout the day that I love myself. I feel down into the difficult emotions in my body and hold them with love. I look at my wins throughout the day and celebrate them, and I forgive myself with understanding when I make a wrong step, always trying to take responsibility as much as possible. \n\nAll the exercise routines, healthy eating, sleep schedules etc. never lasted as I would eventually find a way to drag myself down again somewhere along the way. I've now quit drinking for good, look after myself well, and have a great internal world that supports me as I go. There's still lots of work to do, but I get great satisfaction out of doing it every day. \n\nTherapy was a huge help in helping me find this mindset shift, and honestly, I believe that a huge part of the therapeutic process is simply bringing the individual to a place where they love themselves. I'm now on the road to becoming a psychotherapist myself. \n\nThere's much more I could say, but focusing on this is enough. Just remember, you are enough just as you are. You are worthy of love.",

It is destroying my intestines lol I start each new day off feeling so much better, make a promise to myself I will not chew any gum. Then I trick myself into thinking I can have just one piece. Okay, then another two pieces. Okay, just one PACK. I can\u2019t stop after just one piece. It\u2019s just like they say in AA; \u201cone is too many and a thousand is never enough.\u201d I feel like it helps me to focus. I definitely get more cravings to chew gum when I\u2019m at work.

Unfortunately, I met her two months before she had already decided to move an hour and a half away.  During those two months, I was victorious over my porn and masturbation addiction...stayed away from all porn and jerking off completely, on top of the fact that I have yet to even have sex with her.  We are still committed to each other with texting and phone calls all the time, and are working out which weekends to get a hotel and just be in each other's presence hanging out inside and outside of our hotel room.\nHowever...the porn and masturbation has crept back in...mostly because I see her way less obviously than I used to.  This addiction makes me feel horribly immature and weak as a man.  I have always been hypersexual, and have always struggled with willpower in this department.  My willpower is amazing in every other aspect.  I guess, like someone mentioned above, it never goes away.  Just keep fighting the fight.  Thank you for the space to allow me to get this suffocation off my chest.",

Not in a exaggerate a story way or like to hurt people (although I do hurt people sometimes without even trying) \n\nMore of like a control thing, I'll lie about anything just to make sure people think what I want them to or don't have any uneeded information I feel could be a problem. The thing is that generally isn't really an issue in day to day life that I need to go to such extremes all the time. I even do it with my family and I have to constantly stop mid sentence and restart so I can make sure I'm honest. \n\nYesterday example, my mom asked how much I spent on a go kart for my kid. Instantly lied to downplay the price I paid to her even though there was no real threat to her knowing. It was only a couple hundred bucks, nothing would be to telling about my finances sharing how much I really paid nor do I care as my mom and I are very open.\n\nWent to the store to grab some stuff for my birthday, cashier asks how old I am turning? Instantly lie, dont want a stranger knowing my age. I only changed the answer my 1 year but just enough that they don't know. Why does the cashier really care how old I am? He doesn't, guy was just starting conversation to be polite. My mind is like a warzone so I play every scenario that way and I can't find the off button. \n\n\nFriend and I want to order food? Great, but I know what he wants and it's not the same as me. Why not just tell him I'm not in the mood for a burger and I want some pizza right? Nope I have to tell him me and my wife just went last week and the food was terrible etc. Just to make him feel as though he can choose something better on his own free will when in reality it's for me to choose what we eat without making it out like I'm forcing the choice.\n\nI'm trying to keep everything PG but it does escalate and alot of the time it's to manipulate and control and most of the time it's extremely unnecessary. \n\nI do this with my wife too and I will tell on myself later. She usually knows anyway when I do it at this point but I can tell it always leaves a level of uncertainty with things.\n\nI'm very loving, helpful, considerate, I take care of everyone. Even a stranger. I try my best to be good but I can't stop the lying and controlling. I'm still trying to regulate it better though. I will say I wonder if it's just a brain thing, like genetic. I've noticed my kid does this already even at a very young age and I'd really like to think it's not a taught behavior. It really accelerated after starting school so unsure.",

When she told me she wanted to just be friends, all I wanted to do was sit in my room and escape reality. But I couldn't bring myself to escape with TV or video games, so I went out with my brothers and just socialized. I'm so glad I fought the urge to isolate, because I feel so much more OK with this breakup (if it can be called that, since we only saw each other for a few weeks) than I feel like I should.

At the time, I thought I was chasing happiness and a fresh start, but it turned out to be a huge mistake. My affair partner got pregnant, and although I should have been feeling joy, I was consumed by doubt.\n\nNot long after, I found out she had been communicating with another man\u2014someone she claimed was just an old friend, although they had a sexual history. She swore nothing was going on between them, and that they hadn\u2019t seen each other around the time she got pregnant. But that didn\u2019t ease my doubts. I stumbled upon texts and emails, like the one where he told her he was thinking about her, which I read while using her phone.\n\nA week before she gave birth, I discovered they had been exchanging private emails behind my back for months. She insists that the baby is mine, but I can\u2019t help but wonder if I\u2019ve been deceived all along.\n\nReflecting on my actions, I realize how much I destroyed in pursuit of something that wasn\u2019t even real. I wrecked my marriage for a fantasy, and in the end, I\u2019m left with guilt, insecurity, and a lot of pain.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: I want to be better. I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that the decisions I made were rooted in selfishness and a lack of self-awareness. I\u2019ve committed to changing that. I\u2019m focusing on rebuilding myself, and hopefully, one day, regaining some form of self-respect.\n\nI can\u2019t undo the past, but I can learn from it. My goal now is to stop the cycle of hurt and dishonesty. I want to live with integrity and try to heal the damage I\u2019ve caused\u2014to myself, my ex-wife, and the people I\u2019ve hurt along the way.\n\nHas anyone else here gone through something like this and found a way to move forward? How do you keep yourself accountable in the process of becoming better? I could use some advice and encouragement as I try to navigate this path toward redemption.",

After the date I went to a bar alone and I\u2019m so mad at myself, I was ready to get the train home and it was like an automatic impulse, I just started walking towards the nearest bar.  I got really drunk and then when the bar shut I tried going to a club but the bouncers didn\u2019t let me in because I was too drunk.  I\u2019m so embarrassed, I kept trying to get in the club and was shouting at the bouncer, she had to keep pushing me back.  I work in a bar and know how annoying people like this can be so I\u2019m disappointed in myself that I\u2019d become one of them.  Then I bought a hotel room for the night as I\u2019d missed the last train and couldn\u2019t have my family see me in that state.  I\u2019m so embarrassed, I was doing really well.  I know I should be honest with my family but my mum gets extremely anxious and she becomes furious with me.  I\u2019d rather they didn\u2019t know and I work back towards sobriety.  I just feel bad lying to her.  ",

                    "body": "Hiya friend!\n\nThere's a sport called judo and the point of it is to grapple with another person to throw them onto the ground, back first. This means that in order to even START practicing this sport, you have to learn how to fall safely in all situations; when someone throws you, when you trip, when you fall to the back, the side, the front, etc. \n\nBut falling itself, unfortunately, is not something humans do regularly after learning how to walk properly. So at first falling properly using breakfall techniques will not only feel unnatural but also painful. When your entire bodyweight hits the ground, that's a lot of force; the breakfall techniques are meant to distribute that impact along your whole body so that it doesn't impact only one part of the body (for example: falling on your elbow will most likely break your arm, but falling with breakfall technique will have you hurt but not significantly injured).\n\nSo you have to practice this, over and over and over and over. Sometimes you'll forget to apply the technique correctly, like slapping the mat too late. But it's okay; as long as you recognize that oh! I fell, but I forgot to slap the mat at the time of impact. But next time I'll try to do it. And then you fall again, and again, and again. And you repeat this the next day. \n\nThe more you do this, the delay between the impact and you recognizing / doing the technique reduces. For example when you first start you'll fall, and in like 2 seconds you'll remember what to do. But by the end of your week 4 you'll be falling pretttyyyy naturally. That's just the power of intentional repetition. \n\nWhy I'm seemingly going off in this wild tangent is, the same applies to your situation. You are recognizing after 12 hours now, the impact of your impulse. But what matters here is, you *did* recognize. Now you just keep recognizing when you have the impulse, hopefully aiming to recognize after 11 hours. Then keep going with life, trying your best to recognize the impulse, but even when you're late you could perhaps recognize in 3 hours instead of 12. Then more time will go on and eventually you will be able to catch yourself mid-impulse; or sometimes pre-impulse.\n\nRecognition stops your internal clock so that you can make an informed choice on whether to proceed with this behavior or not. An impulse is an impulse because it's so automatic and fast. Recognition already short-circuits that process so it's a great beginning step. Of course all of your REASONS to drink will stay the same, and that will have to be examined for prolonged progress but I just wanted to give you words of encouragement about how addiction control works in general.",
