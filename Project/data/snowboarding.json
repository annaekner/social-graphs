            "text": "Hello, I have taken this screenshot from an instagram account (travels.jw) and I was absolutely shocked at the price of ski passes in the US compared to those in any other country in Europe. I'm from Italy and I already thought it was incredibly expensive to buy a skipass for the price of \u20ac60, whereas in the US it's normal to buy one for basically half the price of a whole board??? I was so naive thinking that I could afford a snowboarding holiday in the US, turns out I am way better off in my home country. \n\nHow do you guys even afford it? What's the point of snowboarding in the US? It is assumed that snowboarding/skiing is an expensive sport, but US snowboarders are you okay? What's your secret to affording these insane passes?",

Before that, most of these resorts and mountains were independently owned, relatively cheap prices, but fighting to stay afloat. Since Vail and Alterra came in, all of the premier started selling what I\u2019ll call \u2018global\u2019 season passes. So now instead of buying a season pass to one mountain, you can buy a \u2018global\u2019 pass for 3x the price and get access to a ton of these other resorts. \n\nWhat this did was force the locals used to buying 3,4,$500 passes into buying $1000 passes, and then Vail/Alterra could focus on catering to the richest of the rich by charging the prices you shared in your screenshot.",

Most slope side resorts offer free passes for all guests and every day they stay, but hey it might make you feel better when your paying >$300/night to get a free \u201c$300\u201d pass. It\u2019s a marketing scam and of course they don\u2019t care if there are people that stay off slope and pay the ticket window price. So if you are going to stay somewhere cheap and want to ride the big hills on ski vacation in the U.S. (and a few international spots) check out the Ikon pass or Epic pass. On the flip side there are a lot of fun smaller resorts that still have decent price. Last year my wife and I were rv\u2019ers in Blue River Oregon for ski season and I rode Hoodoo. It was a fun little resort and they offered a decent 5 day pass deal that were fully transferable and could be used on the same day. Bonus: they had rv parking, but we have a travel trailer and would have been best with a C class.",

I watch everyone else spend their money on the most sad pathetic shit. If you don\u2019t like the prices maybe you\u2019re spending too much on other shit or are not as big into skiing as you thought. \n\nThe value is there, the amount of skiing I get and the quality skiing I get compared to the other \u201c cheaper\u201d resorts is laughable. \n\nI would never waste a winter at some slow lift, small terrain, cheap mountain. I\u2019d pay 6,000 a year on passes if they gave me double the terrain and faster lifts. The people that pay these prices WANT TO SKI. The people that bitch about them have other priories. \n\nBy the way I\u2019m a tile installer in the northwest so not exactly rich\u2026 lol",

I remember going down the mountain thinking to myself, this is fun but not worth it. Snowboarding and skiing in Colorado is a terrible value. I don't have much desire to go when I see how much it will cost, I'd rather do other things for that amount of money at this point. \n\nAlso, if it always snowed in Colorado it would still be a terrible value. But now, Colorado is not even close to being reliable from a snow standpoint. You can't do any pre-planning if you're going to travel to go snowboarding in Colorado, otherwise you might be out $2-4k with a 30in base and snowboarding over rocks and dirt.

Also it's massive.\n\nFYI if you plan to ski to the Italian side make sure you check on the requirements. We had to pay a $10 upgrade to our passes and were told to bring our passports.

Because of the wide lens it seems like skier was really uphill but when the snowboarder decided to cut across there is no way skier can see her coming unless he turns his head to look if he is clear.\nMy question is skiing or snowboarding, do you have the right of way to cut across as long as you are clear of anybody infront of you? Can you just cut across from one end to the other and it is the responsibility of the people behind you to watch out for you? Somebody gave a traffic example. Can you just change lanes and cut people off and say it\u2019s their responisibility to make sure they don\u2019t hit me\n\nPS. I am not a member of this subreddit. I don\u2019t ski or snowboard.

The skier started in the right most section and was carving to the middle. The displacement made by the snowboarder is more based on the start of the video than the skier who is consistently in the same course. \n\n-The run curves towards the right, so the snowboarder should have been a bit more aware that the near, mountain side of the track is technically faster as it covers less distance. You can clearly see how far the snowboarder drifted from the edge marker from the beginning to the post crash shot. \n\nHaving said that, I would still hold the skier at fault at 80% for not seeing the snowboarder come closer to them, but I also partially blame the snowboarder at 20% for going across the run without ever looking to see who might be barreling downhill, and for lack of situational awareness.",

Its not so big that you would automatically hard stop to check, but just big enough that if a bunch of kids sit under it(versus stand) you wont see.\n\nInevitably i almost hit them but managed to avoid them at the last moment as they popped into vision.\n\nI shouted to my partner who asked me what happened and i just said those kids sat under a blood hill and i almost hi them.  They must have heard because they all started shifting to their lefts as much as possible\u2026.\n\nIt is literally an inexperienced thing and young people thing and thats that.

You should have known he was close to you, as he was basically beside you at times... Especially if you're about to stop in the middle of a run.\n\nIgnore all the idiots telling you to sue... Holy shit, is that the American answer to everything? Dude broke his femur... He has enough problems to deal with. If he's dumb enough to try to sue you, you have video evidence to shut that down quickly.\n\nHe did not run into you intentionally... Nobody does that. Perhaps he was trying to buzz the tower, but I guarantee there was no intent to injure.\n\nGetting sick of this whole skier vs snowboarder thing... People are dumb, regardless of what they strap to their feet to slide down a mountain. \n\nWhat I see here is 2 people with no spatial awareness and even less luck. Sucks that you were both hurt...

I dropped a pencil like 3 days in and went for it with the wrong arm- shooting pain, but that also means it wasn\u2019t hurting at all just resting on the desk, my mind was totally off it.\n\nThe leg- bit misleading, I only cracked it really.  I had a nonossifying fibroma, a big spongy part in my bone, and one day when I was running I felt something pop.  I cried, which isn\u2019t cool in 6th grade, limped to the nurse, then couldn\u2019t even put weight on it when I got to the doctor\u2019s.  Had to use my 5 foot tall mom as a crutch, good times (thanks mom!).  I got incredibly lucky, I basically had a cm of good bone on the other side and nothing else, otherwise my femur mighta collapsed a solid inch right above the growth plate in my knee.  Anyways, I got cadaver bone inserted, a metal plate, a cast that went around my waist so I had to bathroom in a bedpan, physical therapy, a second surgery to remove the plate, more therapy, boom good as new, kinda.  I think I went through 1/5th the pain a full break would be, and would rather break my collarbone once a month than break my femur ever.  Just the physical therapy alone was worse than anything with the collarbone.\n\nAnyways OP, hope you and powderhead over there heal up alright!",

I suspect this starts with their education - you know, riding all in a line, following each other in a snake taking up the entire run? They never stop doing that, they just do it one-by-one.\n\nLike, sure, there's a time and a place for turning for turning's sake, I've carved down plenty of green runs for the amusement, but skiing and snowboarding is meant to be about getting from point A to point B, not meandering around aimlessly.\n\nAnd the weird thing about the fact that I only realized this now is that I skied for a decade and snowboarded for two - I've spent 30 years on the slopes, a third of it on skis, and I never really looked at just why the hell the people around me were doing what they were doing. Probably because the people I'm around were mostly racers, so the above doesn't apply.",

At 22, he became the first person from Chamonix to climb Everest and the first person to ever snowboard down it. Despite skepticism from some older climbers, Marco's philosophy was clear: embrace the daring while you're young. His daring spirit earned him several firsts, including the Nant Blanc on the north face of Aiguille Verte at age 20. Marco\u2019s descent records spanned formidable routes in the Alps and the Himalayas.\n\nBorn in Chamonix, Marco was no stranger to the mountains\u2014 **his brother died in an avalanche** when Marco was just 2. Despite this, he was drawn to the mountains. At 20, he made his first notable feat by snowboarding down the Nant Blanc on the north face of the Aiguille Verte (in the Alps and one of the highest peaks in the Mont Blanc massif). By 1999, he was tackling 8000-meter summits, preparing for his ultimate challenge: Everest.\n\nIn May 2001, Marco made his first successful descent from Everest, becoming the first person to climb all the way up with his snowboard and ride down. Beyond Everest, Marco\u2019s other remarkable achievements included first descents on the north faces of the Tacul and Chardonnet, the west couloirs of the Aiguillettes du Tacul and Col du Diable, the Diagonal on the south face of Mont Maudit, and the south ridge of the 6034-meter Tocllaraju in Peru.\n\nUnfortunately, on September 8, 2002, Marco attempted his second descent from Everest via the Hornbein Couloir. Tragically, he never returned, and his disappearance remains a mystery, with his tracks vanishing at 8,500 meters. Marco\u2019s fearless legacy endures, echoing his belief in living boldly while you can.\n\nA true shredder.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l65iad0tl1bd1.jpeg?width=560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=870b85287b43f68be6d24c7d49672740d2c8f750",

Nor any other protection. It was only when I was 18 when I decided to go for both a helmet and a back protector. My younger brother, a couple of years younger, never had any lessons without helmet. When he started, they gave out a free rental helmet to all younsters and later, that became obligated to be able participate in skischool. In Europe, at least, Austria, the big turn around in wearing helmets must have been in the same periode, somewher early 00's up to 10's...

Especially in the case of people who summit and die on the descent, they often get summit fever, push further than they should, and run out of energy to get down.\n\nEven when that doesn't happen, descending is inherently a bit more dangerous because each step down is effectively a small fall downward. You're at the mercy of gravity every step you take, it only takes one small slip and with your momentum already heading down, you can easily end up in a fatal fall.\n\nThink about climbing a ladder, then think about trying to descend a ladder with your back to the ladder as if you were walking down a staircase. Which sounds easier? Probably climbing up.\n\nMaybe you could mitigate that danger by down climbing rather than descending, which is to say basically climbing in reverse with your face against the mountain, and in some spots in big mountains that is necessary...but you don't want to do that the whole way down because it would take forever and a lot of energy.\n\nAlso, being in the death zone about 8km is a bit of silent killer, it is constantly sucking the life out of you but it can be easy to not realize how much until you finally just hit the wall, or you run out of adrenaline, or whatever.\n\nAnd *then* you add in the factor that most of the people on Everest these days aren't there because they're great mountaineers, but rather just because they paid to be there, and it's a recipe for consistent disaster sadly.",

This happens way too often in the park and on non-slow / learning zones. I ride the same way I drive: looking constantly around me to avoid a collision. Now, I calculate well my carves based on a prediction of how other riders will ride around me. I try to pass at more than 1m/3ft for safety margin reasons. However, just because I sped near you doesn't mean I could have hit you (except if you suddenly snake me, which according to the mountain safety code, you'd be in the right). If all skiers and intermediate snowboarders especially would be more aware and less eager to appropriate the entire 30m/90ft width of the run especially in the park and black runs, my fast carves would not be that close. If you are going to carve throughout the entire run, at least leave the edges clear so that fast riders can also enjoy the sport (My hypothesis also applies to skiing)",

It takes a lot longer for snowboarders to reach the same speed as skiers without poles since snowboarders rely purely on gravity or their back foot, which is a pain to unstrap and restrap when already moving. When skiers block snowboarders path, snowboarders have to slow down, lose their momentum and then often fail to reach the same speeds again, making us fall behind our skiers friends. \n\nI\u2019ve rode with plenty of skiers as the only snowboarder. Skiers often forget that we lack poles and will often stop somewhere not conducive to snowboarders. I see it all the time and then end up having to hop or shimmy or worse, unstrap a foot to go marginally uphill, and by then my skier friends are gone bc they forget snowboarders can\u2019t just stop in a dip or flat terrain! \n\nHope that helps. And it was probably me yelling at you to get out of the way!",

Im quite scared at this point that im going to get hit which makes me constantly look uphill, stop at any crowd, waiting for big gaps that sometimes take minutes, and often Ill let someone pass only for them to then stop right in front of me and wait for me. I go then they blast past me 3 feet away. \n\nI try to stay to the sides of the hill but its often the most bumpy terrain and where I see the fastest people blasting down to avoid the middle crowd. Obviously these people are good enough to dodge me 99% of the time but I know its a recipe for disaster. This has led me to only be doing powdered blacks recently which I love but dont seem to help me improve much due to the forgiveness of powder.",

The vast majority of snowboarders never ride switch. There is no bio mechanical advantage to that position. In fact it is disadvantageous when carving. You don\u2019t have to bomb to carve. The guy in the video is not bombing.\n\nNope he's not bombing. He's licking distance away from the ground which as I wrote, is hardcore carving. \n\nYou're making the assumption that carving is the only thing snowboarders do. Dunno where you ride, but here in Japan it's still a pretty niche/advanced thing to do. The majority of riders fall into the beginner/intermediate category. As such, duck stance is by far an easier stance for getting rotation in your turns. You turn with posi/posi using tilt - something most beginner and intermediate riders have trouble doing. \n\nRiding switch for a majority of riders is still very important if you get yourself in a situation you can't ride out of. \n\n \n\n>You ever see anyone ride a surfboard duck?\n\nThat's kind of irrelevant to bring up.

Fast forward to 3 years ago, I buy a board and I'm riding a bit more. 6 or 7 trips a year, so started getting better and trying to improve my riding. Luckily when I bought the board I also decided to just buy a helmet. I was riding and about to go through a tunnel, pretty steep before the tunnel so alot of people brake alot and it was pretty much just ice, lost control and slammed the back of my head into the boulder walls surrounding the tunnel prior to entering. Helmet fine, im fine but it was such a smack I always wonder what woulda happened if I didn't just get a helmet before that trip. Anyway, get a helmet. Things like this, catching an edge or even someone slamming into u out of control make it worth it.",

Also rode BMX for most of that time without one. \n\nThe one thing that eventually got me to wear one was when I found out they were putting speakers in the ear pads. Thought that sounded pretty cool and got a Bern helmet with speakers built in for Christmas. It is a great compromise of still being able to hear your surroundings while listening to music. Especially now that everything is bluetooth. \n\nNow I always wear one. Snowboard helmets are pretty comfortable. But I would highly recommend going to a local shop (or multiple) and trying on helmets in person. Each brand makes helmets that are shaped a little differently. Some fit your head shape better than others. \n\nI was in the market for an MTB helmet like 1 year ago and went to a bike shop that had like 15 different options. Tried on a couple, then I put on the Fox helmet and instantly it felt way better than anything else. It has a BOA style tightener on the back to fine tune how tight you want it. But before even touching that it was snug on my head without being uncomfortable at all. \n\nIf you see this and think buying a helmet is a good idea, it is. But it's the kind of thing you should avoid buying online if you can help it. An uncomfortable helmet that flops around everywhere is going to annoy you, making you want to take it off. But a good, properly fitting helmet doesn't get in your way at all. You can almost forget you're wearing it.",

The key finding was that increased helmet use (from 69% to 80%) was not associated with a reduction in reported head injuries. Over the study period, the average rate of reported head injuries was 0.2/1000 skier visits, with a statistically significant variation (P < 0.001). The line of best fit showed an non-significant upward trend (P = 0.13). Lacerations were the only subcategory of head injuries that decreased significantly with helmet use. A higher proportion of people who reported a head injury were wearing a helmet than for injuries other than to the head. Skiers were more likely to report a head injury when wearing a helmet than snowboarders (P < 0.001 cf. P = 0.22). There were significant differences in characteristics of helmet and non-helmet wearers. Helmet wearers were more likely to be: young adults (P < 0.001); beginner/novices (P = 0.004); and snowboarders (P < 0.001), but helmet wearing was not associated with gender (P = 0.191). Further research is needed to explore the possible reasons for the failure of helmets to reduce head injuries, for example, increased reporting of head injuries and increased risk-taking combined with over-rating of the helmets' protection. \n\n [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26688174/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26688174/) \n\nNah, ur the idiot.",

Helmets for snow sports have similar ratings though I'm not as familiar with them, but I know Snell has one, there's an ASTM rating, among others. There is a reason why every governing body of sports with impacts *requires* helmets, to include snow sports. I take my car to track days, the absolute minimum they require for a street prepped car is a motorcycle rated helmet but a karting or better, SA rated helmet is preferred if not required. \n\nHelmets are proven to mitigate injury, as mentioned by OP the fucking doctor agrees that without a helmet it could have easily been a cerebral hemorrhage. Like, if you don't like a helmet and don't want to wear one by all means that's your prerogative. But they're proven to work, that's why stuff where you're likely to hit your head requires them.",

No one I know who's been riding a long time (And I ride with someone regularly who's been riding as long as I've been alive) has ever mentioned helmets being required and was following the \"old ways\" of not wearing one until last season because she finally felt out of place not wearing one. Resorts are under zero obligation to force anyone to wear any safety equipment, and why would they when it's free and arguably more money to just let people take it at their own risk? After all, it's not a sport free of injury and is very much an \"at your own risk\" sport. You sign a blanket waiver whenever you're getting a ticket or pass absolving the resorts of any liability of injury not otherwise directly caused by them. You're an adult, you're allowed to make your own decisions for personal safety. But being a helmet denier is just stupid.\n\nHelmets are proven to work consistently in every sport that uses them, including governing bodies of snow sports. It's not some scheme to get people to buy things they don't need. I assure you the Air Force doesn't make me wear a helmet for fun, no one wants to wear an HGU-55/P less than the people wearing them, they fucking suck. But does the AF want a pilot or crewmember to slam their head against something in turbulence and be out cold? Absolutely fucking not. The stakes might be lower in snowboarding *but the risks are still there*. Hitting your head against things is bad, mitigating how badly you hit your head can be the difference between braindead (or just dead) and a concussion and some lost brain function. Of course more commonly the difference is between a concussion and just a minor head injury/no injury at all, but if you think concussions aren't that big a deal, talk to someone who's been hit in the head a few times. Many of them, one of my best friends included, have serious frustration about the fact they simply cannot do things like they used to be able to do. Imagine being an engineering major and then getting a couple concussions and having once simple math be difficult for you",

We have tons of evidence to prove they improve safety, and is evident by the widespread requirement to wear them in any impact based activities. I'm starting to think the concussions added up for you big dawg, you might be 30 something but you argue like a 12 year old.

You obviously saw me take my gear off, leave it with my 4 year old\u2019s snowboard, and go in to take her to warm up and grab some food. You decided to knock over her gear, take her dad\u2019s stuff, and to ruin her day-not like she can get in the chairs without me there with her.   Nevermind that im a single dad who gets less time that he likes with the kiddo. You stole over 2 grand of my stuff, and I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re stupid and can\u2019t use it.  I hope you get a lot of good riding in on a 3d printed powder board on the ice coast, you deranged muppet. I brought it out to bust it in (as brand spanking new and was Breckenridge bound later this month) and slide behind my daughter as I instructed her.   I hope the dynamic chambers on the 3d print channel the snow directly up your tuchas if you ever strap in. \n\n\nThere is low and then there is stealing something completely assanine from the crappiest learning mountain in the northeast from someone obviously teaching their kid.

Here\u2019s my board theft story: I grew up skiing but switched to snowboarding in grade 7 because skiing wasn\u2019t cool anymore. I quickly became a park rat and would bum a ride off whoever I could to get to the local hill. My aunt was a big supporter as she had no kids, was close to my siblings and I\nand would offer to pick me up. One day she came with her partner at the time and offered to buy me some food before doing some park laps to show my new moves. We went inside and I didn\u2019t lock my board up for the first time. We come back out and the board is gone. I\u2019m 13 maybe at this point and have saved and spent everything on snowboarding. We search everywhere, but it\u2019s a small place and obvious my board isn\u2019t there. We report it to the front desk and start walking to the car. Im a total wreck at this point. Take most of my rage out on my helmet. Her partner had noticed a truck doing donuts in the parking lot at some point. He suggests we head to a nearby hill and look around. We arrive, talk to ski patrol and report what had happened as well. As we\u2019re talking a truck matching the description appears. Her partner talks to the driver and notices the truck had 4 others in it. I look in the bed and see there is 20+ boards. I see my board sitting near the top. I tell him and he grabs it as they rip out of the parking lot. Ski patrol chased them down the road on snowmobiles but ultimately couldn\u2019t keep up. This is all reported to the police instantly with a number of others. Months go by then years and they are eventually convicted through an organized crime ring and served jail time. I have since gone back to skiing but I still have the board and ride it occasionally.",

I wish you the best and hope this problem resolves quickly, so you can get back to shredding with your little one. Much love \u2764\ufe0f.",

Played by all the rules and ended up getting mowed over by an out of control jerry that was there on vacation. The edge of his ski gashed the back of my head dangerously close to my spinal chord, and I had a concussion from my head smacking the ice (it was spring time). No permanent damage other than a scar, but it made me realize the dangers of the sport, even when 99% of the time it seems so mellow. Stay safe everybody",

At least not while they're still learning the basics of the game. \n\nWhen I played in college, we never went full contact in practice unless it was a drill specifically designed to work on tackling technique. I think this school of thought is becoming more widespread for younger age groups, but it sure as hell wasn't when I was growing up. I'm only 26. \n\nWe played bull in the ring, Oklahomas, and numerous other games, some of which are illegal now. None of them did anything to teach you fundamentals, but to \"toughen\" you up.",

Unfortunately for me, when I did the board cut right into the ice, snapping my one ankle and spraining the other one. So, in essence my  board stopped but my body didn't. Ended up waling half way down the hill and slid the rest. Ski patrol said if I walked partially down it wasn't broken. Went to the doctor the next day and the xray confirmed it was broken.\n\nHad a lot of trouble getting back on a black diamond, let alone go fast.  Now I am more confident and relaxed paying particular attention to what edge I am on and what needs to be done. My legs are stronger than ever so I can really dig in to slow down rapidly.

The intermediate rider initiates turns with their knees and the advance riders initiate turns with their ankles.

While more surface will mean more contact, it also means the weight is more distributed and the force between the two objects will remain the same. What does affect friction is the roughness of the material in contact with another object or the ground in this instance. So going faster on an edge or riding flat is really determined by two things:\n1. If a board is properly waxed and maintained then the flat surface is often smoother than the metal edge, but marginally so\n\nand more importantly \n\n2. The skill of the rider as riding flat you will have much less stability and not feel comfortable reaching a maximum velocity because you\u2019re more likely to eat it.",

I\u2019m not a lift operator nor do I have technical knowledge of how lifts work. But I do know that the cable is under tension and a quick, unexpected, change in the weight can do a lot of harm. The example I always point to is the accident at Northstar on the T-Bar back in 07/08. I don\u2019t remember all the details but someone(s) did something while riding that cause the cable to come out from under one of the wheels on a tower causing the cable to fly up several feet. This launched another t bar rider up into the air. That person died I believe. \n\nSo while it may seem you\u2019re only taking your own life into your hands when doing this, you could be endangering a lot more people.",

Falls of over 16 feet or something also have to be reported. \n\nWhile it probably won't do any harm the lift is not designed to have 180 lbs unsprung in the middle of the lift. It could cause a Shockwave up the line that could oscillate just right to derail the lift. Or some 8 year old sees you doing it and tries themselves and falls neck first. \n\nIt's one of those play stupid games win stupid prizes things.

This dude up on hood lit a cigarette after chugging a beer. Watched this guy intentionally slip out of the chair and dropped a good thirty or so feet onto the steep of a black diamond and zoomed all the way down at what looked like 1000 mph to this little boy at the time. \n\nAlso saw a little kid on the express lift swinging his skis headed up with his dad two chairs in front of me. He then fell at one of the high points and dropped. Dad freaked out obviously. He was about to jump down. Luckily a bunch of people rallied on the run and checked on kiddo who was fine as he fell right at base of the pole where there was a ton of towed and fresh powder saving his ass. Who knows little kids are made of rubber but still.\n\nIf you see any younglings swinging on the lift yell at them please especially when at top of mountain on a cold icy day.",
