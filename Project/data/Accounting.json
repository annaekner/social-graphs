            "text": "So last week were at client for an audit and I met the CEO and CFO and were talking. The CEO made a comment saying, \"That's a nice watch for just a staff.\" Today I come into the office with an email from the partner asking me to not wear my grandfathers watch at clients. Apparently I disrespected the clients employees by \"flaunting my wealth\" while we were there. I guess my negative net worth hit an integer overflow and now I am intimidatingly wealthy.\n\nHow would you all respond to this? I have to go back next for their single audit.\n\n  \n[The Watch in question](http://imgur.com/a/nzcX1p0)",

I\u2019m sure it means a lot to you and it\u2019s weird that it brought out a negative reaction. I would not wear returning to the client since the client appears to be a man child. Perhaps wear it on your next engagement and so on. It obviously hurt that persons ego that a mere staff has a nice watch and them, a CEO or CFO does not. Don\u2019t see why anyone really cares.

The guy was just an asshole who wanted to complain about anything, and your clients are assholes too.

They will feed clients a line about not having this or that, so next year when the client has this or that and the work and fees magically increase...clients get pissed.  I think most of you miss this dynamic.  Clients are paying for a service and auditors often just focus on their own workload given to them by the audit manager.  Clients will tolerate a certain amount because of high switching costs, but there are limits.  You aren't privvy to those conversations that are taking place offline.\n\nSo you may have walked into a client getting frustrated with your firm, and he picked out a landmark to exaggerate his point to the partner whom he feels is exploiting the situation.  That landmark was your watch.  Partner either doesn't get it, or wants to take that excuse away.  The client isn't mad at you, he's mad at your partner.",

Told me he didn't want to see me wearing it on my belt after lunchtime\n\nI lost all enthusiasm with working with \"masters\" of the craft after that, what a prick, and even after lunch he was teasing me like i'm one of those kids buying a camera and calling myself a cinematographer shooting youtube videos.

While I think it's a bit messed up that a piece of equipment would trigger someone, I understand the whole 'keep the status quo'. My dad is a physician and he told me a story once about a young receptionist who was a little full of herself in the clinic he worked at. Most physicians will call each other by their last names out of convenience/respect/equality, whatever you want to call it, they just do. But to everyone else it's Dr. Lastname. So anyway, she kept trying to get this other doc's attention and called him by his last name only to summon him over to confirm something. My dad told her after the fact, in no uncertain terms, that physicians are to be addressed as Dr. Lastname and only once she's a physician is she able to address other doctors by their last name only. \n\nAnyway, he wasn't mean about it, he's one of the most humble people I know and is a genuinely caring person and normally doesn't give a hoot about status or any of that BS. As he says, he can never advance into administration (not that he wants to) because he won't waste his day playing golf and kissing ass.\n\nSo I get it. There are plenty of people out there who like to lord their fancy doctorate over everyone else (obvs not my dad) and be a prick but I do understand wanting to uphold the status quo in business. If everyone starts walking around with a lightmeter, maybe it's not so important anymore! ...jk, I have no idea wtf a lightmeter is and what its significance is but I think I made my point haha.",

This was back in 2017, same year I graduated film school. I now am an owner op gaffer with a 3 tonne truck package (just some aputure shit). \n\nIt\u2019s funny, after lunch his words when he teased me were \u201caw mummy bought me RED camera for my birthday so I\u2019m a DP now). We were in Malaysia so this kind of issue of super young owner op DP\u2019s wasn\u2019t a thing yet but actually it is now even here. I can understand his insecurity from the UK market lol but he didn\u2019t have to take it out on an aspiring third world kid.\n\nMy local mentor gaffer who encouraged me to bring a lightmeter to set to learn even if I wasn\u2019t gaffing/DP wasn\u2019t on this show unfortunately. Anyway the DP spoke to me quite softly but sternly, you know, in a British way, lol so it wasn\u2019t a public reprimand but his tone was serious compared to his usual banter with his mates.\n\nTo this day I always try to be kind to newcomers and have a somewhat informal shadowing program where guys and gals can join my department if the production is ok with it to learn the ropes in lighting/grip.",

Im trying my best to not do the mistakes my managers do to my team. Sometimes it\u2019s the culture of the company.\n\n1) it\u2019s the management who don\u2019t want \u201cany risk\u201d so that they can always hide behind \u201cyou said it and I did it\u201d attitude and throw the confirmation email on the clients face. I mean, that should be the last resort. Clients come to us for solutions and we\u2019re hiding behind that is absolute cowardly. \n\n2) the management doesn\u2019t plan knowledge transfer effectively. Some fellows just are petty and will never share the process knowledge with their juniors and leave in a short time after the transition and they\u2019re stuck and the management is too pussy to ask for a refresher. \n\n3) innovative ideas, there\u2019s tons being given out here. The problem with outsourcing to a third party company is that when they bring up that idea, the work hours reduce and the billing reduces and it\u2019s a direct hit on their income. So they don\u2019t encourage innovation in the processes. \nClients love innovation and they\u2019re delighted when that happens and actually get us more work, the management doesn\u2019t see that. \n\n\n4) to be honest, it\u2019s a fucking rat race here. Everyone wants to get ahead in life. A lot of folks just learn the accounting by heart and not truly understand the concept. The education system is absolutely broken here. It\u2019s focussed on learning things by heart and not focusing on the concepts. 75 years of independence and the government refuses to fix that dump.\n\n5) the management at US wants to give the contract to the lowest bidder to show maximum savings to the shareholders. The lowest bidder keeps lower head count and pay lower than the market rates and keep longer work hours here so nobody sticks to a company here. Cost of living is rising and 2-3K USD per annum (yep US $3K per annum) isn\u2019t sufficient to survive where these jobs are located. Wherever they are, the costs rises sharply. Especially the rents.",

The courts have upheld that employees and prospective employees are permitted to discuss wages in **NLRB v. Main Street Terrace Care Center (1997)**.\n\nIf the accounting firms, sent this email, it would be a clear violation of the National Labor Relations Act. \"It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section 7\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7158(a)(1). \n\nWhile it's clear your post violates the spirit of the National Labor Relations Act, it's unclear if a university would be held liable in these circumstances.

This is still a very grey area, and you must trust that they will keep your personal information confidential.\n \nThe issue is that students are sharing details in offer letters with their peers and using exact details to leverage offers with firms. Salaries and compensation should not be discussed amongst peers/colleagues. This is simply a best practice.\u201d",

That sort of practical application is immensely valuable to us as students and in positioning us well in our future careers. We understand the principle of appreciation and that salary generally increases, so being able to establish as competitive a salary as possible at the beginning of our post-graduate careers means we will maximize our long term earnings. That's a good accounting practice. Second, as accountants, we are required to know GAAP and other relevant laws and regulations. The relevant regulation for individuals discussing their own salary (including job offers) is from the NLRB, which clearly states that it is illegal for employers to prohibit employees from discussing pay. If multiple employers collude to penalize candidates from discussing pay, that is even more troubling and raises concerns about cartel-like behavior.",

If PwC, for instance, decides they will no longer recruit from this masters program because of this problem, it\u2019s not the companies that are losing out it\u2019s the students. So I see both the students\u2019 and schools\u2019 sides on this one.\n\nLast thought is that being right doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get fucked over. These companies care 100x more if you\u2019re messing with their other employees being content worker bees than missing out on one recruit who\u2019s a slightly better than average worker bee. You should be able to share salary with no issues, doesn\u2019t mean issues won\u2019t come down the line. Again, the students are the ones who are losing out because of this.",

Isn't it less expensive to pay your existing employees more and inspire loyalty, than it is to hire new people and train them?  \n\n\nWell, I have the answer to that above question.  \n\n\nThe answer is that 90% of the professionals do not job hop, and never will.  They stay at the same company for 10 years, 20 years, etc.  The \"Loyalty\" a company tries to inspire is code for \"We get to pay you less, drone\".  \n\n\nI recommend to anyone starting a professional career in most things that they want to job hop about every 3 years.",

It was a shit night, dishwasher didn't show, prep didn't do the work they should have... it was frustrating all over the place, and when I brought it up to the sous, he was very dismissive. So, we're mid-service, I have a stove with 8 burners and cooking all my stuff, but I'm pissed, so am leaning back against my table - back to the sous chef expediting - and kind of stewing. But I'm doing my job. He yells out, \"Hey, John! Turn around and look like you care!\"\n\nSo, I turn off all my burners, turn around, and say \"I don't\" and walked out. I went to the bar around the corner I'd usually get a post-work pint, but this was about 7:45pm... bartender says, \"you look like you just finished your last exam\" (we were in a college town). I said, \"No, I think I just quit my job.\" I have several pints before getting home, and this was mid-90s, so there was a tape answering machine, and the chef left me a message, \"John, it's Jo, call me back\". Well, I was a bit pissed... in either sense of the term, so I just went to bed.\n\nI woke up in the morning, put on my nicest clothes because I intended to knock on doors for a new job. But first, out of respect for the chef (who I love to this day), I stopped by to apologize for walking out. \n\nShe said the sous called her immediately and his first words were \"Chef, I fucked up\". And she didn't blame me. \n\nNow, self-aggrandizing shit or whatever you want to call it that I was, I asked, \"but what will my punishment be\". She said none. I actually argued that, saying we just had two new hires, we can't let them think my behavior was proper. Ed, the GM, was our for the weekend, so she said she'd touch base with him when he came back. I worked the weekend.\n\nSo, Monday comes, and I ask if she spoke with Ed, and she said \"yes, and he agrees there shouldn't be any punishment.\" For whatever reason, I said, \"I just don't want to set a bad example to the new cooks.\" So, she asked me, \"well, is there a day you want to be suspended?\" And I was scheduled 6 days that week, so I said, \"Honestly, I could use Wednesday off.\" And she said, \"OK, you're suspended on Wednesday.\"\n\nSo, no raise or bonus, but doing something I still think was wrong of me, I did get a day off of my choice.",

That's intended: a lot of programming is searching for solutions.

            "text": "As you might recall, [three weeks ago I posted about how the AICPA is illegally hiding salary info on their job postings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1fk2ipk/the_aicpa_is_so_committed_to_keeping_its_salaries/). I noticed that the bottom of each job posting included an email for AICPA Human Resources. After HR ignored the first few emails, I sent a followup reminding them that Colorado has fined noncompliant employers and [sent them a link to the list of employers that have been fined](https://cdle.colorado.gov/dlss/equal-pay-for-equal-work-act). That finally got a response, but they only updated a single job posting. \n\nAfter more followups, AICPA HR then stated that they wanted to have a Teams call to discuss my request. I declined to have a call, and [asked them to contact state regulators if they found it too difficult and confusing to add a salary range to a job posting](https://imgur.com/a/oKUJCYL). Finally, after several more days of radio silence, they emailed yesterday to confirm they had updated all postings with salary info.\n\nNow that pay is public, let's have a look! Here's a [Lead Manager role requiring a CPA and six years of public accounting experience, but paying only $90k](https://aicpa.referrals.selectminds.com/jobs/remote-lead-manager-peer-review-3085). Fair market rate for this type of role in a MCOL market like North Carolina is ~$140k, which might explain why the AICPA wanted to keep pay info a secret.",

And they say kids these days are getting too many participation trophies...\n\n>On the day Melancon learned he had passed the CPA Exam, a Bergeron partner removed himself from a Society of Louisiana CPAs committee and had Melancon inserted as his replacement.\n\nCould you imagine a Baby Boomer like Melancon giving a young person a chance like what he got?

It\u2019s just varying degrees of tolerance towards the work. Some people naturally \u201cget it\u201d, so naturally, they will feel happy from being rewarded for doing a job that they think is easy and intuitive to perform. That\u2019s not the case with most accountants, who instead coalesce around this sub to ask questions exactly like yours.",

Pizza is usually the best bang for your buck to feed a group easily. I wasn't high pay management, I had people under me that made more than me.\n\n2. If you can't all eat at the same time it's one of the more forgiving foods to eat cool or easily reheated.\n\n3. (Almost) everyone will eat pizza if you offer them some. I could order some with meat, some veggie, a vegan one, and everyone could have something to eat. If I were to order Korean fried chicken or whatever some people would complain and not eat it. They'll still complain about pizza but not as much.\n\n4. I tried letting them all decide what food to get once when they complained it was always pizza and they argued most of the morning and couldn't agree on any other restaurant then finally decided back on pizza.\n\n5. Even giving the choice of toppings would result in a lot of arguing as nobody could agree on what to get. Joe wants pepperoni and mushroom, Jim hates mushroom with his pepperoni and wants olives but Sarah hates olives. If I just ordered a variety though Jim would choose slices with mushroom despite refusing to get it if offered a choice when ordering.\n\nEventually you realize you can't make everyone happy with the budget you have available, but you still want to do at least something so you get a stack of random pizza and set it out for everyone.",

Do not believe anyone at the company who says it's rude to ask for salary upfront. They are just gaslighting you into getting lowballed. That's not an employer you want to work for. It is totally acceptable to ask for salary that's an important part of why we work, to make money and support ourselves.\n\nApply for jobs that fit your salary range.

            "text": "I work at a mid-tier firm and we had some interns that started a few weeks ago. Since we\u2019re encouraged to utilize the interns I picked up one of them to help out with cash on one of my audits. I figured it would be a good learning experience for him. He told me he had only been working on EBPs until now, and this was his first audit.  After walking him through an example, he said he seemed confident that he can complete the workpaper. Also told me he had just finished his audit 101 class, and was top of his class. I just smiled and said great, and turned around rolling my eyes as I walked back to my desk.\n\nA few hours later after getting no questions, I go to check in on him and he frantically told me that he found fraud, because one of the bank recs wasn\u2019t tying to the bank statement. Typical intern, always thinking everything is fraud. I took and look, and of course, he was comparing the bank statement to the wrong bank rec (literally the same one he had started working on hours ago when I walked away). I\u2019ve worked with some bad interns before, but this one probably had to have been the dumbest. pointed out that he was looking at the wrong bank statement and he responded by telling me he\u2019s fresh off his audit 101 class; then mumbles under his breath that I\u2019m rusty and don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. Asked him what did you say? And he didn\u2019t say anything like the little weasel he is. I\u2019m a 5th year senior and been on this client since I was an A1. And this kid is telling me I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about? Lol\n\nThe next morning I get a message from the lead Partner telling me and the manager to come to his office immediately. Turns out, this little dumbass intern directly emailed the clients CFO, CEO, and Controller and accused them of fraud. HE THEN CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED FRAUD. Needless to say, we lost the client and the interns getting fired.",

That\u2019s called being in your 20s. Then you get into it for a few years, tell yourself it isn\u2019t that bad, get more responsibilities with a spouse and maybe children and you suck it up and do the job that you may not love. The 2 years of the slog you mention turns into \u201cmaybe 2 more\u201d then \u201cmaybe 1 more.\u201d\n\nStock with it, find a team or manager or company you enjoy and stick it out. Or be OK with cutting down your lifestyle and expenses. Traveling 2-3x per year is a great example because after graduation my wife and didn\u2019t travel outside of work stuff for two or three years, that\u2019s a luxury that you are baking into your \u2018needed expenses.\u2019",

Generally at 10am, we have our workflow call to go over project updates, hence I wanted to get it done before that call. Anyways, I went in his office, and told him my intention to resign.\n\nAt first, he didn't believe and told me to go away. I assured him I was serious and I was seriously resigning. His face dropped! He literally acted like my concerns were a non issue, saying stuff like this normal part of public practice, and that sometimes work increases and its fine. Basically, normalizing the situation. He asked if this was about money or if this a threat. It was quite embarrassing.\n\nI told him, I do not wish to continue at this firm, and I am officially resigning today and I will serve a two week notice period. I thanked him for his time and support and walked out to my desk. Literally, 20 mins later, I get an invite on my teams, titled \"Senior Leadership discussion\". I chuckled.\n\nSo at noon I logged into teams, and had my meeting with the four most senior partners of my department, including the managing partner. They mentioned, how they care about my mental health and they are willing to up my salary by 15K, and they are offering me to take 2 weeks starting today. Side point, they also mentioned if I do take this offer, I will have to sign a agreement not to mention this to anyone, basically a NDA.  I said no thank you and I am done. They couldn't believe it, I felt them getting mad at me. I retorted saying, I had asked you a raise in December last year, why the fuck did you say no at that point. They said, we were not in that position at that point to agree, but now since they have more budget they can offer me now. I again mentioned why did it take to me resigning, you could have offered it to me last week. They had no answer, so they apologized and asked me not to leave, even mentioning they would make me Director in our next promotion cycle. Finally adding they saw me as family, and how disappointed they are in me. I smiled and said thank you \ud83d\ude0a. \n\nThough I am not the best Senior Manager in my department, I do have the largest portfolio, and losing me would cause absolute havoc on one of my larger client, which is a disgusting client. I reiterated, I will stay on board to ensure smooth handover but I am done.\n\nThey scheduled another meeting at 3pm, to offer me another bump, but honestly I didn't even looks at it. I kindly and respectfully said no, and left the office at 330PM. So I can get home to watch the Bills play.\n\nHonestly the best decision of my life. I feel so much at peace \u270c\ufe0f.  And looking forward to my time off. I am getting all my dental check ups before they cancel my insurance. It has been a funny day! Anyways, loved all your comments and replies. I will be taking on teaching  Accounting classes and CPA prep classes at a public university nearby, I always did it part time, but now might take on some more load. I love teaching accounting.

            "text": "TL;DR: I followed this sub in college, decided fuck PA, and started in the federal government in 2017 straight out of college. Work is reasonable. Life is great. My net worth has gone from -$20k at graduation to $490k. My fianc\u00e9e\u2019s (elementary teacher) net worth has grown to $244.5k, giving us a household net worth of $734.5k for the year ended 12/31/23. We\u2019re both 30. Government jobs might not pay as much as PA and industry, but there's still plenty of room for success.\n\n**Career:**\n \nI work as a financial auditor for the federal government. My OPM career code is 0511 for those interested. My day-to-day work is exactly the same as PA audit work. I have 7 years of experience now. I will always be grateful to this sub for lifting the curtain on the nature of PA work and for pointing me towards a government job. Around 9 years ago in a thread about internships someone commented that government internships are often overlooked. On a whim I went over to USAJOBS.gov to see what federal internships were available, applied to several, and the rest is history. This post is partially to be that for the next generation of students.\n \nI started out making $60k. Last year my salary was $104k, however my final pay stub for 2023 showed $114k grossed due to overtime pay and student loan repayment benefits. For 2024 my salary has increased to $112.5k. I don\u2019t have a masters or a CPA. I considered becoming a CPA after I started working but quickly decided against it. I spent my free time after work as actual free time and met my now fianc\u00e9e instead :). I am VERY content with my job. \n \n$112.5k for 7 years\u2019 experience in a HCOL is nothing special. My peers who went PA are certainly leaps and bounds ahead of me in salary and title. However, it\u2019s more than good enough for me. When I picked accounting, my goal was a career that paid me \u2018enough\u2019 to live well, while giving me the best work-life-balance possible. A federal career has absolutely provided that. Any large increase in salary would probably come with a decrease in work-life balance, and that\u2019s simply not worth it to me.\n\n**Work-Life balance:**\n \nExcellent. I work 40-hour weeks nearly year-round. I earn 4 weeks PTO and 2.5 weeks sick leave each year, in addition to 10 federal holidays. This past busy season I had about 4 weeks again where I needed to work 60-hour weeks. I\u2019m really not a fan of having to work OT, but the short-ish duration and 1.5x pay makes it bearable. It also helps that the job, improving the quality of federal financial reporting, actually provides some level of public good. \n \nI have been 100% work-from-home since March 2020. My agency is going to reclassify my position to remote. We\u2019ll be able to live anywhere in the US. This is honestly life-changing. Pay will of course be adjusted accordingly, but the DC pay scale doesn\u2019t come anywhere close to making up for the cost of housing. My fianc\u00e9e is a teacher so we plan to move out of the DMV this summer to a MCOL area. The specific city is still TBD. \n \n**Personal Finance:**\n \nI found the /r/financialindependence sub in college too and decided I wanted to retire early. I made retirement contributions a priority and have maxed out my TSP (gov 401K), IRA, and HSA every year since 2017. It took quite a bit of effort the first couple years but my salary grew quickly. Those first few years of contributions set us up for life. If I dropped my TSP contributions to 5% and we stopped all other contributions, our combined retirement savings are on track to still grow to ~$4.9M (all projections in inflation-adjusted, 2024 dollars) by the time we hit age 57. \n \nWe don't feel like those contributions currently hold us back though, so we still make them. With our current savings rate we\u2019re on track to have ~$3.7M by age 45, though we\u2019ll probably back off on our savings well before that due to lifestyle changes like kids. Halving our savings rate starting today would put us at ~$2.7M at 45, which should still be more than enough for us to retire if wanted.\n \nThe biggest factor (beyond making enough money TO invest, which we\u2019re grateful we do) is investing early. Investing $1k/mo from age 25-35, then nothing from age 35-65 results in more money (~$1.4M) than investing $1k/mo from age 35-65 (~$1.2M). \n \n**Net Worth:**\n \nThe S&P500 was up ~24% in 2023, so my net worth jumped to $490k. My fianc\u00e9e's net worth jumped to $244.5k to give us a combined net worth of $734.5k at year-end. With the continued market growth, we\u2019ve since crested $750k!\n  \nWe\u2019re going to get married this year, but I plan to continue posting annual updates outlining my accounts (to demonstrate how I\u2019m progressing with a federal accounting career). We plan to keep our accounts mostly separate, which will make record keeping easier.\n \nHere is my updated net worth tracker. (Note that in the past I was unsure how to value my pension, so I always just left it out. It\u2019s become sizeable at this point though, so I decided to add a line item for the refundable cash value of my pension contributions. I went through my leave statements to add the historical value for each year)\n\n|ASSETS|12/31/2016|12/31/2017|12/31/2018|12/31/2019|12/31/2020|12/31/2021|12/31/2022|12/31/2023|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|Cash (incl HYSA)|$ 2,576|$ 6,562|$ 15,272|$ 26,022|$ 20,320|$ 26,334|$ 32,257|$ 43,895|\n|TSP|$ -|$ 22,448|$ 41,213|$ 79,546|$ 124,048|$ 178,928|$ 168,494|$ 241,445|\n|Pension contributions (refundable)|$ -|$ 2,536|$ 5,880|$ 9,559|$ 13,460|$ 17,498|$ 21,743|$ 26,302|\n|HSA|$ -|$ 3,535|$ 6,565|$ 11,656|$ 17,766|$ 25,698|$ 24,298|$ 34,632|\n|IRA|$ -|$ -|$ -|$ 12,538|$ 21,969|$ 32,191|$ 24,338|$ 28,476|\n|Roth IRA|$ -|$ 6,015|$ 10,924|$ 14,289|$ 17,287|$ 22,248|$ 25,526|$ 40,675|\n|Brokerage|$ -|$ -|$ -|$ -|$ 29,868|$ 53,980|$ 53,498|$ 77,952|\n|Total Assets|$ 2,576|$ 41,096|$ 79,854|$ 153,609|$ 244,719|$ 356,877|$ 350,154|$ 493,376|\n||||||||||\n|**DEBTS**|12/31/2016|12/31/2017|12/31/2018|12/31/2019|12/31/2020|12/31/2021|12/31/2022|12/31/2023|\n|Student Loans|$ 22,885|$ 21,639|$ 19,936|$ 17,182|$ 13,454|$ 10,334|$ 7,084|$ 3,393|\n|Total Debt|$ 22,885|$ 21,639|$ 19,936|$ 17,182|$ 13,454|$ 10,334|$ 7,084|$ 3,393|\n||||||||||\n||12/31/2016|12/31/2017|12/31/2018|12/31/2019|12/31/2020|12/31/2021|12/31/2022|12/31/2023|\n|**NET WORTH**|$ (20,309)|$ 19,457|$ 59,918|$ 136,428|$ 231,265|$ 346,543|$ 343,070|$ 489,983|\n|YoY Change||$ 39,766|$ 40,461|$ 76,510|$ 94,838|$ 115,278|$ (3,473)|$ 146,913|\n\n\n**FAQs:**\nDid you live at home? In community college, yes. After that, no. After moving to DC I split a 2br/1ba apartment with a co-worker to save $$$. A few years later my fianc\u00e9e and I moved into a 1br apartment together.\n\nDid you parents support you financially? Yes. I was given a car (98-02 accord) in HS which I kept until 2020. My parents also paid for my first year of rent when I moved away for college. After graduating (with $23k in student loans), the only ongoing financial support I received was staying on the family phone and Netflix plan for several years. I would have lived at home if I could, but a several-hundred-mile commute would have been a bit much.\n\nDid you gamble in crypto, meme stocks, etc? No. VTSAX and chill. (shoutout to /u/ALL_IN_VTSAX)\n\nHow did your traditional IRA go from $0 in 2018 to $12,538 in 2019? The IRS allows IRA contributions for the PY until approximately April 15th. For 2016 through 2018 I was always a year behind on contributions. By 2019 my salary had grown enough to catch up and I made 2 years of contributions (2018 and 2019) in 2019.\n\nYou don\u2019t have kids, do you? Nope, not yet.",

I was an AP/AR clerk for a couple of years first. My short account:\n\nJob:\n\nMy job in government only requires a financial related degree with 6 to 9 hours of accounting credit hours. I only hold a bachelors degree in accounting with a minor in finance. I am not a CPA. All hard skills that are needed are provided by on the job training. I had zero work or school experience for the industry that I regulate in my job. There are a series of tests that are needed to be complete to be 'certified' in my role, but again, training is provided on the job that contains this knowledge.\n\nPay:\n\nI am now 5.5 years in and gross $89 thousand a year and have an already approved bump to $93 thousand starting in September this year. I expect to hit about $115 thousand at my 7.5 year mark. The current entry-level salary is $61 thousand, with an approved 5% bump in September.\n\nWork-Life Balance:\n\nI work maybe 25 to 30 ***true*** work hours each week, as I am efficient in completing my deliverables of good quality. There are times when I'll need to work 45 to 50 hours in a week, but that only happens a few times a year and only for a week (perhaps some of a second week) at a time. \n\nMy office works on a flex schedule. Monday through Thursday, we are scheduled to work 9 hours. Then on Fridays, we alternate working 8 hours and having the Friday off. I currently get 13 vacation days and about 10 days worth of sick leave a year. Sick leave never expires and rolls year to year. Vacation days don't expire, but they do convert to sick leave after a ceiling that increases with tenure. Due to the flex Fridays, I use a lot less vacation time than my spouse does. This is the first year I'm projecting to lose vacation time to sick time (I'm not going to use enough to not let it happen).\n\nThere is a lot of overnight travel. Never on weekends, but usually one to two weeks out of the month, depending on the schedule. Over the last 12 months, I've stayed in a hotel about 55 nights. Our work from home ability is still generous but in flux right now. When not onsite, we are allowed to WFH except for one core day in the office. New hires are 100% in the office for the first year, with it loosening up throughout the second year.",

Had I known then what I knew now I would\u2019ve went straight to the federal government when I graduated instead of doing it now at almost 40 years old.\n\nEdit: and I just remembered that when I was taking my government accounting class the teacher specifically said that what we are learning is useful only if we wanted to work for the government which he didn\u2019t recommend because it didn\u2019t pay well and it wouldn\u2019t look good on our resumes if we wanted to eventually work for a public accounting firm or for an industry company. I feel like a fool for listening and believing what he was saying and I have a feeling that the rest of my peers did as well since none of us are in or even considered government work.",

I was extremely frugal and aggressive with my investments and tax planning.\n\nAll my accounts have their individual balances listed and all of them are achievable. I grossed $61,850 in 2017 (tiny bit of OT pay) and only paid $3,723 in federal income taxes for 2017, a 6% effective tax rate. Maxing my TSP, IRA, and HSA only 'cost' me $26,900 that year and the market grew 21% that year + my cash balance grew about $4k.\n\nI'll be the first to say my savings were extremely aggressive the first couple years, but there's nothing impossible about what I did.\n\nSomeone else was questioning the growth of my taxable brokerage balances but it's right in line with the market. Here's the breakdown I gave them. You can do this for all my accounts.\n\n>**2021:** I started with nearly $30k in the brokerage and in 2021 VTSAX returned 25.71%. That's about $7.7k in returns, not considering the returns earned on contributions through the year. I just went back to look at my brokerage history and for 2021 I contributed $14,750 (It looks like I was still DCA'ing some cash above my set $200/week).\n\n>$29,868 (starting) + $7,679 (gains on starting) + $14,750 (contributions) = $52,297. Basically what I arrived at in real life.\n\n>**2022:** VTSAX returned -19.53%, that's about a $10k loss and I contributed $10,860. My balance stayed flat, as you can see in the table.\n\n>**2023:** VTSAX returned 26.01% (about $14k return on starting amount) and I contributed $9,400. That puts me right at $77k.

Most of that return came in the final couple months too, so I had most of my TSP / IRA / HSA contributions already made for the year which means market growth accounted for even more.\n\nEdit: VTSAX was actually up 26% for 2023, so that would be $91k in growth.",

What you can't always do is deduct those contributions.\n\nI think might also be assuming that being covered by a retirement plan via work (like Feds are) makes you ineligible to deduct the contributions to a traditional IRA, but that's not the case. The actual rule is that if a person is covered by a retirement plan at work, they are subject to a phase out on how much of the IRA maximum contribution they can deduct. The phaseout is based on your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) which gives you a lot of wiggle room.\n\nThe phaseout for single filers 2023 started at $73k MAGI, which means if a person maxes out their TSP ($23k), HSA (we'll say $3k), and pays $1,800 in health insurance premiums - they could gross $100,800 and still wind up with a MAGI of $73,000 allowing them to take the full traditional IRA deduction.

Many profs at my university were Big 4 alumni, and while there are some who openly admit how horrible it was, most of them distribute the kool-aid quite effectively. The propaganda was so overwhelming, that kids would discount or even openly mock the warnings from our profs who were like \"B4 isn't all it's cracked up to be\". Furthermore, B4 firms contribute a lot to universities in the form of donations and sponsorships, just to keep the meat grinder pipeline full. It is in the university's (or more specifically, the accounting department's) interest to keep that money flowing, so of course they will not give an honest and accurate assessment of what life in PA is like beyond empty platitudes like \"work hard, play hard\". \n\nFrankly, I am not at all surprised that universities don't encourage government jobs, or even actively discourage students from going into them. The whole thing is set up to make government jobs feel like the \"loser option\" and for PA to feel like \"what successful students strive for\".",

There is another shutdown risk coming on March 1st / March 8th.\n\n3) House down-payment. We want to eventually buy a house, probably sometime in the next 3 years. I know this will be a big chunk of change, so I let my cash balance continue to grow. My retirement and brokerage accounts aren't exactly starved.\n\nLastly, most of the cash is earning 5.27% interest in the Vanguard settlement fund. There are no withdrawal restrictions.

Her previous job paid more but she needed this experience as an \"internship\" to finish her degree, and they told her she was the highest paid teacher at the center at like...$18 an hour? Or something like that. This is in a HCOL area.\n\nState law requires that for each classroom, there must be at least one teacher for every 10 kids. That means even with 11 kids, you need two teachers. Each kid presumably represents roughly the same monthly tuition of ~$2,200 so for every 10 kids, they're pulling in ~$22,000, or $264,000 annually. If your teachers are making $18/hr on the top end, that's $37,440 annually. After paying the teacher's annual salary, you're left with $226,560 to cover other things like rent, supplies, admin salary, etc. I'm sure a daycare has plenty of state related expenses for licensing and what not. However, every classroom of 10 kids is contributing to that with tuition.\n\nSo if a center had, for example, 85 kids, that means:\n\n**Tuition**: $2,244,000\n**Teacher Salary**: 9 X ~$38,000 = $342,000\n**Assumed Admin Salary**: Maybe Director and Assistant Director, combined salary of...$250,000? I think that's probably generous\n\nLeaving around $1.6mil a year for overhead and other direct costs that I have no way of knowing (since this is all very rough estimate). They could pay their teachers double and still have $1.3mil to play with. But ultimately you never really know without seeing the books, and I'd be curious where all the money goes. I've always felt like childcare is outrageously expensive and I don't know how anyone affords it. We make a combined salary that I once thought was a respectable number but we're borderline paycheck to paycheck because of childcare costs.\n\nETA: A big perk of working at one of these centers is that (at least in the case of the one we use) teachers get heavily discounted tuition for their kids. It was something like $450 a month for your kid if you worked there. This wouldn't change the numbers above significantly, since obviously there are far more kids there whose parents don't work for the center.",

Goes application, grading, referral to agency/division, interview, possible referral to hiring manager (I don't think this always happens), tentative offer w/onboarding & background check, firm/final offer.  I did initial applications back in July/August, and sent in my resume by email 2-3 times after that.  For the website applications grading didn't happen for like 3 months, referral for 5, and I saw interview requests in Jan/Feb.  The IRS did heavily revise all the USAJobs postings during that time though so maybe it will be faster (or slower) now.  I think all the Revenue Agent jobs are under one set of job postings now, i.e. 1 for the 7-12 escalator, 1 for the 13s, and 1 for the 14s.\n\n1st interview was off the email in Sep or Oct, TJO in December, FJO like 2 weeks ago. 2nd interview was also probably from an email application, happened in November, referral to hiring manager this week.  Both are with LB&I, but different sections.\n\nYou may get multiple referrals and multiple interview requests, as each division and sometimes each section of a division does their own interviews.\n\nEventually they'll ask for your transcripts & license, even if they are present in your USAJobs resume 'cause government.  When this happens varies.  One job wanted it before the referral to hiring manager, one with the tentative offer.\n\nWhen you get the tentative offer you get access to the onboarding site, the process for setting up fingerprinting, and sometime after that you get an invite to the background check site.\n\nIf you want to negotiate compensation or leave, you have to do it before you accept the final offer.  You usually can't get a whole grade, but supposedly you can get steps.  Normally you start at step 1, and steps are your raises while in a grade, at 1 year for 2-4, 2 years for 5-7, and 3 years for 8-10.  I've read it is easier to get better leave, as after 3 years of service your annual paid vacation goes from 4 hours per 2 weeks to 6 hours.  The next improvement is at 10 years service, to 8 hours.  They will put the final offer on hold for the negotiation.  I haven't had my negotiation yet.\n\nAll 3 interviews I had were really basic, 30m 4 question types.  Tell me about a tax return relevant to the division/section that's interviewing you, how would you handle a disagreement between direct reports or co-workers, how have you used tech/software/time management, how would you handle a combative taxpayer, things like that.  Questions were really similar between the interviews.",

I too am a civil servant and will have a pretty big pension.  My pension statement shows a pretty big amount...but the actual pension payments will be better than the amount shown.  \n\nDefined benefit pension is usually calculated something like this - Years service x highest annual pay x age factor.  So, lets say if you retire at 55, the age factor for might be 2%. Lets say you have 33 years in at 55 and your highest annual pay is 150K.  You would get $99K per year until you die.  There are also 'normally' COLA adjustments to that pension.  Plus at my organization, I get lifetime healthcare for me and the spouse for life (after being employed for 20 years).\n\nThe 99K is 'unadjusted'.  You can take less and cover your spouse for the spouse's lifetime.  So, (just an example - made up numbers) instead of taking the 99K, you take adjusted $85K a year until you die.  The spouse might get $75K until he/she dies.  This is all based upon life expectancies and age differences between the spouses.  Government work is indeed great!",

I'd even add, there's more to it than those two facets.\n\nWhen I was at my career's entry-level, I was a high volume producer.  I understood the job and how to do it, I produced 400% of comparable employees.  In addition to being the most productive employee we had (I had two rivals who I am friends with), I went above and beyond.\n\nI trained new staff.  I wrote area procedures.  I developed worksheets for less experienced staff to use.  I looked at the impacts of law changes and made projections based on those law changes for upper management.  All of this, while outproducing everyone else.\n\nThe person sitting behind me in the office did none of those things.  She was a run of the mill employee, who was producing a quarter of my output - not getting into all the other things I was also doing.  Also, sometimes she would take my calls.  She would get the person on the other line good and pissed off, and then transfer the call to me, man I hated that.  I called it a \"her-name special;\" and often said to my friends but not to her: \"Just transfer the call to begin with; don't dig me into a hole and then expect me to dig myself out.\"\n\nWe were paid the same.  I felt it was grossly unfair.\n\nI took a new position.  Then I learned she's bilingual; and I'm not.  I rely on her regularly now for translations.\n\nI have skills she doesn't have, she can't match my output or knowledge.  But the minute I'm dealing with someone who only speaks Spanish, none of that matters.  My output drops to 0% - *full stop*.\n\nIt's okay that her output was only a quarter of mine, if she's the one who deals with the quarter of the population who only speak Spanish.\n\nIt changed my perspective about our compensation.  We probably were compensated equitably.",

It should be based more on output and effort. There are plenty of people working at jobs putting in minimal effort throughout most of their career.

They will try to get every job done for the lowest price they can find.

I thought about getting out of accounting because I knew the salary was low, and public school teachers were advertised as making around the same that I was and my thought was at least I wouldn't work 80 hour busy seasons anymore. I really thought I just made the worst career choice and needed to pivot.\n\nThe spreadsheet showed me I could make more money if I just left.

Great for future accountants since low supply high demand is economics 101 for market opportunity. Glad it's not as competitive as engineering/finance since in any profession you have to go through bs at the beginning when you're first learning.\n\nHOWEVER, I would 100% say stay away from Big\n4 but often accountants tend to be risk adverse and seek stability in these firms. The WLB is non-existent and the money is terrible for the hours worked. In my opinion the best route is working for smaller PA firms  that have small business clients. Wide variety of work since you prepare the financial statements and tax return for each business and get to see what kind of sneaky companies make a killing which is very intellectually stimulating in my experience. Plus the work life balance is usually much better, I'm talking 45 hour busy season for two months in personal tax season with 37.5 hours the rest of the year focused on corporate work. Stay away from audit though, unless that is your passion. The work is mind numbing box ticking and you are often working on non for profit organizations, which personally is not my cup of tea. \n\nBut then again, no one tell you these things in school,  they don't prepare you for the real world at all. That's why I believe this subreddit is one of the best resources for people entering the profession.",

My generation (the newer generation, 20yo etc.) do not want to do anything that requires time, effort, or hard work. It\u2019s very hard to find someone my age that wants to pursue something like a CPA etc. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s due to \u201cscaring us off\u201d. I think it\u2019s due to parenting and our society beliefs rubbing off on young minds.\n   \n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go to college to make money\u201d is what I was told growing up but there is only so many jobs for trade school graduates.\n   \nOur generation has also never experienced hard times. The last major economy crash was in what 2008? We were toddlers. At the end of the day, if in a normal middle class family, most of my generation did not see our parents hit rock bottom with an economy crash. We\u2019ve only seen the growth and been given things our entire lives. Where do you get a work ethic if you\u2019ve never had to work hard for something?",

I\u2019m a disabled veteran and have had many blue collar jobs busting my ass for way less than I\u2019m making now. \n\nI absolutely love this job so much. This last week I finally got a project straight from my Controller, which by the way I think is awesome since I\u2019m so new. I\u2019m gathering source date for a greenhouse gas emissions audit. Again I think this is so cool to be involved in this project. But when he gave me the work he apologized because the work is boring, tedious, and in his words \u201cshitty\u201d. But I honestly think it is awesome to be involved as such a new employee. Of course my being new is why it was assigned to me because honestly if I showed my 7 year old son what to look for he could also find the information. But the complexity isn\u2019t the point to me it\u2019s the overall experience of being involved in the sustainability audit process. \n\n\nAnyways I love this profession so much. For the first time in year I haven\u2019t had to DoorDash in a month or so. I have been able to consistently have food in the house and not worry about how I was going to provide for my family.",

I tell it exactly like it is and you told it differently than I would have.\n\nAs my first degree was in philosophy, you begged an inordinate amount of questions, which had assumptions that nobody should assume.\n\n1. Not everyone wants to be TikTok famous, but I only wish them the best. Why not? Shit, if my student makes 1M a year talking about LLCs and G-Wagons, I hope they have me over.\n\n2. Accounting isn't \"boring work.\" I don't want any student grinding away so they can retire and die a year later. In fact, if I actually help students who have social media channels to monetize them, because it's a job and there is a demand. I consider myself boring (49-year old Dad and CPA) but with 15+ tattoos, an extroverted personality and a decent intellect, nah. \n\n3. Needing to be smart. What does that mean to you? I have done everything from audit to tax prep to law enforcement. Each semester I teach one course in Intro to Accounting. Week 3 is debits/credits. Biggest drop-out week for any University because you need to be SMART to grasp accrual accountancy / GAAP / Accounting equation. Nobody hires a CPA because of their \"average\" self.,\n\n4. The \"concrete millionaire\" DID, in fact, have a passion for concrete. A business degree, while mostly worthless for practical application (and I have a couple), should have enlightened you to the fact that nearly all business start with a passion - whether for the product, service, or simply to employ. \n\nSome of us like to prep taxes or balance books. Others enjoy being a cop or mortician or trash collector. Some people enjoy their shit. I don't want ANY student dreading to go to work because they will be happy 2x in their lives: payday (for 13 minutes) and retirement. \n\n5. Take the temperature. I lose accounting students to finance all the time. Why? Well you could make millions doing crypto, planning high wealth strategies, seeing the future. OR, you could get turned and burned at any firm, plan for people's past (taxes) and not see your family for 3 months out of the year. Both have risks, but seriously, what the fuck excites a 19 year old student?",

I'm an honors/AP student.\n\nThe average high school GPA is 3.0, meaning more than half the students can't even get a B average. Trust me, it's not because getting a B average in high school is hard. And no, it's not always some terrible family condition. I tried \"regular\" classes in my Junior year and realized just how low of a standard all my new classmates placed upon themselves. They're all nice people that I hung out with... just with zero ambition and care.\n\nSame with college. The average GPA is 3.1, meaning almost half the students can't maintain a B average. I got a 3.5 GPA while only showing up for test days for most of my classes. I played League of Legends most of the time.\n\nNo, I'm not a genius. Most people just underperform. There's a reason why low-IQ activities like... drinking and doing nothing... are vastly more popular than high-IQ activities. People don't like to work and prefer to shut off their brains. You still have people in accounting manually linking their Excel workbooks (or worse, hardcoding), when you can complete the job in a fraction of the time with an Excel formula.\n\n\"But some people aren't taught Excel\". How hard is it to go \"There must be a better way, let me ask someone or Google something to see how I can do my job more effectively and efficiently. Oh shit, this xlookup formula takes like 2 minutes to learn and only has 3 steps. Let me try that!\".\n\nPeople struggle in accounting (and everything else) not necessarily because they're mentally incapable. Most of the time, they simply have no drive or sense of pride in their work. They intentionally choose to turn off their brains and live like a dumbass. You just need to care a little bit to see some resemblance of success in accounting. It's not rocket science.",

                    "body": "Every state department needs to manage their budget, but it works a bit differently than a typical business. Instead of using your excess earning to try out some new venture you are limited to whatever your Governor\u2019s appropriation is (basically think of it as how much of your own money you could spend). Some departments are just a pure drain as they do not earn revenue (which is completely valid why should, let\u2019s say, the department of economic security earn money when the entire point is helping impoverished individuals through programs that give them money). State Parks is a revenue generating department, and at least at the state of Arizona, earns much more than it spends, however we are still hit with relatively strict appropriations. This is in case of a rainy day (like Covid) and sometimes funds are siphoned back to the state, especially if it is in a deficit like Arizona\u2019s current fiscal year (which ends on July 1st). Part of our job for Parks and Trails is to help create a fair and balanced budget for all the parks operating budgets. We do not want to ever spend more than our appropriated amount per year (this could make the CFO and our director lose their job, plus all kinds of extra oversight would be added to the department), so we divvy up an expected average for how much each park will spend, and then allow a certain amount for extra projects if the years budget is more generous than usual (it hasn\u2019t been these past two fiscal years unfortunately). Next up is revenue. Since this department actually earns more than it spends our job as accountants is to track the revenue so we can have a better argument when we create the budget to be approved by the Governor on why we should have a larger appropriation. We also can use that data to see what parks are excelling or struggling compared to prior years and hopefully come up with ideas to improve them (unlike a business a State will not just get rid of a park even if all it does is drain money, after all, the whole point is for people to enjoy the outdoors lol). A lot of the creativity is from our Park managers on ideas, but I think that is a good thing since we have a strong working relationships with our park managers (apparently a couple decades back Fiscal just lorded over them, since we do control their budgets, but our past few directors have wanted central office to be a  more supportive role than pure administrative, which I think has helped tremendously with the central staff and park rangers working relationships, after all, the department is more about them, our job is just to make sure they don\u2019t overspend so we don\u2019t get in trouble). Finally, we also have our Grants management to work on. A grant, in case you didn\u2019t know, is Federal money given to us to be spent for a particular project. This is meticulously tracked as every cent needs to be accounted for (we can\u2019t just pool the funds into some other project), and is where the majority of our maintenance and development funds come from. You would be surprised, but development spends about double what our operating budget does per year, and about 90% of that is using federal grant money. Grants can also be used for heritage projects, like helping a native American reservation maintain culturally significant buildings, even if they aren\u2019t related to a park specifically. There\u2019s also other stuff we do, but this is a general breakdown of what a state accountant for Parks and Trails does. Hope that provides some insight!",

We were a young bunch running a screen printing business. I switched jobs and became an IT project manager but along the way a career counselor planted this idea of becoming a freelance bookkeeper. I took a general accounting night course and started watching loads of QBO tutorials on youtube. I asked around my social circle, got one friend of a friend who needed help with bookkeeping. Got a couple of small referrals from there. Got laid off from PM job, hated it anyway. I took a temp job at a CPA office and kind of saw a \u201cformal\u201d bookkeeping procedure. After that I pretty much understood what these small businesses needed, and how much I could get away with charging. I kept learning based on the clients\u2019 industry and business scenarios. Been doing this about 10 years now with a pretty slow build but it has been solid for the last 5-6 years. Money wise, I make what I need to make and have headroom to take on more work when needed. I live in NYC and am comfortable financially. This is different for everyone but I am more interested in flexibility for travel and lifestyle overall. I am growing each year but not just taking loads and loads of clients and burning out. I go to the Intuit Connect conferences and get some enrichment/motivation/new ideas. I\u2019m getting into advisory/cash flow planning. That\u2019s the story more or less. Not always easy but with some foresight it\u2019s as stable as any traditional job.",

I am really grateful I started my career in Big 4 cause it helped me land good lucrative jobs in the future that allowed me to pay off my loans \"early\". \n\nI knew shortly after graduation that I made a huge mistake and the road to pay off would be hard. This Tik Tok is not a flex; it's fucking dumb. \n\nMy priority now is being able to save for my daughter to have help for college and make sure she also doesn't do dumb shit like this.",

I was getting recruited for a football scholarship outta high school and had multiple full ride offers to d1 schools. Lehigh coaches contacted me 6 months before singing day saying that I was a \u201ctop priority\u201d. If teams are actually interested they usually contact the player wayyyyy before that. They were only offering a partial scholarship so I\u2019d have to pay 40-60k over 4-5 years. I spoke to one of the coaches out of respect but was never truly interested. During this call I straight up told the guy I wasn\u2019t interested because of the tuition. He kept talking about how \u201cgreat\u201d the education is and all the money I\u2019d make with a Lehigh degree. The faculty is obviously so out of touch and they are fine with destroying futures and selling a failing process. \n\nI went with the full ride and am currently 6 years into a career that isn\u2019t in my field of study. Also had similar conversations with Ivy League schools but their athletic scholarships work a bit differently and they are at least somewhat aware that the education they provide is basically an over priced luxury product. Staying away from those \u201cprestigious\u201d schools was one of my best decisions in my adult life.",

I was able to go there for relatively cheap amount of money (don\u2019t remember, but about a few hundred bucks). I then transferred to a state school and was able to get my BA after 4 semesters for about 3.5k for each. I admit that was pricey for me, but I worked all through college and my parents didn\u2019t make me pay rent so I could afford to not have any debtAlso I managed to be cpa eligible! 150 creds. 1.5 years later, I\u2019m a tax senior making 100k, with no debt, upward career trajectory and a good work life balance. I say this for the people that aren\u2019t sure of what to do. If you want that out of state experience and have fun, go for it! Just be aware of what that entails if you don\u2019t have rich parents. Plz look into your CC! Go to a school you can afford. You don\u2019t need a masters if you get a CPA. Most firms expect you to know very little. Be ready to do public. DMs open to anyone new or worried about the field!",

Private universities like Lehigh are disincentivized to accept *any* incoming credits, since that is less revenue for the school.\n\nI went to a private university myself, and they were more stringent about AP credits and took almost no transfer credits save for one specific Community College they had an articulation agreement with, and even then they only took the most basic GenEds.\n\nOn the other hand, my local community college has a very strong articulation program with my state's flagship public university, so it's basically 1:1 for saved years outside of strongly managed programs like Engineering, and even then they have a program for that which shaves off some time.",

As long as as it's nothing illegal, you're good. The EE sub is controlled by an authoritarian regime that limits posts and what memes are allowed. \n\nHere you can post about your night at the getting drunk at the strip club with the partner at your local CPA firm. Not something you can do at many other subreddits\n\nSalary time. You guys seriously make fine money for a lot of you. I know there are many different types of accountants, geographic area, CPA or not, etc. but seriously $70k to $80k starting in MCOL is super solid. That's what many engineers are getting these days out of college. Many of you can hit 100k in about the same time as many engineers do. Yeah some places pay more like biotech, oil, and aerospace, but those jobs are super limited. Also WLB depends on where you work.\n\nDon't compare yourself to others.\n\nYou guys have it good ",

But remember, the firms are there to generate an opinion for _investors_, external audit has nothing to do with being accountable for morally \u201cgood\u201d activities. ESG is about as close as it gets and that\u2019s full of fudge and paper tigers right now.\n\nAnd for advisory stuff, it\u2019s all about maximizing profit, that\u2019s it. Auditing your practices to find gaps and inefficiencies isn\u2019t about keeping people accountable, it\u2019s about optimization.\n\nWhen people get fired from audit findings it\u2019s usually because they broke a company expectation, sometimes a real law. So if the companies make rules that allow legal but unsavory practices\u2026 the audit is to the design, not an ideal.",
