            "text": "There has been an overwhelming number of pro-Trump posts on this sub recently. All claiming that he is the god damned bitcoin messiah. My question is this: How fucking blind do you have to be to believe the lies of this dipshit? What in the world makes you think he's a pro-crypto candidate? Is it because someone make NFTs out of a collection of AI generated images glorifying your saggy orange demi-god? (Newsflash, that was a grift. Another in his long line of grifts since the 80s.) Is it because he said something about being pro-crypto? Well, that motherfucker says a lot of things, and you can look at the tale of the tape to see how few of them are truth. \n\nI have to assume that the \"people\" posting these things are Russian bots, but god damn, it gets tiresome seeing this pants-shitting wannabe con man raiding this sub with more nonsense. I'd rather be pissed off about politicians that are willingly stifling crypto than to see dumbasses fall for false hope in this idiots lying bullshit about being pro-crypto. He ain't. And he isn't fighting for the poor. He's fighting for his own pockets. Not yours.",

Politicians on both sides of the fence have come out as both pro- and anti-crypto. No party has a monopoly on either stance.\n2. Historically speaking, crypto has seen larger support among Republicans than Democrats, a pretty easily Google-able piece of information.\n3. Most of the vehement opposition to crypto have come from the Democrat side, with Elizabeth Warren leading the charge in recent years.\n4. [This](https://news.bitcoin.com/donald-trump-pledges-to-stop-bidens-anti-crypto-agenda-protect-bitcoin-free-ross-ulbricht/) is some recent commentary from Trump regarding crypto. Biden has been much more non-committal with regards to crypto (but not really outright against), with most of his commentary on it being fairly neutral and aimed at the money laundering aspect.\n\nMost parties involved in the crypto discussion have flip-flopped at some point here or there (shocker, right?), but as of late, both Republicans and Trump seem to have the more crypto friendly stance, although I think people make it sound more \"pro-crypto\" hype wise than it actually is, because well, that how sound bites work.\n\nAlso, I would point out that the OP's barrage of demeaning remarks regarding Trump (\"dipshit\", \"saggy orange demi-god\", \"motherfucker\", \"pants shitting wanna be conman\") would make me inclined to believe there is a...fairly colossal...political bias in this situation that stems from emotion and not factual data.",

Stablecoins are 99% backed by the US dollar, with stablecoin issuers becoming enormous demanders of US treasuries, which is great for the supply side. And then on the demand The US dollar is accessible to anyone around the world with just a internet connection and a crypto wallet. Never before have US dollars been so easy to buy. \n\nSo of course it's political and you can read into all that as you like. But the underlying reason why he backflipped is actually just good policy IMO",

That's like the number 2 rule in crypto, don't listen to anyone, 99 percent of advice about crypto comes from someone whos a bag holder who lost money and is trying to raise the price by saying whatever they can to make that happen. Look at xrp. (Not all their fault cause of lawsuits but still. It's consistently above most other crypo for 24 hour volume yet it's barely the tip of the ice burg.)That or they are scammers. Two years is not a long time, but it is a long time to look at a chart and not learn anything. Maybe you should of learned about that chart and the indicators before you go bashing the chart.

These CEX\u2019s don\u2019t want us to make money, they want them to make money. I\u2019m 90% in self-custody, but even just having the 10% I have on the Coinbase CEX blocked is just rage inducing. I didn\u2019t even want to sell but it\u2019s the principle. How dare they. Genuinely. \n\nEdit: some users are suggesting it might be a traffic surge, which is a different but potentially valid explanation. **I do really hope this is a genuine mistake**. Either way it still emphasises the importance of self-custody. \n\nIt\u2019s about the choice being yours. \n\nEdit 2 (19 hours later): to users asking what\u2019s the point as you need a CEX to sell\u2026you just send funds to **any CEX of your choice**. Advisably one that is working. Because self-custody **gives you back the choice to do that**. Your funds aren\u2019t stuck in a CEX that is frozen.",

Newcomers, who have their first surplus after all the bills are paid and now think that crypto will go up 15% a week for another year or so.\n\n\"The math is easy! 15% a week for 52 weeks and my 1000 bucks will become almost 1,5 million!\" A flawless conclusion after extrapolating the (very recent) data.\n\nBut this is only the fist stage! The second stage:\n\n\"I invested after bitcoin shoot up 15% and now I am down 10%! How could that be? It is over and I need to sell!\" A sensible reaction after buying a volatile asset that was very overbought. But don't worry, they will be back next day after buying in again and losing a part of the initial investment for no reason.\n\nNow comes the third stage:\n\n\"I did the math again and realized that I will become a millionaire much quicker if a invest in this new CumElonDoge coin that I see everywhere. It quadrupled in a day so I will buy today and will be a carefree person in less than a week!\" A logical conclusion. Nothing with \"Elon\" in its name can go wrong! If you think otherwise, go fuck yourself!\n\nIf we are lucky, we could stop some of those people, but on the other hand... It is kinda fun seeing this level of idiocy but not being the idiot anymore.

            "score": 2924,
            "text": "Not financial advice. \n\nGreetings All,  \n\nThis is my 19 month update since I first took out an unsecured personal loan to buy Bitcoin. You can find my previous updates in my post history. The first is from June 2022. \n\nA lot has happened since my last update, so I\u2019ll get right to it\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off, I managed to completely pay off my 2nd loan of $20,000! \n\nWork has been better than usual and I had a big job in December that netted me a $12,000 windfall of which the entirety was put towards my loan balance.\n\nNext I decided to buy even more Bitcoin by taking advantage of some really awesome Credit Card Balance Transfer offers that appeared in August/September\u2026\n\nTwo of my credit cards were offering 0% APR for the first 18 and 21 months with a one time 3% and 5% transfer fee respectively. I also opened a new card that was offering a similar deal and was approved for a $12,000 limit. That combined with my previous two credit card brought my total to $40,000 in balance transfer potential. \n\nBalance transfer offers are great because they allow you to simply write a check to yourself and cash it in your bank account like any other check. Also, I\u2019m only responsible to pay 1% each month, so servicing it is really easy. \n\nI ended up using $35,000 in balance transfer loans and buying 1.35 Bitcoin at an average price of \\~$26,500. This brings my total amount of Bitcoin purchased with loans to 4 Bitcoin!!!!\n\n**With the balance transfer monthly payments, plus the previous loans, my total monthly cost to service all these loans is \\~$800.** \n\nI can easily afford this. In fact, I\u2019m putting almost double that towards these loans each month to pay them down aggressively so I don\u2019t end up paying a lot of interest when it\u2019s all said and done. I plan to have everything paid off in less than two years. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**As of today, of the combined loans / balance transfers I have a total remaining balance of \\~$56,000.**\n\nIt works out like this:\n\n$21,000 remaining balance from unsecured personal loan.\n\n$35,000 from new balance transfer loans. \n\nThis brings the total amount of loans that I\u2019ve taken out so far to $94,000. I\u2019ve paid a total of \\~$4,500 in interest to date, which brings the total cost basis of these loans to \\~$98,500 as of January 24th, 2024.\n\n**I have acquired a total of 4 Bitcoin at an average price of \\~$24,625 per coin: $98,500 / 4 = $24,625.** \n\n**As of today, January 25th, 2024, the current price of Bitcoin is \\~$40,000.**\n\n**This brings the total value of the Bitcoin I acquired from loans to $160,000.**\n\n**This represents an unrealized USD profit of \\~$61,500.** \n\nThe math is simple: $160,000 - $98,500 = $61,500\n\nLastly, I\u2019m officially done taking out loans and balance transfers. I have a nice round number of Bitcoin from loans, plus my personal stack which I\u2019ve been slowly adding to from earned income. Now it\u2019s time to focus on paying everything down over the next 2 years with earned income. I have no desire to sell my Bitcoin regardless of how high its price goes. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions. \n\nNot financial advice. ",

More power to ya \ud83d\ude0e\n\nI did the same thing about a year ago, but $50k, and with all with CC balance transfers (3% fee, 0% APR for 18-21 months). I bought BTC (at $17k), ETH, and a handful of crypto and tech stocks, and have been up as high as $125k value, closer to $100k right now. I only owe about $40k on it, so am about $60k ahead right now. I'm started selling/reallocating a few of the tech stocks (sold META at its peak, up 280%) now that I've held for over a year (so they're long term, not short term capital gains), but I plan on selling most of the crypto as we find the peak of the bull run.\n\nI've posted about it a few times here, but every time I do I get downvoted into oblivion. Even though the \"borrowed\" portion  of my portfolio is a fairly small percentage and I could easily ride out a crypto market crash, people still think I'm an idiot for taking on risk like this. I'm fine with reasonable risk and manageable cheap debt as long as I have a huge safety net and the upside is worth the risk. I also know the market and have been in this since 2011. \n\nI'm just glad that people aren't downvoting you into oblivion like they did to me!

For example, just sell 1 BTC at $100k to cash out your basis and pay off any remaining loans, then let the other 3 BTC ride playing with house money at that point.  At least you could eliminate your risk altogether in that case, and still have massive profit potential with a 5-10 year hold.",

How does it feel to achieve the goal?\n\nIt's what we've all been waiting for, for years. $69,420 Bitcoin has finally been reached.\n\nAll the pain and suffering and grinding during the bear. We didn't care, we stuck to our guns and persevered because we knew that one day, we would reach that magic number.\n\nAnything else seems pointless now, the ambition is gone. We can all exit crypto. It's been fun.\n\nI'll never forget all the friends I made along the way, we made this happen together and I love you all.",

            "text": "Started in October 2017 with the goal of 'enough bitcoin to retire'. Got the general idea from the FIRE community (financial independence, retire early) but instead of buying the S&P every month, I chose to buy bitcoin every month. So, basically I save as much as possible from every salary --> buy as much bitcoin every month as possible. When I have a stack of 1 million euros in fiat terms, I consider myself as successfully retired and most likely gonna quit my job. I document my journey in this blog that I try to update once per month, hopefully you like it interesting and motivating! And whatever your capacity and timing for stacking sats is, I'm pretty sure this kind of 'bitcoin retirement plan' is way more efficient than the government one, so starting anything similar is highly recommended.

For Stakeland which is launching with big brand partners and staking gives you their coin or some iteration of it. \n\nStart buying memecoin on Solana: $wif or $bonk. $JTO or $jup will be good too. \n\nBlast is launching an L2 on Ethereum which should do well, they\u2019re up to almost 1B TVL for their staking reward mechanic. \n\nFinally, you can look into DePIN etc.",

Yes, they have positive cash flow, but that\u2019s the effect of its underlying value, not the underlying value itself. \n\nThe underlying value of Facebook is the network they built. The company was able to monetize the network by selling ads to people in the network. But the reason anyone was willing to pay Facebook anything was because the network they have is valuable. Yes, this is oversimplified, and the data collection they do is a big part of it (and they\u2019ve diversified a bit since then, too). \n\nBut at the end of the day, the value of Facebook all derives from the fact that there is an existing network that billions of people use because they see value in using it. If people lost interest in the Facebook network and went elsewhere, the value of Facebook would plummet dramatically. \n\nThe underlying value of bitcoin is the network/functioning system it exists on that people see value in using. It is valuable to be able to buy, convert, send, and sell currency purely electronically. In the case of Facebook, their network was owned by a company that needed to be able to turn a profit. They were able to leverage the value of their network to generate ad revenue, which makes Facebook a profitable company and plays a big role in the value of Facebook stock. But the network, itself, was already valuable before the owner of the network became profitable. That\u2019s why people used it (and still do). Facebook users find value in using the Facebook social network (at least enough value to continue using it, even knowing they and their data are the product). \n\nFor bitcoin, there\u2019s no owner that needs to extract revenue from the network. Just because some owner isn\u2019t making a profit by exploiting the network, doesn\u2019t mean the network isn\u2019t valuable. Just as Facebook users see value in the ability to connect with friends and family and see photos and share articles and chat in groups and so on, users of the bitcoin network see value in the ability to buy and store a digital asset on a stable and existing network and be able to send money around the world and trade coins in the hope of making a profit and so on and so on. \n\nAnd the bitcoin network is a fairly stable one. It is pretty hard to kill. It might not be the best in terms of cost or speed, but it is the best in terms of staying power. And there\u2019s no \u201chead\u201d to kill to make the body fall apart. It almost runs on its own (not exactly, but it\u2019s so decentralized). But many cryptocurrencies have some level of underlying value because of the existence of the network and the value people see in the network of people using the system. \n\nWhat\u2019s the underlying value of any fiat currency? There\u2019s no positive cash flow. There\u2019s not gold backing it. But there is an existing network of people and functioning system for using that fiat currency. \n\nWhat\u2019s the underlying value of the SWIFT system? Is it not that it\u2019s an established network of people using it? What\u2019s the underlying value of the NY stock exchange? Yes, the owner of it makes money from transaction fees, but why do companies list on the NYSE instead of a cheaper exchange? It\u2019s because of the network of people using the NYSE. More people are using it. More people default to it. It\u2019s easier because it\u2019s been the default so long. That\u2019s the value. If everyone started to use some new stock exchange and left the NYSE, they wouldn\u2019t be able to make much money on transaction fees and would go belly up. \n\nThe cash flow isn\u2019t the value. The value is the reason there\u2019s a cash flow.",

However, the concept of compounding can also apply to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but in a slightly different manner.\n\nIn the context of Bitcoin, compounding can occur through strategies such as \"hodling\" (holding onto Bitcoin for an extended period) or participating in certain investment platforms or protocols that offer interest-bearing accounts or staking rewards.\n\nHere are a few ways compounding can work with Bitcoin:\n\n1. **Hodling**: If you buy Bitcoin and hold onto it as its value appreciates over time, the increased value of your Bitcoin holdings effectively compounds. For example, if you bought 1 Bitcoin at $10,000 and its value doubles to $20,000, you've effectively experienced compounding growth.\n2. **Interest-bearing accounts**: Some cryptocurrency platforms offer interest-bearing accounts where you can deposit your Bitcoin and earn interest over time. The interest earned can then be reinvested, leading to compounding growth of your Bitcoin holdings.\n3. **Staking**: In certain blockchain networks that utilize proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, participants can stake their coins to help secure the network and earn rewards in return. These rewards can be compounded by restaking them, leading to exponential growth of your staked Bitcoin holdings.\n4. **Yield farming and liquidity mining**: These are advanced DeFi (Decentralized Finance) strategies where users provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges or lending protocols in exchange for rewards, often in the form of additional cryptocurrency tokens. These rewards can be compounded by reinvesting them back into the protocol.",

Even if you paid for 3 years or more costing hundreds you have nothing to show for it until you continue to pay. You can\u2019t then decide to resell any of that content or lend it to anyone, it was never yours.\n\nWith decentralised distribution artists can get their content directly to the consumer without a middleman, they can retain 10% royalties using smart contracts embedded into the NFT. In my opinion it\u2019s the most exciting thing (and one of the most valuable) that\u2019s happened since the beginning of the internet. My problem with bitcoin is that it can\u2019t do this and uses way too much energy for something that relies on energy scarcity but exponential increase in consumption to retain it\u2019s value and function",

However, they did it under the auspices of best practices, trying to be advertiser-friendly, you know, as all business executives act.  Could their censorship be perceived as political bias?\n\nSure.  They had a personal bias like everyone else, and one side of the political divide consistently wants to post the kind of hate speech that advertisers hate, so it makes it easy to censor, and then they can scream \"victimisation\".\n\nMusk has sought to amplify the right wing, and to that end has employed the cherished fascist tactic of disinformation, misinformation, undermining and discrediting empirical data and its analysis, and just generally muddying the waters to improve their political chances.  In that sense, it's not a far out conspiracy theory to think that this was orchestrated by some right wing party looking to make a quick profit or just discredit government regulatory bodies in general, but as always, the fascists assiduously maintain plausible deniability.",

Just out of curiosity for cryto - back when crypto actually still had a meaning associated with cryptography.\n\nWas just a fun exercise, while I was learning to use terminals and stuff.\n\nI later gifted those coins to some guy on the internet, that  had written a really good tutorial on something crypto-related, who basically had a public crypto address.\nBecause I was eager to find out how actually sending coins worked, I've send my coin to them.\n\nWell ...\nI don't really care. Whatever I've send had no monetary value. It was more like a nice gesture.\n\nThe following thought is stupid: If I would have just waited and actually kept the keys and everything, I could be a millionaire now.\n\nImagine, in 10 years Reddit changes policy, that every person can only ever give 1000 upvotes and 5 awards. Also Reddit ends up becoming a platform for finance and companies heavily invest depending on upvotes on posts on Wallstreetbets.\n And because most people have spent their upvotes and awards allready, the value of giving an upvote raises to 1000$ and awards are suddenly worth millions of $. You can literally sell your award to billion dollar companies.\nNow people will laugh about you, because you gave away your upvotes and awards for free in 2024.\nThat's basically what early crypto days were like. Shure, we dreamed of a world where we could use it as a secure, decentralised payment method. But we didn't expect (nor wanted) it to become an investment.\n\n\nThe likelihood of that happening was so abysmal small and mining new coins was relatively easy, so why bother assuming that toy is an investment. If we kept everything ever for our whole life, surely we might end up having something really valuable. \nBut most likely this means we stagnate. In fear of loosing something potentially valuable, we would block ourselves of acquiring actual value in life.",

CPU and GPU BTC mining are no longer possible by standard consumer grade computers. It requires data center grade compute power to mine BTC.\n\nEven with 10 computers, the odds of hitting a block are so infinitely small as to be impossible on such a short timeline and with a sample group of only one such incident being reported.\n\nOccams razor suggests the simplest explanation is often correct, and that is that the number is just inflated or made up.",

If you can't physically get the cheap coins anymore that's bad for you... since you can't repay the loan), and the terms of the loan (what does the contract say happens if you never pay back? Maximum fines might be huge. Or not)\n\nThe odds of anyone setting that loan up and having time to do all the steps and come out ahead in 15 minutes and have double checked everything to make sure you didn't do something that majorly screws you in the fine print seem very unlikely.",

Even financially it makes sense to pay just so that he can gain better reputation in the next product he's going to sell (like lunchly)",

Another chunk of retail will be left drowning at sea.. most likely ending up as salty no-coiners hating on the \"scam\" that is crypto.\n\nHere's a chance to save yourselves. Don't do it.

What if it doesn't pump back ... now it does, and suddenly, the Market manipulation is to blame, not the user for jumping on to late or not buying into shit at the bottom when it's worth the risk. \n\nTypical quadruple standard of judging the same type of event but with different names :) ... Crypto is a 'joke' , a manipulation , etc ... no. Some crypto are doing that, just like some companies are doing that and get listed at stock exchange. \n\nThe tech is sound, verified and functional over many years now , how is that related to the fact that some people will always do the same shit -> tricking others into giving them their cash? \n\nIs the Internet a Problem because scams roam free , or the people who are tricked into getting scammed? \n\nWhy are so many in this market for 5-10 years and have 0 loss on scams? Meanwhile others enter the space, and in 2 years' time, they get wreked because they can't distinguish between solid working projects and Meme Coins that are basically a P&D scheme?",

It seems like the trend of insane gains from meme coins came out of 2020/2021 bull run with the likes of doge/shiba, and is continuing this time around with other meme coins since people like dollar signs and a chance of 1000x gains. I\u2019m just thinking it\u2019s a small sample of meme coins to make a prediction and think that the behavior could be different this time around regarding meme coins, seeing a peak earlier",

Since then, it has imposed massive costs on the law-abiding majority, while not having any demonstrable impact on reducing terrorism, nuclear proliferation or drug trafficking.\n\nThere are other ways to deal with radical anti-social groups and drug traffickers than putting the entire world under surveillance, under pain of imprisonment.",

            "text": "When btc hit 40k I remembered how nuts this place was. I also remember the sudden increase from 35k to 45k as we embraced the false prophet (EM). \n\nSince 2021, I have learned a lot. Now having  gone through a bull and brutal bear, i feel time has allowed me to muture. I  regret being afraid to buy the dip because it may go lower. What i come to learn is DCA and sometimes you just need to buy at a good enough price (rainbow bands).\n\nMy second regret was greed  and putting some of my assets in  Celsius; however,  I have been slowly accumulating  more. I\u2019m hoping this cycle ill have made enough to  make up for my past mistakes plus some. I\u2019ve learned and positioned myself better for this next year and upcoming cycles. Onwards to 14Q 2021 btc to 100K!\n\nEdit: stay strong bothers, WAGMI",
