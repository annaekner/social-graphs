            "text": "So recently me (18M) and my gf (18F) went to a halloween party. I was already uncomfortable with her going because a bunch of her co-workers were going to be there, and they try flirting with her even while at work. While we were there she got very drunk fast. (she\u2019s a lightweight) In the room full of the guy co workers, my gf and I were sitting together and her guy co-worker that I told her about that I absolutely do not like was also sitting next to her. So it was me, her and her co-worker. She touched on his leg to get his attention to play with game with her and it honestly made me feel like shit, but it was a drinking game and I was the sober driver so I guess it\u2019s understandable. Suddenly two girls came rushing into the room asking people if they want to play spin the bottle. Those two girls said \u201cWho wants to play spin the bottle, you can\u2019t play if you\u2019re in a relationship though\u201d My gf proceeds to say \u201cIM NOT\u201d in front of everyone in the room. I could hear the guy co-workers in disbelief and they were all kinda smiley idk. I don\u2019t know how to feel. It honestly hurt my feelings for sure especially now knowing she\u2019s been snapchatting that guy co-worker I hate. They snapped each other 6 times in one day. (which was today) I don\u2019t know what to do, I feel disrespected and violated. I don\u2019t know if I should break things off. I already tried to but it was honestly so hard to and I backed off and took it back. She was crying a lot. From the start I promised her I would stay to the end but I don\u2019t know if I can if I keep getting disrespected.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all for your opinions and support, I really appreciate y\u2019all fr. It\u2019s going to be over between us and thankfully all of you have made me see it though. This was my first relationship, so thank you for honestly giving out advice about this situation. Have a blessed day and again thank you. \ud83d\ude4f",

This kind of disrespect is completely unacceptable.  You deserve better.  Do not ever settle for something like this.  Nobody is going to stand up for you if you don\u2019t stand up for yourself.\n\nAlso, learn what you can from this.  When you date a girl, don\u2019t tell her what to do.  Don\u2019t try to control her.  Let her do what she wants.  And then just observe.  Observe what she does.  And if what she does is flirts with other men, snaps men who flirt with her, entertains men who or hitting on her, or otherwise disrespects you in similar ways, then just leave.  The goal in dating is not to mold someone into what you want.  You can\u2019t do that.  The most you\u2019ll do is make them pretend and do things behind your back anyway.  The goal is to find a woman who will respect you and not make you feel like this out of her own volition.  Because she wants to.  Because she has integrity, respects you, and respects your relationship.  \n\nAlso, don\u2019t be hard on yourself.  You\u2019re so young.  Everyone is foolish and gullible when they\u2019re young.  The trick is to learn from your experiences. and the experiences of others.  \n\nLastly, young people are immature.  Don\u2019t put too much faith into dating at this age.  It\u2019s extremely hard to have a mature and respectful relationship that will last at this age.  Because you\u2019re so young and have so much growing to do.  \n\nOh and, read Models by Mark Manson.  Best book for dating you\u2019ll ever read.  Wish I read it at 18.",

Not only was she flirting with a co-worker that you speficially addressed that you didn't like COUPLED with the fact that she openly declared that she was single so she could play spin the bottle and hook up with other co-workers? This alone sends a bad message. Not only is she willing to say \"fuck it\" to the relationship, but she just showed all of her co-workers that they have a shot with her if they're clever enough.\n\nI know that you said that you swore to her that you'd be there forever, but 1. She might as well have said that you two aren't an item and that she's a free agent. 2. The person you made that promise to may not be the person you are dating now. People change, they grow apart, they find new interests. If that person is different than who they used to be, then you made the promise to who she was, not who she is.\n\nUltimately, the trust has been broken. Staying in the relationship is up to you, but already the doubts and suspicions are setting in, and you'll spend more time worrying about what she's up to. As much as I hate to say it, I would recommend breaking up with her. You're both still young, and you have plenty of time to find other partners. Let her find one suited to her lifestyle and find someone who is more compatible to you; someone you know that you feel is trustworthy. \n\nBest of luck, OP, regardless of the choice you decide to make.",

That\u2019s not very good girlfriend behavior\u201d.\n\nLike, she shouldn\u2019t be playing Spin The Bottle in a relationship at all, but what the fuck. She literally said she was single.  She broke up with you in that moment.  It\u2019s an exceedingly shitty way to do it, but you should take it at face value and find someone who actually respects you.

The tears are manipulative. You seem like a very nice guy and she\u2019s using that to her advantage. \n\nYou\u2019re young so you need to make the transition from \u201cnice guy\u201d to \u201cgood person\u201d. See a nice guy ignores his feelings, but you can still be a good person and consider your feelings as well.\n\nWhen she said she wasn\u2019t in a relationship in front of everyone. You should\u2019ve said: she\u2019s right!! she\u2019s not. And walk off. Whether you leave now or later, it\u2019s still going to hurt. This will not end well. And you guys are 18!!?? The odds of you marrying this girl are slim. \n\nI\u2019m twice your age and I will tell you 100% of the time if you forgive someone for being disloyal, they\u2019ll do it again. And each time you forgive them-they get better at hiding it. They get sneakier and sneakier. \n\nSo when you break up with her, you can say \u201cnow you\u2019re free to snap whoever, whenever you want.\u201d You can still get out of this with your pride and dignity. The last thing you want is another man sending you your girls nudes. Or you FaceTime her one day and a dude picks up and says \u201cyour girls busy right now.\u201d",

So I\u2019m out.\u201d\n\n[Saying it out loud is better than texting, but saying something at all is better than ghosting]\n\nThe other advantage of this method is that you don\u2019t have to wonder if they know why you left. You get to say your peace and you\u2019re a mature class act. You get closure and completion (and sometimes an apology or a chance to understand something you didn\u2019t before). I\u2019ve done breakups both ways and I can\u2019t recommend expressing what needs to be said before leaving vs. ghosting highly enough.",

He had her number because his current wife and my wife know each other professionally. They got married about 10 years after the divorce. So my wife says should she answer it we don't but he keeps calling. Thinking something bad had happened to his wife my wife answered put her phone on speaker. The man is drunk off his ass. Starts professing his love for her biggest mistake he ever did was cheating on her. Saying how lucky I am. And more of the same for about 5 minutes before we both told him to go to sleep. Then he starts crying about how he fucked up his life. And on and on till we just hung up. No my wife is not cheating. He lives over a 1000 miles away.\nThe question is to I contact him soon and tell him to knock it off. First time my wife has spoken to him in 27 years.\nSome ideas for a text response to embarrass him would also be liked.",

He only took me serious once it was too late. He cried, because he didn\u2019t expect it despite all the warnings, and that\u2019s because he took me for granted. But he didn\u2019t try to work it out or even ask me for a chance to try. I am still mad at him for that because it made me feel like he didn\u2019t care about the relationship as much as I did, and I felt like I had been wasting the best of myself on someone who didn\u2019t value it. It made me feel like I had been living in an illusion, led to believe that I was loved when I wasn\u2019t. It made me feel betrayed for years (the better part of eleven years). I still wish he had taken my concerns more seriously and that he had shared more of his with me, because we otherwise had a lot going for us, we were hugely compatible, and before he started to take me for granted, he really caused some pretty big improvements to my life by just being part of it.\n\nI know where to reach him and he knows where to reach me. I know that if it came to that, he would come running to help me. The ending was ugly, but I have no hard feelings and still trust him because he is not manipulative in any way. We have unfinished business. But neither of us reaches out, probably because it would open a can of worms to revisit what happened and why. I don\u2019t want him to feel guilt at this point, I wish him well\u2014and he probably regrets and has guilt feelings under the surface he would rather not unearth. If he reached out with questions on the past, I would, as respectfully as possible, give him honest answers. It would probably even help him with his relationships going forward, because it turns out he was very confused about relationships back then. But I don\u2019t know if he has been progressing on that and I know that the only way I could do a post mortem is if I could first tell him how pissed I am that he didn\u2019t fight for it. I am not sure that would be helpful to him because I don\u2019t know how far along he got with learning to do relationships. As for me, water under the bridge. I just wish I could take that time back and be eleven years younger.",

She started making strange comments about his looks, athletic abilities, and personal qualities that went beyond her usual enthusiasm for coaching. Meanwhile, she\u2019s become much more secretive with her phone and is often late home from practice without clear explanations. These changes have left me wondering if there\u2019s something more happening between them, but I don\u2019t have solid proof and don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions without evidence.\n\n**Late update**:  \nFirst off, I want to thank everyone for the comments, advice, and support on my original post. Unfortunately, my original post was initially taken down, and I received a three-day temporary ban from the subreddit. Thankfully, the post was eventually restored after my ban ended. Since I wasn\u2019t able to share updates during that time, I\u2019ve decided to create a new post with all the updates so far, structured chronologically to keep everything organized. Sorry to keep everyone waiting\u2014this is why I\u2019m only updating now, and the last five days have also been a whirlwind.\n\n**Post update 1:**  \nI took some of your advice and reached out to a lawyer\u2014well, sort of. An old friend from high school, who\u2019s now a successful family lawyer, happens to be visiting his family here in *{my hometown}* this week. While family law isn\u2019t exactly what I need, I\u2019d rather speak to someone I trust before hiring a lawyer and potentially escalating things out of control.\n\nI\u2019m meeting him for coffee tomorrow and will update you afterward. I\u2019m hoping he can give me some solid legal advice without things getting too intense. I obviously don\u2019t want her to be arrested or anything drastic like that, but I also don\u2019t know what to do next. Right now, I\u2019m not even angry\u2014just overwhelmed and in shock. It\u2019s hard to process that someone I\u2019ve been so close to over the last two years might not be who I thought and could have been hiding something awful this whole time.\n\n**Post update 2:**  \nThe last five days have been absolute hell. The title is a bit of a giveaway, but pretty much everyone who commented was right, and my own suspicions have been confirmed.\n\nAfter talking to my friend (the lawyer), we agreed that I should confront her with my concerns suggest looking through her phone together just to put some of my suspicions to rest. I realise how risky this was, but we really didn\u2019t have a lot of choice considering there was no clear proof that anything weird had been going on.  \nHe suggested that we meet somewhere quiet, but still in a public setting in case she decided to freak out and do something irrational. I decided to take her our local park where I sat her down on a park bench well away from any crowds of people.\n\nWhen we sat down together, I told her how serious of a situation we could be in and that she MUST be completely honest with me, and that want to be on her side but the way she had been acting had led to some serious suspicions. I explained to her that I didn\u2019t want to break the trust between us so had decided against looking through her phone, despite how tempted I was.\n\nWhen I told her the concerns, she immediately got defensive and started denying everything. She called me a \u201cparanoid asshole\u201d for even suggesting that she would be in a relationship with a minor. She said the fact that I would even question something like this means there\u2019s probably something wrong with me and that I must be the one hiding something.\n\nHonestly, the way she reacted just confirmed to me that there was something that she hadn\u2019t been telling me this entire time and that without her cooperation, the safest bet was probably just to leave.\n\nI suggested that we look through her phone together just to provide ME with closure and even if there was nothing to hide, it would mean a lot to me that she would just humour me and that it might even be fun to look through together and laugh at how ridiculous I was being.\n\nShe screamed at me for \u201ctrying to invade her privacy\u201d and that I had massively overstepped the line before storming away from me, back to the car and driving to her friend\u2019s house to stay for the night.\n\nI don\u2019t know what she talked about with her friend but at around 3:00 am the next morning I got a really long text from her giving her view of the situation. The messages was as follows (the entire message was considerably long so I\u2019ve summarised it for this post): My wife - I really don\u2019t think what I have been doing is wrong, it started with me just helping this kid with some extra practice because he was struggling to get the hang of some of the drills we had been working on in that days training session. These private sessions were becoming more regular and after about three weeks of extra training sessions he sent me a friend request to my Instagram. He wasn\u2019t the first one of the team to send me a request and I wouldn\u2019t usually accept them but as I was giving this kid private coaching sessions I though it made more sense.  \nHe started to send me DMs so I responded, because I\u2019m not a total asshole. Ok, maybe the texts aren\u2019t just about soccer anymore, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being friends with a kid, you\u2019ve always been super close to your younger brother and I\u2019ve never called you out for being \u201cweird\u201d.\n\nThe message then proceeded to say how much of an asshole I was for trying to call her out and trapping her in a situation that would always leave her looking bad.\n\nShe ended the message by telling me that she thinks that she\u2019ll be able to look past this and forgive me for being a \u201ctotal insecure dickhead\u201d and that if I ever questioned her like this again, she would be filing for a divorce.\n\nI was in complete shock when I read this response as I have never seen this side to my wife. This is not the kind, loving, respectful, and open person whom i had married and it is driving me totally insane, I just don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nI understand that what she was telling me is not normal and I can\u2019t believe how na\u00efve I have been for so long, but I still feel like there\u2019s even more going on that she\u2019s not telling me. Her long message didn\u2019t actually explain why she had been messaging this kid so much and for so long, or why she had been spending literal hours every evening locked in our bedroom or on the sofa just on her phone.\n\nIDK, maybe I AM just being paranoid?\n\nMaybe this is more normal than I\u2019m making it out to be, although this seems unlikely.\n\nShould I still try to look through her phone anyway, despite what she\u2019s told me?\n\nWhen we had met the previous day, my friend mentioned that this was out of his field but that I shouldn\u2019t contact the police until I was more sure of anything because if we did end up getting a divorce, and she is technically innocent, calling the police on your wife for providing extra help to a kid she coaches wouldn\u2019t look very good for me in a courtroom.\n\n**Again, I apologise to everyone for the late update, and I know this post is kind of all over the place, but I hope you have been able to follow.**\n\n**Edit:** This post was temporarily removed but has now been reinstated. I appreciate all the support and advice so far, and I\u2019ll be responding to comments to answer questions and clear up any confusion. I will be giving another update on the development of the situation, thank you for your patience!",

When somebody gets really defensive, it is a textbook sign that they are hiding something most of the time but not always. However, when it is followed up by personal attacks and bone fide manipulative and gaslighting tactics that make you second guess yourself, it very likely is something serious.\n\nI know it is too late but I never would have confronted her rather I would wait until she was asleep and then look through her phone (there are 9999 possible codes but a good techie can get past that). Had I confronted her, I would have started with, \"I am starting to get concerned that this boy really likes you and might see you as a potential romantic partner even though I know you'd never do something like that. Blah blah blah\"\n\nHowever, now you are too far into it. Wait until she is asleep and look through her phone. If you find some sexual stuff, you basically have two options. 1) Just ignore it and tell her that you were just really concerned that he may be seeing her the wrong way to get her off your back. 2) Take the phone and go to the police station immediately. Between the time that she discovers the missing phone and the time that she gets arrested, try not to be at home as she may act very erratically including violence. If you have to defend yourself just for your safety, the police don't care as it is a double-standard that men cannot win. Therefore, you could go to prison for assault or battery etc..",

Get ahead of this so you won't be the bad guy, which her actions so far has shown that she will go to any length to protect her secrets and that is a dangerous person.\n\nBe Well my friend and let the parents of the child know about their correspondence. Any parent would want others to do that for them.\n\nUpdateme!",

This is a pretty serious accusation.\n\nI'm 37F, considered by most to be attractive. I've had old AND young men shoot their shot. I was surprised by how many young ones, believing the tropes that women are no longer considered desirable after their 20s and that men would aim younger most of the time. Not true! They don't care nearly that much.\n\nI was a community worker and recruited lots of college-aged volunteers. Some of them I bonded with, I would consider one or two of them to be friends. I had got them doing personal assistance tasks for me because I trusted them, and they liked me enough to do it. We talked openly about controversial topics, including sex.\n\nI was frank with them, saying I'd never dated anyone more than 5 years younger and had no plans to; I have qualms about age-gap relationships, I think it speaks to being psychologically stunted somehow for the older person. But if you ever heard the wrong conversation, maybe you could get the wrong idea about the nature of the relationship.\n\nShe absolutely could be gaslighting you. Or, she could be feeling conflicted herself for her feelings of admiration and temptation with someone she shouldn't. It's hard to say because you don't have concrete proof. That said, I would 100% hand over my phone to my partner if they ever questioned me about my relationships with my students. I would pour out all the honesty I could think of to clear my name with you. That's how I would handle it. But people respond imperfectly sometimes. I don't know how to dig to the bottom of it.

In a lot of states you are REQUIRED to report, no matter your profession, if you suspect child or elder abuse. He's really in a fucked up position. I would obtain an attorney in the correct space IMMEDIATELY and proceed with their advisement. u/max_Manford\n\n**EDIT: Since people are not bothering to read further comments or do a quick Google on the matter, yes, you as a layperson, can be a mandated reporter. I will address US, UK, Canada.**\n\n**MANDATED REPORETER:** In several states, EVERYONE is required to report suspicion of elder and minor abuse (ex: [Florida](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0000-0099/0039/Sections/0039.201.html)), in [Canada](https://cwrp.ca/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#:~:text=Do%20I%20need%20to%20report,suspected%20child%20maltreatment%20by%20law), EVERYONE is a mandated reporter except in the Yukon Territory, in the UK it is said that everyone SHOULD be a mandated reporter, but there is no legal consequence (they have suggested [legislation](https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/news/2024/may/mandatory-reporting-child-sexual-abuse#:~:text=The%20duty%20to%20report%20child,they%20witness%20the%20abuse%20happening) to change it to everyone) and it is blurry whether there are protections in place for spouses.\n\n**The AGE.** In MANY states, it does not MATTER how close the child is to 18, as long as the child is under 18, they are therefore a minor, a child, there are [exceptions](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cb/capta.pdf), but I will not list all 50 state laws. In the UK, it is the [same](https://nya.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/position-of-trust-guidance-1.pdf), they are a minor at 17, and in Canada, it is the [same](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/other-autre/clp/faq.html), they are a minor at 17.  \n**Now, REGARDLESS OF AGE and/or age GAP** (which can matter in some US states), there is still a potential crime and/or reason for termination when in a coach/teacher role and engaging with a minor. I do not think this applies to a spouse of the coach/teacher when the student is either a minor in an unprotected state or not a minor. HOWEVER, it can lead to issues legally, where the spouse may appear prejudiced.\n\n**WHY OP should speak to a lawyer in the correct field BEFORE taking action.**\n\n1. If everything is above board and legal, in a potential divorce, his actions could look like prejudice and be used against him when dividing assets/property/spousal support/etc\n2. If they were considered a mandatory reporter, WHY did they wait? Have a lawyer walk them through the right steps to carefully explain WHY they waited, how they waited for legal advice to know how to report, etc. Protect themselves legally\n3. The lawyer should then suggest the action that most likely provides protection for the minor, with or without proof from the coach. Is that warning of the parents? (What if they don't care), report to the police? (what if they want more evidence), report to the school/coaching team? etc.\n\n**Now, stop replying TO ME with your dumbass responses** about **how this isn't possible.**",

I think it'd be best to go with #2 for now & get the lawyers opinion on if Op should be notifying the parents, that'd be a big, big deal.\n\nPersonally, if I were in Op's shoes, I think I'd be done with the marriage. The trust is gone & if there's no trust, there's no marriage. She obviously ran off to go deep clean her phone & get the kid to do the same, hopefully there's still info in a deleted folder. What she did is NOT the reaction of an innocent person who's being falsely accused & wants to clear their name, it was a fight or flight response & she had to get away from Op & try to justify her actions later. \n\nWhen she finally wrote that long message to Op at 3am attempting to cover her ass, I believe that's when she had just gotten done sanitizing her phone of all evidence of sexting / diddling / grooming this poor kid. Unfortunately, I believe the only way to get Instagram to pull transcripts of the conversations between Op's wife & the kid is through the police. I feel so bad for Op, what a messed up situation he's in, it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario. If he tells the parents, his marriage is done for sure because he may be wrong. If he doesn't tell the parents & she is fooling around with this kid, the abuse could have stopped at a sooner time.

A lot can happen between him and your wife in the next few days and months. He needs to be protected. He needs an adult to be looking out for him. While I get that you are tremendously hurt by what is taking place you are an adult. You have resources and the full mental bandwidth to think through what is best and right. The boy has neither of those things. He has NO ONE looking out for him and his best interests in this situation. \u00a0Rest assured when I tell you your wife grooming him is NOT in his best interest.\n\nFrankly, if you have knowledge of sexual abuse of a minor and you hold on to that knowledge because it best suits your personal interests you ARE culpable. Morally as well as by law. It is much more likely to come back and bite you if you do not tell than if you do. You think those parents aren\u2019t going to ask why you didn\u2019t protect their son as soon as you had suspicions? You think they\u2019re not going to go to the law and tell them that you didn\u2019t report that you had suspicions until after you took care of yourself? Because if I were a parent in this situation I absolutely would do that. I would be finding every mandated reporting law on the books and making sure you were arrested for breaking them all, if at all possible.\n\nWhat your wife is doing to you is horrific but what she\u2019s doing to this boy is evil.

He\u2019s so young. You are giving him a life sentence of so much pain and dysfunction.\n\nThere is no doubt you will be impacted emotionally as well. There is no doubt that you need to divorce this woman. There is no doubt you\u2019re going to need a good therapist and a good lawyer. However, this is a situation where your needs to be placed on the back burner. A child is involved. The child is the priority. Trust me when I say by looking out for him you will be looking out for yourself. Legally and morally.\u00a0",

Her refusal to suggests she's still not being entirely honest about the nature of her relationship with the minor. \n\nOP is also not a criminal court. He's not required to have proof beyond all reasonable doubt or to honor the Fifth Amendment. He gave his wife an opportunity to prove his suspicions baseless and she refused.\n\nIf OP were a school staff member, or someone affiliated with the youth league, etc. he would be mandated to report his suspicions to the authorities\u2014 what he's already described is grounds enough for that. If OP told a mandated reporter what he has written here then they would likely need to report her. The police can decide if there's probable cause and perform the legal investigation, with OP's wife both entitled to her constitutional rights but also with investigators entitled to subpoena materials as needed.\n\nAnyway, at the very least she needs to cut off all contact with this student and end her coaching for the youth league. That should be the absolute baseline course of action.",

But even in that case, I wouldn\u2019t say that is the correct move. What this thread seems to be missing is that a minor may be being abused and that\u2019s the first priority here\u2014and would be what any judge would consider the most important point. There is no way any court would tell OP, \u201cyou tried super hard to make sure a minor couldn\u2019t be abused by your wife, screw you.\u201d They might, however, say, \u201cyou suspected your wife of abusing a minor and did nothing, screw you.\u201d I\u2019m not an attorney, but that may veer into the realm of being a complicit accessory to a crime. Even if he\u2019s wrong and no sexual/legal boundaries have been crossed YET, preventing a minor from being victimized as soon as possible is the right thing to do and would also happen to have much better optics in a court room. Waiting for \u201csolid proof\u201d just creates more opportunities for something preventable to happen and potentially brings liability upon himself for his inaction. And inappropriate communication leads to other stuff. That\u2019s why schools prohibit it.\n\nSomeone else mentioned that there are people who would be legally required to report this situation if they became aware of it. An anonymous tip to an administrator as soon as possible would be appropriate; policy would require discreet investigation (they wouldn\u2019t want any unnecessary scandal) and the child would be protected. OP could have someone else call it in if he really wanted to. \u201cI strongly suspect a coach of inappropriate communications via Instagram with a minor participating in your sports program.\u201d Done. If they find no fault, then that\u2019s great, everyone is safe and at least then staff get a clear reminder that will possibly help his wife get her boundaries in order.\n\nOP, do not get sucked into self-protective mode to the point that you actually do something wrong (morally or legally) by failing to report this. When it comes to protecting kids, there are very clear boundaries and as an educator myself, I cannot fathom anyone suggesting the person reporting a suspicious relationship is the bad guy. Don\u2019t let your wife gaslight you into thinking you\u2019re the one at fault here.",

My wife (33F) has been acting really strange lately, and I\u2019m starting to think she might be cheating on me\u2026 with one of the kids she coaches. I feel sick even typing that.\n\nSome background: my wife is an accountant by day, and in the evenings, she volunteers as a soccer coach for a local youth team. She's always loved soccer, and I thought it was great that she was so involved with the kids and the community. But recently, she\u2019s been dropping weird comments that are starting to really concern me.\n\nIt all started about two months ago. She casually mentioned one of the boys on her team \u2014 he\u2019s 17, and I won\u2019t say his name for obvious reasons. At first, it was harmless stuff, like \u201cHe\u2019s really talented for his age\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s a natural leader on the field.\u201d I didn\u2019t think much of it because, well, she\u2019s a coach, and it\u2019s her job to encourage the kids, right?\n\nBut then the comments started to get...weird. Like one night, out of nowhere, she said, \u201cYou know, \\[kid\u2019s name\\] has really pretty eyes. They\u2019re so striking.\u201d I remember thinking, \"Uh, that\u2019s an odd thing to say about a kid you're coaching.\" I kind of brushed it off at first, but then more things followed.\n\nAnother time, she came home after practice and said, \u201cHe\u2019s so much more athletic than anyone else on the team. It\u2019s impressive how developed he is.\u201d Again, I tried to shake it off, but my gut started nagging at me. Why is she talking about him so much?\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s been getting way more secretive. She\u2019s always been open with her phone and emails, but lately, she\u2019s been turning her screen away from me when she texts or checks messages. I asked her about it, and she just laughed it off, saying I was being paranoid.\n\nShe\u2019s also been staying later and later after practices. At first, she told me it was just because they were prepping for some tournament, but now, even with the tournament over, she\u2019s still coming home late. When I ask, she gives vague excuses like, \u201cOh, the team needed extra help,\u201d or \u201cI had some paperwork to catch up on.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing that really has me spiraling: Last week, I came home early from work. I expected to have the house to myself since she was supposed to be at practice, but when I walked in, I found her sitting on the couch, texting someone with a huge smile on her face. When she saw me, she quickly locked her phone and got super flustered. She said it was \"just one of the parents asking about game schedules,\" but it didn\u2019t feel right.\n\nI don\u2019t have any solid proof, but something just feels *off*. Why would she be talking about this kid\u2019s looks? Why is she suddenly so secretive? I haven\u2019t been able to shake the feeling that something more is going on.\n\nI don\u2019t want to accuse her of something so serious without any real evidence, but I also don\u2019t want to ignore my instincts. I love her, and I really don\u2019t want to believe she\u2019d do something like this, especially with a kid she\u2019s supposed to be mentoring.\n\nSo, Reddit, what should I do? Am I reading too much into this? Is she cheating on me with this 17-year-old, or am I just being paranoid? How do I even begin to confront her about something like this?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I\u2019m honestly feeling lost right now.\n\n**Updates:**\n\nHi everyone,\n\nFirst off, I want to thank all of you for the overwhelming amount of comments, advice, and support on my original post. I really needed some sense knocked into me, and I genuinely appreciate the community\u2019s input\u2014it has meant a lot during this confusing time.\n\nAfter reading your comments, I took some of your advice and contacted my lawyer on the evening of my original post. I\u2019ll go into more details about that shortly, but before diving into the updates, I\u2019d like to clarify why this post is coming out now and in this format.\n\nUnfortunately, after posting, my original post was taken down and I received a three-day ban from the subreddit. Thankfully, the post was later restored, but I had to wait until the ban lifted to share updates. I did keep track of each development and wrote them out as they happened, so I\u2019ll be sharing them in chronological order, just as I intended from the start.\n\nI am posting the updates on a new post because there is so much to say, and I think creating a new post is best for organising all of the updates in a clear manner. In the update post will include a link to the original post for those who may not of seen it.",

When you find what you\u2019re looking for, screenshot and send to yourself, and delete the fact you\u2019ve done it. Get your ducks in a row, accounts and all, lawyer up and leave. THEN YOU GIVE HER THE REASON. Make sure you let his parents know, as well as the organization she volunteers for. Go ahead and speak to the other coaches if you can.

The comments she has made can both ways. If you are thinking about it through the lens of cheating, it would be easy to think this is a confirmation- aka confirmation bias. If you look at it through the lens of a coach, I think you could/would easily come to a different conclusion.

No doubt about it, people who are in responsible positions (like a coach) over minors and abuse that position go to prison.\n\nIf this is happening, it's going to come out.  She's going to be disgraced, probably never coach soccer again, lose her job, and go to prison.  It's likely not going to go well for you either, unfortunately.\n\nMy kids swam in high school and one of the neighboring schools that we regularly swam against had a male coach who was involved in a sexual relationship with a 17 y/o female swimmer on their team.  It doesn't matter if it's consensual or not, the law is clear.  He spent 10 years in prison.  His wife waited on him though and I believe he's putting his life back together, but without teaching or coaching ever again.\n\nMy recommendation is that you need to get to the bottom of this.  I agree that an accusation is likely to just be met with an angry response.  You may need to do some detective work and find out if what you suspect is actually happening or not and then confront her.  Get into her phone, be in the area when she's \"working late\", follow her actions.  Not a great prospect but this is a serious matter.\n\nBut whether you discover the truth, the boys parents discover it, or someone else finds out accidentally, she's likely in big trouble.\n\nI hope that this is all just as she says, but the warning signs are all there at this point.",

People\u2019s phone numbers may easily be in a database that\u2019s picked up by a \u2018people finder\u2019 website. \n\nYou could also grab a burner phone and call the number. A lot of people don\u2019t pickup calls from unknown numbers, but if he\u2019s a high school kid, he might think someone passed along his info to someone else. \n\nCheck your bank and credit cards for charges that coincide with times she\u2019s \u201cat a team function\u201d you suspect may be a cover. \n\nLast shot is to hire a private investigator and have her followed on a couple of afternoons you know she has some plan, but it seems bogus. If you feel like that\u2019s too expensive, consider renting or borrowing a car she\u2019s not so familiar with, and follow her yourself. Cheating in general is one thing. If she\u2019s letting this kid get in her car and taking him anywhere but straight home, that is inappropriate. \n\nIt\u2019s important for you and your marriage to have some kind of proof before you accuse her or go to the school or police with the suspicion she\u2019s having inappropriate contact with a minor. Doing that will almost definitely end up with your wife being questioned, and it is likely to get out. She could lose her day job, and you will definitely blow your marriage up. \n\nI agree with you that she\u2019s acting like someone who is cheating. Been there, and what you\u2019re saying is quite familiar. If you confront her before you have proof, she may still cheat, but you can be sure she\u2019ll cover her tracks better than ever, so act a little clueless for now. \n\nI hope you\u2019re wrong, but thank you for making sure this kid isn\u2019t being molested.",

If she gets super wasted every time thats a big problem and could be a huge contributing factor to her past behaviour. Depending on how she handles those boundaries should determine whether or not you stay in the relationship. I would put a hold on any thoughts of marriage for now at the very least.",

While people can change, it normally takes something drastic to make it happen.\n\nYou have 2 options. \n\nOption 1: Leave her now with zero proof she has cheated or wronged you not knowing if she would have ever cheated on you. You will be left with the question of what could have been . \n\nOption 2: stay with her and give her the benefit of the doubt because as far as you know she hasn\u2019t cheated on you yet, but you\u2019ll always have that little voice in the back of your head wondering if she is cheating on you now or who she\u2019s talking too etc etc\n\nBoth options suck to be honest. If you stay and she does cheat, you can\u2019t be too surprised. \n\nIf you leave her preemptively for a\u201d what if \u201c scenario i can almost guarantee you will be haunted by what could have been .  \n\nNeither sounds pleasant if I\u2019m honest. I know the second one doesn\u2019t sound that bad at the moment, but later on in life . Oof lol. Especially if it\u2019s been pretty solid up until this point. \n\nAll that aside, the smartest option is probably to leave. ( but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the best option) \n\nAs stated in the beginning, most people don\u2019t change unless something has really shaken them to their core. We all have for lack of an ability to think better analogy a \u201cRuler/scale  \u201c which we use to judge the world around us . Some peoples rulers/scales are just not zeroed properly. They\u2019re \u201coff\u201d so no matter what they judge it will always be wrong because the thing they\u2019re using to judge things is wrong in the first place. Unless an event happens that re zeros or resets the thing they measure the world with they\u2019re just kinda screwed .\n\nThis is partially why we all know people who mess up all the time even though they may try incredibly hard to be better.",

So watch out for that.\n\n>she simply admitted to cheating on all SEVEN of her boyfriends, and the cherry on top? they never knew, she was almost.. braggy about it in a way, prideful, and egotistical. i was taken aback, and shocked to my core (we\u2019ve been dating for 3 years, she NEVER mentioned cheating on any of her ex\u2019s, much less all SEVEN of them)\n\nThat's pretty wild.  I get that maybe she was attention seeking because you were playing games.. but 3 years together too.  Then the attitude about it... almost like she's saying \"So here's what's gonna happen, because I always do it when I don't get what I want (attention) and I'm proud of that because I deserve what I want (attention).\"\n\n>after i woke up in the morning,\n\n>part of me was hesitant to bring up her confession, but i did, and once i asked her, her expression changed, her eyes widened, and she started stuttering, she then admitted to everything being true, and began crying,\n\nCrying is -not a defense- that's valid.  \n\n>i told her i needed space and left, it\u2019s been 2 days\n\n>her cheating on her partners, and bragging about how she got away with it has me feeling violently sick, and now i\u2019m stuck in my own paranoia\n\n>i keep asking myself, what if she cheated on me? what if im next? what if she played me too?\n\nSo, stop avoiding it and communicate all of this.\n\n>she keeps blowing up my phone, but i\u2019ve been decking her.\n\nThis is immature of you.  It's fair to take a day or so, but you need to hash it out.  Her reaction and attitude during the confrontation will tell you whether to stick with her or bail.\n\n>although it\u2019s been 10 years since her physically cheating on all of her past relationships doesn\u2019t mean im safe with her, clearly i wasn\u2019t when she was SO CLOSE to emotionally cheating on me in the start of her relationship, and even though she admitted to cutting them off, in that moment, i lost almost all my respect for her.\n\nIf this last line is true, break up.  There's no reason for someone not to have a few other interests when they first started dating you.\n\n>respectfully, i told her that i was done\n\nThere you go then.  You did the best thing FOR YOU, and I don't mean that in a negative way.  You gotta call your own shots and know how you feel-- good for you.",

I agreed to the open relationship because it was either that, divorce, or say no and he would likely cheat on me anyway. After a while of our open relationship he told me he had been with another girl before we married, and saw nothing wrong with it since I agreed to be open. No matter how much I said, we weren't open then so it was still cheating, he didn't understand why I was upset. He has kinky interests that I am not willing to participate in. And it got to the point where our sex was shit because he couldn't stay hard without those kinks. Long story short, I agreed to be open to save the marriage but here we are... separated anyway.

Your husband is an absolute hero. Please get him a lawyer who is heavily experienced and give him a big bear hug when he gets out of jail. I hope your friend gets out of her relationship as soon as possible, and seeks help to recover from the abuse. I now have a magnet on my fridge that says \"Strong People stand up for themselves, the strongest people stand up for others\", and try to live those words out in every situation where it's needed. I'm happily married to a man who would never hurt me, and couldn't be happier. Wishing you and your hubby the best!",

Of course, not so once he went to being confined. \n\nAfter that, I couldn't do anything or find out anything without his number. \n\nFinally after a while he called (collect,of course)  so I right away told him I need his number and he gave it. Later on, after release, he told me: he had seen men make collect calls and instead of a name they would spit out the inmate number. Now we knew why. \n\nIt appears to me, a lot of this is deliberately made as difficult as possible. I don't know why/for what purpose, other than meanness. But anything they can make harsher it appears they do so. I'm sorry your family is experiencing this. My family member wasn't given a mattress... other prisoners had to tell him what to ask.  \n\nIf you don't hear from him by a reasonable time, go see a bondsman. That's who will get him out.  (Generally they are taken to a judge at 9am. So I would reasonably think you would hear something by noon). \n\nLawyer up. This system is so difficult for the average person to navigate, \n\nCall a bondsman. Call a lawyer. If husband calls you, immediately get his inmate number and then tell him right away don't talk at all about what happened.  Just tell him you're getting bondsman/lawyer, as appropriate. \n\nSome of the jails are now giving prisoners a kind of tablet. He said you can watch \"church\" on it. With money on his account he can call you on it and he can pay for/watch some television.  They don't get to keep it but it is some welcomed distraction as long as they have it. (You can put money on his account but you have to know his number. Although one family friend did show us you can go there and do it in person if you don't have the number. You go to the courthouse lobby and there's a machine that will take your money). \n\nJail can happen to anyone, misunderstandings happen. It ought not to be so extremely difficult to navigate. there ought to be some humanity. I understand some people need to be separated, jails and prisons serve a purpose. But your mother or son could wind up in there, anyone could have a wrong identification or misunderstanding. \n\nIf you don't know your family's phone number, you could be even worse off. Try to memorize at least one phone number. \n\nWe were told he'd be out.  It took 3 days. I'm sorry this is happening to you.",

One sent money to her abuser when she couldn't afford to pay me anything while staying with me. I've gotten a black eye and been threatened by men, whom these people I cared for went back to afterwards. So I've seen what happens when you try to help, but the woman won't press charges. I have an elder in my family whose grandson is threatening her. Other family members called the authorities,  but they questioned her in his presence and she wouldn't say anything 1) because she doesn't her only grandson to go to prison and 2) because he frightens her and 'what if they don't take him or let him out'. My brother paid for a friend to live in a hotel for a month. She did nothing during that time to try to find a way to make it. She just talked to her boyfriend the whole month and just moved back with him on the promise that he'd not hit her again. He did.\n\nAll that to say: in a lot of cases, more people want to help, but we can't because it can put us in danger for someone who isn't ready to leave. And we can use all our resources to help in vain.",

You have to somehow explain how you thought they remained a threat, a lawyer can be vital for that.\n\nAlthough you are correct, shitty lawyers may push for a plea bargain to save time.

            "text": "So, a little backstory: I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend (both 28) for almost two years. Over the last two years, my boyfriend has tended to get really upset over really small things. For example, \n1. Once I got undressed too close to a window on vacation (we were on the top floor of a hotel) and he screamed at me and accused me of wanting other people to see me naked. \n2. One time we were in a different hotel and I guess I said something too loud, and he physically covered my mouth with his hand and had the other hand behind my head which left me unable to speak. \n3. About two months into us dating, we went on a dinner date and had agreed to watch a movie at his house after. I accidentally dozed off on the couch and he got really upset about it. \n\nAnyway, tonight, I cooked us dinner and he was kinda helping me clean up my kitchen (we do not live together). I asked if he would take the trash out while I finished cleaning, and he said he didn\u2019t feel like it. I ended up taking it out and when I came back inside, I began giving him a hard time, saying \u201care you actually a man bc I just took the trash out\u201d. This made him really mad and he pushed me hard with both hands. I didn\u2019t fall or anything, but I did stumble backwards. I told him I wanted him to leave my house and he responded that he wouldn\u2019t. I said it at least 3 more times, and then he finally did leave. He texted me \u201csorry for pushing you\u201d after he left, but I didn\u2019t respond. I think this might be my breaking point. I know this isn\u2019t normal. \n\nEdit: I really appreciate how supportive everyone in the comments has been. I fully understand that I shouldn\u2019t have said what I did about him \u201cbeing a man\u201d last night, and I take full responsibility for that. However, I don\u2019t think it was necessary for him to push me in response. I\u2019ve been making excuses for his behavior for way too long and this is my breaking point. The last thing I want is to have children with this man and this be the relationship they grow up seeing. ",

He followed me, grabbed me, and threw me to the ground. I got up and went home. The next morning, the only way I could get out of bed was to roll out, and was in severe pain. I went to the ER, and found out I had whiplash in my neck, and had pulled every muscle in my back. The police were called, but I wouldn\u2019t press charges. \n\nI took him back after he groveled and cried real tears. A month later, he raised his fist to slug me. I told him that if he hit me I\u2019d press charges for it , and the previous incident, so he put that fist through a wall while I ran. \n\nI got lucky. He was much bigger than me, and he could have hurt me far worse than before. I never forgot that lesson. \n\nYou deserve better.",

Usually men who physically abuse a woman, they start slow, like a push her or a slap there and then over time it gets worse and worse to the point where he is beating the heck out of you. Usually abusers are triggered very easily and almost everything upsets them, even small things. They usually jump to ridiculous conclusions, like where you mentioned your boyfriend accused you of getting undressed because you wanted to be watched by other people while you were naked. He then covered your mouth to prevent you from speaking. These are all signs of a man who is going to be a hardcore abuser. Leave him now. Thank goodness you are not married to him. I\u2019m not sure if you live with him or not but if you do live with him, now is the time to start packing your bags and moving back to your parents home or live with a relative or a friend temporarily. Do you have a job and can support yourself? If not, start looking for a job. Leave this guy because I guarantee you things are going to get worse and he will become more abusive and he could end up killing you as there have been thousands of women who have been killed during a domestic violence dispute. I hope you don\u2019t have children with him because he will abuse them as well. Do you leave him? Yes, absolutely. As soon as possible. Like pack right now and go.",

I can give you a hotline number.\n\nI would also advise putting together a **Safety Plan.**\n\nA Safety Plan is a personalised, practical plan that can help you avoid hurtful situations and know the best way to react when things are going badly between you.\n\nThis plan includes vital information tailored to your unique situation and will help you prepare for and respond to different scenarios, including telling friends and family about your situation and events as they happen, coping with emotions, and various resources suited to your individual circumstances. \n\nIn your Safety Plan, include information for when you leave him. For instance, include a plan to gather up all important items prior to the split including identification, important documents, all medication, medical records, car permits, and personal items that are important to you and store them somewhere safe. This will help you navigate things when you are emotional and under duress. \n\nHere are some resources to help you: \n\nhttps://www.thehotline.org/plan-for-safety/create-your-personal-safety-plan/\n\nhttps://www.1800respect.org.au/help-and-support/safety-planning/checklist\n\nAnd those hotlines I gave you can help you create one too.\n\n**What you need to know is that what he did is not normal, it is not okay, and it is not excusable. You are right to feel hurt, scared and betrayed. Trust your gut. Your body\u2019s warning systems are telling you something.**\n\n**\u201cGenuine love means respecting the humanity of the other person, wanting what is best for him or her, and supporting the other person\u2019s self-esteem and independence. This kind of love is incompatible with abuse and coercion.\u201d** - [Lundy Bancroft](https://ia800108.us.archive.org/30/items/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf)\n\nI\u2019m going to pop some signs of emotional abuse below; because I suspect there\u2019s a lot more abuse going on than you realise. \n\n**Signs of Emotional Abuse:**\n\n1) **They are Hyper-Critical or Judgmental Towards You**\n\n2) **They Ignore Boundaries or Invade Your Privacy**\n\n3) **They are Possessive and/or Controlling**\n\n4) **They are Manipulative**\n\n5) **They Often Dismiss You and Your Feelings**\n\nAnother list:\n\n**Humiliation, negation and criticism - tactics that undermine self-esteem.**\n\nExamples include: \n+ hyper-critical / judgmental towards you\n+ insults like calling you stupid, derogatory nicknames / terms of endearment that highlight your weaknesses / things you\u2019re sensitive about, won\u2019t stop when asked; \n+ character assassination (eg: \u2018you\u2019re always xyz\u2019) to you or you others about you; \n+ screaming, yelling and swearing to intimidate you; \n+ patronising and belittling you (eg: \u2018I know this is beyond your ability to comprehend\u2019); \n+ public embarrassment - picking fights, spilling your secrets or making fun of your shortcomings in public; \n+ insulting your appearance; \n+ belittling your accomplishments; \n+ putting down your interests (because they don\u2019t want you to participate in activities without them); \n+ pushing your buttons - continuing to do the things that annoy/upset you even if you beg them to stop.\n\n**Control and Shame - tactics that manipulate you into doing what they want you to do, often by making you feel ashamed of your inadequacies. controlling everything you do.**\n\nExamples include, trying to control you by:\n+ ignoring your boundaries;\n+ invading your privacy;\n+ behaving in a possessive manner;\n+ manipulative behaviour;\n+ making threats;\n+ monitoring your whereabouts;\n+ spying on you (physically, digitally, via others);\n+ gaslighting you (which can leave you questioning your own memory, not to mention your mental health and well-being);\n+ making all of the decisions;\n+ controlling your access to finances;\n+ emotional blackmailing (including frequently \u2018testing\u2019 you);\n+ lecturing you constantly (cataloguing every minor perceived error, monologues of all the ways you\u2019ve fallen short, making it clear that you are beneath them);\n+ having frequent outbursts;\n+ feigning helplessness;\n+ unpredictability (creating a walking on eggshells effect);\n+ walking out (eg: of events, unexpectedly);\n+ stonewalling you during disagreements or conflicts.\n\n**Accusing, blaming, denial - creating a hierarchy with them on top and you on the bottom.**\n\nExamples include: \n+ jealousy (eg: accusing you of cheating or flirting);\n+ guilt-tripping;\n+ unrealistic expectations (they expect you to do what they want, when they want you to do it;\n+ they think you should always prioritise their needs, do things according to their standards \u2014 and you absolutely shouldn\u2019t hang out with your friends or family if there\u2019s any chance they might need you);\n+ goading and blaming (goading you into being upset and then blaming you for your reaction), \n+ denying the abuse (and often flipping it into you);\n+ dismissive of your feelings / trivialising (eg: if you express your feelings about something they did, they accuse you of overreacting or misunderstanding the situation);\n+ blaming you for their problems;\n+ destroying and denying (they might destroy or damage important possessions, etc and then deny it or claim it was an accident). \n\n**Emotional neglect and isolation - they will try to get you to prioritise their needs and neglect your own and they\u2019ll also make an effort to isolate you from your support network, leaving you more dependent on them and less able to contextualise their behaviour.**\n\nExamples include: \n+ dehumanising you (eg: intentionally look away when you\u2019re talking or stare at something else when speaking to you in an effort to make you feel unimportant); \n+ keeping you from socialising; \n+ invalidating you (suggesting or stating that your your needs, boundaries, and desires don\u2019t matter to them); \n+ trying to come between you and your family; \n+ using the silent treatment; \n+ withholding affection (refusing intimate contact if you offend them or refuse to do what they want you to do); \n+ shutting down communication; \n+ actively working to turn others against you (eg: undermining you and your mental health to others, making you seem unstable, turning you into the \u2018bad guy\u2019, etc); \n+ interrupting (your talk, your activities, etc. - forcing your attention on them); \n+ disputing your feelings (insisting you shouldn\u2019t feel that way). \n\nPlease note that your partner might not do all of these things; but if he is doing some of them, that is emotional abuse.\n\nPlease be safe. You need to get out ASAP. It can be hard. It might take time and multiple tries; but you can do it. **You are not alone.** Chin up.",

This guy is an abuser, and it will only escalate the longer you\u2019re together.

Take out a protection order with your local PD (this ensures that if he even comes to your place, there\u2019s no bullshit or explaining why you\u2019re scared, he\u2019s just arrested immediately). When you drop this piece of trash, have your largest male friend come hang out for the evening (if dude shows up before the police, this will help, and it\u2019s well known that the abusive type male cannot actually stand up to an actual man, or anyone more powerful than them). \n\nLastly, just for an attempt at levity: this guy did an angry 2 handed push, and you didn\u2019t fall over; do you really want to be with a man that\u2019s actually that weak?",

I can't speak definitively about the laws of other states; but it's hard to believe they'd be this different). \n\nLeaving abusive relationships is often hard. I've had a number of clients who tried to get away from abusive partners but then decided to go back to them. Sometimes it seems to be about financial dependency, but not always: I've seen this behavior a number of times from financially independent, even wealthy women (and it is often women, though abuse can be committed by people of any gender against people of any gender). There's some social pressure that makes you feel like you can't leave - even though, I hope you would agree, this behavior is totally unacceptable. Think how you would feel if a friend of yours told you that her boyfriend did these things to her. \n\nDomestic violence like this tends to escalate, as people like your boyfriend discover what they can get away with. It operates in cycles, of mounting abuse followed by emotional breakdown, maybe apology and reconciliation, but it's unlikely to change unless your boyfriend does some real intense work on himself - and for that to happen, he needs to experience some consequences. For your own safety, I beg you to stop seeing him. You have the advantage that you don't live together, which should make this somewhat easier. You don't have to be cruel - end it as kindly as you like, but please, end it. If he refuses to accept your decision, and continues to harass you, please talk to a lawyer in your area.",

Cheri was beautiful, petite, and sweet. Her husband would take her her to and from work. I met him a few times, and he gave me the chills. He had cold, dead eyes, and he was a massive man. \n\nOver the next 6 months, I got to know my co- worker as we worked in the same department. We had another co-worker who was a good-looking guy who played college football.  He worked with us  to make extra money in the off-season. \n\nCheri started to open up to me and the rest of us about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband. She came into work one day, and she was having a hard time moving. Come to find out, he had beat the shit out of her. He'd hit her where it wouldn't show. He would place a bar of soap in a sock and hit her in her back, stomach, and legs, but never where the beating was visible. The football  player started to fall for sweet Cheri. Her asshole husband would never let Cheri keep her checks.  She had to turn all the money over to him. He wouldn't let her have friends, and he listened in on her phone conversations. Mark(the football player,  not his real name) found out about Cheri's abuse. When we saw her back and stomach filled with bruises,  I cried. Mark wanted to beat the shit out of her husband. \n\nWe begged her to call the police, but she said it wouldn't do any good. He would get out of jail and beat her worse because it had happened before. This was back in the early 80s. So, I approached my female professor, who was also on the board for a domestic abuse center, and asked her for help. \n\nAll of us employees pooled our money together, including the owner of the store, and we helped Cheri escape. The owner gave her new clothes, and we girls gave her toiletries, etc. My professor had a place reserved for her at the domestic shelter. Cheri's husband dropped her off at work. He had beat her the day prior. We waited for the husband to drive off, and we sprung into action. \n\nWe gave her 7k in cash, the clothes, etc., and my professor picked her up from the alley behind the store. We loaded Cheri into the car. Five hours later, her pos husband came  to pick her up from work, and when he found out Cheri was gone, he went into a rage. He demanded we tell him where she went. We stayed quiet. He then threw a swing at the football player, and it was on. All of us dog piled on her asshole husband, including the store owner, and this time, her pos husband was the one that was beaten. \n\nCheri ended up divorcing her husband. We showed up with her when she had court dates so her husband couldn't attack her in the parking lot. Cheri moved back to her hometown in Texas and went back to school, got a degree, and married a wonderful man.\n\nSomerimes,.there are happy endings. \n.",

            "text": "Hello, I'm writing here because I was so surprised by the suggestion that I was left speechless and I don't know what to do. \n\n\nContext: As context: I am a 21-year-old girl studying at university. About a year ago, my mother had to have her uterus removed due to medical problems. This made my mother and my stepfather start having problems in their relationship because my stepfather wants to have children and, obviously, my mother can't \"give them to him.\"\n\n\nIn the end, a month ago my stepfather left the house over this same issue, so my mother started obsessing over finding ways to have children. He even wanted to adopt, but my stepfather said that since it wasn't his, he wouldn't come to love it. Until he got to the topic of surrogacy.\n\n\nShe started researching the topic and saw that it was extremely expensive (in dollars, it would be around 30,000), so who was her cheap option? Yo.\n\n\nOn the same day (10/22/24), he asked me to be his surrogate. Because supposedly I am their only support network and because I wouldn't charge them anything. But when he told me, I felt an overwhelming urge to vomit and cry. She started saying that she wouldn't force me, but a moment later she talked about how beautiful pregnancy was and that she would talk to my university to get their support. \n\n\nI clearly don't want to have children at this age. Yes, I'm no longer a teenager, but I'm still young and I don't want to ruin my life explaining why I'm pregnant. In addition to this, I take psychiatric medications and an unwanted pregnancy would, in short, make me commit suicide. \n\n\nSo my only options (considering my mother's personality) are: accept and live in depression or get kicked out of the house and not be able to study anymore.\n\n\nWhat should I do? I'm really very desperate.",

I am so sorry you are going through this. The fact that you have been asked is not ok.\n\n2. The answer is no. No is a complete sentence. I do understand that likely won\u2019t fly. Not sure where you are- but I know where I am (ONT, Canada) you need to have previously had a successful birth before you can become a surrogate- even for someone you know. It\u2019s an expensive process no matter what, they want to ensure that everyone knows what they are getting into. \n\n3. Giving up a baby- even one that is not biologically yours, once it has lived in your body for 9 months is not an easy thing to do. If even a cell in your body is leaning towards yes- then please keep this in mind. You have never given birth (neither have I), but in everything I have read, it can be quite an arduous process.\n\n3. Where on earth does your mother think she is getting the egg? I hope she doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s coming from you. And that is expensive in itself. \n\n4. Look into free therapy provided by your school. I don\u2019t know what the US and other countries look like, but many of the Canadian universities have a lot of support when it comes to students. You need a trusted person on this one, clearly outride of your family, to rely on as this situation unfolds.\n\n5. This is very clearly an unhealthy relationship your mother is in. It makes me worried for other aspects. Have a go bag ready for your own safety. If you can, ensure you get a good lock for your door. I don\u2019t want to see anything happen out of desperation on your mother or her partner\u2019s end. \n\n6. Look into shelters for victims of domestic violence. They help people get on their feet. Explain the situation. You are not feeling safe in your body as you are feeling pressured to use it to provide a baby for your mother. Work with them to develop a plan. If you get kicked out at 11 at night or god forbid they try to force something, you need to know where to go and have your bag packed to get there. Ensure you have some cash, your passport, SIN, birth certificate, bank info, everything you absolutely need. Also ensure that your banking info is not connected to your mother so if you need to go for your safety, she can\u2019t track you\n\n7. You are not alone. This won\u2019t be easy, but I know you can do this. It\u2019s ok to have the tidal wave of emotions before this is over. Fear, anxiety, anger, sadness, etc\u2026. Are all ok. Be kind to yourself. If you are struggling during this time to keep up with school work, your profs are human. Let them in on as much as you feel comfortable with. Or just tell them your family situation is changing and your are requesting more time. Try and do this before an assignment is due, not after. Our brains don\u2019t work at 100% when we are under threat. Ask for help when you need it.\n\nGood luck OP. I am sending my best thoughts and strength your way.",

OP, everyone has give excellent advice, I\u2019m going to add:\n\n- actual surrogacy agencies often *require* that you\u2019ve already had a healthy pregnancy and children of your own before you\u2019re even allowed to volunteer for such an intense service to struggling couples. There\u2019s a *reason* for this - and it\u2019s because, while pregnancy is \u201cbeautiful\u201d, it\u2019s also genuinely and 100% physically intense, medically intense, and can genuinely result in permanent physical damage to your body, to the baby, to both of you - up to, and including - death. You can\u2019t properly agree to a risk like this without having first been through it. \n\n- surrogacy requires signed legal documents, healthcare payments, and all kinds of insurance for a reason. They don\u2019t want to pay the $30k? Then that\u2019s tough. Who would be covering your insurance and the birth payments? Who would be covering your necessities when it\u2019s time to take maternity leave/leave of absence? Who is going to cover any surgery costs associated with the birth, if it comes to that? Who will be covering the expenses and losses to *you* when you put your entire life on hold to recover from birth - serious and dangerous medical process?\n\n- What happens if stepdad *still* doesn\u2019t bond to this baby? What happens then? \n\n- What happens if you agree to this, and suddenly stepdad (and mom, via emotional abuse and coercion) attempt to impregnate you via a\u2026 non-consensual way? (Stepdad asking is also so creepy - it makes me see red flags and concerns me over any warped ideas he may have for impregnating you). \n\n- what happens if you agree\u2026 but then, later, back out? What would they do? What would the reaction be? \n\n- There are so many countless ways this could go wrong, and you, OP, will be left without compensation or help because they are trying to emotionally manipulate you and guilt you into being a \u201cfree\u201d surrogate.\n\n- consider as well: if you agree to this: your mom\u2019s age, your stepdad\u2019s age - and, goodness forbid - what would happen to the baby/child if something were to happen to either of them? If you\u2019re their \u201cprimary support\u201d, you may end up with a kid. Even if you don\u2019t agree to surrogacy (and you shouldn\u2019t), you need to ensure that legally, they have other back up plans. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe them anything. \n\nI\u2019d honestly push for your mom to get therapy for her issues and the abuse she\u2019s dealing with from your stepdad. \n\nI\u2019d also encourage you *and* her to read, \u201cWhy Does He Do That?\u201d By Lundy - even if all you do is peruse the pertinent parts. It\u2019s important. It\u2019s also [free to read here.](https://sa1s3.patientpop.com/assets/docs/85477.pdf)\n\n\nBe safe, OP. Be careful. Take note of any other red flags and plan accordingly for your own safety. Your stepdad sounds like a proper creep from what you\u2019ve written here, and the fact that your mom is going along with this is beyond upsetting. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, OP.

Since your mother's husband (and your mother) seem like (pardon my words) pieces of shit, you could use a lingo to make them think that the fetus has a very high change of developing a cognitive and/or physical disability.\n\n\n\nPlease put *yourself* first and don't accept under no circumstance. You do *not* want this no matter how they try to twist it to make you feel obligated to. *You are obligated to nothing of this.* Depending of your country, the type of resources may vary but since you speak spanish, I assume you are latin american. You can search for feminist groups/\"t\u00edas\" groups (the ladies who help women get abortions) since they are usually more knowledgeable on the available resources of their countries.\n\n\nBest of luck OP.",

As someone said here, she's ready to sacrifice you, your physical and mental health, and your future, to keep her relationship afloat. And the worst thing is that I don't think their couple is fit to have a child together. A child isn't supposed to be the Band-Aid that holds a relationship together.\n\nI understand that you feel overwhelmed and miserable. She's delusional, as she shown when she started talking about making an arrangement with your university. It is extremely inappropriate to ask you to be her surrogate womb. As you stated, you don't want to have children, you're actually busy studying and you're taking medication that prevents you to take your own life. And knowing all that, she asks you to put all your life on hold, crippling your mental health, and without hope of any kind of remuneration. I don't think that she realizes it, but she seems to rely on her authority as your mother to impose you to obey, as the obedient girl you are.\n\nAt 21 years old, you're legally an adult. Stand for yourself. Your mother will definitely not be delighted by your decision, and it may make things difficult for both of you, but she can't force you.\n\nYour body, your choice.",

The whole reason surrogacy is expensive is because it needs to be done properly to protect the surrogate, ensure their physical and mental health, to do IVF and to ensure that a legal framework is in place. \n\nA potential surrogate needs to have had a successful pregnancy and be physically and mentally able to have a successful pregnancy. It takes two years to recover from childbirth. Pregnancy is a serious medical condition. You have to say no for the medical reasons you've mentioned plus your unwillingness to become pregnant.",

Maybe a lawyer know some things we are not thinking of that can be of help.\n\nIs your father in your life? Have you other family members or good friends who can help you?\n\nAnd finally I suggest to lie to protect yourself if necessary: \nMaybe you can tell them you'll do it after college, or next year.

I hope things work out for you, believe me /anything/ would be easier to get out of including finding somewhere else to live than to have to go through 9 months of an unwanted pregnancy, maybe even end up getting an attachment to the child and not be able to take care of them yourself, or not have any bond and feel like you wasted 9 months of your life and let someone use your body as a tool to get a means to an end. And of course don\u2019t forget it\u2019s not just pregnancy, but then months of postpartum that could possibly put you in an even worse state mentally, and with some medications you might not even be able to take during pregnancy, in my opinion you should say NO and if you have to leave, then leave. I got kicked out too for a different reason and I know it isn\u2019t easy but having been in a similar position, my biggest advice is to say absolutely not.",

Most clinics have rules they institute, but most of those can be waived if it's a personal arrangement rather than a strictly professional one. Like you can't be a paid surrogate for a random couple if you don't meet the clinic's requirements, but if you want to be a surrogate for a close friend or relative and everybody signs waivers acknowledging that not everything is medically ideal, you may still be allowed to proceed. \n\nMothers have been surrogates for their adult daughters, for instance- no clinic would let a woman in their fifties be a surrogate to just whoever, but if the prospective parents are willing to take the risk and the surrogate is too, then it can still happen.\n\nAnyway most clinics also will not do \"traditional\" surrogacy anymore (where the surrogate is inseminated directly and it's her own eggs fertilized), because it involves more legal complication (because the surrogate is also the biological mother in that case). Surrogacy now almost always involves IVF- so the surrogate is carrying embryos made from someone else's eggs. This means it's still wildly expensive even if the surrogate is a volunteer. \n\n(I suspect this op is ragebait, but it's good for people in general to understand this stuff better because the industry really does need better regulation, and most people don't know that it isn't well regulated at all.)\n\nEdit to add: and most other countries fall to one side or the other of this- they either ban surrogacy outright or regulate it very little or not at all. This unfortunately isn't a scenario that most governments that permit surrogacy would safeguard the OP well in. She would need to advocate for herself, unfortunately.",

            "text": "So, in November of 2023, I posted on here that I traveled to South Korea with my friends and stayed there for a month. I met a Korean girl, hooked up with her, and two days before we left, she told me she was pregnant. Most of the comments told me I should go back and get a DNA test. I built up the courage, and on September 3, I booked a flight with my friend. We got there and texted her through Instagram, where she was keeping me updated with the baby, even though I was suspicious. Surprisingly, she wasn't upset with me; she was happy I was there. Anyways, I immediately asked for a DNA test, and it took three days to get the results. I was scared, nervous, and felt sick. Finally, the results came back - it's me, I'm the father. Not gonna lie, my heart dropped, I was sweating, shaking, and on the verge of tears. I came back home after being there for one week. I told her I needed to go home and think for a while. She said, and I quote, \"Ok, but please do what's right for our daughter.\" It's been about two weeks since I've been back, and I genuinely don't know what to do. I still like her, but I live in America; it's not like I can just move there. I'm still so naive to so many things. Please give me some advice; I'm stressing.\n\n\nUpdate : So, I've been getting a few DMs saying I fetishize Asians. Let me tell you how I even thought about going to South Korea. Around October of 2022, I decided to walk to a Korean restaurant that's four minutes away from my apartment and get some food. I enjoyed the food so much that I would go once or twice a week. Eventually, I grew close to the son, who was 20 at the time, and his mom. They're both Korean American. After being friends with him for a while, he asked if I wanted to take a trip to South Korea. For a while, I thought about it and eventually said yes. And that's how everything went down. I don't fetishize Asians. Korea was the first Asian country I've been to. I had only been to the UK and Mexico before. I'm talking with her, and we're figuring something out. I will let you guys know what will happen.\n\nUpdate: I want to thank everyone who genuinely gave me advice. After talking with her, we both decided it's best if I go to Korea for a bit and be there for my daughter and build a relationship with her. She\u2019s willing to get me Korean lessons and everything I need to make sure I am the best for my daughter. My family agrees I need to be there for her. I still need to figure out some things with my work, but that will come in time. Also, thank you to everyone who private messaged me. It really woke me up. Wish me luck, and check my page\u2014I posted a picture of me and her. I want y'all to see us. Thank y'all so, so much.\ud83d\ude0a\n",

I can imagine being 20 doesn\u2019t change very much as it\u2019s only a two year difference.\n\nI think whatever choices you make depend on what path you\u2019re on right now in life. If you are working or if you are attending school.\n\nIf you are solely working, then you\u2019ll need to figure out a way to financially advance yourself to such a degree that you can atleast send some kind of assistance to your daughter and be there for her physically on occasion abroad.\n\nYour other option is, if you\u2019re in school, finish your schooling as quickly as possible and do your best to find a program in Korean that allows you to work and provide for your child. This may look like teaching English predominantly, but perhaps if you strive for getting a graduate degree over there and learn the language over time this could change.\n\nIf you make these decisions NOW and start planning NOW you can be there for your child during their childhood. Maybe not a ton at first because these things take time, but you need to legally establish rights, ties, and provide evidence that this child is also yours.\n\nYour other option other than going to SK, is after she gets through her pregnancy and recovers, you can start the discussion with her now of coming to the US if she is interested in that idea.\n\nYou can get married to her, and figure out a way to get her citizenship. There\u2019s a way you can get a green card going I believe pretty early, but you might want to look into speaking to an immigration lawyer first and see what they say about everything.\n\nLastly, I would like to say to you that YES this is a lot, and YES you are young, but this isn\u2019t the end of your life unless you make it that way. You have to decide for yourself whether you want to live with the guilt of not being there for your child and the mother of your child FOREVER, or as others have mentioned \u201cfigure it out!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a lot to figure out though, and I\u2019m sorry that things will be a bit confusing for quite awhile. If you like this girl, and find her attractive, kind, and that she already cares for this child, then maybe you should make the effort to try and develop a loving relationship with her. This may not be possible at first totally due to whatever stress you feel, but I think if you put in some effort, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s not that hard to learn to love someone that is good and kind. \n\nEven if all of this doesn\u2019t work out, and in the end you do spend some time away from your child and visits happen on occasion, remember that you have a baby and she is waiting for you and will be looking for you for the rest of her life if you aren\u2019t there.\n\nFate really works in mysterious ways, and sometimes your swimmers work better than you ever imagined! But this is why it is important to use protection. I am pregnant presently and it was COMPLETELY unplanned and I am not that much older than you, it happens to the best of us.\n\nYou CAN DO THIS! \n\nYou CAN figure this out.\n\nAnd I think if you do work hard and do put your best foot forward and think of this woman and child truly as your own to support and protect you will make the right decisions as they come.\n\nWishing you the best! Be kind to yourself and be soft, don\u2019t go crazy, and DO find someone to talk to in RL about your problems, preferably someone with a degree mental health or someone reliable and wiser.\ud83d\ude05",

This is a pretty unique situation for many reasons, beyond that of the typical accidental young father. This isn\u2019t the same type of situation you\u2019d be in if you accidentally got the girl down the street pregnant.\n\nYou\u2019re going to have to work something out. Visits are necessary. Keep in mind, you may not ultimately be compatible with this woman as a life partner. After all, she\u2019s raised in an entirely different culture. It wouldn\u2019t be a tremendous shock if it did work out, but there is a lot stacked against you.\n\nFor one, are you even employable in Korea? Are you more use to your daughter if you stay in the United States where you can get a job and provide for her from afar? These are real questions you\u2019re going to have to find the answers to.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to really familiarize yourself with Korean culture\u2014 you have true ties to this country now. You\u2019re probably going to have to learn Korean if you don\u2019t know it already, as that\u2019s the language your daughter will be speaking in a few years.

It\u2019s challenging but so rewarding and you will want to do anything you can to make sure she has a good life. \n\n2) I don\u2019t know what your life of financial situation is, but you should consider talking to a recruiter for the Air Force. You will learn discipline, honor, integrity and so much more. You will get free healthcare for you and your child (you will need to do paperwork so that she becomes your dependent, unless you get married to her mom). You will get the money to financially support the child if that\u2019s how you choose to do things (I don\u2019t think you should only do this, I think you should be involved), you will get education benefits, a housing allowance, a GI Bill, entitlement to a VA loan for a house. It\u2019s something you should think about, I don\u2019t recommend this to everyone because it\u2019s tough but it seems like it could be good for you.\n\n3) Be involved, being there for your baby is so important and you did this together, it\u2019s not a one way thing, so you need to step up and take responsibility for the life you\u2019ve helped create. It will be okay, you can do this! Congratulations!!",

I'm not saying you have to do that, but you need to learn about any expectations she might hold or any cultural stigma surrounding single motherhood in Korea before you can make a fully informed decision. Paying child support and not being so personally involved might be an option in America, but I don't know how it works in South Korea and I don't think you do either.

Of course she was happy to see you!\n\nYou got some things to figure out now. Namely, where to live.\n\n* Does she intend to raise the child, or give her up for adoption? \n\nI don't know what your baby mom will want for her daughter, but I will say it's quite uncommon to meet single mothers. Or at least if you do meet them they don't declare it. Many children of unwed parents end up being put up for adoption. Talk with your baby mom about her intentions here; make sure that you're both on the same page.\n\n* Do you want to raise your daughter directly, or just financially? Or not at all? \n\nOne thing that's fairly common is a \"goose dad\" (\uae30\ub7ec\uae30 \uc544\ube60) where the mother and child live abroad (usually to learn English naturally) while the father lives at the home country supporting them financially. Your situation potentially sounds kind of like reverse of that, where you'd be living abroad (i.e., the US) and mother and child would be living in Korea. Or maybe you'd rather take you daughter in and her mom would stay in Korea and work? Unlikely, but possible, I guess!\n\n* Where does she want to live?  Are you open to her living with you in the US?  Are you open to living in SK? \n\nIf your daughter does grow up in Korea, and you are not ethnically Korean (or East Asian), she may have some social struggles. She's gonna look different from others. This could be a small thing, or a big thing for her. It might make her stronger, or it might hurt, or both. Sometimes kids who speak English too well get teased and bullied, but maybe that's changing over the past decade and the next decade. Just another factor to consider. \n\nOh, yeah, and you probably wanna learn some Korean. Better start with nursery rhymes. Search for \ub3d9\uc694 today!\n\nIt must be scary for you but you can make it work. If nothing else, you have the opportunity to move to Korea and work as an English teacher with a very comfortable F-visa on the table. Great food, great healthcare, great people. You'll get a lot of respect. You could live a pretty good life out there. Honestly, for an American, the QoL in Korea is miles above the QoL in the USA. The main thing is that you would be far from family and friends - but all homes are temporary. Even if you don't love this woman, you have the chance to make some really meaningful life choices here.",

Generally, it takes around 4 to 6 weeks after conception for pregnancy to be confirmed reliably with a test.\n\nI'm not an expert, but it raises some questions. Additionally, you might want to think about the potential benefits someone could gain from claiming that the father is from abroad, especially considering the complexities with parental rights, immigration, or financial support.\n\nGood luck with everything !\n\nEdit: Also it looks oddly convinient that the DNA results came back in only 3 days, which is really quick.

In countries where abortion is a reasonable alternative and a woman chooses not to take it, I generally think that we shouldn't treat men like monsters for leaving when they get women pregnant. Not to say that it isn't *better* when they do stay, but these things are complicated, especially for a young guy, and I find it hard to blame someone for not wanting to get trapped with a girl, especially one he barely knows, when she had the option to terminate the pregnancy and didn't. However, South Korea has a very weird situation with abortion, and I have no idea what this girl's options were. \n\nThe unfortunate answer is that there is no easy answer. The *best* thing you can do is probably to try to make things right. Ideally, maybe you can move to SK or vice versa and settle down with this girl, and help raise your daughter. Who knows, moving over there could be an exciting adventure! Barring that, you could at least offer financial support and try to visit when you can. All of that said, it's understandable that you're unsure of making a big commitment like this. However, it sounds like you didn't even indicate to her from the off that you didn't want a kid, which would make me far less sympathetic if you left her now. \n\nThese are just some things to mull over. Again, there is no super easy answer, as some people here would have you believe. But I think if you think hard about it, you'll probably agree that the morally right thing to do is to at least try to help in what ways you reasonably can.",

First of all, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that you\u2019ve taken responsibility by going back for the DNA test, which shows you\u2019re trying to handle this situation maturely.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s completely normal to feel overwhelmed right now. You have a huge decision ahead of you, not just for yourself but also for your daughter and her mother. Moving forward, I think the most important thing is to approach this practically and consider all options.\n\nFirst, think about what kind of relationship you want with your daughter and how much you want to be involved in her life. If you\u2019re not able to move to Korea, could you work out a co-parenting arrangement where you visit regularly or have her visit you as she grows older? Also, try to have an open conversation with her mother about your concerns and how you can both cooperate to provide the best environment for your daughter. She will be a parent too, together with you. \n\nIt\u2019s also okay to take time to process your emotions, but keep the lines of communication open with the mother. Your actions now will have a lasting impact on your daughter\u2019s life, so it\u2019s good to make thoughtful and informed decisions.\n\nSome comments suggested seeking legal advice, in this case, you may want to consult a lawyer who specializes in international family law to understand your responsibilities and rights.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to lean on trusted friends or family for support, and if you\u2019re feeling really overwhelmed, consider speaking with a counselor who can help you navigate this emotionally. You\u2019re not alone in this, and taking things one step at a time is the best way to move forward.\n\nWishing you strength as you figure this out \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc96",

They cause us to go in a different direction. \n\nIn your heart, you know what the right thing to do is, but in case you don't, I'll tell you my theory: If you don't do the right thing, this little girl is young to grow up without a father. In Korean society, that's a punishment no one would want. She'll live her whole life punished for the fun you had. \n\nOn the other hand, if you do the right thing, you'll get to be a dad. GET. It's the greatest thing a man can ever do. Nothing is more fun, more rewarding, more life changing. There's nothing like waking up in the middle of the night to your child's crying, going into their room, cuddling them and rocking them to sleep again. Nothing like it. I would give anything to do it all over again. Watching my kids grow up and become teenagers has been the most enjoyable time entire life, and I've had an interesting and fun life. \n\nSecondly, you must have liked this girl to a degree. Is she marryable? Is she nice, kind, pretty? What does her family think of you? \n\nI don't know how old you are, but it may be time to hang up the old life and step into the adventure of a new life. You might even learn to love it. \n\nI hope for you, and the young lady, and your daughter, you'll do the right thing. It won't be easy, but you'll be better for it. \n\nI hope you read this.

Ask anyone who fits the following => If you were ever unfortunate enough to have something happen to you where you spend some real time alone in hospital with a realistic chance that you're going to die; everyone who has been in that situation will tell you. A remarkable thing happens. You find yourself/the meaning of life. I'm telling you everything that I thought was important suddenly meant nothing. It's weird. What suddenly mattered was family, connection. All that silly clich\u00e9 crap that you always just rolled your eyes at. The only thing on your mind is the people you care for. Go be with your child. Because imagine the alternative. Imagine every single big moment in her life. Times when things happen where you'd love to have a dad there to be proud of you, comfort you, or just enjoy the moment with you. She will always just have nothing. Emptiness. Imagine some other guy walking your daughter down the aisle one day. Mate. You don't have to marry the chick, but be in her and your child's lives. If they can't relocate to your country, then you relocate there. Just do it. Make it work. Otherwise, one day, you're going to be in for some of the most painful regret in your final moments. Sorry for being so somber; I've just seen this too many times. And I've been blessed to have that moment of realization and clarity early enough in my life to avoid mistakes and really hoping to pass it on to you. Having a child is weirdly one of the best things that can happen to you. Nobody understands that until it's you in that position. Embrace it. Enjoy it.",

Your bf can buy a used car through a bank. Or, if he is so confident he would be able to pay you back in a year, then he can just save up the cash and wait to buy a car in a year, right?",

I\u2019ll take whatever I can get from yall. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nUpdate: I woke to an astounding amount of advice and condolences and it truly means the world to me. It will take me a sec but I will read them as I\u2019m so grateful all of you have taken the time to reach out to me. With the humble heart, thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe ",

Go crazy (within reason) but do it without hurting yourself or anyone. Please, please, please do not get lost in drink and/or drugs, if it can be avoided. \n\nGrief hits everyone different so there's no one true route. I'm still processing a loss from 13 years ago, another one from 26 years ago.\n\nI am so sorry man, losing a loved one who was only 27 sucks like fuck - I know your pain. I hope you have other friends that you can gather around you.\n\nLong term, if you can, check in with his parents now and then if they are still with us. You'll find it both painful and beneficial. It's weird how it functions, but the natural order of things are now upside down. His parents, I would assume, could not have expected this loss. They'll need just as much help as you in this bewildering time.  \n\nHaven't ever done the therapy route, so cannot advise you on that, but that will be something others will advise you to look into and they will be correct to so.\n\nFinal thoughts. You were a great friend for checking in on your late best friend. Not everyone cares enough to do that kind of thing. You are a diamond. Nature sucks man...seizures/aneurysms/strokes...these are not things that \\*anyone\\* can plan for. Not knowing the full story, I can only assume that this is not something you could have helped prevent. Again, I am truly sorry for your loss.",

I start by saying I\u2019m a fairly cold gal. I\u2019m covered in tattoos, ride Harley\u2019s for many many years, am an avid gun owner and enthusiast, worked in the morgue, etc, so I\u2019m not usually very sad or tearful or emotional. I witnessed a man get stabbed multiple times in his gut. I just so happened to be taking the trash out at work. I held the man\u2019s intestines in his torso for 8 long minutes as I called 911 on voice command. In the moment it was like the eye of a tornado. Pretty calm and focused. Thoughts went fast but with such clarity. But when I stepped back it was like being hit by the tornado itself. I was covered in blood and in shock. I had to id the perp and the whole nine yards. So I went back to work after like two days off. I felt fine. So many people were asking me questions and I didn\u2019t feel fazed. I just felt matter of fact about it. Then one day tears just started flowing out of my face. I couldn\u2019t even explain or understand why. I suddenly became the opposite of who I am and was weak and fearful every time I was at work. My job (huge coffee chain) refused to trespass the guy who did the stabbing. I was losing my mind some. I realized this was bigger than me and I needed a professional to help me through this. \nThe dr gave me an amazing analogy. She said \u201cour fears and emotions are like children in the backseat of a car on a road trip. You may be in high spirits and focused on the end result but along the drive your kids start saying they need to pee.  You say \u201cok just a few more exits. It\u2019s too soon to pull over\u201d. Then an hour later two kids are whiny saying they really need to go to the bathroom.  You say \u201cI promise only a little bit longer\u201d. All of the sudden one kid peed themselves and worst yet, one pooped. They have absolutely destroyed the backseat of your car! They told you they needed to go but you kept going\u2026the moral is that you have to pull over and let your kids out to go to the bathroom before they lose control and pee themselves. Your emotions are like your backseat passengers. Pull over and let your emotions out\u201d.  \nSorry for the long message. Mostly I am sorry you found your best friend that way. Let yourself go through every step of the grieving process. It won\u2019t go away but it will get a little less painful in time. Sending you so much love and support \ud83d\udc99",

You may not feel extremely stressed by it now but the brain can suffer extremely without you even knowing about it. I had panic disorder for 3 year becouse of a similar reason thinking it's not stressing me out much thankfully i recovered. Please see a doctor or therapist things like this can really mess us up and the earlier you deal with the problem the less consequences it will have on your soul and body. Stay strong friend don't be hard on yourself speak to anyone about it don't hold it inside you it's better to someone cry to me 24/7 than for him to suffer in silence \u2764\ufe0f",

                    "body": "Hey, 3 years ago (coming up on 4 next month) I hadn\u2019t heard from my best friend all day. I started having a sinking feeling in my stomach because i knew something was wrong. She hadn\u2019t been on social media or anything, and she was the type to update her insta story constantly. I got home from work and tried to call her but no answer. About 3 minutes later her sister told me she was dead. She went into cardiac arrest and couldn\u2019t be revived. All I could do was sob uncontrollably. I came home with food from my favorite spot and couldn\u2019t even stomach a bite. I immediately started going through my camera roll and story archives looking at pictures of her and thinking of how beautiful she was. Nothing felt real. I cried every single night, I still do at times. I finally moved out of our city. I\u2019d always been too scared but she always told me if i just pack up and go everything would fall into place, and it did. Some days I didn\u2019t have energy to do anything, others I did really fun things that we both enjoyed. At first I avoided anything that reminded me of her, now I embrace it all. I have a small altar in my room where I go to honor and speak to her. I still have bad days, sometimes terrible ones. Healing isn\u2019t linear and there is no \u201cfinish line\u201d for grief. Sometimes it\u2019s a steady incline, sometimes a plateau, sometimes a zigzag and loop. I can say with certainty though that grieving is much easier with a support system. You may feel like isolating yourself is the best thing but it\u2019ll only make you worse. Hangout with his family and your mutual friends, reminisce together. Just hold onto all of your best memories and be great for him. Celebrate his life, remember his favorite things, write him letters.On my best friend\u2019s birthday I like to make a small cake, cook her favorite foods, listen to her playlists and do something fun for her. Grief is never ending, but you begin to grow around it and welcome it instead of dismissing it. You can do this \u2764\ufe0f",

Collectively I spent probably 12 months in treatment centers.\n\n\nI'm sober now, but needless to say I've met a lot of good people who didn't make it. Didn't take it seriously, I was just a lost soul and had nowhere else to go and my entire personality just became getting high until I couldn't anymore, getting sober for a month, doing it again. I was so fucked off and detached \n\n\nI went to one rehab like 3 times...  Months apart each time. And I think the moment the gravity of the situation really hit me, was when I came in the 3rd time and started joking about some of the dudes I knew from the first 2 times and stories about them... And then the person running the rehab was like \"oh George... He's dead now you know. Charles too. Overdose.\"\n\nI was like holy fuck... What....\n\nI only saw them when they weren't using and cleaned up a bit and just didn't even conceive that they could be dead like that. Young dudes too, early 20s.\n\n\n\nThere was one friend in sober living I had the time I finally actually stayed sober. He was such a wreck.... So depressed. Had bad hygeine, smelled realllllly bad which made him the butt of jokes and such. But he was such a nice gentle soul. He was always struggling and even eluded to like mass shooting stuff.. Scared people, but I knew he was just desperately asking for help because he was in that much of a dark place. \n\nI know that dude, he would never hurt a fly. He was just in that much of a spiral I think he was just desperate for literally anything to get some semblance of control over his surroundings or at least have people see how bad he needed help  \n\nWed stay in touch on FB but sometimes it got too dark and I had to distance myself. \n\nAfter I'd been sober and moved away a few months he sent me a video on FB... He I guess had been playing with a gun drunk and pretty much shot his hand off. Bones and everything sticking out... I felt fucking awful but didn't know how to respond to something like that it was just too stressful to process.\n\nCouple weeks later he killed himself\n\nFucked me up. He was my closest friend in rehab. I just feel like it's my fault for not reaching out more even tho I did more than anyone else there.\n\nWhat really bothered me was when I reached out to tell other people who'd been in the same rehab at the same time about it. Let's say the friend I've been discussings name is Kevin. There was a worker there named Kevin too. \n\n\nWhen I told other people they were like \"who, smelly Kevin?\"\n\nLike cmon",

He said she smelled foul and I never told her then. Well she got married and her husband wouldn't go down on her and I finally told her after she broke down crying. She said she wishes I would have told her sooner but turns out she was using scented body wash to clean and wearing underwear that baked her down south and for HER that was a no. She changed to just mild water and special PH wash. Started wearing cotton undies and it worked wonders. \n\nSo for my ladies on here who feel bad about having a vaginal smell and the men who are pretty misinformed. \n\nNormal vaginal discharge has a mild, musky scent that is not unpleasant. Think Sour Dough Bread or it could smell like nothing.  This means that a\u00a0slight smell is normal. Any foul (bad) or strong smell, or a smell that is unusual, is a sign that things are out of balance, and that you should get yourself checked out. This odor is caused by the good bacteria in the vagina, called lactobacilli, which produce lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide to keep harmful bacteria at bay. \n\nIf your vagina smells like fish or has an odd smell? The most likely cause is you are using scented body wash to clean or perfume. Your VULVA only needs water & a mild soap (Think Dove non scented hypoallergenic) as the vagina is self cleaning. It COULD be Bacterial. Could be from not properly washing toys after using them. Does she take baths with bath bombs? Those are awful. Is she washing herself everyday and peeing after sex? Scented Tampons? The WORST. These are ALL factors. Could be a load of reasons but they absolutely are medical. \n\nYou should NOT be using anything scented in your privates. Don't listen to these social media people, stop buying all those BS products, stop being ashamed of your vag/vulva and the various smells. You should not douche or put anything in your vagina to wash it. STOP listening to men who make comments about it and if they do make comments please let them know that BALLS should not smell either.

Ensure the timing is appropriate and your friend is in a good state of mind.\n\n2. **Be Compassionate and Supportive**: Start the conversation by expressing your care and concern for her well-being. For example, you might say, \u201cI value our friendship a lot and want to talk to you about something sensitive because I care about you.\u201d\n\n3. **Be Direct but Gentle**: It\u2019s important to be honest but also gentle in your delivery. You could say, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that there might be an issue with body odor, and I wanted to bring it to your attention because I thought you might not be aware of it.\u201d\n\n4. **Frame it as a Health Concern**: Emphasize that body odor can sometimes be a sign of an underlying health issue that may need medical attention. Suggest that she might want to see a doctor to rule out any health problems.\n\n5. **Offer Support and Solutions**: Let her know that you\u2019re there to support her and offer practical solutions. For instance, \u201cThere are many reasons this can happen, and it might be helpful to talk to a doctor or a specialist who can give you some advice.\u201d\n\n6. **Reassure Her of Your Friendship**: Reiterate that your intention is to help and that this doesn\u2019t change how you view her as a friend. For example, \u201cI hope you know that I think the world of you, and this conversation is coming from a place of concern and friendship.\u201d\n\n7. **Be Prepared for Any Reaction**: Understand that she might feel embarrassed, upset, or even defensive. Be patient and give her space to process the information. Let her know you\u2019re there for her no matter what.\n\nUltimately, your goal is to help her without damaging your friendship.

He advised her to get into the tub with some warm water and to squat and push as hard as she could. In disbelief she did as instructed and was horrified when a stringless tampon came out with a horrible smell. The doctor advised her to then soak in a warm bath with a cup of white vinegar added to eliminate any smell. \nI read this in a woman's health magazine a while back.

She was depressed and her hygiene was terrible would only shower every 3-4 days. It was a sensitive topic but I had to bring it up and she was very very embarrassed and upset when I did but was glad I said something. People in here saying they can\u2019t smell themselves are incorrect, it was literally 10 feet across the room bad smell. She said she knew it smelled and was trying all the different ways to get it clean herself. It could have also been me as I sweat a lot at work and should probably have showered before intimacy. Live and learn. She went to the doctor tho and they gave her some medication and stuff for BV and she had some utis as well quite a few times. If you\u2019re her best friend just say something. I\u2019d want my buddy to tell me if I smelled like BO after he set me up on a date with a hotty where in my head the date went well but then I get ghosted after.. and all my friends would tell me immediately lol men don\u2019t beat around the bush.",

But you\u2019re not supposed to wash the inside of your vag. No soap, no sprays, no gels, not even water. It\u2019s a delicate bacterial balance in there! \n\nIn fact, sometimes women who douche or wash their insides end up smelling bad because they upset the pH balance. It can also lead to irritation, bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections, plus it can interfere with the vagina\u2019s ability to clean itself. \n\nA PSA to all who read this: wash your vulva, but not your vagina. Use either warm water and a mild soap or just warm water. Front to back. Don\u2019t splash anything up inside. \n\n\u270c\ufe0f",

I legit just figured it out when I got obsessed with my own parts as a kid and, exactly, realized you gotta really get up in the nooks and crannies, pull back the clit hood (just read a Buzzfeed article a month or so ago that tons of women didn't know you should do this, see how underinformed we all have been?!), go between, on the sides of, and all around the lips, go down near the grundel. \nAnd I just wondered, jeez, this girl (my ex) seems to have..not been doing much at all in terms of washing. Because maybe she never got curious when she was younger, or just thought, \"That is just supposed to smell\"?.. I was the first person she had done oral on - that's why I felt I had to teach her, because I didn't want to put my face there, lol, my hands being there had been enough to realize some lessons needed to be learned as gently as possible, before I reciprocated. But maybe being a lesbian but having never got that up close and personal with another vag before also made her able to be unaware of how different she was to others? (In case anyone is thinking I'm creepy, we were both teenagers! I wasn't some predator, haha.)\n\nBut that did cross my mind - for OP's friend and my ex, like, just if you happens to, Idk, be super sick or something and you can't shower as often as you want, you definitely can smell yourself when you pee or whatever, I'm very sensitive to the slightest smell, I smell things no one else can, but like, if somebody REALLY stinks, it's unmissable! How does OP's friend not smell herself? That's where I think she assumes it's normal. Does she not visit a gyn though? You'd think the doctor would find a way to gently tell her? I take such a Silkwood shower before my gyn appointments, and go out of my way to not pee or anything beforehand so there's no chance of the slightest odor when I get there. How could this girl's dr just accept that odor and not feel compelled to let her know her hygiene needs work? But, I know people who haven't been to the dentist in 5+ years, maybe this girl is the same with the gyn. :(",

            "text": "My boyfriend 28M and I 29F have been together for about three years. It hasn\u2019t always been rainbows and sunshine. But the good times always did outweigh the bad times. We would get into little disagreements here and there. Two years into our relationship he was struck by a vehicle and landed in the hospital for about five months. He had two shattered legs, broken ribs, broken hand, broken foot, and suffered from a fat embolism which caused some  brain damage(TBI) . I was there for him every step of the way, which obviously isn\u2019t an issue, I definitely am not trying to make myself out to be a martyr or anything but I would go to the hospital and visit him every single day. Working 50+ hours a week and I would i would immediately go to see him after every shift. It was pretty mentally exhausting honestly. But he did eventually get better and he was discharged and able to come home. \n\nEver since the accident I literally can\u2019t stand to be around him. He\u2019s so quick to anger and he\u2019s mean a lot of the time. Or he\u2019s flat out neglectful. Of course I didn\u2019t I expect him to go work right away, so for the last year I\u2019ve just been taking care of him, paying all the bills and giving him money to do whatever he wanted with (buy snacks, games, etc) \nI will try to take him on outings on my days off, museums, zoo, nice restaurants, movies etc and he\u2019s on his phone the entire time. He\u2019s always playing Pokemon go. He will not put his phone down. He claims playing the game will help with his brain damage. \n\nAfter working long shifts, I expect to come home and chat with my boyfriend and relax with him, but I\u2019m ignored because he\u2019s always on his phone. It makes me sad.\n\nSo recently I was diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease, while I was on a business trip. I landed in the hospital for two days, and he didn\u2019t even call me. At this point he was able to drive and I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting him to drive 4 hours to come see me\nIn the hospital, but I was expecting him to call me at least. \nI was so incredibly upset, I just needed some comfort. He didn\u2019t seem to understand that he was wrong for not calling me. And he blames everything on brain damage. I completely empathize with him having brain damage and I feel like I\u2019m very understanding of his struggles but I just don\u2019t understand how he has time to drive around, hang out with friends, play Pokemon go all day but not call me? \nAlso, he scolds/ yells at me in public. Ex- we were at the pet store trying to find a new leash and collar set for our three year old female boxer, and I saw a cute pink/ floral print one (I am still the only working so I\u2019m providing for him and paying for everything)  and he yelled at me how he isn\u2019t going to walk around with a pink leash, and it\u2019s HIS DOG, he bought her, so what he says goes. I was absolutely mortified when he started yelling at me. I am not terribly sensitive but embarrassment is hard for me to handle so I started to tear up a bit and I asked him if I could have a second to myself. He had no self awareness to realize that he was wrong, he thought I was being unreasonable. \nHe will also call me out of my name and curse at me. \n\nHe will also do extremely embarrassing things like scream at the self check when there\u2019s an error on the screen. It\u2019s extremely hateful and intolerant of anything that he isn\u2019t familiar with. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to reason with him and talk things out but he\u2019s resistant to change. I have gained a lot of self awareness throughout the years and I\u2019m huge on \u201ctreat others how you want to be treated\u201d, so I\u2019m extremely careful with my tone, and I\u2019m always making sure to not raise my voice, curse during tense moments, and I especially do not believe in calling my boyfriend out of his name, but he can\u2019t even attempt to give me the same respect. He refuses to go to therapy. He even admitted to being a sociopath, which is extremely alarming.\n\nHe also spends my money however he likes. \nI was trying to pay our electric bill but for some reason the app wasn\u2019t working on my phone, so I sent him money  specifically to pay for it, and he used the money for something else (he hasn\u2019t told me what he used the $230 for, still to this day). \n\nI love him a lot and I care about him a lot but also despise him. I find it hard to look at him sometimes. \n\nThere are still some good times sprinkled in, but now the bad definitely outweighs the good. \n\nHe still isn\u2019t working and I feel bad for him, if I leave then he won\u2019t have money to pay the bills. Also I love beautiful dog with all my being. Yes, he technically bought her, but I came into her life when she was six months old and I\u2019ve been caring her ever since. I home make her food every week, but her toys, treats, take her on walks, take her to the vet etc she\u2019s my heart and soul, my pride and joy, I honestly feel like I couldn\u2019t be happy without her. She\u2019s an amazing companion and she loves me so much, she\u2019s always stuck to me hip. But I know if I leave, he wouldn\u2019t let me take her.\n\n- I am seeking help from a therapist.\n\nNot sure how I should proceed. I\u2019m so torn. Pretty sad \n\nNote- he is 28M, I am 29F",

I'm super irritable all the time, and for a while, I was snappy as all get out. But after a few months of my closest relationships devolving and seeing the hurt on my husband and child's face when I got snippy and mean, I knew something had to change.\n\nI started trying to be more mindful, and even if I slip up, I make sure I apologize and hold myself accountable. I'm still in the process of finding a therapist, but I've taken other steps to work on my anger; meditation, deep breathing, working out, being mindful of my attitude, etc. And things have gotten better. It's not perfect, but much much better. \n\nMy point is that while symptoms aren't the fault of the afflicted, the attitude and the choice to not hold one's self accountable as a result of the symptoms is.\n\nYou don't need to stay. You can leave. I'd have understood if my husband left me and the bf you knew from before accident would understand if he was still the same. But he's not. And you don't have to force yourself to be loyal to this new version of him because he's not holding himself accountable, and you don't have to put up with that.\n\nGood luck, OP. may your life get better \ud83d\ude4f\n\nETA: Thank you for the awards, kind souls. \ud83e\udd70 I hope my story encourages others to seek healing and to always hold oneself accountable \ud83e\udd17",

I'm sorry things have turned out this way, and it sounds like you've done everything you can do to help someone who has no interest in helping himself to anything but more of your care, attention and money. It's unfortunate. But you hold all the power to get away.",

She sleeps all day. That\u2019s it. No job no money unless her parents send her something and I took this massive pay cut to appease her unreasonable dad. She kept this sob story going for a while. Her dad \u201ckicked her out\u201d. I am not able to afford both of our bills now and she can\u2019t even listen to me talk about my day. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t want to be around her.

What the f@ck, sure I love the relationship and she\u2019s super great, but I am conflicted. She has what I assume is genetic but a constant migraine almost. I\u2019ve taken her to the ER like 20 times because she insists. Some days she wouldn\u2019t eat and idk it just seemed convincing enough. She told me about going to the Mayo Clinic in Arizona and they couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong. Her mom has something similar and always and I mean always has an ice pack on her head. She has had Botox next to her head to relieve pain\u2026 I just don\u2019t want this for my life.

Head trauma is very common in serial killers and violent offenders (not saying your BF is one, this is just a documented medical fact found in history). \n\nThe odds are his behavioral changes will not get better without some sort of intervention. That being said, psych medications have been shown to help alleviate or at least control some impulsive aggression found in TBI (traumatic brain injury) patients. But you have to get him to a doctor and have him actually seek care before this is a possibility. \n\nIf this is too much of a burden for you, you may just need to accept that the man you fell in love with is no longer the man you are with. You are still young and this will be a life long issue for him. Is this something you want to commit to? Is he a suitable partner to settle down with? Will your children be safe around him with these impulsive aggressive moments? You have to ask yourself these questions. \n\nLink to more info about TBI & psychiatric medication treatments: \n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7653730/",

Your boyfriend\u2019s behavior will not miraculously change! You\u2019re still very young you have your own income what are you waiting for? Please do not have a child with this man child!  Yes, he was in a horrible accident, but that is no excuse for him to say he\u2019s a sociopath!  Listen to him! listen to him he\u2019s telling you who he is and what he is, you owe him nothing!

The whole thing was a fog that I waded through. I was unkind, aggressive,  and generally emotionally unstable.\n\nThis brings me to your situation. I broke up with my girlfriend at the time for no other reason that I can recall, but that I felt like I was hard to be around. I still think it was the right call. She moved on and is happy with a family. She deserved to not live the rest of her life remembering what I was during that time. It would have been weird otherwise.\n\nIt is perfectly acceptable to take a break, or want to take a break from this. If holding on to the pupper is a hill that can't be climbed, so be it.

I want him to be happy, and the idea that I would one day not care about that breaks my heart.\n\nEdit: when it comes to the dog: dogs do not like being around volatile people, just like in humans, it causes stress and it's traumatising. Check the law where you live, pets are often considered property so he could sue you for the cost of the dog etc. theoretically, but not get it back. In my country if the dog isnt chipped, and you have it chipped in your name, there is very little anyone can do.

One of the FIRST recommendations my doctor said to me during my physical healing, was to immediately do rounds of CBT, and when my abilities change, to consider intense psychotherapy. LONG TERM. I was the same age as your boyfriend. Brain injuries can alter your personality permanently if you DONT seek intensive help. \n\n\nI don't even remember who I was during healing- I was SO MAD, SO ANGRY! I broke things and said things, DID things I am ashamed of today. Everytime I vomited, I WANTED TO FIGHT! I wanted to sleep with strangers. I isolated myself because I HATED everyone. Thankfully I was living alone so I was responsible for my own messes and never hurt anyone.\n\nEarly emotional therapy and mood regulation is key and I NEEDED that before I broke another cup/mirror or got into another relationship. I HATED THERAPY. But it helped me. Did it for a solid year no breaks. Hated my therapists (but I didn't, if you get what I mean).\n\nNow I'm back to normal, Im back to myself. I still am in therapy because that injury actually sparked a bipolar diagnosis in me (I mood tracked for months before getting a proper diagnosis). I can handle stresses, I can manage my emotions by talking it out, and IF it comes to a head (haha), my loving counselor helps me get back on my feet.\n\nMy point being is.... \n\nYour partner needs an ultimatum NOW about intensive therapy. He's let it go for so long it's become a critical must. If he denies it, save yourself and leave. He will not get better since he doesn't realize he has you as his punching bag. Maybe later on you two can reconcile, but as it stands, he needs to either ACCEPT he needs help NOW or LATER without you.",

The doctors back then did not tell us, even though it would have helped a lot. \n\nOP if he is treating you badly\u2026 You dont have to stay. You gave it a year. Thats really nice. You tried.\nYou helped him and payed for him. He SHOULD be thankful. With or without brain damage. Its your life. \n\nMy father eventually got a bit better. But then he left my mom for a younger woman \u201ebecause he was unhappy with his life\u201c.\nTo this day i would not want to live with him. Me and my mom stayed far too long. \nIf you\u2019re unhappy , and if he\u2019s treating you badly my advice would be leave. People will judge you but thats gonna pass. And what the heck do they know.",

And if you feel guilty, think of it this way: it wouldn't be fair for him to have a partner that's going to compare who he is now with who he used to be.

One of the hallmarks is that individuals with TBI tend to lose most of their ability to have impulse control.  I\u2019ve seen many just absolutely blow a gasket over situations that most would consider to be an inconvenience.  And then needing a 30-45 minute conversation to help them come down from their heightened emotional state. \n\nCan\u2019t advocate staying or leaving, but he will likely always struggle with these issues. One of my clients with a TBI calls it his \u201cCadillac Syndrome\u201d.  *was hit by a Cadillac*.  He was just a normal dude and after his incident essentially became a liken to a special needs individual.  \n\nHe was blessed to have you in his corner and helping him through the worst of his recovery.  But he\u2019s not that person anymore. \nThere will be fragments of him left and he will have some memories of how he used to be and will live with knowing what\u2019s he\u2019s lost of himself.  \n\nStaying with him will be an act of love and sacrifice, but not one that you have to make for yourself. \n\nIn the note of your dog.  I see why you\u2019d want to keep her.  Id like to propose that there\u2019s also a possibility that him keeping the dog could be a boon for him, because his TBI has pretty much destroyed his ability to have a \u201cnormal\u201d relationship for the remainder of his life.   And the dog could do a lot of good for him, psychologically speaking.  \nGranted, if he isn\u2019t good to the dog, hurting her, etc, obviously take her.\n\nBut his guy is going to be a shell of his former self. \nI know a lot of commentators are saying to screw the dudes feelings, and fair enough, but you\u2019re going to be much more able and successful at moving on and having a brighter future, if you choose leaving.  He\u2019s not going to have that same outlook, sadly.  \n\nI wish you both the best, regardless.",

                    "body": "To him:\n\nHey, I understand what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019ve been there myself. When you suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it changes how your brain works, even though you may not feel it in the same way others notice it. It\u2019s frustrating, right? You try to use your brain like you always did, but it just doesn\u2019t work the same anymore. It can feel like the world is suddenly speaking a different language, and no matter how hard you try, people just don\u2019t seem to understand you.\n\nI know exactly what that feels like because I went through something very similar. As a child, I had a head injury that completely changed me, and I didn\u2019t even realize how much it impacted my ability to explain things or be understood. Then, things got worse during my time in the military. Later, in 2012, I was hit by a Ford F-150 truck while walking across the street, and after that, everything just spiraled. I wasn\u2019t all right before that, but it became much worse after. I kept trying to make people understand me, but no matter how right I might have been, it never came out the way I intended. Over time, I lost connections with people, family, and friends, because they couldn\u2019t trust what I was saying.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly difficult when you know what you\u2019re trying to say or do, but people around you just don\u2019t see it the same way anymore. You\u2019re probably feeling trapped inside your own mind right now, struggling with the way things used to be versus how they are now. It\u2019s not your fault that things have changed, but I\u2019m telling you from experience that you need to take control of this now, before it gets too late.\n\nDo you want to lose everything? Do you want to lose your family? Do you want to lose your friends? Do you want to lose your girlfriend? Even in your community\u2014do you want to lose everything? You will lose everything if you don\u2019t take action. And then you\u2019ll have to start all over. Trust me, that is not good. It is an uphill battle, and it\u2019s not something you want to go through.\n\nI waited too long. Even though I\u2019ve improved and I\u2019m more understandable now, it doesn\u2019t matter. The people who knew me before still don\u2019t trust me. They don\u2019t believe what I say, even if it\u2019s right, and they\u2019ve already made up their minds about me. I had to leave and go to places where people didn\u2019t know this side of me, just to be understood again. You don\u2019t want that to happen to you. Don\u2019t wait until your relationships\u2014your family, your friends, your girlfriend\u2014are all so distant that you can\u2019t repair them anymore.\n\nI\u2019m telling you this because you have a chance to change things now. You don\u2019t have to keep trying to do everything on your own. TBI requires therapy and medication. This is no joke\u2014you can\u2019t just wish it away or rely on anything else. Yes, prayer is nice, but you\u2019re going to have to take medication for life. Don\u2019t look for any other type of help\u2014this requires real, medical intervention. Without it, you won\u2019t be able to gain the control you need over your mind and your emotions.\n\nTrust me, it\u2019s worth it. You deserve to get back some control, and it will help you keep the people who care about you close.\n\nNow, I also want to be honest with you. Your girlfriend is going through a lot too. She\u2019s been strong for you, but if you don\u2019t seek help, there\u2019s a chance she may feel like she can\u2019t stay. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t care\u2014it\u2019s just that she\u2019s hurting, and she may not be able to handle it anymore on her own. I know it\u2019s hard to hear, but it\u2019s important to understand that this isn\u2019t just about you getting better, it\u2019s also about protecting the people who care about you.\n\nSo take that step, man. Don\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late. There are people out there who can help you, and there\u2019s hope. But you\u2019ve got to act now before you lose the people who love you most.\n\nResources for help:\n\n\t\u2022\tTBI Support Page on Reddit: A community of people who have gone through similar experiences and can provide support.\n\t\u2022\tCDC Traumatic Brain Injury Information: Comprehensive information on TBI, treatment, and recovery.\n\t\u2022\tBrain Injury Association of America: Offers support, advocacy, and educational resources for those affected by brain injuries.\n\t\u2022\tBrain Injury Helpline (BIAA): 1-800-444-6443 \u2013 A national hotline for brain injury survivors, caregivers, and professionals looking for help or information.",

His brain is damaged. You know, the thing that controls your entire body and everything in it. \n\nIt\u2019s like driving a car, getting T-boned by a driver that ran a red light, having the car taken to the body shop to get worked on, towing it home to sit in the garage, and staring at it day after day hoping that the engine will just start running again. You have to take that thing to the mechanic to get the engine fixed. You don\u2019t fix the engine, the car doesn\u2019t run no matter what you do to the rest of it. This young man needs professional help to cope and get control over his damaged brain. But just like how some engines just can\u2019t be fixed, same goes for the brain depending on the amount of damage sustained. \n\nIt\u2019s an unfair and unfortunate situation that OP and her BF have been put in. I don\u2019t know where you stand with your beliefs however I believe that God does not lay upon us burdens that we may are not capable of handling. OP, there is an opportunity here for you to salvage your relationship and rebuild stronger than ever before. If you are willing to push a little more, I know of someone that can give you the exact direction to push in order to make it through this seemingly impossible situation. God, our Father. Prayer will be your torch in the night and further ahead you will find another light. A light that shines brighter the closer you become and guides you through these hard times. \n\nOP, my suggestion to you is this; sit down with your partner and communicate your desire to move towards a progressive future together. Be assertive but soft when suggesting him to seek professional help. Like I said before, I\u2019m not sure your beliefs and how you view religion, but you could also suggest taking baby steps with prayer. When either of you are feeling low, find a moment to be alone and pray what you feel. Prayer is about connecting with God and giving him our burdens so that he may show us his wonders and love. I promise you OP that prayer, even if only you decide to do so, will make such a difference in the best of ways.\n\nI will be praying for you and your partner so that you may be able to find healing, to find peace, and to find a strong relationship with God through it all. IF that is what you desire. If you are feeling that you want to separate yourself from the situation, do not feel invalidated or discouraged for doing so. You have been through so much physically, mentally, emotionally and yet you have been able to sustain not only yourself but the relationship. You\u2019ve proven yourself to be a kind and admirable partner amongst many other things I\u2019m sure. A true heart of gold imo. Being resentful of your partner may seem so harsh and maybe even outlandish which is why you\u2019ve come to seek an honest opinion. But I assure you that MANY others and I too have felt the way you feel towards their partners and many more that have been on the receiving end of that resentment. Resentment stems from unsolved problems as I\u2019m sure some have come to learn. In this particular situation, his brain damage along with severe injuries having altered his life. \n\nThe bottom line here is that he does need help regardless of any other external factors. There are ways to help him from a distance if you decide you need to separate yourself from him.\n\n- Contact his family and/or friends to ask that they be present in his recovery process.\n- Schedule him an appointment to a mental health specialist that can help with his particular situation and encourage him to go. (You don\u2019t need to do anything more than just scheduling the appointment. The rest is on him.) \n- Simply check up on him as often as you feel comfortable with and remind him of the help he can get to rebuild himself. \n\nWhatever you may choose OP I ask that you\u2019d be sure to give yourself the time to think thoroughly over what it is you truly want to look back on and remember when you are 5, 10, 20 years older. Life can be full of regrets if we are not careful to listen to our hearts. A strong heart and a sound mind is like Yin-Yang. A strong heart and broken mind will be irrational and a broken heart but strong mind will be callous. I pray you find that balance for it will serve you well beyond your expectations. \n\nTo all readers, I hope you too may find something of worth through everything I\u2019ve shared and may be able to find it in your hearts to take your first steps towards a relationship with God or to continue on with yours if you have already begun but have set it aside. He hears us all and will answer if we call upon him. Life is so difficult alone so let us walk together with our Father and our brothers and our sisters.",

Our new home is open floor plan which gives me extreme anxiety and I should have said no but I didn\u2019t and obviously it\u2019s too late and my husband is doing everything possible to help until we can afford to basically make a section into a room with fucking walls. I need walls. I can\u2019t explain it. ) \n\nTurns out a lot of my sides effects are from my new medication. But I don\u2019t want to go back to being a zombie.

I\u2019m 35, not a teenager. \n\nOp shouldn\u2019t have to stay with someone she\u2019s miserable with at all. But with a tmi a lot of stuff changes. I mean damn even with medication it can. I\u2019m having to work hard in therapy and don\u2019t want to go back to just laying in bed when I\u2019m finally active besides just doing animal rescue. But some of the stuff I even think now is so hateful that it startles me. And it gets targeted at people I love. \n\nI feel for both parties. A lot of peoples personalities will change completely with a tmi. But op also has to do what is best for her. I don\u2019t want to encourage anyone to settle or stay because their partner had a life altering situation especially as they aren\u2019t married or even long long term(me and my husband are at 12 years together in a few days and we had to go to counseling(my psychiatrist suggested we do it before things got bad because I was just\u2026resentful even though I was a part of this too) \n\nI hope things get better for you.

I am far too confident for my own good sometimes, but I always stand up for what I believe in and I have gotten to a place where I am able to share my story with others in hopes of helping someone, anyone, leave before it\u2019s too late. I have been a foster parent in recent years, and through that I realized how much need there is for education and support to help prevent these things from happening with young people who have sometimes never known a genuinely caring person. Once I am more settled in my career, I have plan for dedicating my life to helping abuse survivors and kids that have grown up in the system.",

I\u2019m completely devastated because this was my first good relationship. I was genuinely so happy and everything just fell apart. I feel like I\u2019ve done something terrible. I can\u2019t ask any advice from the people around me because I don\u2019t want anyone to know. It\u2019s legal to date a 17 year old where I live but it feels so wrong now that I know her real age. \n\nI thought she\u2019s just a naturally very sweet and shy person but now I can\u2019t stop thinking how that might have been because of her maturity level. This is my fourth relationship whereas it\u2019s her second. I knew this and I was alright with it but that\u2019s when I thought she\u2019s 19. I already said I loved her and I don\u2019t want to leave her because of this but it feels like it\u2019s the right thing to do. \n\nWhen I was that age I was just a kid. She said I should just forget it and we can pretend like I never knew. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible. I feel like a huge creep for even considering what to do, I just really cared about her and I was so happy with her. What in Gods name was going through her mind?\n\nI feel shattered. What should I do? \n\nEdit: \n\nThank you very sincerely to everyone who\u2019s commented and given me advice. I haven\u2019t told anyone in my personal life about this so I didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to. It really means a lot. \n\nSince some people were asking:\n\nShe graduated Highschool and I had too when I was that age.\n\nI do not face any legal issues as the age of consent in my country is 16. The issue is that I have to bring up the age of consent to begin with..",

Sometimes we lie not thinking about the consequences, to get what we want. Then we are in too deep and afraid to admit the truth. She sae you, she liked you. You asked how old she was she got nervous and lied. Then you actually got close and it became a real relationship. At that point she's didn't want to hurt you or was embarrassed to tell you the truth and that she lied. Once she found out you knew, Did she show any remorse? Has she expressed feeling bad for lying or does she think it's not a big deal. Her reaction to you finding out is more important in my humble opinion. Also did she actually lie about her age or just concealed the truth. Either way, good luck\u00a0",

You admitted the relationship was good and you were 'so happy' - that says a lot.  You said you loved her even. That has to be worth something.  Maturity levels are very personal and can vary incredibly from person to person. It appears to me you didnt doubt her 'maturity' before so it can't be that obvious.\n\nThe lying is obviously not good. I understand you feel upset that she lied to you but havent we all done similar once? She obviously really liked you and really wanted to be with you so she told what I think is a pretty innocuous lie.  Its fine from a legal point of view as shes 'of age'  and most sensible people wouldnt have a huge problem with a small age difference like that. If she'd been underage it would be an entirely different matter.  Make your decision based on how YOU feel - don't do anything to please or placate other people.\n\nObviously you have to do what feels right for you but think hard before you throw away what looked to be a happy, loving relationship because she  did something stupid.  Personally I think if we're all honest we've all done something similar to put ourselves in a better situation and I can't condemn her for it.  It was wrong but it wasnt earth shattering and now its out in the open you could make renewed promises to each other never to lie and move on.\n\nWaiting for the downvotes because...no-one in Reddit believes in second chances.",

Later that night, at a different loud bar, he asked my age, so I rounded up as I'd already said the reason I couldn't get into the club was forgetting my ID.\n\nThings moved quickly and we knew we really liked each other. I confessed my age a few weeks later. He always said he would have never asked me out if he knew I was 17. He actually misheard me at the loud bar and thought I said 19 instead of 18 so he was pretty shocked.

I'm only mentioning it because it sounds like you're taking this on your own shoulders, but you didn't do anything wrong here. It's cold comfort and easier said than it is to take to heart, but you don't need to feel ashamed when you had bad information to begin with.\n\nBut the lying...that IS bad. That is a sign of a lack of maturity - not one you could have predicted, and certainly not one limited to underage folks. But it should be a deal-breaker, IMHO, especially when it's about something like her age. You have a right to know when someone you're interested in is younger than you're comfortable with, and the fact she lied is a breach of trust (and arguably means that you weren't even in a position to give informed consent to anything you may or may not have done). \n\nThere are other mature girls in your age group out there who will respect you enough not to lie to you and are just as sweet as this one was.

Yeah, she lied about her age, but the age gap isnt even big. You should throw away your relationship just because of a little lie. I understand people saying that lying in relationships is bad, but if she ACTUALLY does something bad later on, then you can break up with her. But i honestly dont see a point of breaking up with her because you didn't do anything wrong, and she just wanted to date you so much to the point where she felt the need to cover up her age with a lie. If the girl goes that far for you it means she lieks you. You also seemed to have a good relationship with her. PLUS- MOST IMPORTANT THING- GIRL'S MATURTITY LEVELS ARE 2 YEARS AHEAD THAN BOYS!!! So what I mean is that if a girl is 17, her mental age is usually 19 (since girls start puberty around 2 years earlier than boys, they are psychologically proven to be more mature. that's why boys would always laugh at balls jokes while girls wouldn't in middle school).",

This young woman deliberately misled you about something incredibly important, and that's not okay. Not even close to okay.\n\nFirst, let me acknowledge your integrity here. The fact that you're wrestling with this morally, despite it being technically legal where you live, shows strong character. That matters. A lot of guys might try to justify continuing the relationship, but you're putting principles above personal feelings.\n\nNow, to address this whole \"let's pretend you never knew\" suggestion - absolutely not. That's completely unacceptable. She's asking you to compromise your values and conscience to enable her deception. Red flags everywhere.\n\nLook, I know you care about her. I know this hurts. But she violated your trust in a fundamental way that affects the entire foundation of your relationship. She took away your ability to make an informed choice about who you were dating.\n\nMy advice? End it. Clean break. Yes, it's going to be painful, but continuing this relationship means:\n1. Compromising your values\n2. Accepting dishonesty as acceptable behavior\n3. Potentially putting yourself at risk legally and socially\n\nYou're 20 years old. You have so much life ahead of you. Don't let this deception trap you in a situation that goes against your conscience.\n\nRemember guys, trust isn't just a nice-to-have in relationships - it's absolutely essential. Don't let anyone convince you to compromise on that.",

My friend and I went to a party with some older guys and girls 20-24, and I was 17 (she told everyone we were 19). I ended up meeting a guy that was 23, and we hit it off incredibly well. I hung out with him solo a few times (nothing had happened), but when I knew it was going to move in that direction, I had to \"man up\" and tell him.. i did not ask to see him again, and he appreciated me telling him. I also didn't offer to continue talking to him because though I was not the one that ultimately lied to him, i was not forth coming, and I would not want to put that kind of pressure on him.  Good luck to you! For those of you that said \"being in HS should have been the first clue\", I was 17, graduated, sharing an apartment with a friend, while working a fulltime bartending job in WI. I was also driving a sports car that I had paid for myself. Look out for some of those thrifty 17 yr olds \ud83d\ude02",

Of course this isn\u2019t always the case. As someone who dated a man much older than me(27) when I was 18, age really shouldn\u2019t be a deciding factor in a relationship, heck we\u2019re still together and he\u2019s the love of my life. And being honest it was REALLY hard and REALLY WEIRD at first: he felt like a cradle robber, I felt sleazy for going after a guy so much older, but having been more mature than ppl his age and ppl my age it worked out really well. Honestly she lied and that\u2019s pretty bad considering she should\u2019ve clarified right before you guys became official, but at the same time she was probably so head over heels that she made a bad decision. Ppl make mistakes, it\u2019s only human, but it\u2019s ultimately up to you to decide whether to forgive her. Everyone in the comments saying you should instantly drop her bc she lied are all hypocrites, we\u2019ve all been there, we\u2019ve all made choices we regret. Granted yall have only been together for 2 months, IMO that\u2019s not a big loss, you could move on and end up finding someone even better. All up to you to decide how much you care about her and/if ur willing to give it another shot bc of that. Hope this helped :)\n\n(PS before y\u2019all try and twist my story into something gross, I pursued my BF, not the other way around, we had so much in common since I\u2019d been raised old school, I don\u2019t even have friends my age bc we don\u2019t get along or have the same priorities)",

Your prefrontal cortex isn\u2019t fully developed until about 24. She\u2019s only three years younger than you and she will mature. Most people agree that girls also tend to mature faster than guys. I\u2019m sure you guys will meet in the middle in regard to maturity level pretty soon. It\u2019s important that you lay your boundaries and communicate that she can\u2019t be lying to you. If I were you, I\u2019d personally give her another chance. In my country, it\u2019s socially acceptable to be with someone 5 years younger/older than someone as long as they\u2019re of age. My older sister graduated early at 17 and got a boyfriend who was five years (at least) older than her. They were together for fourteen years, but throughout the relationship, she was always more mature than him and he cheated on her and she ultimately left him. My grandpa lied about his age to my grandma. About a whole decade difference in age (he was younger). She found out, but was in love with him. If she didn\u2019t stay, my mom wouldn\u2019t be here and neither would I. I could understand you wanting to drop her now. It\u2019s a personal choice. If I was really interested in someone though and things were going really well, I would feel the same way as you if this situation occurred, but I\u2019d consider giving them another chance. Another offense and I\u2019d say goodbye.",

In my area at least, 17 and 20 is completely appropriate. However, the lying is the part you should be concerned about. I did a similar thing to my partner about 10 yrs ago (he was 14 and I was 11 but said I was 13). We had a very surface, middle school relationship. But as the years went on, I went to a different school, we saw different people, blah blah blah. We found each other again when I was almost 18 and he was almost 20. It's now been 5 years and we've worked through every problem that we thought would be our downfall. I guess my point is, if you're so hurt that you have to ask other people if It's okay to stay, maybe you already know the answer. You either already made up your mind and will love her despite her mistake, or this really pushed you over the edge and and you need the right comment to be your motivation.

Biologically there's truth in, but societally as well, we teach girls (force girls?) to become more mature. There are different types of maturity do it's not an all or nothing thing, but the chances you're as mature as she is, is very high. I will say it depends some on your birthday too. You said she turns 18 in January, when is your birthday? If you just turned 20 then definitely no problem. If you're going to turn 21 before she turns 18, that's getting a little further. Either way I probably would see where this goes. The chances a relationship goes the distance at this age is low anyway. And so is there that much harm in letting it go a little longer? And if it does go the distance to would you really want to end it over an age difference that really isn't a problem, or her wanting to date you so much that she lied so you would ignore the age difference?\n\nPeople here are overharsh.

He proposes a couple weeks later. Instead of saying yes she says that she is actually 17 and can't get married yet. He loses his mind. The whole family was in on it and knew she lied about her age. \n\nShe skipped a couple of grades so we were all shocked that she was that young and going to school with us. She was over at our apartment all the time and she lived on campus in the dorms. He took some time and realized that he was more upset about the lie than anything else. They had been on several dates by the time he asked how old she was. she knew he was the one and didn't want to scare him off by telling him her real age. He waited until she was 18 and they got married right after her birthday. The state would have allowed them to get married sooner, he just needed to get both parents to be present and sign off on it. While her parents were 100% on board, he was not ok with that. They got married and have 5 kids. They have been married for almost 20 years. He told me he is glad they waited and he is glad he didn't turn and run. He did have to get over the dishonesty but he knows why she did it and he is glad that she did because he wouldn't have continued that relationship if he had found out early on.",

Luckily, he can't get into legal trouble since the age of consent is 16, but it's still such a bummer to find out that someone you truly liked lied about something so stupid (and something that could get other people his age in trouble if he was somewhere that the legal age was older than 16). She could have avoided all this by telling the truth, letting him know she very much likes him and his company, but as she's 17, she knows he may not be interested in seriously dating *at this time*. They could have just been casual friends and seen where things went as they aged, although, I know a lot of people would see that as \"grooming\", but I feel like a 3 year age gap may not fully qualify as grooming since they're both out in the working world already. Also, who knows when she'll be 18, yanno? If she just waited till then to actively pursue him, he probably wouldn't have been as concerned with the age gap, especially as people at the ages of 18 and 20 commonly date in college or such.\n\nEither way, good luck OP! It's a tough situation, but if you *do* choose to stay together, at least it's not like she's five or more years younger than you. Also, it's *very* obvious you weren't actively trying to groom a minor, especially since she lied to you about her age and all, so you're not a bad guy or anything.",

A few months later and she was pregnant. He was a happy healthy boy and everything seemed great at first. I slotted right into being a dad and he's my little ray of sunshine. \n\nMy wife developed terrible PPD exacerbated by pumping anxiety. During a few arguments caused by her being overstimulated, she's admitted to me that she feels no emotional attachment to him and that he's just a child living in our home. She's been going to therapy and things seemed like they were getting better. Don't get me wrong, she's an amazing mother, always makes sure he's well cared for and has everything he needs or wants. But it's obvious she doesn't feel connected to him. Today, after a few particularly stressful days where he's been very needy and crying constantly (due to teething) she texted me while I was at work. It read \"He's pushing me to the edge. This morning I just wanted to put him in a hot car and walk away. I'm ripping my hair out and I'm in the middle of a mental breakdown, I just can't do the crying anymore.\" I immediately made sure he was safe with my mom and arranged for her to watch him overnight. I talked with her more and it seems like this is just an out of the blue manic episode. I'm just terrified of what happens if she has another and she acts on those feelings. I don't know what to do here and it's killing me inside. ",

I would encourage your wife to share this development with her therapist. Even if it's just an \"oppsie\" of sorts, I would want this to be addressed to make sure it's not more than that. Recovery isn't linear so it might just be a short step backwards, but don't take that chance. It also might be a good idea to ask your wife how she felt moments before her breaking point. Was there a lead up for her? Could she feel it coming or was it truly just completely unpredictable?

Make sure she can at least get a little break in every day or every other day, get a shower, take a nap, and let her bounce back a bit bc babies are exhausting. And then maybe a longer break like once a week to let her go and like grocery shop out vent to friends or whatever she really desperately needs.\nAlso, I don't mean to sound critical of you since you don't immediately seem the type to slack off and do nothing at home, but are you taking the baby from her when you get home so that she can have some of these breaks? It's important to share the workload. I know you're out of town on a business trip, but having friends and relatives who can drop by periodically can save lives.

Some (not all) mothers experience an immediate feeling of closeness and devotion as soon as the child is in their arms, but sometimes it takes a minute. It doesn't mean she's failing as a mother, isn't cut out for it, or any other concerns she or you may have. The feelings of love and care develop over time the same way it would when a stranger turns into a friend. So that in and of itself isn't necessarily a red flag.\n\nThat being said, she's having a severe post-partum mental health crisis. This isn't just PPD. That line of thinking and her reaction to a stressful but normal situation is not typical. I had a friend who similarly had a severe PP episode where they did not trust themself to be alone with their children because they would think about murdering the children. Their partner had to quit their job and stay home 100% of the time because of how severe it got. I think your wife needs in-patient treatment, or to be seeing her therapist several times a week. And probably a psych med adjustment. I'm really sorry you're both going through this. I really hope she gets the support she needs to work through this, and I hope you find the strength to support her while she does so.",

The days seem endless.  \nMy bro has 2 nannies for 3 kids. A housekeeper 1x week, a cook 5x a week.  I ridiculed him saying plenty if people raise kids w no nannies or outside help. She also goes for massages and yoga retreats.  His explanation was that since he works alot, and not always or willing to pick up slack like cleaning, cooking, any help he can pay for alleviates the wife\u2019s stress.  Also he told me, she cant handle 3 kids and mothering.  They love their kids. \nAnd after visiting them for 2 weeks, I can see, my SIL, mentally cannot handle it all. They had kids late and had enjoyed a free life of travel snd vacations. So the solution was for my bro to do whatever he can afford to raise a happy family and sane wife.  \nNow I know not everyone can afford these luxuries. But u said you have a mom. My bro didn\u2019t have mom or MIL available ( out of country). Perhaps u can schedule daily breaks. Even a few hours help and Im speaking from experience.  Schedule weekly time for her to get out by herself. Schedule date nights. Get a teen to help out for a few hours like cleaning etc \nThis wont be forever but do what you can to relieve her mental stress.  If she\u2019s nursing, which is best but gives her no break , then better to do formula then for her to start thinking of abandoning or hurting baby   Ive wanted to run away too when baby seems to leech your own life.

Supporting her and being a safe place for her so that whenever she\u2019s having those thoughts she knows she can tell you without fear of shame. It really demonstrates that you have been a safe person for her that she would express those things to you. So many women with PPD have similar thoughts and feelings but don\u2019t have anyone they feel like they can be completely honest with who won\u2019t make them feel judged and ashamed, so they keep them to themselves and aren\u2019t able to get the support and communicate the red flags before acting on them. There needs to be a no shame or judgment zone so you can take action accordingly. This is absolutely not a reflection of her! Every single person has intrusive thoughts, but depending on certain factors some circumstances make these intrusive thoughts dangerously believable and actionable to the person suffering from them. Validate her struggle that you know this is not reflecting her or who she is as a person or mother, and is only due to instability between hormones and neurotransmitters and the brain/thoughts trying to make sense out of a flood of fears, changing and unmet needs, intrusive thoughts, a huge life change, etc. Everything in her brain is trying to adjust and the more emotional support she has the more resilient she will be. But the most important thing is that she feels safe sharing the deepest and darkest thoughts and feelings so you can ensure the safety of your family. You can\u2019t protect what you aren\u2019t aware of so thank her profusely for telling you!!!",

When somebody is in distress, they struggle to think clearly. (An example of a clear thought might be \u201cI am tired and overwhelmed, I should ask my mother in law if she can watch the baby for the afternoon so I can nap.\u201d) If she is in distress, a simple thought like that might be difficult, so you have to have it planned out and written down ahead of time, when she is in a space to think straight. Then tape it to the mirror or somewhere accessible, so in a time of distress, she can enact the plan without needing to think straight. \n\nExample of a plan (This is a generic but effective crisis management tool, but I am no parenting/ppd expert, so the specifics will of course vary depending on what you need/what might help. The main thing is to have clear, easy to follow steps that you\u2019ve discussed with relevant parties ahead of time):\n\n\n\u201cWhen starting to feel overwhelmed: \n1. Call MIL and ask to babysit\n2. Text husband \u201coverwhelmed\u201d so he is aware\n3. Set baby down in playpen and take five minutes to breathe and eat something. \n\nWhen feeling unsafe around baby: \n1. Shut baby in his room and go to the other side of the house. A crying baby is still a safe baby. Leave if necessary. \n2. Text MIL \u201cCan you come watch the baby for an hour, urgently\u201d \n3. Text husband \u201cnot coping\u201d\n4. Take medication in top drawer (pink bottle, 1 pill) \n5. If unable to contact husband or MIL, knock on [neighbor]\u2019s door for help.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just an example off the top of my head, but you get it: Clear instructions. Assume that in times of distress, she will be incapable of coming up with a rational plan, and take that pressure off by discussing it beforehand. Also, a verbal plan is not good enough, it needs to be written down so she doesn\u2019t have to try to remember anything.",

It sounds like unhealed trauma and possibly ptsd in my nonprofessionally-educated, experienced opinion. She needs to know that she is not alone and these feelings are completely normal! I felt guilty for years after having my firdt because I didn't get that instant love and connection every one talked about. It develops over time, especially when you get through the crying and sleepless nights \u2764\ufe0f",

Her lacking an emotional connection is not the major concern at the moment, I have a friend diagnosed with sociopathic tendencies, and while she doesn't have an attachment to her child, she does not neglect or harm him. She doesn't let him know she doesn't love him and is a good mother by most standards. Pick your battles, and her emotional standing could not only be PPD but a form of PTSD as well due to the previous loses. Plus, even while doing everything right, there may be backslides or outright failures. Looking at her environment may also be a good idea. How much help is she getting, how much downtime, how are the other relationships in her life going. She is aware enough to reach out for assistance when she hit a limit, which is a good thing. Discussing what were the triggers, what was their order of impact. Was it the being needy or the sound of him crying that affected her more? I'm autistic from a large family with a lot of babies and while the crying wasn't pleasant, the touching was worse. So, checking out sensory input could help as wall. Also, when a woman has a child and suffers these sorts of things afterwards it becomes a \"get better so you can be a better mother\" and her as an individual gets erased from the equation. Yes, safety of the child is most important, but she matters as well, so adding \"get better so you are feeling better\" should also be important. As for today's incident, determining if it was an \"out of the blue manic episode\" or the climax to a building storm that you weren't privy to or that went unnoticed. Without more detail I am unable to assist in a more defined way, but this is what I advise.",

Taking care of a new baby (who sounds colicky) and dealing with crying 24-7, no sleep, and hormones going haywire, contributes to all of this. What she is experiencing is likely a result of the hormones from birthing but also breastfeeding. Breastfeeding hormones are the same hormones that are dominant in pregnancy, which double each day during pregnancy and is back to 0 within 48 hours of birthing. \n\nMy situation is similar to most who have struggled with psychosis, they had no help, no breaks, no support. You sound supportive. I was very self aware when I went through this, but that made it more scary to me. I contacted my OBGYN, who is not really trained to deal with things like this, and they sent me to the ER. From there I spent a week in-unit locally in my town, getting on anxiety meds, attending group therapy, and journaling. They knocked me out with Benadryl to wind down my paranoia and anxiety from not sleeping. Every noise I heard, I would rocket launch myself out of the bed thinking something was wrong when I was asleep. Get her to a therapist immediately, her OB can help with a referral. It sounds like she definitely needs to get on medication to straighten her mind back out, and she needs some rest. \n\nHire help. Hire someone to come clean the house. Someone to sit with her during the day for a few hours, or even a night nurse to handle overnight care until everyone is more in a mentally stable position.",

Your wife is dealing with a serious mental health issue, but she is still the person you love. She needs support, she needs treatment, she needs to know that is OK to not be ok. With proper treatment she can get better. \n\nAnd once your child grows a bit and starts developing a personality, there\u2019s an extremely good chance that one day it will just click for her and she will love him. But that can\u2019t be forced, it needs to happen naturally.",

What happened was giving birth and essentially a hormonal equivalent to being on 300 birth control pills to zero in a couple days, coupled with pre-existing mental health conditions, sudden enormous anxiety and pressure of parenthood, and a ton of nutrients having been and being pulled from her body. She\u2019s also going through this *alone* \n\nYou need to get home, now- and you need to not leave her alone with the baby until the post partum psychosis has passed. This is non-negotiable. If you absolutely have to go on work trips then baby needs to be with your mother the entire time and she can\u2019t be left with the baby unsupervised with you gone. \n\nPlease bear in mind this is not her, and this will pass with medication and time. It happened to my best friend and it took a few months and then one day like magic she literally just snapped out of it- granted she had shaved her head, taken their baby, and moved several states away declaring she was a lesbian. I\u2019ll never forget the phone call when she came out of it. She thought she had ruined her entire life. She didn\u2019t. They\u2019re now an incredibly happy family and she had another baby and had a full plan and went on medication as soon as the baby was born. She couldn\u2019t nurse but it never happened again. \n\nYou can not leave right now. And that\u2019s okay. Even if you leave, she can not take the baby from your mother and have baby unsupervised. It\u2019s that serious. You guys are gonna be fine and she\u2019s gonna love that baby so much when she\u2019s herself again. She\u2019ll snap from this to being a protective mama tiger.",

It's overwhelming to think there are so many resources out that it should be an easy decision,  but is it ethical? we all know when we have to make the right decision even if it is the hardest we should anyway(moral compass). Emotional is the issue it can distort facts with being in denial. I understand that you would not want to go so harsh and contact cps on your wife and she think you betrayed her or ruined trust that she is not able to work through this without some serious choices that need to be made, but some decisions no matter what will be invetiable right? Your son needs you to be the logical parent and make a decision that will not jeopardize his safety. whether or not this is a severe case or not, or it is so severe, will be a conversation with you and  your wife along with professionals that have all of your family best interest in mind. Not every doctor is a great one, but there are amazing physicians out there. You have to base your decision on what is factual leading you without denial of what she said may or may not be a real threat either way its a serious one, and the likelihood of not doing anything could lead to some outcome that will be regretful. What are the facts so far. If she is home with him during the day, is she caring for herself too after the baby? I'm talking basic hygiene. Was she able to at least take a shower bath and get some sleep or eat? Is she isolated all the time with the baby or  any company over to not feel so alone? Is the house a little dirty, or is depression looking like it hit every inch of the house? There are some examples of someone mentality that could suggest your next move whe. You speak to a doctor. Are you able to take time off and be honest with your supervisor as far as options like.fmla which would be the best as far as taking a good amount of time off to dedicate to getting your wife the help she needs and doing research on how to deal with this as your wife is dealing with the ppd. Finding support in any way besides your mom alone. [Takes a village] in which is true. Developing a plan that works in the best interest of the child only. I say that because he does not have a say so in this clearly which is why if a hard choice has to be made it is because based on the ppd symptoms an as evidence you have seen will be only on you unfortunately because your wife is not capable to do it alone for your child. you.know this because of the statement of harming her child eliminates the possibility that she couldn't make a healthy decision instead of calling for medical help at that time and chose go call you and relay her frustration and stated she wanted to cause harm. without being in her right mind, she couldn't call you and say I really need help,  I'm scared for our son, and I need to get help now and check myself in a hospital.  Unless she said that or anything close, then you know now if you need to make a decision it's because your son needs you to be the logical one that comes from a loving place and needed to happen whether your wife is able to see that now or later. Best luck to you and your family, OP.  You can get through this!",

Even when everything went to plan and I got him in his crib he'd wake again within max two hours, often less. This went on for 14 months, so to say I was sleep deprived is an understatement and it resulted in me feeling a lot of very negative thoughts about him. I had thoughts of shaking him, throwing him into the wall, driving us both into oncoming traffic. I didn't want to do any of these things but the thoughts still creeped in, especially when he was crying nonstop. I was beyond terrified to tell anyone at the time and thank god I was able to suffer through it until he started sleeping better, he's two now and I have the best relationship with him but I still feel so guilty when I think back at how I used to speak to him in those moments and I wish for his sake I had reached out for help. It's a relief to hear that CPS works with the Mom in these situations rather than just jumping to remove the child, that was the fear that kept me silent.",

If someone else had done that, threatened to frame someone and have them sent to prison if they didn't have sex with them (especially if it was a guy threatening a girl) im sure she would be arresting them with enthusiasm. The fact that she's a cop and the victim was a guy doesn't make it not rape. IT just means he's certainly not going to admit to anyone he was raped, and even if he did, nothing would happen because she's a cop. \nI can empathize but I can't really offer any advice. \nAnd the fact she was laughing with her friends about it later is fucking crazy. Like she either doesn't even realize what she did is rape, or doesn't care. Since she works in law enforcement though, I'd say she likely knows what it was she did.",

Ranty is right about the gossip approach. I also want to add that you should act non-judgemental, curious, laugh along with her (she seems to think it\u2019s funny), and inquire about her \u201clove\u201d for him. She\u2019s gonna want to talk about that *a lot.* (That\u2019s typical behaviour whether you\u2019re a regular person in love or a rapist who **thinks** they\u2019re in love. I\u2019m getting sick just writing this, but that\u2019s what happens when you try to put yourself in the mind of a fucked up person.) I\u2019m trying to imagine her mindset and vulnerabilities. She\u2019s clearly obsessed with him, so if you\u2019re able to stomach it, try getting her to vent about your friend. Her unrequited feelings for him are her weak spot.\n\nBasically, you need to butter her up. Put on an Oscar winning performance\u2014this could be the only piece of evidence you get. There\u2019s a bit of pressure here but think of how much you\u2019d be helping your friend.\n\nOf course, I don\u2019t know the laws about recording people in your state. You may not even be able to record a confession. Still, even if recording is off the table, I recommend to maintain the act. I believe she\u2019ll slip up and do something stupid (which we want) if you maintain a friendly, non-judgemental vibe. If I were in your shoes, I\u2019d be confused, worried, and full of rage\u2014so I know it\u2019s hard to play nice. But you get more bees with honey.\n\nEdit: Fwiw, I was able to record a confession from a rapist a few years ago by using this technique. It works really well.",

I don't know if this would work for you if the tree is already completely severed from the roots. My other suggestion would be to make furniture out of it - that way the tree isn't gone entirely, and you can pack up and take it with you if you guys decide to move.\n\nUnless you have absolutely zero cares about architecture and interior design, including colors, patterns, shapes, etc, I would sit down with your husband and see what his plans are. If you two have never renovated or altered a living space together you may be surprised by what you discover you don't like (speaking from experience).\u00a0\n\nAbove all, I am so sorry you're experiencing this loss. Once upon a time my grandpa cut the three lowest hanging branches off of our prized magnolia tree (they were huge branches and were great for kids to play on since they were so low to the ground, also you're not supposed to trim magnolia trees so that their leaves can stay mostly self-contained). He thought he was doing us a favor, but we were devastated. I remember how torn I was, and I can't imagine how much worse it would have been if he cut down the entire tree.",

                    "body": "My mum said she was going through my grandmas things and sorting out the older stuff that needed to be thrown away after she passed. The first item of the agenda was apparently, to my horror, all of the handmade gifts and cards I had written her throughout my life. I wrote a poem in each card - gone in the trash. There were genuinely broken items still left untouched. \n\nApparently, it didn\u2019t occur to her. Everyone else I speak to in the family believes it was a misunderstanding. I had a very hard time believing that, even though I wanted to - it was only once I saw a therapist and she said \u201cThat was not an accident\u201d I really accepted it. \n\nBe very frank with yourself, OP. This simply does not make sense as a misunderstanding. It is odd to cut down a tree as the first project in modernising the house. He must have known its significance to your family. He was not apologetic and in a frantic state of despair when he saw how it hurt you. He appears to have some genuine disdain for the house from your other comments as well - I can\u2019t speak to exactly why, but is there something about the closeness of your family that could trigger him? Did he not have beautiful signs of significance like that tree in his own family? \n\nI may be reading into it too much but it sounds like you are quite sentimental about the house and the memories it holds. It sounds like you have just \u201cgiven up\u201d trying to get your husband to understand your sentimentality, and you have a sense that modernising is inevitable, so you have just said \u201cdo whatever you want\u201d. It sounds to me like you didn\u2019t want to give your own input or be involved in every tiny decision because you knew he would railroad you and your opinion did not matter. Now you can see just how much he does not care about your feelings, values, or wellbeing.\n\nI know it sounds ridiculous to end a marriage over a tree - but actually, it doesn\u2019t. It only sounds ridiculous to people like him who refuse to acknowledge that items that *they* see no value in can hold incredible sentimental value to others. To me it makes all the sense in the world. Just like the tree, it\u2019s symbolic. He destroyed something that made you happy and he now cares more about being right and being able to do what he wants than making it up to you and consoling your feelings. Put yourself in his shoes, OP. Imagine destroying the most important thing in the world to him, and getting argumentative when he lost his shit over it.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t inherently know what he has done and how he should act, he won\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t value you. If he did, he would cherish all the things you valued even if he didn\u2019t feel the same way. Because your happiness should be more important than having a modern back yard (which, logically, there\u2019s no way ONE tree is going to be the biggest factor when we are considering a full makeover of the house!).\n\nMy heart aches for you, OP. You have lost something with so much history and so many memories that cannot be replaced. Don\u2019t let anyone, him or otherwise, minimise your grief. My grief in your situation would be deep and immense. This is a tragic loss.",

When my children wanted a pool, I said we couldn't get one because there wasn't enough room in our backyard because of a 100 year old tree.  I bought this house because when I was touring the house there was a nice back patio, a porch swing and a beautiful large oak tree with some kind of green leafy plant spiraling up the trunk and into the branches.  When my  children wanted a pool instead of the tree, I cried and literally hugged that tree!  I was sentimental about the tree and because I love trees and particularly large, shady trees.\n\nI said all of that to explain that I sincerely understood your attachment to that tree in your parents yard and all the memories you guys had there.  I think YOUR TREE is greatly more significant than my tree.\n\nWith that said, and only because it is gone you guys should plant your own \"new tree.\"  If you have kids they can be a part of the planting and naming of the new tree. Maybe even make a rule that the new tree name has to go well with Sally's name. Maybe the new tree's name starts with an \"S\",  or has to have double letters.  But make it special for you guys.  Also, maybe make a new rule that whoever gets the house after you pass on has to plant their own new tree. It can be in place of your upcoming new tree OR they can plant one next to it; as an addition to your \"new\" tree.  And this can start new memories for the next generation. \n\nA bonus!  Is the story about how your husband cut down the original tree and you were so angry you almost traded him in!  It could be a story that could live on and take on a story and legend of it's own.  Just a thought!\n\nAlso, I am a jeweler and think it would be great if little trinket or jewelry boxes could be made for yourself, and your siblings and all your kids.   Although, since you were not home when the tree was cut down you may not still have the wood.  OR... You could make a frame out of the wood and take a photo of the house that has the tree in it and frame it... and have a little plaque on the frame, declaring how special Sally was to the property and the owners.  There are numerous things you could do.  The photo could even be when your dad planted it.  Just something special and different to commemorate your dad, your family and Sally.",

He can pick out a nice \"modern\" plaque or carved stone to attach to the tree or under it as a memorial to the tree your grandparents planted. You can have a memorial plaque that dedicates your new tree to Sally--the tree that honored your grandparents and was a part of your family, and that this tree is intended to provide comfort and companionship for your family and future families--thanks to Sally. \n\nIf it's not too late, I would also recommend keeping some piece of Sally. Maybe a wood cutting or even just a small hunk of wood that you can keep for yourselves or turn into some kind of artwork, or even bury near your new tree. \n\nBest of luck to you. I know how much it can hurt when something like this happens. Try your best to move forward with your husband if this was an honest mistake. If he was reckless with your feelings purposefully, move on without him.. either way, Sally has done well during her lifetime and has now moved on to whatever comes next for her.

Maybe he's not an emotional person like that, and just cut it down without realizing how his actions might affect you in the moment he did it?\n\n3.

Maybe he didn't grow up in a family like that, and don't know how to relate to it fully, so he sees objects more as objects, rather than objects of affection?\n\nThe third one is the worst, and I would say get away from him if that's the case...\n\nIn any case, you need to figure out how you feel about this, despite what you're feeling about him from the past, because likely he'll continue doing this kind of behavior in the future, if he does not admit any faults.\n\nBut if he's a bit stupid about that stuff, I think you owe it to him to explain it to him why it matters to you...\n\nIn the third case, it won't matter at all if you try to explain it, so that's why I said to get away from him in that case.

Even if the answer is yes, he obviously doesn't get or didn't care enough to understand what this tree represented to your family so I would show him. I would show him all the pictures of you and your family around the tree over the yrs, share the happy memories you and your family had around the tree (playing, having picnics, talking, etc.), and as calmly as you can try to explain to him what that felt like to have him just rip that away from you and your family without even speaking to anyone and waiting till you were gone on a business trip. You can even try to compare what this tree represented to you and your family by  finding/thinking of something that's super important to him and his family, and then ask him how he would feel if you went and destroyed it behind his back and never considered his or his family's feelings on the matter.\n\nHowever you decide to go about this I hope you find something that works for the both of you to try and mend your relationship again and to bring peace back into your guy's household.",

But here\u2019s the cold truth: your husband didn\u2019t respect that, and that tells you a lot about where you stand in the relationship. You gave him permission to renovate the house, but there\u2019s a difference between redecorating and erasing something with that much emotional weight.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is about respect.

I\u2019m incredibly sentimental because I lost many things form my childhood, so things that hold memories are huge for me. \n\nI also am deeply in love with a man on the spectrum so I could understand how a miscommunication could have tragic consequences. It would be hard for me to let go even if I knew he had no ill intentions. \n\nFirst: it\u2019s completely ok to grieve. Being mad at your spouse is a separate emotion from grieving, and probably a more convenient feeling to have than sadness. Anger won\u2019t help you heal and it also won\u2019t help to just \u201cnot be angry\u201d. Your energy should focus on proper grief. \n\nThe memories your grandparents created are alive as long as the stories are told. Could you honor the memory in some way? \n\nThrowing out ideas: Maybe a sign made to honor Sally. Especially if the stump is there, something mentioning \u201cSally 1970-2024 Withstanding everything but a well meaning but too eager of a husband making a new home for new memories with his family.\u201d\n\nSomething silly like that, but also holds Sally in high regards. You could even plant a new tree with a placard that says \u201cSally\u2019s predecessor\u2026that fits the modern aesthetic\u201d \n\nThe tree would have come down eventually, sadly. There is now a story to go with it. Grief and honor your grandparents by being determined to keep your family memories well preserved!",

When your husband said he wanted to renovate, he clearly, and understandably meant the whole thing, not just the building. Renovation commonly includes the garden area. You're not going to pretty up a house but leave the garden alone. You told him he could do whatever he wants, so he has done precisely that. You didn't give him any restrictions, you gave him carte blanche.\n\nSure, there is an argument for whether he should have been more aware, or should have double checked, but nothing you said really says that he every truly understood how much that tree meant to you, so it's not a surprise that he didn't double check. But even if he did know, to him it seems like you've given him permission.\n\nThis is just a communication issue, no nore, no less. If you want to repair this particular rift, you need to be ready to accept your part in this, accept that you made some fairly significant mistakes. If you can't do that, you'll spend all your time blaming your husband, who, quite frankly, is largely innocent in all this. He cocked up, but it's an innocent mistake, not some evil, underhanded, ma ipulativr move like the idiotic hivemind would have you believe.\n\nTalk to each other, accept your part in it, and use it as a time to bond, not to place blame and build resentment.",

Maybe struggling with compulsion like OCD, or maybe just craved a fast \"accomplishment\" for the project and saw it as a \"breath of fresh air\" for a fast dopamine boost. Maybe didn't understand the value and history, i.e. \"you could've taken pics under any tree. It's just a/another tree.\" I absolutely love all trees, but in his defense, I love NOFX too and that band isn't universally loved. Reminds me of my dad throwing stuff away around the house.

I came home one day and he had cut it down. I was so upset. I cried and cried. He kept saying 'It's only a tree. It's only a tree.' To me it was the first major crack in the foundation of our relationship. I started watching and yes it was true, it was all about what he wanted and his opinion and mine was just not important at all. \nSo you are The only one who can make up your mind what this issue means to you.  He sounds like a narcissist, so this is probably the best it will ever be. Chances are he will be cutting down your trees all your life.  I hope you didn't put his name on the house.

I also like the idea of the two of you choosing a spot and planting a new tree together. \n\nMy dad made a coffee table out of cedar wood from a tree my great grandpa had planted after the tree died. \n\nI spent hours and days woodburning designs into the table.\n\n It moved with me through a marriage, divorce, and remarriage. I needed to refinish and reseal it and didn't want it to get damaged in the meantime so I moved it to a storage shed.\n\nDuring COVID I finally had the time to work on the table. I went to the storage shed to get it and could not find it anywhere. \n\nI asked my husband about it, and he had no clue what I was talking about at first. He had cleaned out the shed a few months prior and had finally gotten around to taking an old bedroom suite we had to drop off for donation to free up some room. \n\nHE DONATED THE FAMILY COFFEE TABLE TOO!\n\nHe'd saw it in there with the rest of the furniture and just assumed I'd put it in there because I'd no longer wanted it. WHAT?! I'd told him the story of it's creation! To make it even more traumatic, I'd just lost my father 3-4 months before this. \n\nThis hurt to the core in a way I couldn't put in to words. Yes, it was coffee table, a material thing- and I don't consider myself materialistic at all. But, it was so much more than that!\n\nI think I felt much the same way you're feeling. I didn't know if I could stay in the relationship. I felt violated, I felt betrayed in the most horrible way.  I could tell, though he tried to brush things off at first as me blowing things out of proportion- it was just a damn coffee table! \n\nI told him I needed my space and didn't talk to him for a few days, didn't cook for him, didn't do any of the things I normally did out of love for him. \n\nThis finally got him thinking I guess, and I still hated that I didn't have the table anymore and I would never have gotten rid of it, but I do love the man. When he admitted he should have thought about what the table might have meant to me, probably should have told me hey I'm taking x y and z for donation etc. My love kind of overrode the hate I guess. \n\nA couple of years later now, I still would love nothing more than to have the table back, but in a weird way my husband's and my relationship is better for it. \n\nI also think a little more before deciding to toss something of my husband's now.\n\nNow, after writing this book reply- I think my husband and I will have a new project- we need to build our own table!",

People can get defensive for any number of reasons, and guilt isn't the only one at all.\n\nIs what you're saying possible? Yes.\n\nIs it the only possible explanation? No. Mistakes do happen.\n\nThere could be any kind of issues, like maybe OP's husband had perceived the relationship to be in worse shape than OP and made an honest mistake and then got defensive because of feeling like the two of them were already having trouble and not feeling like he could convey a sincere apology.\n\nOr maybe OP's husband might have some kind of neurodivergence and might not have been malicious but might have been literally unaware of the sentimental attachment to this particular object. Is it *unlikely*? Well, it's unlikely in marriages general, but is it unlikely among marriages where one partner damaged something sentimentally important to their spouse? Maybe not.\n\n**Maliciousness is 100% a possibility.**\n\n**But it's not the only possibility.**\n\nAll I'm recommending is to have a calm discussion with the husband, find out his intentions and understanding and see if he's sincere.\n\nAnd I am speaking as someone who is not good at picking up on social cues and who sometimes sincerely misses things other people insist that no one could miss. I have repeatedly been in situations where my actions were sincerely well-intentioned and where no one would accept that that was even a possibility.\n\n**I am not saying OP's husband isn't guilty.** He could be guilty as sin.\n\nAll I'm saying is that I think it's best to have a sincere conversation and to try to make a determination about whether OP's husband was trying to help and made a mistake, or whether OP's husband was actually malicious.\n\nMost husbands don't go out and do things to maliciously hurt their partners, particularly not in long-term marriages.\n\nAnd sometimes two people who are married can find out that they're not on the same page about something they both assumed they were in full agreement about.\n\nI think it's worth finding out the full reasoning behind what OP's husband says led him to cut down the tree.\n\nI think accidents and miscommunication tend to happen a lot more than people think.\n\nIn the end, if they do find out that he did it maliciously, he absolutely deserves to be treated as a jerk and an asshole.\n\nBut I think that it's really important to take a lot of factors into consideration before acting in a negative way:\n\n1. that they've been married a long time\n\n1. that (barring some kind of build-up) partners don't tend to randomly do things out of a desire to hurt their spouse\n\n1. whether or not this person tends to be someone who makes social mistakes or ever has had significant misunderstandings\n\n1. whether he had something against the tree\n\n1. whether he has expressed wanting to do things to really help his partner and be really active(so for example, if he's the kind of person to bring roses every week or be constantly doing little romantic things, it might be out of character to do something that would so deeply hurt his partner)",

It took a while for me to pick up on things and her to realize she could tell me how she felt. We communicate so much better now and I would never make a mistake like that again.

Just giving tips on chess, as well as probability models related to chess (as I come from a math background). That's it. That's all I do. My clothes have never come off aside from one video where I was wearing a top instead of my usual t-shirt. Surprisingly, I make some money with it, ranging from 500\u20ac per month to 2000\u20ac per month. Not a huge living, but it helps with some bills. \n\nWell, some individuals online who I also most likely know in real life (I have a suspicion who they are, but I am not 100% sure) sent my OF to my parents. My dad laughed it off, and actually likes watching my chess content now, lol. My mom however... Well, let's just say that she has recently reported me for \"tax evasion\" (which I am not guilty of, we just have a difficult relationship and I went NC recently) has now shared my page with my employer, and other individuals in my personal life.\n\nWhat do I do? Everyone seems to think that I do OF for sw, which I don't. Asking for them to subscribe just to show the proof sounds tacky. No idea what to do here. ",

            "text": "This is going to be a very long one, I apologize in advance. My wife and I got married very recently this year, in a gorgeous ceremony, surrounded by our friends and family. We were together for 4 years prior. This last year has been monumentally stressful for the two of us, both work-wise and with the wedding planning. However, the day couldn't have been more perfect and it was undoubtedly the absolute best day of our lives, making all of the trouble and stress more than worth it.\n\nI make very good money and provide for the both of us, while my wife takes care of finances/bills, plans our trips and generally keeps me uplifted when I'm stressed with work. I adore my wife, she's beautiful, smart, extremely well read and has always shared my sense of humor. When we met, I couldn't believe that there was someone as wonderfully goofy and weird as I was and I knew very early on that she was the one for me. We made it through the pandemic together, through distance at times and I never thought that anything could sway my feelings for her.\n\nWe booked an expensive honeymoon, in a tropical location, scheduled a few weeks after the wedding. She'd been there before and told me she had always wanted to go back. I paid, while she, as per usual organized the trip. The first few days were amazing. We're not super active on our vacations and were just happy to drink, go to the beach for the whole day and out to nice dinners in the evening. The second hotel we stayed at is where things took a turn.\nWhile out, my wife and I started chatting to a few other couples at a beachside bar/restaurant. We're both very social, so we like asking other couples about themselves, sharing funny comparisons and including each other in the laughs. She was getting a little tipsy, but nothing too bad or out of the ordinary. At some point, she began to start slipping into 'drunk' territory and I started ordering us more food and suggesting she take it easy, which she obliged. Despite this, she later kept ordering more drinks. I asked her to please take it easy, because I know her pacing at this stage. She got quite agitated and stated that this was her honeymoon too and she wanted to relax. While talking some more, she got noticeably more drunk, pretty fast. I was talking to the couple on my right, when I heard my wife tell the girl next to her that she had a 'one that got away', who she wished she 'hadn't let go' and that she settled for me. My face, my stomach, my heart, everything dropped. I can't imagine what I must have looked like in that moment, but the people she was talking to got very quiet and awkward, the couple next to me tried changing the subject. Still, my wife went on.\n\nShe gestured toward me and began to discuss that I wasn't her type at all and went on to describe something entirely different. We had both made jokes in the past about not being each others initial type, but that since meeting each other, we were both the 'type' we both never knew we wanted. It seems this wasn't true on her end. She patted my head condescendingly and said \"unfortunately, this was the best I could do, but life goes on\". She wasn't laughing. She was completely deadpan. I was absolutely crushed. This didn't seem at all like the person I had been with over the last 4 years. I tried to get her to put her drink down, let me pay the check and leave when she outright snapped. The waitress had refused her when she asked for another drink and she stormed off to the bathroom. At this stage, the people she was talking to had migrated tables and the couple next to me were trying to reassure me, despite the bomb that had clearly gone off. I went to go check on her after a few minutes. This turned to 20 more minutes, after which the waiting staff had to go in and retrieve her. She had been getting sick in the bathroom. She didn't say a word to me when she got out and just grabbed her stuff. In the interim, the other couple had picked up our check, which I was incredibly embarrassed about, but grateful for. The parted ways saying \"happy honeymoon\" in awkward wincing smiles.\n\nI left with her, feeling utterly dumbstruck, embarrassed, concerned and above all just heartbroken. She spent the entire walk back to the hotel saying that she knew I was embarrassed of her behaviour, adding \"you know what, I don't care, you're an embarrassment most of the time\". She went to point out that she that I was not funny or charismatic, as she had said in the past, but a clown, a laughing stock, and that our friends only put up with me out of niceties. She said that they all just saw me as a complete joke and that I was just too stupid to notice. This was all being screamed at me in front of as many people as you can imagine a popular destination spot would have walking around in the main town, all while I was trying to keep her from stumbling out onto the street. I had turned from embarrassed and upset to completely numb. I felt as though my marriage had detonated then and there. I'm ashamed to say this, but in that moment, I imagined leaving her as soon as I got back home and the ensuing embarrassment of having to explain to friends and family that my marriage had not even lasted a season without crumbling.\n\nWe were getting into a semi crowded elevator when she squirmed out and bolted off. I immediately ran back down 3 stories and spent the next 45 minutes trying to locate her on the hotel premise. Finally we got back to the room and she fell straight to sleep on the bed. I rolled her onto her side, tucked her in and got her water. We were going to our 3rd stop at a resort the following morning, so I just stayed up and packed. To say I felt empty inside is a complete understatement. She woke up about 2-3 hours later asking what had happened. Why I looked so upset. I asked if she was actually serious. If the most devastating part of our relationship, of any relationship I had ever been in had not JUST happened for her. She seemed anxious, as if it were less than half coming back to her, so I told her everything she had done, as calmly as I could. I told her how much she had hurt and embarrassed me with what she had said.\n\nShe was hysterical. She started screaming into the pillows, trying to hurt herself, screaming that she had ruined our honeymoon and our marriage, begging me not to leave her, telling me she didn't mean it. She was still fairly drunk. I told her to just go back to sleep, that I needed to go for a walk and have some time to think. She refused to give me it. She grabbed my arm while I asked her to let go, scratching me while I told her to just let me have space, screaming all the while. I stopped and just got into bed and told her I could not talk to her. We both went to sleep, but she woke me multiple times, telling me that we needed to talk through this and that I owed her that much. I just told her that I couldn't. I was shattered. I told her I didn't even know if I could finish the rest of the honeymoon and that I didn't know if I could go to the final resort we were staying at.\n\nI woke the next morning. She had cancelled our 5 day resort stay that we were due to be at in 6 hours, of which I received no refund. She cried, she apologized, she begged for me to hear her out, but there was literally nothing that could fix what she had said and how she talked to me after, in that moment. She told me that it wasn't her, that she remembered none of it and that she couldn't even begin to think of why she had said and done those things. That it wasn't how she felt at all and that I was the best thing that had ever happened to her, that I had to believe her, after everything we had been through. Asking why I couldn't just trust her after all of this time together.\n\nThis is getting very long, so to put the rest of the trip briefly, she used her savings to pay for a very expensive resort for us that day, apologizing for cancelling the other one without asking first. She wanted to save the trip. For the rest of the trip she was remorseful, she was kind, she was sweet, she was the person that I had fallen in love with. She seemed just as shattered and upset as I was. I tried to make the most of the rest of our stay, but it was obvious that I was still heartbroken, despite trying to keep it together. She cried on the plane home and she cried most of the day we got back.\nFast forward a couple of very awkward, sad and tense days, she comes to me and lays out all of the changes she was going to make. She has always done the laundry but didn't really do a lot of the cleaning or cooking. In recent months she would often get agitated when I would finish work and start doing it. She promised to do all or at least most of the household stuff, to take the pressure off of me. She started dressing up, doing her makeup more often, she even cooked me a fancy dinner and decorated, to show how much she appreciated me and the life I had given her (her words, not mine). She told me that she had only said those things because she was insecure about not working, about herself in our friend group and how she had felt that our mutual friends liked me more than her. I don't believe that last part to be true in the slightest. More than half of them were actually her friends before they were mine. I asked about the 'one that got away', as difficult as it was and she said that she didn't know why she said that but she didn't feel that way. She said that I was her type, that I was the only one for her and that she would spend as long as it took to make it up to me.\n\nWe see a lot of relationship posts reuploaded to tiktok and one thing I absolutely cannot stand is that the couples cannot seem to fathom the concept of actually communicating to each other in situations like this... and that's what we did. We communicated. We talked openly and honestly. I told her firmly and candidly about all of the changes I needed. I asked about what I needed to change, what could have made her so full of contempt for me in that moment on our honeymoon and what we could both do to avoid it. Things started to pick up over the next few days and it seemed like things were going to be ok. There were some lingering things, of course. I wasn't initiating intimacy, I just couldn't. I felt like a complete loser. I felt completely undesirable. Questioning how anyone could see anything in me, if this is how she felt. She tried on multiple occasions, but I just asked her for time to recover. She gave me that space and reassured me that she would wait as long as it took for me to feel up to it again. We both always had a high sex drive and that was now completely shot.\n\nFinally over time, we were intimate again, she cooked, cleaned, did sweet things for me, acted like she did when we first met. It really did feel like this whole nightmare might have been a net positive. Like it had kicked some things that were off in our relationship back into place. Like it was the wakeup call we needed. I still had intrusive thoughts, but we communicated and she would compliment and reassure me. She would constantly ask if how she was acting and the things she was doing for me were noticeable. I told her that they were and that I appreciated them and I tried to be more aware of any flaws I myself might have in my day to day.\nIt's been some weeks since then and things have started to slip back. The nice dinners stopped almost immediately, as did the nice gestures. She's started to become irritable with me with small things, unrelated to me. She's stopped doing household things consistently and is again irritable when I ask if she can help with them, while I'm working. I don't work the longest hours on earth by any means, but my work weeks are 60 to sometimes 70 hours. I'll find her downstairs playing video games or watching streams and asking her to help out is leading to strained discussions at times. She doesn't not do housework at all, but it's absolutely noticeably less already. She had started therapy through Betterhelp (I have no experience with that app and don't know if it is reputable) but that stopped after about 2 weeks. We have long discussions and things get better momentarily, but they keep resetting and I feel like I'm in a sate of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with everything. Again, I previously stated that I hate that couples can't just talk to each other in these kind of posts, but we've been talking. She'll turn around and still do sweet things, but I just can't bring myself to look past what happened sometimes and it's still eating at me. My confidence is completely fine some days and others it is just on the floor.\n\nI still love her, but I cannot say with any confidence that I feel \"in love\" with her anymore and I don't know what to do. I never thought I would see myself on this end of one of these posts. She's talked to her mother about it and I cannot bring myself to say anything to my parents or friends. I'm so embarrassed and haven't been able to confide in anyone about this, aside from her. Thank you all for taking the time to read this. Any advice movement forward would be so appreciated. Have a wonderful day, all of you.\n\n(TL;DR: My wife drunkenly said she settled for me and is still holding a candle for someone else, on our honeymoon. Then she said I was a joke)\n\n\u2014-\n\nEdit: Oh my goodness, thank you all for your messages, no matter what your opinions were, I appreciate all of them and I appreciate you all giving your time and advice. I only just work up, so sorry for not responding sooner. I really wasn't expecting this turnout in the comments. Being able to get the story off of my chest, outside of talking to her, is in itself some form of relief. \n\nI see a lot of people writing that my wife married me for the money. I really should have added that when we got engaged, we did not have much money at all. Sorry for not including it initially, I wrote this at around 1-2am my time, and the grammatical errors reflect that. We got engaged in the middle of the pandemic, work had dried up in my field and we were both banking on my plan to pay off. She always said she believed I could be successful, but I was by no means close to being financially sound when she said yes to marrying me. However that said, take from that what you will. \n\nI'm trying my best to read through all of the messages. I'll be honest, a lot are difficult to process. I see, acknowledge and appreciate the ones telling me to look out for my best interests, but also the ones telling me to actually ask my wife about her aspirations or goals, which surely cannot be sitting around/household tasks. In the past it's been touchy and/or difficult to get her to pursue the field of her degree. It's creative and daunting and she has often gotten defensive and dismissive of my help in the past. This morning I asked her to lay out a realistic and specific plan to get back into working, with the goal of working towards the career she actually wants.\n\nI have never been to therapy, but I'm going to look into one on one sessions and go from there, no matter what outcome, after reading this, I clearly need to work on me, whatever that might entail. I'm going away on a trip with some guy friends for a couple of days and while they are our mutual friends, I'm going to try and open up to them as non-biased as I can. Thank you all for sharing your own past experiences so candidly with me and for the DM's also. I know that these next steps seem like baby steps and might be frustrating to read from your end, but we are both religious, divorce is not the option I want to go down if I can help it. However, you're all right. I cannot be miserable for the rest of my life and if no effort is made, it's looking like that might have to be a route. With that said, your words have given me comfort, and while they haven't restored all of my self confidence, they have shown me that I have to actually buck up, be more direct and not be so malleable.\n\nI will update in the coming weeks. Thank you all so much again, I really mean it. Have a wonderful day, you kind souls.",

So she has a lot of unhappiness bottled up in her just keep it going. That's maybe why she got so drunk and expressed her true feeling on which meant to be one of the happiest moment of her life. Because it wasn't. She has settled for the easy life, and she isn't truly happy about it. \n\nBut I may be totally wrong. It may just have been a silly drunken incident.",

This needs therapy imo.\n\nBut.. therapy doesn't work on people who aren't willing, or won't tell the truth.\n\n\nThere is a fundamental truth of people you have to understand, people are insecure. They are anxious, traumatised, have low self esteem and are running away from themselves.\n\nIn general people have emotional issues, and this dictates their lives to huge extents.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \n\nThere are people who seek love in order to fill a void in themselves, instead of seeking love for love's sake.\n\nAre they incapable of loving? No they aren't, not by any stretch.\n\nDo they ask more than the relationship can give? Perhaps.\n\nA relationship can't sustain YOU and your self worth. If you try to get that support, the relationship will colapse.\n\nNow comes the part i think might be relevant- \n\nFull disclosure, I read this in a newspaper article. This is extremely simple, but might be pertinent.\n\nThe headline read- Is your relationship out of love or loneliness?\n\nPeople who love out of love can tolerate separation even if they miss their partner\n\nPeople who love out of loneliness can't tolerate separation and get anxious when separated\n\nPeople who love out of love will be sad to breakup and very hurt, but will prioritise your happiness along with theirs.\n\nPeople who love out of loneliness will freak out when a breakup is on the horizon. They'll get irate or start shouting, or get very stressed\n\n\nPeople who love out of love, have a calm and kind love\n\nPeople who love out of loneliness will have a clingy and needy love\n\n\n\nThat's not to say that people who love out of loneliness may be incapable of love. It may be the case that they settle for partners who they might not want because they fear being alone.\n\nhttps://www.antiloneliness.com/relationships/love-or-fear-of-being-alone\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/social-instincts/202303/3-signs-your-relationship-is-based-on-loneliness-not-love%3famp\n\nThese links might be useful.\n\nNow, I've heard that when people get blackout drunk, people can say the most random or batshit insane things. Alcoholics have reported to saying things a complete180 of their actual beliefs.\n\nSo there's no guarantee what your wife said are 100% her inner thoughts. They might also not be.\n\nWhat you said, there are very minor 'clues' if you consider them such.\n\nShe's not willing to take responsibility (the drop off in housework and effort after some time passed - you will not be able to pull off an unsustainable habit, by definition)\n\nShe doesn't have a job and likely has self esteem issues, as she stated she felt insecure due to not having a job, although that could've been a lie to appease you.\n\nAnd it's sort of telling that she went to a 0 - 100 after an incident. Not that it happened, any spouse will be in \"makeup with hubby\" mode after that happened, but there's something to note about the quality of it.\n\n\nHere you are who's been hurt, and your self esteem has been shattered.\n\nHow does she make it up to you?\n\nBy being extra nice\nBy doing all the chores so you feel grateful\nBy TAKING all the responsibility\nBy dolling up to appease you visually\n\n\nI ask you, how's any of that relevant in a broken self esteem?\n\nIt's not. It helps the hurt sure, a small bit, but it's fundamentally (imo) a giant appeasement effort.\n\nAnd appeasement is a misdirection tactic. It avoids paying the real price (earning trust) while gently coaxing you into a better mood.\n\nDon't accept it.\n\nThere are many many examples of spouses who do nothing but video game all day, scroll online and are also in a dysfunctional relationship.\n\nThe relevant interpretation being the bad lifestyle and the bad relationship is a side-effect of dysfunction inside of them.\n\nDo you think that's the case?\n\nHow well do you know your wife?\n\nIs it possible that your wife has deep emotional issues which she has hid from you and just can't or doesn't want to tell you?\n\nSome people don't want to solve their problems. They just want to put on a band aid and forget.\n\nWhat's the probability of a person behaving like your wife did, if the person was deeply insecure, and was in a relationship out of loneliness and was repressing feelings of inadequacy which came from settling with someone who wasn't the fantastic ideal in all conceivable dimensions?\n\nWhat's the probability of that behaviour, given the emotional issues were assumed to be true?\n\nIs it possible that you were chosen for your wealth and status? Because there are plenty of people who go for that.\n\n\nStart watching her like a hawk. Stop communicating with her. Collect data over a long enough interval of time. And do not allow her the opportunity to modify her behaviour.\n\nBe precise in your observations. You'll have your answer in her behaviour to an extent.\n\n\nIt may turn out that she's not a good partner or it might not turn out that way.\n\nIn the former case, if you want to continue the relationship, get her to a personal therapist asap. Also go to couples therapist.\n\nSome couples counsellors aren't therapist, I wouldn't recommend those.\nYou have money so seek out an actual therapist who does couples therapy.\n\n\nAnd lastly. None of this is a reflection on you. It's a reflection on her. I suspect all this is because of some bad beliefs she has about herself and the world.\n\nDon't take it so hard although that's foolish sounding at this time.\n\nGet a therapist yourself. A lot of things will become clear.\n\nGood luck and you'll survive and thrive. Dont give up.",

Specifically when in reference to how someone feels about another person. \nThe less inhibited, more careless mind of a drunk person will overshare. While what they say may be a bit exaggerated or even embellished a bit but, there is some truth to what they say.\nIn your case, the things she said were fucking brutal and even if super exaggerated, it\u2019s clear that she married you for the wrong reasons. For her this is a marriage of convenience, of necessity. If I were I in your shoes, I would always feel that lingering in my soul. Her words would replay in my head and it would wreck me. \n\nBrother, she didn\u2019t ruin your honeymoon. She ruined your marriage. It\u2019s probably not too late for an annulment. That\u2019s what I\u2019d be doing if I were you. I couldn\u2019t stay married to a woman who said those things about me. That\u2019s how she actually feels and no amount of apologizing, or playing Susie homemaker will ever change that. Clearly that\u2019s all BS anyway because she slides back into her old ways. \n\nYou deserve better than that. You shouldn\u2019t have to wonder if your wife actually loves you, respects you and wants to be with you. You shouldn\u2019t feel like someone\u2019s consolation prize, a participation trophy.\n\nThere\u2019s no undoing what was done, unsaying what was said. \nHer being drunk is relevant only in that it loosened up her tongue and allowed her real feelings to come to light. \nIt\u2019s not an excuse. It doesn\u2019t make any of what she said untrue. \n\nIt\u2019s sad that she was raised to see marriage as a means to an end instead of what it\u2019s supposed to be. Clearly she just wants to be someone\u2019s trophy wife and she\u2019s willing to settle for anyone who can give her a lifestyle she feels is appropriate. Let that be some other poor s.o.b.. \nYou can find someone who actually wants to be with you, not just financially supported by you.",

Early on, I had some indications that my wife was not going to be a suitable life partner and I ignored them. We had kids, bought a mortgage, etc. and now I have very few options and they all suck. I wish I had paid more attention to some of the things I realized about my wife before we had kids, because I would have made different choices. You can still do that. You\u2019re young, you\u2019re childless, you can extract yourself from this situation pretty easily. \n\nTo be clear, I do think you need to leave. Your wife has some pretty serious issues, including possible alcohol abuse disorder, that will take years to address and that\u2019s only if she commits. She isn\u2019t showing you that she\u2019s willing to do that. Untreated, these issues will compound and get worse. \n\nSecond, it seems that the way she feels about you (and about \u2018the one who got away\u2019) are different than she tells you when she\u2019s sober. That\u2019s not something you can fix with therapy. \n\nI wish you the best. Have courage. It\u2019s better to find out early.",

Hear me out. \n\nHigh volumes of alcohol and women don't mix, that's not rocket science to us lol. But, add the contraception pill to that picture and you literally have a nightmare on your hands if she gets sh\\*tfaced. I am saying this from experience in my 20's, with myself 'being' that nightmare and I have several friends who have experienced the same behavioral issues and literally abused their partners publicly (like myself) when they've had too much to drink. \n\nI said the most awful things to my partner at the time, cursed at friends, punched people and made a complete fool of myself several times. I thought I was crazy, but I wasn't. It was the pill. \n\nIt's a blackout and the devil that doesn't even exist comes out. Don't ask me why, don't ask me for written evidence on this, as I can't provide it, but I can tell you based on experience that this is an issue! I wanted to die every time it happened and literally stopped drinking anything heavier than a light cider so it wouldn't happen again.\n\nI did end up speaking to my doctor about it and he was the one that said it was likely the pill causing the behavior with too much alcohol consumption. \n\nI had no idea that contraception was the problem, but after stopping the pill at 29, it has never happened again - and the same with my girlfriends who stopped the pill and never had another episode. \n\nOne went back on the pill after her first child and then had an absolutely epic episode at the races in front of hundreds of people !!!! She wanted to die. Like, I just can't explain the remorse, it's just so, so awful and so, so black, because the episode is 100% NOT a representation of what that person feels or thinks in reality, or who they are. Some women just simply cannot drink when they take the pill. \n\nSo, if she isn't on the pill, I will swallow my words and refer you back to the other Redditors advice!",

                    "body": "I\u2019m so sorry, OP. I\u2019m going to share my reaction, and a personal experience that I think is relevant:\n\nI think you\u2019re making a mistake, trying to work this out. I can\u2019t speak to how she felt about you a year ago or more, but I think that night was the most honest she\u2019s going to be about how she feels now. Maybe she married you because she had enough faith in your goals to bet on your future income; she might have left if you hadn\u2019t become so successful, but it\u2019s easier to bag a high-earner before they have money than after (you yourself have more trust that it wasn\u2019t about money because she agreed to marry you before your success); maybe she was aware that you were willing to be the sole earner, and she didn\u2019t care how much you made so long as she didn\u2019t have to work; maybe she was impatient to be married and you were available; or maybe she genuinely loved you. But alcohol doesn\u2019t make people say things they don\u2019t mean; it makes them say things they don\u2019t *mean to say.* They may voice a more exaggerated version of their truth, but the root of what they\u2019re saying is generally honest unless there\u2019s something significant pushing them to lie. There was no reason for her to say what she said unless it was true.\n\nI think you\u2019re trying to work through this because 1) you don\u2019t want to mourn the loss of the love you thought you had, 2) you\u2019re embarrassed to tell everyone that you\u2019re getting divorced so soon after the marriage, and 3) you\u2019re so sick of bad TikTok videos that you place moral value on being able to work through relationship problems. But this isn\u2019t the sort of thing that you can fix by talking it out. Unless you could be happily married to someone who views you the way you now know she views you, cut your losses before she gets pregnant or your finances get more intertwined.\n\nI married a guy I thought was wonderful. I couldn\u2019t believe how lucky I was. After we got engaged, we started having problems, but I was convinced that being a mature adult meant working through things when they seemed hard. I took on more and more responsibilities on my own, convinced that if I worked hard enough then things could be good; to reduce his stress I started doing all the housework (he was working, I was a PhD student in cognitive neuroscience); I walked our two sixty-pound dogs alone so he could have more free time to play video games; I started therapy, lost weight, and asked less and less of him. After the wedding, things got to a point where I finally talked to him and said I felt like maybe he loved me, but he didn\u2019t seem to be *in love with* me (by this point, he\u2019d take his meals to a different room because he didn\u2019t even want that 30 minutes or so together; one night we went on a dinner date and he didn\u2019t even want to sit with me while I finished my dessert and we waited for the check, so he left me alone while he went home and I finished eating and waited to pay). He assured me that I was wrong, that he was just stressed, so I continued to try to take things off his plate. Then some symptoms that I\u2019d started to have almost a decade prior got worse, and then I got COVID and they became unbearable. I started a process of medical tests, through which he told me I just needed a \u201cmore positive attitude\u201d and that I was \u201csteering into\u201d being sick as an excuse to fall behind on housework. He wouldn\u2019t even drive me to the testing that I couldn\u2019t go to alone; I had to ask a friend to go with me. We had started couple\u2019s therapy, and our therapist convinced him to at least go with me to find out the test results (she tried to get him to go for the last test, but the day before he decided he wanted to hang out with someone who had COVID so he\u2019d have to isolate from me instead of going with me). The appointment was the week of our two-year wedding anniversary; I was diagnosed with three chronic (but not life-threatening) conditions that my doctor assured me were very manageable with treatment. Less than 24 hours later, my now-ex husband asked for a divorce. He later admitted that he probably wasn\u2019t in love with me, and that if I still could have kept on top of housework perfectly while going through everything then he probably wouldn\u2019t have asked for the divorce. Ask yourself: do you think your wife would be trying so hard to fix things if you weren\u2019t funding her life? If you lost your income or got sick and needed support, do you think she\u2019d stay? Because trust me, those things can happen when you least expect them, and while going through those huge life stresses is NOT when you want to also deal with a divorce. You can\u2019t fix things if she\u2019s just trying to keep her lifestyle, and the fact that she\u2019s stopping trying so quickly tells me that she\u2019s not emotionally committed to you; she\u2019s just trying to do the bare minimum to keep from losing her meal ticket. I\u2019m so sorry if that\u2019s harsh, but I\u2019d hate for you to waste more time and energy trying to save a loving relationship while your wife just tries to save a financially-advantageous legal contract.",

First of all being drunk doesn\u2019t change the person and feelings you are and have. She was speaking some truth she felt as hard as that maybe to hear. Second I understand not wanting a divorce for religious or other beliefs, but you can get an annulment. But I would suggest you personally get some therapy and she also. But I would try couples therapy along with it. I feel like if she really didn\u2019t feel that way she would still be doing things and helping more then just a few weeks and stopping.thats just her manipulating you. I have had many ups and downs in my marriage,we had some really hard dark times. But I would NEVER say anything like that to my husband regardless if I were drunk or not. If I had said anything hurtful to my husband which I have in arguments, I would do everything I could possibly do to make it up to him and show him how sorry I was not just saying it changes anything. Actions are a lot more powerful and meaningful than words. I\u2019ve been married for almost 27 years and would NEVER disrespect my partner like that. When you truly love someone you would never say anything like your wife did. She is immature selfish and not very loving. Again the best thing you could do would be couples therapy and separating spaces to work your way back to one another or to an annulment. Good luck I hope nothing but the best for you and for a partner that loves you completely and respects you. I at this point would not be able to live with her until we worked things out. She has not only disrespected you, but broke trust in the relationship and that\u2019s a hard thing to came back from. Trust, love and open communication is key to a happy and healthy relationship.",

You deserve to be treated with love and respect, especially by your wife.\n\nSecond- you need to do some soul searching. Picture your life in 5, 10, 15 years. Is she in it? Picture her walking up to you tomorrow and telling you she\u2019s pregnant (if you plan on having children). Would this be happy? Or the worst news of your life?\n\nDivorce is completely reasonable in this situation. Staying is also a completely ok option. You seem to have good and healthy communication habits (not sure about hers), so I would tend to believe you could make either of these work. You also need to know that the end of someone\u2019s relationship is no one\u2019s business but your own. You would choose who you would decide to tell. To everyone else, \u00ab\u00a0it just wasn\u2019t working\u00a0\u00bb or \u00ab\u00a0it was no longer something that was making me happy\u00a0\u00bb. Those that love you will always support you. Especially in situations like this.\n\nNext, it\u2019s hard to be someone who relies on someone else completely. Not everyone can do it. If she is not one of those people, which it seems she is, she needs to get back into the workforce. Honestly, I think you should be pushing for this anyway. Hire a cleaner to come in once a week. Ask her to pay some of the bills. She needs to develop more ways for self esteem to come through. Clearly it\u2019s pretty low at the moment. \n\nLastly- she needs therapy. The good kind. The expensive kind. The kind you go into an office and see someone face to face kind. Better help is a great low cost option for those that can\u2019t afford more. It also unfortunately pays it\u2019s therapists pennies to what they are worth, meaning very few stay on the app for long. To get a good therapist with a vast wealth of experience that will be able to tackle a more complex issue (self esteem can always get to be extremely complex), you need someone outside the app. For me, this would not be a negotiable. She needs to figure herself out, so that you aren\u2019t sitting there waiting years for the ball to drop. \n\nYou could likely use therapy too. This has obviously affected you big time. It has put a large strain your your self worth and self esteem. It will also give you someone to talk to about all this that can get to know more details about the situation and get to know you more than strangers on the internet. Help you ensure there are no other red flags that haven\u2019t been seen, before you have kids and tie yourself to this woman forever.\n\nGood luck.",

Lady is 25 years old and she needs to pick her ass up and find a job. I don't care if you're a millionaire. She's never going to have any self-respect if she has to depend on you like you are her father. That isn't your purpose. She is your partner not your child. She's a grown woman and she needs to be able to rely on herself. It doesn't mean she has to earn the same amount as you but it isn't 1950. Women have jobs. Let's say things don't work out between the two of you...well, she hasn't done herself any favors by not working. I actually suspect this is a big part of her problem. She is bored sitting at home all day, she feels inferior and there is a power imbalance. She needs to fix that. It's not like she's at home taking care of babies. She's literally sitting at home doing nothing all day. Her job isn't to make you gourmet dinners and be the housekeeper and my guess is, she's not okay with being that person. I know I wouldn't be.",

They'll say anything, even if it's not true just to hurt you because they are nasty mean drunks. That being said, these thoughts had to come from somewhere. She's probably been thinking a milder version of this for a while. \n\n2. Stay at home wife is not a maid or cook. If you want a freshly cleaned house and a hot meal daily, hire a maid and a cook. She needs to get a job or you need to both agree on what your expectations are for you to support her financially. Be realistic too- your job ends at 5pm and you get the weekend off. Hers should, too, if you are expecting her to work on the house. That doesn't mean she doesn't have to pick up after herself after 5pm just major chores can wait until working hours. If you can't agree then she should get a job.\n\nI say that not because she should get a free ride with no chores but because some people just aren't cut out to stay at home. I tried for 3 years, my husband would come home throw his clothes wherever, not eat what I made or complain- I felt like crap, I cleaned constantly only for the kids or hubby to ruin it hours later. And if I didn't clean or cook-- it was the weekend for example and I needed a break, I felt like crap because here was hubby working 40 hrs. Eventually I got really depressed and considering leaving my husband but instead I got a job, told him to pick up his own $hit and we've been together 10 years now, much much happier. \n\nNot everyone is cut out for it and if she's not cooking and cleaning get a maid and tell your wife to get a job.\n\nThere are other things in this post however that are genuinely concerning. It's not ok how she embarrassed you, and even though she was drunk what she said was not OK. You both need to go to counseling and she needs to stay away from alcohol and get a job.",

It\u2019s probably the biggest life decision you can make and she doesn\u2019t seem like she feels in control or confident about anything she does. Which relates to her work I think. She sounds like she feel utterly powerless over all, she can\u2019t influence her own life, can\u2019t realise her dreams and maybe she jealous that you can.

It\u2019s good you\u2019ve been talking but there are some bigger conversations to be had that I think might be better had in couples counselling. I think she needs to hear a little more from you, not just about how hurt you are but what you want from your life, what you need to feel and that you don\u2019t want that forced from her. You may come from a religious background but ultimately if the marriage is miserable, you may make a decision to leave. Tell her. She needs to know that while she is paralyzed with the burden of life, you are not, you have the strength to make hard choices for the both of you. You want to be in love, you want to feel genuine love from her, you want a partner in life that is happy and sharing the workload with you, carrying it together. She needs a reality check and she needs to be working towards her career (clearly she needs help with that).",

That being said, I have known two people who WERE diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and one diagnosed with BPD With Narcissistic Tendencies. Your wife's behavior is almost textbook narcissistic behavior. \n\nShe told you the truth while she was drunk. She got so drunk that her mask slipped. Continuously thanking you for the lifestyle you provide her is a very important context cue here. That IS why she married you. She DOES have a \"one that got away\" and she DOES feel she settled for you. She sounded bitter when she said it because she is bitter about it. \n\nThis is the narcissistic abuse cycle, and I hope this information is helpful to you:\n\nStage 1-  Idealize. This is the part where she love bombs you: she verbally praises you, gets dressed up for you and does all the housework, tells you how great you are and how much she loves you, etc. It feels like she means it because, in that moment, she mostly does. Once everything starts to feel nice and comfortable again, we move onto:\n\nStage 2- Devalue. This is the part where she starts taking you for granted again. She starts thinking about the fact that she settled for you and all the ways she finds you lacking and/or feels she deserves better. It shows through her behavior. She slows down on the chores, stops making the effort to look nice and cook for you, her bad attitude starts coming back, etc, which brings us to:\n\nStage 3- Discard. This doesn't always mean breaking up or ghosting, though that's often the result. In your case, this is the part where she just stops doing everything you guys agreed on and withdraws affection and praise. Also in your specific case, it's possible to skip this stage and go straight to the next IF you are confronting her behavior while she's still in stage 2. If that happens, she'll go directly to stage 4, then rinse and repeat. If you don't confront her in stage 2, you get more of what happened on your honeymoon (that's a strong example of stage 3 behavior). Either way, a confrontation at any point will lead to:\n\nStage 4- Hoovering. This is the part where she begs and pleads and promises. She'll say everything you ever wanted to hear and then some, she'll agree to anything and everything you ask for, and she'll mean it all sooooo much. If you let her suck you back in, the whole cycle resets to Stage 1. She'll be very convincing and sincere and emotional, and I need you to understand that the only thing she's crying for in that moment is herself. She does not want to lose the lifestyle you provide her, full stop. \n\nI don't think marriage counseling is going to be helpful in this. It will only help her learn how to manipulate you better. If you're inclined, there's a lot of good information out there about narcissistic traits and behavior, and it might be very helpful to you in making a decision.\n\nGood luck, and speaking as someone who divorced a narcissist, I'm so very sorry this has happened to you.\n\nEdit: spelling",

                    "body": "Sir this is a difficult situation within which you find yourself. I would offer a thought or two.\n\nGrowing up I had an alcoholic for a stepfather from age 3 until age 13. Due to this we (he, my mom, & I) moved at least every year, and sometimes twice a year. Whether it was to a different part of town, across the state, or to other distant states.\n\nWhenever this happened, it was the result of a standard cycle. The cycle was 1)Drink to excess, 2)Do stupid things, say stupid things, or both, 3)Promise fervently that things would change, he would get better, and HE SWORE HE WOULD NOT DRINK AGAIN, 4)Things would ease up, 5)We would move because OF COURSE HE WOULDN'T DRINK HERE AT THE NEW LOCATION AS HIS FRIENDS WERE GONE AND IT'S A NEW PLACE, and finally 6)Things would settle down even more.\n\nHe would be loving, safe, attentive, consistent on his job, not steal our family savings, not take my meagre child level savings, and so on. Twice though during the 10 years he would not even stick to the usual pattern, but would just have taken our car, and left to the other side of the state, or a different state, so we went from 2) right to 5)/6).\n\nThen once settled down more, something would flip a switch, or irritate him, or create too much pressure, or whatever the flavor-of-the-time excuse may be. And off we would go, through the 6-step process.\n\nWhenever he was at home & drunk, he would speak about stuff, which fit what his actions displayed. This truly was the opposite of his promises given via his 'word.' When he was sober, he swore that his drunk words were not true, just drunken mental meanderings. The problem was that his consistent actions fit the drunken verbal musings. As his promises did not last long, whatsoever.\n\nThis is all to say, that I believe that your wife was truthful when she was drunk. It is only after sobering up she tried to fix things, but notice that her fixing was not a true turnaround from a genuine epiphany. The dedication to fixing things was insincere at best. And like most addicts - I am not saying she's an addict, just that the patterns are eerily similar - she will promise that she will NOT DO IT AGAIN nor did SHE MEAN IT AT ALL.\n\nI think you are struggling with the wool over your eyes. As you do not want to fully believe that the bad things are true. So you are trying to explain away and excuse the bad things, so you do not have to recognize their true existence, and thereby having to embrace the problems.\n\nAs your belief system allows, be brutally honest with your assessment of her, and stop excusing bad conduct, look out for your heart as I do not think she has your best interest in mind.\n\nBest wishes & kind regards.",

It sounds like a very difficult situation, and it's understandable that you feel hurt and confused. Here are a few suggestions on how to handle this situation:\n\n1. Give yourself time and space: Take some time to process your emotions and give yourself space to heal. It's important to allow yourself to feel upset and disappointed, but also try to focus on self-care and engaging in activities that bring you joy.\n\n2. Communicate with your wife: Once you both have had some time to calm down, have an open and honest conversation with your wife about what happened. It's important to express how her behavior affected you and for her to understand the impact of her words on your relationship.\n\n3. Seek couples therapy: Consider seeking the help of a professional couples therapist who can provide guidance and facilitate communication between you and your wife. A therapist can help you both work through any underlying issues and communicate more effectively in the future.\n\n4. Reflect on your relationship: Use this experience as an opportunity to reflect on your relationship. Take into consideration not only this incident, but also the positive aspects and memories you have shared. Assess whether this is an isolated incident or if there are deeper issues that need to be addressed.\n\n5. Reevaluate your expectations: It's important to reaffirm your own self-worth and not let this one incident define your entire relationship. Remember that people make mistakes and that relationships require effort, understanding, and forgiveness. Consider what steps you both can take to rebuild trust and move forward.\n\nRemember, every relationship has its challenges, and it's how you both handle them that will ultimately determine the outcome. Seek support, communicate openly, and be willing to work on the issues to rebuild your relationship.",

That wasn't the real me. I said those things because of the alcohol, and I was mortified and deeply ashamed. I had NO recollection whatsoever of any of that. If drunk me is capable of becoming a terrible person, that means I can never get that drunk again.\n\n\"Sober thoughts become drunk words\" or whatever isn't always true. Maybe she really does love you and was just talking nonsense because the \"alcohol demon\" overtook her for a time.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong of course, but you guys just got married and she clearly loves you if she married you. Marriage is not to be taken lightly and is worth fighting for. At least go to couples' therapy - it's too early to give up. Try to find it in your heart to forgive her, if she's sincerely remorseful. This doesn't diminish how horribly she treated you, and what she did has real consequences, drunk or not. She needs to take responsibility for her words and behavior. But she wasn't in her right mind. If sober her is saying she loves you and wants to repair the relationship, believe her and give her that chance. If it still doesn't work out, at least you can say you tried.",

A marriage is a true commitment and the question within every couple is, is it worth a divorce?\n\nWhat you described at the beginning, how you couldn\u2019t believe you\u2019d found someone so perfect for you etc. that\u2019s how I feel about my husband. I am 100% his type on paper, he\u2019s not really my type on paper but I don\u2019t have a type. Anywho- my husband was my best friend and we fell deeply in love with each other and still are to this day. I cannot imagine ever saying anything negative about my husband, even when drunk. If anything, when I\u2019m drunk I\u2019m even MORE obsessed with him and can\u2019t stop talking about how amazing he is! He owns a couple of companies and like your wife, I organise our life basically, am financially looked after and am a SAHM. I look after our baby, take care of all the housework and cook and clean every single day, breakfast lunch dinner. I\u2019m not trying to show off or make you feel bad- but it\u2019s not normal to act that way and say the things she said, drunk or not, unless she truly felt that way. \n\nMy best advice to begin with would be couples counselling, or maybe speak to her mum since that\u2019s who she confided in? Like you say, communication is key. I totally understand how shit that must have felt for you, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.

We were on holiday with my best friend and her bf, and he said some downright nasty things to me when he had been drinking one night. I was numb for the rest of the holiday and didn't want to bring it up while we were sharing a small apartment with friends, but as soon as we got home, I told him I didn't know if I loved him anymore and I moved out to my mum's house. \n\nFor us, the issue was his drinking. He has social anxiety and he felt the need to drink in social situations. He then felt resentful/insecure that I am more socially confident than he is and made 'jokes' about me in poor taste. \n\nAfter staying with my mum for a couple of weeks, the hurt had faded and I missed my partner. We started dating again, we moved back in together, and we started going to couple's counselling. That was the single most important thing for our relationship. \n\nCovid then hit and put a stop to any opportunities to drink/socialise, which I think was very good for my partner. I also became disabled by Covid and he stepped up and was an amazing support for me. We actually ended up having a baby soon after which again means we have cut down on drinking. There has been one incident where he slipped up and got embarrassingly drunk, but he was very remorseful and I forgave him. \n\nAll this to say, I know it hurts when your partner betrays you like that. I know how embarrassing it is (I didn't tell many people about our temporary break up). Things can be fixed going forwards, but only if your partner is willing to put the work in (i.e. counselling), identify and avoid the triggers for that situation, show their remorse and step up to be a better partner. Only you and her know whether this is possible, and I would only give it a limited period to find out (I decided to reassess our relationship after 3 months and decide then whether or not to commit to our future). Good luck.",

                    "body": "There is no further communication you can do to resolve this.\n\nThe \"good girl/good boy\" act is what I call it when somebody fucked up their source of supply or money, and they do some grand gesture to make you trust them again. It is a deliberately deceptive maneuver they then taper off back to normalcy. The people who implement these acts are used to love bombing to ensnare a person they will instrumentalize, so what they're doing is a deliberate attempt at manipulation.\n\nThe truth of this matter is that nobody would utter those words while drunk unless they were true. It's not the kind of thing that wells up randomly into the mind of a person. It also doesn't surprise me that it happened AFTER the legal binding - this is when people with personality disorders are in their comfort zone. They have essentially captured their prey, and are ready to devour it (ie, treat the source of narcissistic supply or resources like absolute dogshit).\n\nThe other truth of this matter is that you deserve a life and marriage with someone who would not, did not, and will not say these things about you.\n\nYour vows do not stand with a woman who said her true feelings out to the whole world like a drunken idiot on what's supposed to be a celebration of your future together. She literally just proclaimed to everybody at that venue that her vows were a fucking lie. Nothing she did is acceptable, and you shouldn't be forced to cope with the pain of this. She did not marry you in good faith, and you do not have to subject yourself to this.\n\nI highly recommend contacting an attorney as soon as possible to understand your options and limit any potential financial impact of divorce. You should not be paying alimony on somebody who did this to you.\n\nOne last thing which I say not to scare you, but to be as blunt as I can possibly be about the ramifications if you don't permit yourself to see her for what she truly is: if she feels this way about you now, she will cheat on you in the future. If she still has a \"one that got away,\" that means there's a man she would pick over you. If you're not her type, that means when her type shows up, she'll consider her options. She doesn't work and she has ALL the power financially - if she divorces, she can take your money, and have her new shitty man too. Your initial instinct to immediately leave her is valid. That is your true feeling, and her begging and pleading is just going to happen when you try to leave. Her begging, pleading, and assurance means as little as all her other words did - she uses words as tools to get you back into line, not as communication tools.\n\nPlease do not leave yourself vulnerable and exposed to a wolf in sheep's clothing. I can tell from the detail-orientation of your post and other elements of it that you are a conscientious, loving, and capable man. You deserve somebody who truly does see you as their type. Any indication otherwise is a slap in the face that you should NEVER have to endure.\n\nUnderstanding the BPD and NPD cycles in relationships may help you form a better grasp of what will be in your future with her. I can't diagnose her, but I can certainly see that deceit is a core foundation of personality, and she is following a pattern of idealization and discard. There are plenty of subreddits about both of these topics, and perusing some of these may put more into perspective.\n\nOne last note on one of the seemingly pettier matters which still represents a large component of her taking advantage of you: with you working 60-70 hours a week and her not working at all, she should be doing the housework and not putting up a fuss when you ask her to do more of it, which I can tell from the post you likely ask in a very reasonable way. It's one thing if it slipped her mind, r she wasn't feeling well or something. But her being combative about it is putting you into a situation where you're not on a team, you're with an antagonist who's angry that she isn't getting it all from you. Not okay.\n\nAnd you know she's lying about saying her friends like you more than her. You knowing she's still lying to you is enough to know she's not the one. Fuck what anyone thinks about a marriage ending soon - none of those people have to deal with the pain that you're in and the financial turmoil this could cause you. You have to do what's right for you, regardless of what anybody else thinks of it.",

Now, in these 8 years we've both done and said things we regret, however, no matter how bad things have gotten between us, never has she said she \"settled\" for me. That I was an embarrassment.

If she (or I) ever put us through something like that, it would be over. Being drunk is no excuse, these thoughts are coming from somewhere. Also, to completely disregard how much the entire trip was that she canceled just because things arent going her way, without consulting you shows another side of her. Lastly, her already going back on her word about being helpful around the house is just the cherry on top. \nLove yourself, so many people would love a life you can provide, she's not grateful & she's not it.",

I know it's silly sometimes to look for fairness, but it sounds like you're downplaying for yourself how unfair this is to you.\n\nNext, I agree with the other commentors who have said that it doesn't sound like she actually cares much for you unfortunately, friend; perhaps it's the idea of being married, of being financially supported, or a thousand other things, but that again doesn't sound like what you signed up for. My suggestion for you would be therapy or other self-evaluation, even one half of a couple's marriage book to really evaluate what you want out of a relationship and a life with someone, then compare it honestly to what you're living today.\n\nFinally, it strikes me a horrible idea that she is your main confidant on this one - she can talk to her mother all day, but that doesn't necessarily give you any form of objective or supportive or plain-in-your-corner input. Since you took the time and energy (and likely emotionally wrung yourself out a little) in writing all this out, can you go to your closest friend or relative, ideally in person, and let them read this as a conversation starter? I know it's embarassing, but honestly, there's no shame in being tricked, which is what it sounds like here - there's shame in lying, there's shame in *tricking*, there's shame in taking a vow and going back on your word. And at this point, stranger, sounds like you need all the folks in your corner you can get (plus this lovely collective of internet strangers and comments). \n\nGood luck, OP, and maybe keep an eye on the duration of this marriage - IANAL by any stretch, I know certain jurisdictions have annulment or no fault divorce, and not to say that that is your immediate next step, but don't let time close doors for you that someone else may be watching too.",

That is awful. Even if she truly did not meant it, it ruins your only honeymoon memories. My mother went with me overseas when I married my wife. She wanted to be at the wedding. But she semi ruined the honeymoon by calling me while drunk and talking crap about my wife. Which then made my wife kinda not cheery. Obviously lol.   \n\n\nI hope things with your wife work out, whatever is going on needs therapy for sure. And if you still feel hurt by what happened or the random outbursts in mood, I'd probably get some help too. More so if you find out it is mentally related as you may need help to deal with it. Best of luck to you and your wife.",

                    "body": "This is one of the saddest posts I\u2019ve ever read on Reddit.  At first, I thought it was weird you cared that she got drunk on your honeymoon.  Thought it sounded controlling but after reading through it, I assume you\u2019ve seen something in the past which made you not want her to get drunk.   \n\nI totally agree with post I\u2019m replying under..  Been the drinker where things would  slip out ti friends about my concerns in the man I married.  I didn\u2019t feel I settled, but he had behaviors that were hurtful and confusing so this is a different scenario. \n\nYour wife needs help.  She might have an alcohol issue even if she doesn\u2019t drink much. Some people seem to change even after a few drinks.\n\nI don\u2019t know why people let their mask fall once married.   You might consider a separation for a few months while she gets help.  If she really feels she settled, then a therapist will help her address them issues and she may chose divorce.  Suggest you get therapy too as you have been treated poorly.   You missed sone red flags and may have been in denial.  You might try couples therapy if you want to save the marriage although this is hard to overcome. She may have chose lifestyle over choosing you. \n\nIt\u2019s weird after 4 years you don\u2019t know who this guy is.  I\u2019ve been working thru a trauma bond and learned that I must look for someone who is consistent  and steady.   I was conditioned over my 25 years with a narcissist to live my life on eggshells trying ti avoid his wrath.  I learned that I was used to living life on a roller coaster.  This isn\u2019t healthy.  Healthy relationships are more like a merry go round. It\u2019s not as thrilling as a roller coaster and so the merry go round seems boring. I\u2019ve been warned by my therapist that finding a healthy relationship might make me question if I\u2019m settling as the merry-go-round seems boring\u2026 like I\u2019m settling. Ultimately though, this is what I need to find true happiness.  I share this bc many times \u201cthe one who got away\u201d was a life on a roller coaster.  I suggest you drive into that relationship she had with this other guy to determine what happened.  If he treated her poorly, this might explain her confusion. No doubt the reality of being married causes people to question their decisions at times.  This is the only explanation I can think of that might make the marriage salvageable.   \n\nDon\u2019t tell her what you are looking for when asking questions about their relationship abd breakup.  Look for trauma, any type of abuse, abd inconsistent behavior on her previous partners part.  Perhaps he treated her inconsistently like love bombing and then ghosting.  Doesn\u2019t mean he was a N, like in my case, but he could have had avoidant attachment style or possibly didn\u2019t  card as much for her.   For some reason we always try to get back the one who doesn\u2019t love us back. This could be why she felt he got away.  If you do see signs of this, then bring it up in couples counselling as it\u2019s best to have an expert there to help navigate this tricky bond bc you don\u2019t want to make assumptions.  As I says before, I suspect you lived in denial and missed red flags, perhaps justifying her behavior the past 4 years.  You want to be careful you don\u2019t do this now.  \n\nI\u2019m so sorry that you are going through this after such happiness.  My heart breaks for you. I hope something I says adds clarify or a direction for you to go. I\u2019ve been working on myself a lot during the last 2 years thru therapy and various other methods.  Suggest you be careful in sharing too much with family and friends.  The kids others get involved, sides will be taken, friends lost, and more problems created between you. Suggest you choose 1 or 2 friends/family to talk to but understand that they will never support a reconciliation after learning the truth.  Feel free to DM me if you need a random person to unload your thoughts and feelings.  I\u2019m a 55 year old female who has been thru a lot but in a good place.  Willing to help anyway I can as I wouldn\u2019t be here without the support I\u2019ve received. Believe in paying it forward.  \n\nI know you world has crashed down around you right now but keep in mind that things will def better.   It\u2019s better to know all this now than 10 years down the road when you have kids.  I believe these type things make us stronger if we work on our issues .  You will need to learn to trust  again and repair your damaged self esteem.   She\u2019s said  some mean things to you that make you question your reality.  Look at them seriously as it may or may not be the truth.  \n\nOne last thing\u2026 I attended a really amazing retreat in Sedona that really helped me heal. It has sone \u201cwoo woo\u201d attached as all the life coaches all have gifts that they use intuitively.  It change my life.  Would  be happy to disclose the name abd how it worked for anyone interested.   It\u2019d be helpful for those feeling lost and overwhelmed, grieving, going thru divorce, or list of self esteem.",

Was it the stuff about loneliness vs love I quoted out of the newspaper?\n\nSecond, did you find my comment coherent or flowing?\n\nI'm working on that, and i don't understand what stage I'm at in improving that.\n\nSomeone I admire told me that they have a skill which they practice almost everyday with almost everything.\n\nIt's the skill of doing things at the right pace such that they don't feel tired, and the output is maximised. They said they learned it during the time they spent in water by pushing their hand across the water and watching it glide along in it and feeling it's resistance.\n\nThey wrote such clear answers and easy to read answers that i fell in love with them, and i suspect that they using that skill to spread out the information they want to communicate in the answer, such that it was easy and very natural to grasp.\n\nSo once again, sorry to repeat, what is the state of coherency or flow in my comment if any?\n\nIt would helpful to understand what changes to make so as to reach my goal of getting fluid reading answers.\n\nYou don't have to answer if this was too long or too weird.

It took a year but he was arrested and served a 5 year prison sentence.\nThrough my own path of trying to heal from what happened to me, and with the help of a therapist I have made an attempt at trying to forgive him for what he did. I was torturing myself with my hate and rage and forgiveness was the only way I could see a way out of a mindset that would have only kept on hurting me.\nRecently I've been made aware that he is in a program, is sober, and is now trying to make amends for his lengthy list of transgressions.\nHe wants to meet up with me to extend an in person apology.\nAll of this correspondence has been through a mutual friend of ours who has kept tabs on him for me through the years.\n\nI guess what I'm asking for advice about is, am I completely misguided? Am I being incredibly stupid in even considering letting this happen? Is this a bad fuckin idea? I think that hearing an apology would serve me well. It might help me finally close the book so to speak. Also, being willing to allow him to give the apology feels like it would be the right thing to do. I'm not saying I'm a fuckin saint or anything but I feel like if he's actually trying to better himself that maybe helping him would help me.\n\nAny and all thoughts are welcome. Part of me still hates him for what he did and other parts just feel bad for him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all of your replies. Honestly, the response I've gotten for this is overwhelming and I thank all of you for taking the time to give your opinions and advice.\n\nI do feel like I need to clarify something. This is not a domestic violence situation. I'm a cis het male that ran afoul of a dangerous individual. That being said, all the replies regarding domestic violence are all valid and I hope anyone who read those replies and needed to hear that advice took them to heart. \n\n\n\n\nEDIT 2: I'm sorry for not replying to everyone but I promise I am reading everything and internalizing all of your thoughts. \n\n\n\nEDIT 3: I'd like to thank everyone again for all the kind words and useful advice that has been given. \n\nI've contacted the Victim's Services advocate in the county where this took place and asked about any restorative justice programs they may have. She said that while they don't have a program like that it's only because they've never done this before. However, she's going to talk to the DA and prosecutor of that case and see if they can facilitate a meeting. She suggested that the prosecutor, herself, and the main investigator of the case attend as well to have a law enforcement presence.\n\nIf he's truly on the straight and narrow then he should have no problem attending a meeting with them waiting in the wings.",

It has a great chance of being deeply triggering and may reignite feelings that could be quite a setback for you in your healing.\n\nYou can 'forgive' him and release this in your own way without being exposed to his presence and that's my strong suggestion. There's something about being physically near someone who caused you bodily harm. It's very different than letters, or even a video. \n\nYour heart is in the right place by looking for the 'right thing' and wanting to help both of you move forward. I would never call you or your idea 'stupid' but it might be optimistic and misguided. Can you discuss this with your therapist?\n\nMy feeling is this is not a safe idea, not in any way. I wouldn't recommend maintaining any kind of contact with this individual and your mutual friend should know that sharing any information about you is off-limits. Violent criminals do re-offend, it's a fact. You don't owe this man a thing. Whatever you do must first and foremost be safe and healing for you.",

Men who try to kill you or who abuse women do not mean it when they say I love you.\n\nI've done lots of therapy and I get 'blamed' for 'choosing violent men/staying in a relationship/returning to a violent relationship '. The kind of letter you have and the contact with mutual friend is how I've been drawn back into abusive relationships.  Men promise to change. Few do.\n\nYou've done therapy.  He's done 12 Step Programs which are valuable but I'm not a fan of that 'Make Amends' step and a few others because he will have a Sponsor helping him who might not have medical training. Loved experience and the sponsorship in 12 Step Programs is great for addicts helping addicts but my concern is this meeting might not help you.\n\nYou've already given him the gift of forgiveness.  What do you get out of that meeting him? \n\nYou say you still hate him, a part of you does. I think hate is a valid reaction to abuse you suffered and it's also the flip side of love.  I'd be concerned he might be able to flip the coin back to love.\n\nHave you talked to your therapist about this?  Maybe look online about trauma bonding.  I hate the term 'abusove love' those men abuse and it's not love.  In active addiction where there's a painful withdrawal a person becomes addicted to the substance that removes withdrawal pains.  Violent partners put that pain there and then say I love you and pain recedes.  Meeting a man who broke your heart because a relationship grew apart after a few years ago wants to say sorry is one thing you could be meeting a violent Psychopath Stalker that tried to kill you once, is still a bit obsessed and staying in touch and will do that again.\n\nIf I were in your shoes I'd consider this a life and death situation.  I'd choose no contact and I'd advise Police he was out and he had requested contact.  I'd never see him again.",

That needs to be abundantly clear.\n\nWith that in mind\u2026I suggest focusing on what this means for the future.\n\nA meeting is largely symbolic.  He can apologize from afar.  You can forgive without seeing him.  But doing it in person, the visceral nature of it is harder\u2026but also, the effects are more powerful internally.  That\u2019s why he\u2019s asking for it.

Hopefully thinking through all the options would allow you to make a decision that you feel good about long term. Making a pros and cons list can help you see what all the variables are on both sides. Once you identify the most important factors, something I do is try to reach a place where I think \"I'd rather live with This set of problems than That set of problems.\" Then even if it turns out that I've made a decision that led to problems, remembering how carefully I thought it through has kept me from blaming myself for what I was going through.\n\nThen if you make the decision to see him or read his apology, I would consider what support you'll need.

Up to you if you want to indulge them.\n\n\n\nI know some people making their amends are truly trying to right wrongs, but pessimistic me wouldn't waste your time.",

But really considering that this actually happened and the amount of pain you\u2019re in\u2026 i can easily see it being healing.\n\nWhen shit happens to us and we remove people from our lives, we all can build this sort of mystery in our minds of what they are doing and who they are. It can be torturous. Just even wondering. \n\nIt\u2019s weird to say, but someone who did something awful to us can have such an effect that they are on our minds as much as any healthy relationship we have. Allowing ourselves to actually know the person later, hear them speak\u2026 especially an apology could give us whatever moment we have built in our heads that we may need. Whether it\u2019s to flip shit and never forgive them, or to stand there stoic and strong and basically unmoved\u2026 or to even forgive them. \n\nWhen the pain is that great, the remedy usually involves some pain or risk. We don\u2019t usually notice because they knock us out for surgeries and such\u2026 but most of the time the remedy involves a little more pain. \n\nThat being said, still be smart. It\u2019s definitely a gamble. Perhaps having a mediator or therapist on hand for written apologies or in person would be best. Such as, if you decide to go in person, have a professional there to go in that room first to talk with him and find out his mental state and if it may be riskier than worthwhile. \n\nIt\u2019s a damn tough question.

I have a  friend whose brother was murdered in a really awful way (not that there is a good way to be murdered but this way was especially hard for her to live with as it involved knowing that her brother suffered before he died). She said that the lack of remorse from the people who did it added layers of pain on top of the pain for her and her family.  I also know someone in our community who murdered someone, went to prison, came to terms w what he had done and, thru the restorative process, met w and apologized to his victim\u2019s daughter. It brought them both healing that one would never think possible and it led to some really awesome changes in our community. This man spent his remaining days serving inmates, victims of violent crimes, and their families and the daughter of the man he killed attended, spoke at and cried at his funeral. It is hard to understand and yet\u2026\n\nI am not suggesting your attacker is like this man or that you should feel compelled to meet w him. If, however, you feel that there may be something healing in it for you don\u2019t necessarily dismiss it because it seems implausible.  \n\nFollow your heart. Do what you need to do in order to protect yourself and your healing process\u2026.but don\u2019t rule out the unconventional because it seems counterintuitive. Also don\u2019t let yourself get pressured into something you don\u2019t want to do. \n\nI am sorry for the pain you have been through and wish you all the best for your healing journey.",

So if you don't want to hear from me, fair enough, don't read the rest. \n\nForgiving others is extremely important for moving on with our lives. It keeps us from building up resentment or hatred that could potentially affect other aspects of our lives. So I would say, if you can find it in yourself to do so, yes, forgive this person. I see in your post that you feel bad for him, this is a good sign. It shows that you at least have a desire for him to be a changed man, and to be better. When we don't forgive people, we are only keeping them within the category of their faults, and barring the possibility of improvement. Both parties need to be able to forward without being defined by one bad incident.\n\nHOWEVER! Forgiveness does not equal trust. We need to be prudent in these matters. This man assaulted you, and you only have his word to go by. If you're leaning towards a physical gesture of forgiveness, as I've seen others suggest, an exchange of letters would suffice. If you are seriously considering meeting him in person, be cautious. Meet in a public place, bring a couple friends to keep an eye on you, and it wouldn't hurt to have an exit strategy. Even assuming an in person exchange goes well, recognize boundaries, so if he wants to meet again, calmly say that you both should move on, and that the past is behind you both.",

I actually just got out of the financial hole after 5 years. My credit is barely starting to recover. The emotional, physical and sexual scars are mostly healed but it took a lot of therapy (and I\u2019m back in therapy actually due to a recent relationship rekindling the pain of my marriage due to similar behaviors by my partner).\n\nI was consumed with anger. I used to wish that I had just let my ex wife end herself one of the times she threatened to (it was a manipulation tactic) because the pain and humiliation she caused me still haunts me (and I lost a good 90% of my friends because despite being a victim of DV somehow as a man I was still blamed by people)\n\nThen one day I decided she wasn\u2019t with the pain anymore. I haven\u2019t even forgiven her for what she did I just chose to move on. It was an active decision to \u201clet it go\u201d so to speak. And my life has been so much better.\n\n\nYou don\u2019t HAVE to forgive anyone. You don\u2019t HAVE to let someone do something to ease THEIR conscience.\n\nThey made the decisions to almost kill you. They did what they did. YOU suffered. So while someone may say \u201cyou should forgive them because it will help you\u201d or \u201cit will bring you peace\u201d fuck thems they didn\u2019t live your life and if you truly need to have them apologize for YOU to move on then great. Let them.\n\nBut don\u2019t let ANYONE tell you that YOU need to do anything for the person that harmed you. They can live with their own guilt forever. Because it will pale in comparison to the pain they caused you.\n\nThey always say \u201cyou can forgive but don\u2019t forget\u201d but one thing I learned is you can forgive and forget\u2026you can forgive and not forget\u2026OR you can not forgive and just forget about them because they didn\u2019t give a shit about how their actions would impact you\u2026so why are they even worth remembering? Why is the impact of their actions on themselves something YOU need to deal with?\n\n\nThis ain\u2019t something WE can decide for YOU op\u2026but I wanted to offer a perspective most won\u2019t but my therapist agreed with at one point (she even laughed because she didn\u2019t think of it but thought it wasn\u2019t a bad thing because I was able to move forward and grow as a person)",

Long story short, I beat a man close to death over a stupid altercation for a parking spot (other person got physical first, I just got harder, stronger, faster). \n\nI ended up going to anger management where they teach you you will never be cured of having such a low temperament, you just need to be able to cope with it and that typically means I need to recognize the situation before it gets heated and remove myself from it. Part of the therapy was to make amends with this guy that I've changed the life of forever. Similar to what op is going to do now. The meeting was as awkward as expected. Did he really accept my apology or was he just saying ok to end the encounter, I don't know. \n\nAt the end of the day I live remembering that day always and I wish it didn't happen but it did. Both of us came out learning you can't really assume or know what other people are going through and you cannot control others, all you can do is control yourself and with that control you may be able to steer the situation into a more amicable solution for everyone. I've never had another episode since this one. \n\nI gather in your case the other guy was drunk and looking to pick a fight with anyone and you just so happened to be the lucky person to be there at that time and place. So different for sure in that detail. The man who assaulted you will not be the same man you meet and receive the apology from. He might claim he was very wasted and do not remember the events, so he's apologizing for his actions while drunk, but really the root cause is he should not have been drinking irresponsibly in the first place, ever. If he has gone to therapy as well, he might have made changes to prevent that in his life as well. I hope your meeting goes well and you're satisfied with the outcome.

BUT that doesn\u2019t always happen. It depends on the guidance they receive from sponsors and fellows. \n\n2) An amends should not be asking for forgiveness. Forgiveness actually has nothing to do with the amends process. By owning my past actions I am seeing the past with honesty and admit to myself that the stories I\u2019ve told myself to justify things are false. The response/reaction or opinions the recipient actually has nothing to do with the process. As mentioned indirect amends can work better times. \n\n3) Be aware of your expectations of the amends. This is a very tricky part that I had to unpack when someone very close to me made an amends and I had strong negative feeling afterwards. I was expecting their amends to let me know they really understood how they harmed me and could empathize with the pain it causes. Again this was someone very close to me and neither of those expectations were met. I worked though my feeling on that and came to realize that they will never be able to understand at a level to satisfy my desire to be understood. It\u2019s not humanly possible for them to feel and know MY pain from their actions. \n\nIn what you have shared about your situation, If I were in your shoes I would opt for an indirect amends letter sent to my therapist. Let your therapist take a first read to make sure it\u2019s \u201cclean\u201d and the person is not trying to blame shift. Then you also have the support of a professional to go through the letter in a session. You are in control of how or if you want to receive the amends    \n\nLastly it sounds like you have done a lot of work to realize that forgiveness has nothing to do with the other person. Forgiveness is you choosing to no longer hold onto those feelings of hate and rage that tear apart a soul after major trauma. It is not forgetting the past nor is it necessarily repairing relationships. It\u2019s simply making the choice to stop the internal turmoil by letting go of those negative feeling towards the person.",

Those who matter will see you as stronger and braver for doing so, and their opinion of you is only second to ur opinion of yourself. Hell sometimes it comes first.\n\n\n\nAs for communicating and seeing them in person. Pain and fear can be healthy things they let you know you are alive and try to keep you alive. But if left to fester it can grow into the worst kind of problem. Dealing with it sooner is better than dealing with it later. But it's a balancing act confronting it to soon can do more bad than good. So I think you should ask your self if you really think this person has changed for the better and if they are deserving of your forgivness. If you are ready to give forgivness is a hard question to answer. But sometimes you must first give a gift in order to receive one.",

There\u2019s a young guy called Jacob Dunne who met with his victims parents and it completely turned his life around as well as helping his victims parents, and they\u2019re still in touch. He know supports others in rehabilitating. It can be incredibly healing for the victims whilst also rehabilitating for the criminal and helps them move forwards positively. But it\u2019s complex so there\u2019s a process and usually people to facilitate the conversation, if people choose to do a face to face meeting (which they don\u2019t have to). So it might be worth googling restorative justice and reaching out to organisations for advice before responding to the request. Ultimately you need to only proceed if you have support and feel able to. It could be amazing for both of you, but I have no doubt it will also bring a lot of emotions up for you and you need to look after your needs first. I wish you well as you process the decision. \n\nhttps://restorativejustice.org.uk/what-restorative-justice \n\nhttps://www.theforgivenessproject.com/stories-library/jacob-dunne/",

I won't go into too much detail but I was sexually abused when I was younger age 7 to 14 by a man I trusted. For close to 20 years I hated this man, he was the reason I missed out on so much of my life, afraid to go out, afraid to be alone around Any male, I lost out on school functions, dating, parties, jobs. Until one day I decided he doesn't get to control my life anymore, I made the decision to forgive him for my own mental health. I still see and talk to him sometimes, one day, he actually told me he was sorry, he didn't exactly say why he was sorry but we both knew what he meant, I had waited so many years to hear him say that, but it didn't feel the way I thought it would, I know he meant it and I know he is sorry but it didn't change anything I had gone through. I hope you can forgive that man, but not for him, going through life with that kind of hate can and will change you. I am so sorry for what happened to you, and I truly hope that man has changed his life. Even if you don't tell him that you forgive him, I hope one day in your heart you can let it go. Very different traumas but from one survivor to another I wish you the best. And remember forgiveness does not mean forgetting,  just letting go of the anger and hate. \ud83d\udc9c",

Just like when you love someone, you choose that over and over again.\n\nI would say find terms that you both can agree on.

Could she have told him? Well, she wasn't much of a friend, I later figured out; the headlights in a pickup behind mine went on as soon as I started my car, the driver followed me and tried to push me off the road in a secluded area, so . . . yeah, it seems likely. I did some pretty dramatic driving I couldn't have imagined I'd do, and I got away only because I had a lot of luck. I don't know if he was the person who cut my phone line way back when, before people had cell phones--that was a scary night. I can't prove he was the person who left unwanted \"gifts\" (like a massive freeway sign) on my doorstep. (The Department of Highways picked it up the next day.) I DO know that he was the perv who called me all the time and whispered sadistic things he wanted to do in the days before Caller ID and cell phones--I heard him say that sort of thing once, and after that hung up as soon as I heard whispering. He certainly was the person who wrote me that he was planning to come and see me while I was living abroad for a year. Maybe he did. I moved the next day. I was terrified. I cut contact with all of my friends--I didn't know who had given him my address. Later when I'd returned he called me to say that he knew I was looking for a place to live (and I was; how the HELL did he know? a PI?) and he was going into the local hospital for treatment for cancer and would be there for months and I could move into his apartment while he was gone. Uh, no thanks, I'm not a complete and utter moron and that's not how cancer treatment works. This was all decades ago. The police are some better about stalkers now. The phone company let me change my phone number every time he found it out. \n\nHe called me for the last time using his REAL voice, not whispering about wanting to tie me up, and said he was doing AA and wanted to apologize to me, in person. With a lot of hesitation, I agreed to meet in a well-populated coffee shop and told my closest friend where I was going to be and that she should call in a kidnapping if I didn't call her within an hour of the time I'd agreed to meet him.\n\nHe was there and was clearly tortured by the shame of the apology he made to do his amends. He was in tears and seemed genuinely agonized. Good, I thought. He told me he would never call me or contact me again. (\"We'll see about that,\" I thought.) He asked me if I could forgive him. I thought \"If I say yes will he leave me alone?\" and said \"Yes.\" I can't say I meant it, and I don't mean it to this day. I wish I could forgive him, but . . . I'm married, I have a good life, but I am just a lot less trusting and open than I was. Forty-five years have gone by and I still jump when the phone rings; you wouldn't think you could get PTDS just from stalking (and never knowing if you're being observed, any time you leave home, but you can.

Make of that what you will. There's no guarantee that the man who nearly killed you will be sincere about an apology, and if I had to do it again I'd hire an off-duty policeman to sit in the next booth in the cafe.

And, that means they still have that same personality and at least with my family, operating like a user.  And making amends? It was just one more opportunity for them to use me to get what they wanted--absolution while shifting the blame away from their choices and toward addiction.  No, YOU made those choices and now YOU want me to continue to cater to you.  I'm sorry, but I'd say fuck that guy, you owe him NOTHING.  It might be better for him anyway to know there are somethings you can't just forgive, that maybe he needs to sit with the consequences of his actions for a bit, and if that makes him uncomfortable, too damn bad.

If he wants to write a letter. . . maybe have him address it to your therapist and have that person review it- or just say \"no thank you,\" you are not obliged to help him heal, which is why he is asking you to meet with him.

If you feel uncomfortable with putting yourself in a position where you have to listen to his apology and politely accept it, know that it would be completely fine for you to decline. There's not actually a right answer here for whether or not you should hear him out, as only you can ultimately decide that.\n\nThat all said, as you've evidently done a lot of working through your feelings, I don't really have to tell you how bad harboring anger is and how much better it is for a person to forgive someone else, even when they don't deserve it. As you state, you think it might help you, and that's exactly the point: You forgive not for their sake, but for your own. If you feel you're ready to put that philosophy into practical effect and hear this guy out, I think that would be a great thing for both of you and I don't at all think that would be crazy: I want to state again, though, that, should you choose not to do this, that would be completely ok, too.\n\nYou really have to be the judge of this for yourself, and you should make this decision without any reference to what you imagine other people may think or feel about it, because this is completely about you and what you feel (or don't feel) comfortable doing: The decision you make here should be entirely about doing what you think is right for you.",
