Shadesmar's unique characteristics are a black sun that has zero influence on the behavior of characters, you can drown in it's \" water\" most of the time, spren behave either like regular animals or like regular humans and there are no storms or stormlight so it basically removes a unique exciting part of the setting. I can force myself to \"see\" it but there is no gravitas to the fantasy and it quickly goes back to just a territory characters have to cross.",

And with inanimate objects, I know the difference in cotton or silk and how they feel to touch.

I know what it feels like to walk on stone like that, and equate that feeling to what I'm reading.\n\nIt's also very hard to describe this to others who don't have aphantasia.

She\u2019s also emotionally reserved, leading to her bluntness and capacity for logic, but it also leads her to be extremely pragmatic and unable to empathize with people, only really sympathizing  with them.",

Most of those people weren't even death eaters; they were just regular wizards who were fine with committing atrocities. And those people didn't go away after Voldemort was defeated; they just went back to working in the government. The same happened in the Fantastic Beasts movies, when Grindelwald was defeated. All the wizards who were about to help him commit atrocities just kinda walk away and pretend nothing happened.\n\nIf anything, it's amazing only ~1/4 of their students end up in the \"evil\" house.

It avoids giving lengthy exposition every time something new is introduced, and let's the reader draw conclusions and make connections. Imo it actually makes it a whole lot easier to remember everything about the world.\n\nLike if you had a chapter where chulls are introduced and it goes into detail about them, then the rest of the story just mentions them by name, you're less likely to remember much of the initial information. Whereas if chulls are mentioned earlier and described later, it creates more of a lasting connection in your mind because now you're remembering parts of the story where chulls were mentioned and filling in that information.\n\nLearning is a lot more effective if you learn a little, then a while later you review it and learn a little more, then later you review again.",

They are the largest and most ambitious of all the different series and while totally fine to be read standalone, can be a lot for anyone not used to his style of world building. Even just tangential knowledge of the universe from other books can help a lot since I think Sanderson tends to barrel ahead a bit more in these since there is just so much meat and plot.\n\nThe sparseness of detailed explanations of minor things is actually sort of acknowledved addressed in the second book in the series by someone who has traveled a great deal and remarks to a main character how people just accept those everyday things as axiomatic and universal, without understanding so much as even the *names* of those things. The example is axe hounds, which of course they know what an axe is but what exactly is a hound? since this world has almost no animal life that isn't arthropoid or shelled in order to survive high storms.  I won't say more because the reason for that is actually a *big* spoiler. \n\nSkyward was relatively simple world building compared to anything in the cosmere but is also good to get used to him. I would also recommend The Reckoners series of you liked Skyward. Mistborn  era 1 (The Final Empire/Mistborn, The Well of Ascension, The Hero of Ages) are a much more accessible fantasy setting IMO and the books aren't nearly as big of a read if you feel like taking a break in between.",

There is also 4th book called Lux that just takes place in the same world but is different characters (honestly it's much darker and has an ominous ambiguous ending that kinda kills the closure of the main series so read at your own risk, lol).\n\nThe basic idea is what if people started getting super powers, but they always become villains? It is very much in the vein of The Boys (don't know how much influence Sanderson got from there) but less edgy and the villains don't even try to hide their corrupt ways, they just rule their own pockets of humanity with an iron fist.",

He view is that resistance only prolongs the suffering, and the better option is to keep your head down and avoid causing more pain for the group. He can't understand why people would want to make their lives harder when it's so unlikely to lead to change. \n\n2) Lirin knows pretty much nothing about Odium and how genocidal he is, his main experience is with the fused occupation where they acted pretty similar to the light eyes who were in charge. Think it might have been stated that they were more fair than the light eyes in some situations. In his experience, there's not a noticeable difference between the humans and singers being in charge.",

And he\u2019s, again, very similar to Kaladin, in that he\u2019s a lot better at taking care of his patients than himself.

He knows Kal went through some shit, but he wants to help him by having him stop killing people and be a surgeon. Which to be fair is exactly what Kal needed. Lirin believes his son was MADE a monster by all this violence.\n\nTo make things worse, he blames himself for everything. Tien only died because he was drafted. He was only drafted because their local Lord took out petty revenge on them. He only did that because Lirin pushed back against him at every turn. If he'd just behaved and cowed tow Tien would never have died and Kal would be a world famous surgeon and never would have taken lives.\n\nKaladin KILLING someone in his surgery room just snapped something, Kal violated an ABSOLUTE and he just could not handle it. All this violence and war DID kill his son, and returned to them a monster. Kaladin isn't the only person traumatized. Remember. Lirin lost BOTH his children. In his mind, he lost one of them twice.\n\nThey both have a lot of issues, but that's part of the story. Working on healing.\n\nAlso Lirin doesn't even know who Odium is. All he knows is the Singers, and as far as he's concerned they're lighteyes, at worst. In some ways they're better than them. To him the occupation was just the same thing as Roshon taking over as their brightlord, and this time he wanted to behave and do things right, instead of spit in their faces and get his family hurt again.",

It's one thing to punish the person who stole something, it's something else entirely to punish that person's children.\n\nOn a very similar vein, we tend to believe in, or at least claim to believe in, proportional responses to misdeeds.\n\nTo make things worse, what _followed_ was directly against the mores and ideals of their culture as well.\n\nAs it stands, he was undeniably wrong to steal the spheres, but at the same time, blaming him for the death of one son and the supposed death of another is most decidedly uncalled for.\n\nNow, there _are_ ways in which he would be more culpable for those things.  If he had thrown his sons under the bus for his own actions, _that_ would have been significantly different.\n\nBut as it stands?  Both Kal and Lirin are broken, but not only are they broken in different ways, Kal's broken largely hurts _himself_, while Lirin's broken hurts Kal.\n\nBut even though that does make us judge Lirin more harshly, that doesn't change how much of what happened due to the theft is Lirin's fault.\n\nAnd if you want to extend his responsibility out from that, then Lirin's theft is responsible for the refounding of the Wind Runners.

The same goes for the judge. The judge decided to levy a penalty and then chose the penalty. Those decisions are their fault.\n\nI am only to blame for smacking someone. I am not to blame for the actions of others.\n\nAllow me to try a different analogy. There is a man who owns a gun shop. A customer comes in and says sincerely that she wants to buy a gun to go deer hunting. The owner checks, and she has no criminal record. He sells her a gun. She uses it to murder someone. I think we both agree that the store owner did nothing wrong.\n\nHowever, what if we flip the statement and the result? The woman comes in and says sincerely that she wants to buy a gun in order to murder someone. The store owner checks and finds out that she has no criminal record. He sells her the gun. She uses it to go hunting and never harms anyone. I think we both agree that the store owner did something wrong.\n\nIf the woman comes to buy the gun for hunting, goes hunting, and then uses the deer to feed the homeless, is the gun owner also morally responsible for the homeless being fed? I don't think that he is.\n\nI think that the woman is entirely responsible for her own actions and the man, his. The man is responsible only for the sale of the gun. He is not responsible for what the woman does with it. If he sells the gun knowing that she intends to hurt innocent people, then he has done wrong, even if she never follows through on her intent. He is not to blame for her actions. Only his own.",

It is trivial to show that you can arrive at wildly different answers to the same scenario.\n\nWhy did the thief steal my car? Because I owned a car. Therefore, I should not have owned a car.\n\nWhy did the thief steal my car? Because he learned how to hotwire a car on YouTube. Therefore, YouTube is responsible.\n\nWhy did the thief steal my car? Because the neighbor wasn't watching. Therefore, it's my neighbor's fault.\n\nI also believe that you arbitrarily stopped at the first question. There is no logical reason that you must stop there. We could just keep asking \"why\" and getting different answers in an endless rabbit hole that leads to the origin of the universe.\n\nHowever, humans tend to stop on anything that is actionable in the future, which can be helpful. What is far less helpful is then assigning blame to the past. It is not my fault that the thief stole my car. Even if I left my car unlocked. I should consider taking the action of locking my car in the future, but realistically, I might just wind up with a missing car and some glass fragments after the thief broke my window. Or the thief might have learned how to pick or bypass my car lock so locking would have been useless anyway. Or any number of other things could have occurred.\n\nPeople should protect themselves from likely events in ways that are reasonable and effective. Protecting yourself from unlikely events in ways that are unreasonable or ineffective is often just security theater, like signing your bill at a restaurant. The best thing is to perform a risk assessment while weighing the likelihood, the probable damage, and the cost/effectiveness of the attempted prevention. To be perfectly honest, most people could spend their lives having never locked their car once and still not see any significant loss.",

Kaladin is literally told from day one that a) he\u2019s getting paid wages, b) he\u2019s supporting the army and maximizing shareholder value, and c) he can stop being a slave if he works for long enough. Then he IMMEDIATELY starts fighting back against this system? He could just do his work, pull himself up by his bootstraps, and pay off his slave debt and he\u2019d literally be free to do whatever he wants. But instead, he tries to impede the process as much as possible, ultimately hurting Sadeas\u2019s bottom line.\n\nWhy is he seen as a good guy? What the fuck kind of book is this?",

                    "body": "Honestly I've seen some really, really, really bad Stormlight hot takes.\n\nPeople have said Shallans experience with DID is overblown...\n\nI don't consider myself an expert, but...\n\nAs someone who grew up around relatives who had DID, has dated people with DID, and been friendly with people who had DID, though admittedly has never had the condition and still holds the perspective of an outsider. Shallans experiences are certainly played for dramatic character moments, which in and of itself will never amount to a true and authentic portrayal of any mental condition. I also feel as if Shallan is blessed to have only two stable alters. (I've known people with as high as 7 and low as 4). That being said, there is exactly one DID experience that I have heard from everyone I've known who experiences it, that Shallan doesn't display. And it's the feeling of the effected individual looking at their hands and feeling as if they belong to someone else.\n\nYou can induce this experience in yourself through drugs that have a Dissociative effect, though I don't recommend taking these kinds of drugs lightly. All drugs are stronger than you, kids. Respect them.\n\nThe rest of Shallans experiences float pretty comfortably in the baseline of what many people I've known with the condition expect. The big outlier for me is that when Veil leaves Shallan doesn't grieve. If the alternates are aware of each other, generally you expect there to be feelings of mourning associated with that alternate leaving. Some have even described it as feeling like a relative died.\n\nI've also seen people say Kaladins experiences with Depression are overblown.\n\nNow, I do consider myself a first-hand expert on depression. Kaladins' experiences are within expectations, though once again, played for character moments. Not realistic, overcoming depression is generally a more ponderous, slow, and boring experience than would make for exciting fiction.\n\nI have been clinically depressed since I was very small. My first suicide attempt was probably when I was around 6 years old, maybe 7. I tried to hang myself from the top bunk with a necktie i stole from my father. I think it's pretty safe to say my depression is more severe than Kaladins. I am very happy that there are people who don't know what that feels like, to have a compulsion to end your life at such a young age.\n\nAnd the thing is, there's no real trauma that caused it. I've always been that way. There's trauma that made it worse, but no inciting incident. There's easy days, there's hard days, there's middling days.\n\nI'm not telling a joke, I'm not being sarcastic, I'm not saying \"Oh, must be fucking nice\", if you feel as if Kaladins experiences are over the top in terms of depression, I'm happy for you.  I find it especially real how he clings to something that causes a break in the bad days and falls apart when it doesn't work out.\n\nMy favorite bad Stormlight hot take, though? It's gotta be the one I find actually funny. Whenever I see someone say the eye colour based caste system is racist.\n\nMy brother in Tanavast. Alethi Lighteyes can't be racist to Alethi Darkeyes. They're both Alethi. To use a real world parallell, it's like saying the Samurai caste were racist to the peasant caste, they're both Japnese.\n\nAnd in a lot of ways the Samurai were worse than the Lighteyes. At least when a lighteyes murders some peasants the king sends him off somewhere he can't do much more harm. In a lot of time periods there were just no laws for a Japanese peasant for what a Samurai could do to you. Just raw cold blooded murder in the street and nobody got punished.\n\nIt's got nothing to do with race. It's classist.\n\nAnd it's always someone with like Elsecaller in their username. Child of Honour, if Jasnah caught you thinking like that she'd shackle your ankle to Wit and order him to shout \"Undertext!\" every time you said or did anything.\n\nI do forgive because I can kind of tell from the writing style that it mostly comes from... younger(?) fans, and sometimes fans who I believe are ESL.",

I say these people need to go out and live more, meet people with the disorder. Experience will adjust their opinion.\n\nA movie like Split is where DID becomes unbelievable, not simply because The Beast actually gains superpowers  when that personality takes over, but because of the sheer number of alternates. 24 distinct alternates? That's significantly more than double what my aunt had, (7) and from research I know that about 10 is what you should expect from the average person living with from the disorder.",

It's not classism, because it's not any more about class than any other social or prejudicial hierarchy (they're all classist). It's eye-ist, because eye color is the only distinguishing feature. Darkeyes aren't discriminated against because they're peasants and poor, they're discriminated against because they have brown eyes.\n\nThis is a made-up fantasy world, where discrimination occurs based on an intentionally meaningless facial feature. You don't have to prove how perfectly analogous it is to the real world, and everyone else isn't wrong for disagreeing with you. It doesn't align with the real world perfectly (although if I had to submit my opinion on closest analogue, it seems pretty similar to the racism surrounding the Rwandan genocide).\n\nBetween racism and classism, eye-ism is probably closer to racism, because it's all based around exhibition of an inborn trait. If one parent was a rich lighteyes, but the child is born with brown eyes, they're still darkeyes. Under classism, it's possible to raise one's station by getting filthy rich, marrying up, or just straight lying about one's heritage. It's nearly impossible to change your skin color, by contrast. Of course, in the SA, it is possible to change one's eye color, another key difference from our world.",
