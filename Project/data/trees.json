We looked around and saw this very pretty, very big $50 skull bong, and it spoke to him so he bought it without a second thought. It came with a bowl and stem, so we said \"perfect\" and off we went to his house to try it out together. We get there only to find out the bubble wrap they kindly put on his piece had some deflated bubbles on one side; that side was where the bowl was, so while graciously the bong survived, the bowl did not, shit was shattered to bits. We were devastated, but then bro just chose to drive back to the shop and buy 2 bowls lol, we got back and got sooo obliterated that day. Good times!",

They said going back to see VN again was the best cure for their PTSD because they saw that everyone had moved on, the country was happy and peaceful, and there\u2019s absolutely no resentment towards Americans at all. In fact, people in Vietnam love Americans. I wonder if John has ever gone back to visit",

Not the landscaping kind, anyway.\n\nI did come to say that what you're seeing is likely to product of grafting. Certain species of trees, for one reason or another, are hard to propagate or grow, due to a myriad of reasons. One way to solve this issue is called grafting, where the apex of the desired tree is cut and \"glued together\" to a more hardy rootstock of another tree. This is commonly seen with Japanese maples, for example.\n\nAnyway, sometimes the grafting can partially or fully fail, where the rootstock that was used puts branches out of its own. That is what I believe we are seeing here. 2 different kinds of trees (maybe in the same genus) that are both growing out of one merged trunk.\n\nI'm no expert, so don't take my word for it, but as someone who enjoys bonsai and has had some grafted Japanese maples (graft failures are not uncommon) this would be my guess.\n\nIf you want, I would recommend posting in r/marijuanaenthusiasts (no, I'm not kidding) for more insight.\n\nVery pretty tree!

The trunks are typically a fast growing upright variety grown specifically to create a trunk. The top part of that tree is then cut off and several branches from a mother weeping tree are grafted to the trunk. This way you can make many weeping cherries in a short order. You can tell the upright flowering branch is part of the normal trunk because it originates below the graft. Usually you catch that and cut it away before it is allowed to grow (otherwise you'll end up with something like this monstrosity). Another example is roses, most named varieties are grafted onto a fast growing rootstock.",

Bradford/Callery pear trees are notoriously fast-growing and very brittle (and very smelly/noxious) so their branches full of flowers aren't great to have around. If you take a close look, the flowers are a different shape, and even the bark has some distinct differences.\n\nJust my guess as a fellow r/trees enthusiast, though, def not any better at horticulture than that!

The pink flowers are def a cultivar known as \"spring cherry\" - the bark and flowers both match up.\n\nI think I'm sticking with the graft hypothesis, though - I can't imagine how else this would have happened? Idk trees though, so again that's all a guess other than what PlantNet has clarified.\n\nThat sounds like a really interesting career!! Congrats on it - sounds like you're really enjoying it, which is rare these days, so keep up on the good work!",

When my tolerance started to build, I used to just smoke more and more until I was eventually smoking all day every day. That lead to laziness, general \"don't give a fuck\" attitude, and eventually bad anxiety attacks any time I smoked. The best thing to keep from this trap is to just take a break now and again. I only smoke socially now to keep myself from the \"well who am I hurting\" mindset that keeps me reaching for a toke when I am bored or depressed or need a serotonin boost. \n\nI'd say for you, if you keep to that schedule, you should be fine bro. If you start to fall into the habit of smoking more and more just to chase the buzz, take a break. You'll thank yourself :)",

It's basically been decarbed already, so just submerge the AVB in 100 proof ever clear, pop it in the freezer for a few hours, squeeze out the buds, then cook down the alcohol to make tincture.

They are depicted as a race of super humans with yellow skin, large eyes, angular crowns instead of hair, and simplified, exaggerated features. It is thought that  humans of this era would gather together to celebrate these deities around primitive picture transmitting technologies called TEEVEEZ. These pictures would show the deities in a variety of mythological and moralistic contexts.

I am pro legalization, but heres the problem, and what worries me the most.\n\nIt being schedule 3, that returns it to not only the control of the DEA, but also the FDA. This means that every state, all 38 states where it is currently legal for medical or recreational, it will now be ILLEGAL in those states. This is going to instantly reverse every single state law that states have been fighting for for years. Dispensaries will be instantly raided/shut down. Same with farms.\n\nIt will be under direct regulation of the FDA. They are going to have full control of who can prescribe it and for what. They will be in full control of all regulations. There will be competition, no choices. You will only have access to what they allow you to, and for what they allow you to. Will they outlaw flower? Concentrates? Edibles? Will you ONLY be able to get it in tinicture or pill form?\n\nWhat about thc limits? Will they have a limit on 5mg per edible? 5-10% thc for flower? Only allowed to have \"X\" amount per month prescribed? I have absolutely ZERO faith that they are going to just leave the industry alone as it is. That is NOT going to happen. It would be no different then a state \"legalizing\" any other prescription narcotic. Nowhere in the country can you just go buy percicets, xanax, codeine etc. Every other rx medication is made by like 2 different pharmacitical companies. You will have no choice in quality, strain, potency nothing.\n\nPeople who are celebrating this have no idea that this is going to be a big loss to the movement and is going to totally cripple the industry. If they choose, the FDA can decide it can only be prescribed to people in the most extreme circumstances, effectively making it illegal nationwide, in every single state all over again.\n\nAnd if you think this is the \"1st step\" in full on legalization and removal from the controlled substance act altogether, your going to be in for a rude awakening. Now that it has been reclassified, there is virtually no chance of it ever being legal again. They knew exactly what they are doing. By reclassifying it and \"legalizing\" it, all they did was make it federally illegal in every state.",

That would only be possible if the banking and credit card issues are resolved, and there's no guarantee Schedule III will do that. That said I believe it will let doctors finally prescribe cannabis (instead of recommend) so I'm sure there will be lots of pressure from pharma companies to get that sorted ASAP so their companies will be the ones supplying products to the pharmacies. \n\nSome states may even have provisions in their law allowing pharmacies to sell when changes to Federal CSA placement are made. I think some states even have sunset clauses on their medical program (PA did but removed it) based on its Fed. CSA status. \n\nI think their jobs are probably safe for the short term, but once the ball gets rolling, it won't stop until it's fully descheduled and its related and appropriate criminal justice reforms are enacted. Eventually I see the niche-dispensary model going away in favor of cannabis and its products being sold pretty much anywhere coffee, sofa, cigarettes, or alcohol can be sold - with appropriate age verification so children/young teens can't buy it. When banking regulations are fixed of course. Still, there will always be jobs in the cultivation, processing (concentrates), and ancillary spaces.\n\nIt's still gonna be a giant mess basically until it's descheduled by Congress.",

And if the rule of law is dead we could end up with a Phillipines style backlash against drugs where vigilantes were killing drug users and prosecutors refused to prosecute the murderers with explicit executive encouragement (fuck Duerte).",

What about medical dispensaries? Still no, recommendations aren't prescriptions, and medical dispensaries aren't licensed pharmacies. Would doctors be able to prescribe cannabis? Still no, cannabis isn't FDA approved and there's no realistic pathway for that happening. So when you say this is a huge victory, I don't know who it's supposed to be a victory for - the pharmaceutical companies that can now manufacture cannabis derivatives?",

I keep hearing that is going to be part of Biden's re-election bid, but I'm not so sure. He may say he will if re-elected, or may legalize it before the vote to garner support. We can always hope for the latter, and that any charge stemming from possession or sale will be done away with. Neither the feds nor the GA gov give me much hope, but collectively we could change that. Probation isn't the worst thing, just gotta keep the appearance of being on the straight and narrow. Esp if you have a PO who is for legalization like mine was many years ago. Wish you the best man.\n\nEdit to say even though your right to vote has been taken away, that doesn't mean you can't try to be part of the change. Protesting has gotten a bad wrap the last 4 or 5 years, but it is still an important part of showing our overlords we care about an issue and desire change.

So there may be a halt on medical and recreational cannabis but this shouldn\u2019t push out legal ways of obtaining weed.",

If that's how Georgia works you've got a real shot. \n\nIdk the exact nature of your charges but if it's only possession, your first offence and took place mere months before the official Schedule I - III downgrading the charges your crime would now carry according to state law will make your sentencing look even more excessive on review. I'd think raising it to the appeals court could get you off far sooner than expungement in 10 years.\n\nRumor is even tho' they may announce it officially soon they can drag their feet on implementing it for a few years. Might have to wait until then but I think you have a good chance of getting your sentence reduced. Then again my state skews middle ground so you may have a lot more far right hard on crime campaigners in Judges seats down there. \n\nMight consider some community college courses too. If you could juggle a couple courses on top of work, make regular payments on whatever court fees and fines you've incurred and do a bit of volunteering on weekends my money's on that going over great with a real conservative judge.

The cure was a course of antibiotics followed by probiotics. The probiotocs came in capsules and the way I would administer them was to open the capsule and stir the powder it contained into her food bowl. She was a hyper lil kitten at the time who would be climbing all over me during this prep, so I'd give her the empty gelatin capsule to play with and distract her while I finished prepping her dinner. She loved those things and would bat the capsule all around the house and eventually eat it.\n\nBig mistake, as for *years* after that every time I got anything out of a pill bottle she would think it's playtime. Playtime with a snack. With medications especially that was an unintentionally very dangerous association for me to build with her.\n\nAnyway the moral I guess is be careful what associations you build. Don't let your cat play with harmless toys that resemble other things that you don't want them fucking with for any reason.",

But goddamn, I'm so fucking high as hell. I will update you on how it goes\n\nUpdate: today I walked into work, clocked in and sheepishly made my way to the dish pit, it started with one dish, then another, then another and pretty soon it was already 8:00 and I was already done with  most of the dishes. It was like an ice cube and a plumber's pants, melting at the ass crack. What seemed like/ supposed to be multiple hours was only a few minutes for me. I cleaned up so fast that when they brought the last final rounds of dishes I was able to knock those out within a few minutes. I can't believe I've been raw dogging work sober this entire time, I don't know how, but I just discovered a new thing I love",

We'd get the bartender to make us rum and coke. And some of the guys were doing blow and pills and just about anything else you could think of, so I think you're fine. We'd get yelled at because the waitresses would sometimes go to use a whip cream can and it was dead because we were all using them for \"whipits.\" Kitchen manager would come and scream at us, \"You guys are doing them whips again and wasting all the fuckin whipped cream.\" We'd all bust a gut laughing.

You are nowhere near the first person to think that the gas company has something to do with your AC. \n\nThe \"gas\" in your AC is refrigerant and it's a closed system, so none needs to be supplied or added (unless there's a leak). The AC uses electricity to run a compressor that exploits the heat transfer properties of that refrigerant's phase changes in order to move heat out of your house.\n\nThe gas company supplies natural gas, (i.e., gaseous hydrocarbons) that are meant for combustion to heat stuff. It's used in your furnace to heat your home or in your hot water heater to heat the water or in your stove top to produce a flame for cooking.",

The act of combustion/vaping then converts it from thca to thc that your body can absorb.  This is why you can\u2019t get high from eating raw cannabis and instead it has to be decarbed for it to turn active.  The loophole is that the naturally decarbed thc amount has to stay under 0.3% THC and it qualifies as \u201cthca flower\u201d. If that number goes higher than the 0.3% then it\u2019s considered \u201cmarijuana\u201d.  Most buds you will buy will be like 26% thca and about 0.3%-2% of raw thc at a normal recreational dispensary so sometimes what they sell can even be classified as \u201cthca flower\u201d",

It's just corporations that lose millions, if not billions of dollars (like Canopy Growth) and the weed isn't any cheaper for the consumer compared to before. Too much red tape and bureaucracy involved. \n\nThe black market is still flourishing and profiting. \n\nConsidered opening a dispensary but the regulations/restrictions are ridiculous and you're put at a disadvantage relative to ones run by the province in BC, you can't compete properly. Why invest significant money into something that will very likely lose money or at best make enough to barely scathe by in one of the most expensive places to live in the world. \n\nSomething will eventually break as the companies providing the weed can't keep losing money forever. For now I'll just grow for myself and friend\n\nEdit: speaking as a Canadian who used to grow. Not all American companies are money burning machines.",

I\u2019m now probably spending half the money on way better weed/concentrates. I no longer have those awkward interactions with my dealer who would always talk about conspiracies and the government.

Is tobacco *legalized*, is alcohol? \n\nYou realize you can legalize something while still having restrictions in place, right?\n\nHere's some reading from the ACLU, which might help:\n\n**What is drug decriminalization?**\n\n> Decriminalization is the act of removing criminal sanctions against certain activities, including possession of drugs for personal use. The substance is still prohibited generally, but the repercussions for being found in possession of the substance are no longer criminal. Instead of incarceration, those found in possession of drugs could get redirected to services and have the drug seized. The production and sale of the decriminalized drug is still illegal.  \n \n**What is drug legalization?**\n> Legalization is the act of permitting by law use of a substance. In the drug policy context, the term \"legalization\" gets used in different ways. Generally, though, it implies some type of legal supply, from prescriptions to regulated cannabis shops. People can use the substance without worry of being convicted or fined. Limits can still be set on its use. For instance, the law may require you to be a certain age to use the substance and the government can still limit the amount a person can carry or possess, such as is the case with prescription drugs. Suppliers may need a license to sell the substance, like with cannabis or alcohol. In 2012, Washington became one of the first U.S. states to legalize recreational use of marijuana and to allow recreational marijuana sales. Both the use and sale of the substance are permissible under legalization.  \n\n\nhttps://www.aclu-wa.org/story/difference-between-decriminalization-and-legalization-substances%C2%A0",

Before the current government, we've had the center-right party in power *for 16 years*.\n\nAfter the last election, we finally had the opportunity for a center-left coalition with the Greens and libertarians. This is the one that partially legalized weed. But because of a bunch of reasons -most of which have nothing to do with the current government- the people are really unhappy.\n\nSo the center-right party is at the top of the polls again, even though they completely fucked the country the last time they were in power. But there is a silver lining to this: they will probably have to form a coalition with one of the current government parties, none of which will agree to reverse the partial legalization.\n\nFor them to form a coalition that would definitely make it illegal again, they would have to work with the far-right (fascist) AfD. So far they have ruled out such a coalition, but you never know what could happen...",

The price of cannabis nationwide is being pushed to the lowest it's ever been anywhere in the world, commodified to the degree that people simply cannot fathom paying the price that really good weed costs to grow.\n\nAs a result of this, really good weed (at least legally and commercially) only exists in the very few areas of the country that have high concentrations of people with absurd disposable income. This is not elitism or class warfare, these are simply the people willing to buy the product in the state it currently has to exist in: artificially high prices to counteract the low demand for what is a very expensive crop to produce.\n\nWhat you are describing is good enough weed, which yes you can find in damn near any city in all 50 states of the US. Plenty of people enjoy light beer and that's totally fine, but if light beer was 10 cents a can and drove craft breweries out of business completely then people would absolutely be upset.

I'm speaking from experience here, I've worked for BC Cannabis for 3 years now. When drift brought out their 50mg packs we sold out of them IMMEDIATELY, and we still have people asking for them almost a year after drift caught shit for their packs. We bring in one box, it's gone in an hour. We bring in 12 boxes, they're gone in a day. They were our top seller every week we managed to bring them in, and it had a definite effect on our sales. People weren't buying the 10+ packs at $5 apiece they used to, they were buying a couple of the 50mg packs and calling it a day",

Your brain is not fully developed yet. 21 to 24 is when your brain is fully developed. If you do alcohol, nicotine, or THC/CBD before that age, it will permanently stunt your brain development. Have you ever run into a brain-dead smoker in their adult years? Ask them when they started smoking on the regular. Guaranteed it was below the age of 21 to 24. That, most likely, will be their response below that age gap. It's biology, baby!\n\nThe last part of your brain to develop is the frontal lobe. That's the \"decision-making\" part of your brain. Know how you were younger, and you did stupid shit just based on impulse? That's why. Your frontal lobe is not fully developed. Before that age you, primarily, work off impulse and don't think it through first. Your frontal lobe is extremely important. \n\nTL;DR: Get high after 21 to 24, and you'll be fine. Before.

The legislators just didn't know that literally the weed we've been smoking for hundreds and hundreds of years has been, in fact, comprised mostly of the acid (i.e. THC**A**) precursor and not THC.  THCA turns into THC when enough heat is applied (e.g. combustion or vaporization).\n\nSo, in physical reality, there's literally no difference between hemp and marijuana, its all weed - it's the same plant species.  There is only a difference *legally*.  I hope this helps!",
