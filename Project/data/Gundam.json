I provided the appropriate model, color templates, and ensured that the relative size/placement of each suit component was correct.\n\nMy contributions: I created the heat hawk and machine gun from foam whereas the heat dagger was from 3D printing.  I replaced the original horn with a more modern one (3D printed) and redid almost all of the strapping to better fit me (though more work needs to be done still!).\n\nHope you enjoyed this :).  Seig Zeon!",

We in modern times have multiple cameras in and around our cars, which give us a nice awareness of the surroundings, so it's kind of stupid to think that what are essentially the most complex machines ever built by humans in almost every Gundam continuity fail to take account of that.",

Got to see it in person during my first visit to Japan in 2022. In addition to how impressive the statue itself was, I loved that it had the backdrop of Tokyo Bay in the background, instead of just a generic looking Japanese mall like the Unicorn and Nu Gundams.\n\nAlso Yoshiyuki Tomino's message where he apologizes for how \"boring\" it is because it's not freestanding is hilarious, and definitely sounds like something he would say. (See image below.)\n\nAs for what they should do next, I think we're well past due to get a Zaku statue.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yygmdxh73fxd1.jpeg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c80da2ebeea5e019f6aa632a2feddf77d5129ec6",

Better kill those kids first!\" Real classy, buddy...). He has no problem using decoys, mines, tricks, whatever he needs to, because at this point he's leaned fully into his identity as a professional soldier as his *only* identity and that means he accepts and internalizes the brutality of what he's doing and wants it over with quickly to achieve his objective.\n\nNot a single other character in the movie fights like this - *everyone* else brings other baggage - from the least professional soldiers like Quess and Hathaway, who are more or less blinded by their naivete, all the way to the most professional soldiers like Gyunei, Rezin, and Kayla, who each are using combat for some kind of personal gain or growth (to realize ambitions, feel true freedom, and be a true hero, respectively). And of course, Char, who is always using combat as a piece in his 5d chess game and never has straightforward reasons for anything.\n\nAnd so this scene, and the scene where Rezin, the undeniable top ace of the old-types, goes down to lame ol' turret fire, really highlight the central theme of the movie: all the bullshit, from believing that combat is a route to honor or growth or heroism or love like the other pilots, to using war as a tool for your own personal bullshit like Char, all of it is meaningless fantasy. The *only* thing that's real is the sudden, brutal deaths which all that fantasy causes and the tragedy it leaves behind afterwards. Amuro is the *only* character who actually understands that",

Amuro is a try hard because he gets fixated on things and what he does is drill down into his topic of fascination and learns every last thing about it. When he was a kid he was sneaking into his Dad's office and studying engineering manuals, and then realizing he didn't know how to parse Engineering anything so he started teaching himself electrical engineering which is where we find him at the start of Mobile Suit Gundam. When he jumped into the Gundam what was the first thing he did? He read the manual. You see him throughout MSG using the simulator and personally running diagnostics on his Gundam, you see him being friendly with the technicians and learning from them, and by Zeta you see that He's consulting with Anaheim Electronics on how they can make better Mobile Suits in general. In CCA he's so well known as a master mobile suit pilot that AE builds for him the Nu Gundam as a bespoke Mobile Suit made to his every exacting specification (and Char's psycho frame tech).

Had Char been less reckless and self-defeating going into their battle (we'll ignore the fact that, had he not been in that suicidal mindset to begin with, the battle wouldn't have even happened), things could have ended differently.",

Showing everyone that the White Devil/Unicorn was here and he was pissed and no longer playing. Gyunei was a dead man walking when he did that, and Amuro showed him what a real pliot/Newtype can do to his punk ass. The sad part about the comrade is that she just got engaged when she launched, and when Amuro brought her back, he witnessed the fiance morn over her, begging her to come back to him. So you know that motivated Amuro to after Gyunei and drop his ass hard.",

You see it in his refusal to really try with Chan or Kayla and most clearly when he straight up says so to Hathaway - he's practically *begging* the poor kid not to throw away his life and when he sees that it's not sinking in he tells him directly \"you'll die too if you keep this up\". \n\nI think part of why Hathaway's Flash is so compelling is that it's pretty clear that experiencing the events of CCA really *did* teach Hathaway the lesson Amuro was trying to give him, but both Quess and Amuro had to die for him to see it, and he ends up being a very interesting blend of the best parts of Amuro and Char as a result (as of the end of the first movie, at least, idk what happens from there).",

If the Hero Stark Jegan pilot can frustrate and challenge a very competent Ace Pilot who is a powerful Cyber New Type then Amuro in a Jegan would be a fair challenge for Gyunei. Amuro is a fantastic pilot, probably the best in the UC, and on top of that he's a powerful natural New Type. I think that fight be more fair than you think .",

I can appreciate the hand drawn styles as well as the modern, computer developed styles.\n\nIn terms of animation? Heck no. First off, if we are comparing OVAs to TV shows (since OVAs don't really exist anymore), then it's not even a fair comparison to begin with. OVAs took a year or years to create, had a ton of budget, and literally released one episode every few months on a VHS, of course they could potentially look better. Comparing them to a week-by-week TV series is like comparing a movie to a TV series. \n\nBut even then, it's not always the case. Some of the sakuga that is done for fight scenes is absolutely incredible. Unlike the 80s up until about 2005 where for TV they had to animate on threes (1 frame of animation for every 3 frames), computers have now made it so that TV shows can now have their action scenes be animated on twos and ones (1 frame per two frames or even every frame being animated). To completely ignore how good some of the sakuga is today is simply an act of not doing enough research. Just take a look at what is possible in One Piece now compared to 1999. The difference is staggering to the point many call certain episodes \"Cinema Piece\".\n\nAnd as the other guy said, we tend to engage in curating. We are only remembering the best of what has been done before and we are ignoring 80% of the stuff that has been forgotten. Even peak anime years like 1998 has had 80% of what came out that year left behind, just like in every other medium.",

Do you mean to say the designs of stuff like IBO, Unicorn, 00 are a regression of skill level? I can totally understand you liking the oldies better but I don't see any signs of stagnation (quite the opposite for me)  and traditional art didn't die either people still make amazing work traditionally you are simply less likely to see it because digital art is much more appropriate for comercial applications (again, because you can make edits and changes) and yes more convenient too. \n\nThe issue I'm talking about is that you are making that weird association between digital art and a supposed downfall of talent when the difference of skill required by the two mediums is not enough to cause a general stagnation. Again it's like using Word instead of a typewriter, much more convenient but the core craft is kept, you simply don't need to scrap the whole thing now whenever you make a mistake that bothers you too much, that doesn't mean digital artists are less passionated or committed is not that black and white corrupting force. For example some people do digital because of commercial considerations others because they are very perfectionistic and being able to fix stuff with the precision of fractions of millimeters until you are satisfied, is great, others just want to save on cost of materials (art supplies can be very expensive), for people who work with concept art being able to change stuff without having to begin anew from scratch is amazing, and some just like it as a medium better because it is more extensive than other mediums. \n\nDigital isn't the easy mode of traditional (unless you start off with a fancy tablet I would argue it is the other way around until you really get used to it, depending on the traditional medium you are comparing to), the fact that it brings significant benefits does not mean people will cripple their progress by using it specially considering it also expands the possibilities of what can be done too. \n\n>AI\u201d art is over taking now anyways and in a few generations people will no longer be doing ultra complex hand drawn pieces at all unless something is done about it.\n\nAI is something else entirely. Hobbists will still do complex hand drawn pieces because artists do that for the sake of crafting itself and AI is a completely sterile experience on that end but I'm afraid your argument will become reality for the coming generations unfortunately.\n\nAnyways, my two cents.",

In the act of \u201cbreaking through\u201d or \u201cmaking it\u201d artists have to consistently improve themselves until they are recognized as the best and with which almost immediately a harder grinder comes forth with more \u2014 unless you introduce a new style, you are forced to improve and improve.\n\nWith the onset of digital art, another style arrives that is so unlike analog that we begin to remove the skill bars - easy lines can be set using software point a to b, mistakes can be erased, the \u201cskill\u201d and discipline required to draw a straight line or a perfect circle or cube becomes unneccesary because of the program, however this erodes talent and creates a rigid art form where literally less can be done in more time compared to \u201cpeak artist\u201d its very apparent in the quality of detail.\n\nThat quality of detail is also very much the reason things have innovated the way they have - an analog photo from the 70\u2019s for instance could have been considered peak photography, when compared to a digital photo from the 2000\u2019s you\u2019d be missing out on subtle details, light changes and little renders that are simply being missed. The trade of convenience is replacing finer nuance, which is fine for amateur things but not so much the case with \u201cpeak craft\u201d\n\nEven as I type this out my little spelling mistskes are simply autocorrected if I choose, I can go back and edit to make up for my chubby fast fingers tapping on the screen. And this whole issue isn\u2019t just relegated to art or gundam but humanity as a whole - we have lost our edge\n\nIf I offended you, it wasn\u2019t my intention. And I\u2019m not trying to lambast digital art - I\u2019m certainly not talking about erosion of creativity either, however I am suggesting that the division created by \u201cdigital\u201d v \u201canalog\u201d removed or at least halved the progress of the competitive pool to push each other into becoming better and removing the idea of \u201cbreaking through\u201d and switching it for \u201cwell analog is so hard, I can just switch to digital and get my art out\u201d and the self improvement factor pivots from grinding to learning a new ability.\n\nInstead of developing level 20 hand drawn art we simply have level 15 hand drawn art with level 10 digital art - those 10 levels of digital art could have been ground into more and more progress towards hand drawn art but instead it wasn\u2019t, so total peak performance is down.\n\n\u201cPractice makes perfect\u201d used to be the name of the game but now its just about \u201coops, its okay I can just reload my progress\u201d the same reason 90\u2019s video games were so brutally unforgiving in today\u2019s autosave world.\n\nas for the ai art aspect thats just another layer of humanity\u2019s move towards automation and ease - you\u2019d never see the mistakes you see in AI art with a *true* hand drawing king, they would\u2019t allow themselves to make such simply mistakes because each line is a case by case basis with purpose instead of some algorithm that is effectively doing auto-fill. \n\nYou two cents is kind of lost in some half offended rant about saving grace for yourself - put the ego aside and look at what I am saying objectively. It has nothing to do with pettiness or downvotes or even reddit, it has to do with the divergence of having so many options which eroded the complexity of the original medium. As a result we have duller minds, softer hands and less determination to improve or become the very pinnacle of the best.",

We may like to share our work, some of us care about likes way too much but in the end we are our own most important audience. Even disregarding that being more skilled does not necessarily directly translate to being on top of visibility, don't believe me? Go ask on the art business sub but even before the digital era, there are plenty of artists that are famous now that only got their work recognized after death.\n\nThe second is assuming that lower entry barrier means intrinsically lower skill ceiling, the fact that there are corrective tools does not mean intrinsically that everyone will be perpetually reliant on them nor that the final output will be of lower quality. Again, the typewriter example, someone writing an entire chapter on a typewriter without redoing a page can serve as proof of skill, still doesn't mean the final result is better than if it had been written on Word.\n\nThe third is oversimplifying art progression. Artistic competence relies on a varied set of skills and they can translate to other mediums both directly and indirectly through synergy. The reason why I'm so certain about my stance is because of empirical experience, contrary to your assumption I have far more time doing traditional art, Ive been doing digital for about a year, when I went back to traditional not only I had improved at it, I had improved at a higher rate than before. Dealing with different problems actually improved other aspects of my skill set. It's not a videogame class system, art skills don't always work in such linear way. Trying different media can actually make you a better artist overall. (A large chunk of art skills is not even intrinsically medium specific). \n\nFourth is associating the value of a medium based on its difficulty. Digital doesn't exist to be the easy version of \"pen and paper\" it is it's own medium with its own crafting methods, people will resonate with different mediums on a personal basis. What you value in art isn't necessarily what I value in art. For me my idea of improvement is mainly linked to design quality (concept art) and very specific rendering, I will pick the medium that is better suited for it, someone who wants to do photorealism will pick graphite/charcoal. Someone interested in portraits will likely pick oil painting and so on. We don't need to commit artistic eugenics to \"save\" art from degradation for \"peak artist\", different mediums serve different niches and different people. \"Peak craft\" is linked to the artist, not medium not what other people are doing.\n\n~~Except for genAI, we should banish this disgusting acursed aberration back to the hellish dark pit from which it came with extreme prejudice (I wasn't being hyperbolical before btw, how dare you!).~~",

I am an opponent of AI art - it should be called \u201cautomatic art\u201d, and I would call it dog shit except for each one of my dog\u2019s coils is unique from the other and each one is its own work.\n\n\nSo with point 1 I would argue that the desire to improve one\u2019s self *is* in fact spurned by competition because without others to share your progress with, it would be a lonely world indeed.\n\nPoint 2: writing used to include its own \u201cstyle\u201d of font, each writer had to become not only good with the pen and the craft of word structure but also had to create their own visible writing font - you actually prove my point better than I could have: almost nobody does \u201chandwriting\u201d anymore and the amount of \u201c fonts\u201d one can change the machine to set has reduced the need/desire for penmanship style, the advanced calligraphy in english is out the window worse than a Russian diplomat.\n\n \nI can\u2019t actually argue with your third point because it opened my eyes to a way of thinking I wasn\u2019t aware of or had thought of and it was actually a refreshing notion, so thank you for that consideration\n\nNow with your fourth point I can only hope you are correct - and that there will be a tapering off point from what I call \u201cthe swarm\u201d or the general status quo - eventually enough people will break off into their own stylistic groups and the \u201cnew hotness\u201d of using computers to enhance/create will level off and more unique Hand Drawn/Digital hybrids will arrive, humans do their best work with when tools are like \u201cspices\u201d to enhance their work, not to actually do it. I like to think that when faced with no other options, humanity pushes its boundaries further than it ever could - hence why swordsmanship begins at a young age, as a for instance. The ability to master a talent before beginning to improve it and push it to new levels of decency is exquisitely important to its true potential increase - \u201cthinking you know it all\u201d only to find out that your knowledge only plateaued would be not only embarrassing to the self but shameful to the craft, even the very best keep improving.\n\nIf humanity is to keep building new tech to enhance ourselves, we must at the very least keep enhancing ourselves with it and in spite of it, otherwise we\u2019re the tools will become us. Reverse polarity exists in many forms and one of them is \u201cmaster the tool before it masters you\u201d - in my personal work I rely on myself before anything else because it begins and ends with me, but using assistants - whatever they look like, enhances it, but it doesn\u2019t change my fundamentals not does it take over for me - in fact my job was taken over by machines a long time ago but still the limitations of building safe work platforms has reached its maximum objectivity with those skylifts and swing stages, at the end of the day a guy still has to go up into the conveyer belts at -40 * C in the blowing wind to assemble a safe place for the welder to do his work or nothing goes back online.\n\nI truly hope that the \u201cgothic\u201d style of art we saw from the late 90\u2019s will resurge and take our minds to new heights, and if it takes months for an artist to produce a work that is truly invigorating, than so be it - as long as it was done with passion and created by the self with their heart and soul.\n\nI have to say, I have rather enjoyed this discourse",

Long story short here, I got sick, barely passed Boot, got even sicker, was hospitalized, and was being pushed out of the military. However, while they were figuring out what to do with me (red tape takes forever), I was given leave to go home for Christmas.\n\nI get done with leave and fly back to Chicago, and there's like 5 feet of snow on the ground. I managed to get back to base, but my leave isn't up yet, and I've got nowhere to stay for a day, so I snagged a room at the Navy Lodge and popped off to Gurnee Mills Mall for fun.\n\nWhile there, I see a Suncoast Motion Picture store. I peruse the anime section, and there are the first two volumes of 0083 on VHS. It looked interesting, and I'd heard about Gundam before, but I never got into it because there seemed to be so much. I was overwhelmed by it all. But they were on sale, and the covers looked interesting, so why not? I bought them, headed back to the Lodge, and sat on my bed eating pizza while watching both tapes. \n\nWhat you're showing in this video is literally how I got into Gundam. Almost 25 years later, I've got over 1000 Gunpla, watched every series, played as many of the games as I could get my hands on, traveled to Japan and seen the Unicorn Gundam and The Gundam Base, \n\nThanks for this hit of nostalgia!",

The franchise makes its money off big shooty robots, and so big shooty robots will always be center stage.\n\nLike, look at WfM. The whole point of GUND-ARM was to try and take gund tech and use it to *help* humanity by focusing on prosthesis and stuff. What do we actually see most of the time, though? We see the work being done on Ariel, the big shooty robot. And the school is hypothetically supposed to be... a school. A place for students to safely learn and get exposure to the fundamentals of business, engineering, design, and so on that would be critical to them eventually going on to play leadership roles in the Benerit corporations. Instead, the school becomes mostly a place to train pilots and has an entire dueling system that gives the show an excuse to constantly show off big shooty robot fights.\n\nLike, for a series that claims to want to find a way to coexist without war, they always seem to find a way to make the solution to a problem to blow it up with a giant robot.\n\nMind you, I think 00 is the only series that really took this flaw to its natural conclusion and actually twisted it into a positive, because in 00 the point was to embrace that contradiction. CB said \"we need to stop war, and we will use force to do it.\" *...and then they stuck with that to the end.* We didn't get some magical reformist bullet to solve the conflict, CB continued to fight to the end of the series, and they *won.* They recognized that their war for peace might still continue in the future, but they achieved a better, more unified humanity at gunpoint. It is, by far, the most radical message of any gundam series: That peace cannot be achieved by relying on the political systems that feed off war to simply choose to end them. Those systems must be opposed by force. And in that regard, shooty robots are great!",

For them, war is a necessary evil, because the alternative is worse. When he runs away from the war, everything goes to shit.\n\nAnd it's not even depicted as an unalloyed evil. For one thing, Tomino has gone on record to say the \"Bright slap\" was, in some ways, necessary for Amuro. The line \"Not even my father hit me\" is telling - if you look at it through the lens of 1970s Japanese values, the writers are suggesting that being part of the war gave Amuro the discipline that his father failed to. For another, there's the ending of *MSG* and the whole \"found family\" dynamic. It's no coincidence that their main character is a boy whom the show heavily implies, if not for the war, would have ended up as a cold, antisocial robot nerd with an empathy deficit... much like his father.\n\nThere are some Gundam shows like *0080* which push the anti-war angle to the limit and do it well. That's fantastic. But the more nuanced ones like *MSG* itself, I think, are worth closer examination because they remain anti-war whilst also acknowledging that reality is rarely as simple as \"A good, B bad.\"",

Of course, the US soldiers would feel bitter about it, especially if you lose a leg or two in Nam.\n\nTry making an anti-war story from the perspective of the winners.

Everything then gets turned around when the Byarlant Custom deploys, a high-performance suit, upgraded and modernized, piloted by a former Titan ace with serious combat experience.  He immediately takes out the Zee Zulus which are the only suits that have a chance against the Byarlant Custom aside from the Shamblo, at which point everything starts to turn, followed by the arrival of the Jesta team and the Unicorn.",

All of this was shrouded in a premise of trying to break away from their own miserable upbringing and the society that had created them, but at the end of the day their reasons were almost very selfish, and I think it was because of this ignoble streak that Tekkaden was never sanctioned to have a chance after Biscuit died.\n\n\nHaving said all that, Kudelia and Atra were the real deal and definitely took the worst of what they were given to make the future better, and because of the boys that got them so far, were able to use that momentum to enact real changes for everyone.

You can't let an enemy live, because they might threaten you again. Kill them, they stop. Simple equations. \n\nAs for Orga, I think he also got too big a head. He saw in Teiwaz and the Turbines the chance to be a big shot- \"King of Mars\" as he put it.  He thought he could be some sort of badass mobster lord sticking it to everyone that looked down on him, and Tekkadan was how he could do it.
