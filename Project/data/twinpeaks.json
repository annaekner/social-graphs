If you're like me and grew up in a small community and don't know you're trans until you're 25, then they're 'the other' to you just as much as everyone else. It's a hell of a thing to get over not just that the people you're othering are people, but that you're one of the people you've othered.\n\nAlso, if I may offer a correction, 'transgenderism' is a term that's uniquely used in anti-trans rhetoric rather than by trans people. It's a term used in lieu of 'trans people' to make it sound like more akin to a cult movement. 'Poor confused people taken in by transgenderism' type fear mongering.",

Part of my treatment is to dress the part for six months prior to any further therapy; hormones, electrolysis - ...\" . \n\n\nMy source https://www.lostinthemovies.com/2017/03/dea-agent-denise-bryson-twin-peaks.html?m=1\n\nPart of the original source is behind a payroll but interesting if it is true.",

This is why I was framing it in terms of my preference. Like filmmakers can do whatever they want, I have no power to stop them.

            "text": "I\u2019d like to take a moment to remember Frank Silva today on what would\u2019ve been his 74th birthday. Most Twin Peaks fans know the story of Frank working as a set dresser on the pilot episode, being in the right place at the right time and inspiring David Lynch to write him in as the character of Bob - the embodiment of evil. But we don\u2019t hear as much about him as a person. Frank A. Silva Jr. grew up in Gustine, CA, where he got his first taste of acting in grade school productions of Snow White and Pinocchio. Despite a rough upbringing and leaving home at an early age, he continued to pursue acting through high school and eventually embraced behind the scenes work, obtaining a degree in lighting design at San Francisco State University. Frank was always a performer, though, and he also enjoyed flamenco dancing and singing in a rock band. His mother, Alice Costa, supported his passions and was an avid viewer of Twin Peaks. In a 1991 Modesto Bee article, she said \u201cI feel so proud that he really made it. He used to say \u2018Mom, one day you\u2019re going to see me on TV.\u2019\u201d Sadly, Frank passed away in Seattle a few years after his time in Twin Peaks due to complications from AIDS. His name can be found on the AIDS memorial quilt adorned with musical notes and a depiction of the Space Needle. He and his mother are buried at Hills Ferry Cemetery in Newman, CA. My partner and I visited recently and found the photos on their gravestones clouded with mineral build up, so we returned this past weekend with cleaning supplies and flowers. Happy birthday, Frank.",

Remember that in the late 60s-90s, big cities were seen as dirty violent places. They got better over time, and more nice suburbs and exurbs were built, so smart upwardly Mobile people became more killed to leave small towns.\n\nHere in Indiana part of the problem has been state gov policy. People love to say they love Mitch Daniels, but he closed down a lot of small town high schools and forced consolidation. That hurt local social capital. He also oversaw a state amendment capping property taxes, which was a giveaway to rich homeowners in Indy but made a lot of small towns unable to finance basic government services and education (because small town property values are lower, a lot of small towns had high-ish property taxes).\n\nThere is definitely a cultural element too. Not sure how mean I want to get with this, but America is an increasingly diverse, socially liberal, religiously moderate or non religious place. Small towns don\u2019t fit in with this super well. For one, higher levels of racism prevent a lot of black and latino and mixed race people from moving there (though this is getting better). That\u2019s bad news in an increasingly black and latino and mixed race country. You also miss out on immigrants, who are good at boosting local fertility and productivity. (Though I do think immigrant populations in small towns are increasing).\n\nAlso you have to ask how many knowledge-based companies want to move their office to a community where evolution and climate change are doubted, where the Confederate flags fly freely, and where much of the population believes that God determines outcome more than people and their individual efforts. I\u2019m not criticizing these traits so much as pointing out that they don\u2019t comport well with the culture of the knowledge/office-work economy. They do comport well with hands-on work like construction, manufacturing, transportation, etc., and you see a lot of rural folks do well in these industries. But you\u2019d rather have both sides of the coin going for you.\n\nFinally, I think the decline of agriculture is part of the story. There are just fewer ag workers today than in the past, and that was a good reason to live in a small town. The income also provided demand in the small towns, but as farming has depopulated, I suspect that a lot of the revenue is being shipped out from the small towns and farm areas. The cultural significance of agriculture has changed too. 50 years ago, many people\u2019s parents or grandparents were farmers. Today that is pretty rare. Farmers are often the butts of jokes and seen as provincial bumpkins. The respect for agriculture has faded, and this makes a normal person less likely to see a small town as a desirable place.",

I don\u2019t think Cooper felt like more than a brief period for him, and this may connect to his final comment wondering what year it was. It was like a dream for him. When we wake up from sleep, we can\u2019t recount every single moment of what we did during that time, and that would be the same for Cooper. This also matches Mike telling him that he needs to \u201cwake up\u201d. Cooper was in that liminal space between being asleep and awake, being aware and unaware, and as such didn\u2019t fully exist in either domain. There\u2019s also Monica Bellucci\u2019s comment about \u201cwho is the dreamer?\u201d. Some of, or perhaps most of, what we watched was Cooper\u2019s dream, thus again we need to suspend the rules of reality, as we believe them to be. Look at Mullholland Drive - the whole first half of the movie has been conceptualized as a dream of Diane\u2019s where she envisions herself as living the life of Betty. \n\nLynch lives a lot in dreams, in liminal spaces, in worlds where the laws of reality as we know them (such as time) are suspended.",

There would have to be at least three people per day, and probably some part timers to keep up surveillance. 6 people minimum. Why would the hormones of one of the six people be the point of putting that whole place together?\n2. The surveillance has obviously been going on for some time. Years, probably. Maybe decades. The fact they were using video cameras with physical digital media rather than the cloud is telling.\n\n3. The procedure of the place is that no visitors were allowed. The lady snuck in. She wasn't supposed to be there. She wasn't even supposed to be in the foyer.\n4. There was security, also around the clock. They didn't really need anything more than the one security guard and the key coded door. They were banking on anonymity to keep other people out. Who knows what happens in every office suite in New York. There was probably security at the front door to the office building, too.\n5. The man and woman having sex attracted the random monster thing, which I don't think was Judy. This happened specifically because they violated protocol. It wasn't how things were supposed to go. The observer was supposed to sit, be calm, and watch. If something appeared someone was to be notified. Probably Mr. Todd.\n6. BOB mentioned Judy a few times but nothing he did in the Return was specific to capturing her. His main mission was to remain in Cooper's body and to avoid being sent back to the Black Lodge. The doppelganger of the arm, the box, shunting Coop's soul to Dougie (remember that Mr. C sent guys to kill Dougie after Coop's soul inhabited it), his use of the black guys to revive him after being shot, and sending Coop's son to the coordinates in his place were all precautions against this. BOB's primary goal was to remain active in the real world.\n7. The good guys (Mike, the Fireman) had some strategies working on their side. Dougie/Coop was saved from assassination because he was bent over to get the Great Northern key in Jade's jeep. They helped Dougie/Coop to win all that money to introduce him to the Mitchum Brothers. They helped him to figure out the insurance fraud to reverse the judgement against the Mitchum Brothers. And they sent the dream about the pie to Bradley so they wouldn't kill Dougie.\n\n\nTo further that, it wasn't coincidence that Coop came back to the material plane right after surveillance of the box shut down.\u00a0",

The older camera lacking internet functionality is for security reasons, remaining disconnected means it can\u2019t be hacked or otherwise tampered with without easy accountability. The procedure of security is in place strictly to be broken, with Mr.C wanting something devious to happen to attract Judy (in fascinated by your belief that the monster isn\u2019t Judy, I believe the cooper/diane sex scene in the end is a direct parallel to prove this). The relationship between the man in the room and his fling seems fairly new, I\u2019m apt to believe it\u2019s possible she is being directed by Mr.C to make this happen. I agree that BOB\u2019s main goal is to remain in the real world, however I believe besting Judy is a part of this. I read his desires for a more permanent residence in the real world as an action against Judy\u2019s directive. There has to be a reason we don\u2019t see everyone from the lodge doing the same thing, as it truly was not a difficult task for him and he likely would have been easily successful were he to replace someone more random and \u201cnormal\u201d rather than cooper.",

Judy was mentioned once in FWWM and her name doesn't even come up much in The Return. We don't ever see her. Frost wrote some about her in the Secret History but again not very much.\n\n\nThe creature in the box came from the in-between place that Coop fell through. He landed on that house thing that the woman with no eyes lived in. Assumedly other beings live in that realm too.\n\n\nCoop appeared in the box as soon as he escaped that realm. If the box didn't exist his soul would have been drawn directly to his body. If the box has been under surveillance maybe Mr. C could have kept him trapped in the box long enough to kill him. Instead Coop just floated there for a little bit then moved on to try to take his body back from BOB.",

Cooper is trapped, but Mr. C makes it out in his place and effectively lives as Evil Cooper for 25 years. \n\nMr. C definitely harnesses the same evil energy that BOB does, and they are tied together in that way. But they aren\u2019t the same entity; I mean they defeat BOB separately after they get rid of Mr. C in the return, they definitely seem to be separate entities to me.",
