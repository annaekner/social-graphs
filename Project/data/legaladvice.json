I have the only copy of the will, and a court clerk verified it to be legal and valid.  \n  \nHe didn't have a relationship with his family due to an abusive childhood, but his parents don't believe he had a will and feel like they're entitled to everything.  \n  \nThey've already gone to his house and removed all of the cars/bikes to store at his parents house. They've also taken his laptop and have been using my dead boyfriend's Facebook profile to start listing his smaller property items for sale (furniture, etc).\n\nThe probate hearing is scheduled for Aug 26th, and I was under the impression its illegal to touch anything or remove anything until someone has been assigned to inherit the estate.

            "text": "My 15 year old was asked to go on a vacation with a friend of hers.  The friend (Jane) doesn't have many friends, and my daughter has always made an effort to include her, so she is often invited by the family to go to events and has been invited on trips before.  My daughter (call her Mary) does a lot of activities, and has never been able to go before (and didn't really want to go, but didn't want to hurt Jane's feelings), but this time the parents scheduled the trip around when my daughter would be available.  Jane is an only child and extremely doted upon by her parents, and they have shielded her from consequences and disappointments in the past- For example, Jane was caught on camera stealing another kid's Nintendo DS from his locker.  The parents swore that it was hers, then when shown the video, insisted she was stealing it back from someone who had stolen it from her.  They put up such a fight that the school turned it over to the police, but the father is a state trooper and the incident just went away.  They have also made big ordeals when Jane didn't make cheerleading, and when she wasn't invited to a private party.  This context is just to say, I don't blame the kid in this situation.\n\n  \nApparently, the trip was fine for the first 3 days of the 5 day trip.  They drove to a beach about 9 hours away, stayed in a timeshare, and everything was fine.  On the 3rd day, a family that Jane knew from vacationing there before came, and the boy of the family showed an interest in my daughter.  My daughter had no interest in him, he is 2 years younger and she prefers girls generally.  She was nice, but firmly told him that she was not interested.  Apparently, Jane was interested and was absolutely distraught that the boy liked Mary.  When they returned to the condo, Jane screamed and threw a  cup at Mary, and Mary locked the door to the room and facetimed me.  We discussed options, but the nearest airport to them was over an hour away, and the parents were also angry at her for (??????).  I called the parents to discuss the situation, they told me my daughter was throwing herself at the boy and trying to steal him from their daughter, although they hadn't been there at the time, and only had Jane's word.  I spoke to the mother for over an hour and she finally calmed down and we agreed to just have the girls sleep in separate rooms and take a break from each other, since they were coming home soon anyway.  I checked in with my daughter the next day, she said things were tense but she was just staying in her room and watching her phone all day other than to make herself something to eat.  They were supposed to leave the next morning at 5am, and my daughter set her alarm and was up and ready to go.  When she went out to find the family, they were gone.  They must have left earlier or even the night before.  She panicked, of course, and called me crying, and I attempted to reach the parents because I couldn't believe they would actually leave her there.  It's insane.  They didn't answer and after 3 calls it began going straight to voicemail.  My daughter had them on findmy for the trip, and could see that they were already out of the state.  I arranged a plane ticket and uber for her, and she is home safe now, but she is incredibly upset and stressed out about this situation.  Can I do anything legally here?  I'm so sick of these people facing no consequences and treating people this way.  I can't imagine it's legal to abandon a minor that you are supposed to be caring for, but I'm not sure where to start. ",

During my massage, it was super relaxing, felt great, but then he started getting lower and lower in the bottom region. I figured that was just a normal deep tissue massage because I had never gotten one before. Until he stuck his finger in me... I was in complete shock. I just froze. I didn't tell him to stop, nothing. I just kind of moved my leg to close it and then he stopped. I've never had anything like this happen to me before and I don't really know if this is something I can report, and tbh I don't really want to put my business out there. If anything I'm a little embarrassed, and don't want people to judge me. I'm putting this on here because yall don't know who I am, so this is completely anonymous. Advice?\n\nUpdate: Small update, I filed a police report and they should be at my hotel any minute now. \nUpdate2: it's been two hours and the cops still haven't showed up.\n\nUpdate 3: cops showed up. They came knocking at my door at 4:30am. Because I am a women and slightly paranoid, I did not answer the door, nor did I look in the peep hole (it was covered and I didn't wanna make any noise). But like are you serious? 4:30am?! That's insane. \n\nUpdate 4: I filed a report with the Texas licensing board. Will update after this. ",

Good Samaritan laws won\u2019t always stop someone from filing a civil lawsuit against you, but when you know the limits of what you can and can\u2019t do, it will make it harder for the other person to prevail in their lawsuit.

The ten days ended yesterday but she still wouldn't return my car, so I went downtown to the HCPD HQ to report the vehicle as stolen. Was able to get her on the phone with the Sergeant who told her that once I decide to press charges, it becomes felony possession of a stolen vehicle/Unauthorized use of a vehicle and if she's caught driving it, or caught with it at her house she will be arrested and charged, and I would not have a say in the matter.  Once I sign that line, whatever happens next happens.  Long story short, that lit a fire under her ass and she left the car with my spare key in the glove box across the street. Of course, I requested an officer to meet me at the location just in case she tried to get belligerent or in fact had damaged my vehicle, which she didn't.  She's officially had my car since the 23rd of LAST month, but it's back in my possession now. She's put well over 2000 miles on it, and the maintenance light is on, but for now I'm glad to be done with this,and I want to thank all of you who either gave me good advice or gave me the metaphorical slap I needed.  As for my shop and getting there, one of my mechanics leant me his old beater so I could get to and from, so the shop is up and running and we're already up to our neck in jobs. Got seven satisfied customers and five others waiting on parts. Glad to say that everything worked out once I took a step back and analyzed everything.  ",

[Here is a link](https://www.floridabar.org/public/lrs/) to the Florida Bar Association's attorney referral service. Use that site to find an attorney who is experienced in defamation law - they will know where to take it from there. \n\nOutside of legal help, the other avenue is trying to reclaim the false narrative. This subreddit has an official policy not to advise OPs to contact the media, so I cannot advise you to do so. There are SEO (search engine optimization) companies you could hire to try to bury the story, or you might see if there are other ways you could counteract the narrative by putting the truth out there. But definitely contact a lawyer first to figure out your legal options before taking this step.\n\nBest of luck, OP.",

She checks it\u2019s, pretty extensively so I\u2019m assuming she actually checks my ID, plus the Colorado ID  says \u201cUnder 21\u201d right on it. Anyways, she looks at it, says \u201cThanks, have fun,\u201d then checks my friends ID\u2019s. \n\nEverything\u2019s good and about 3 spins later I hit major jackpot for $1,097.26. The lady is still next to us and watching this unfold, we\u2019re all excited and she looks happy for us and say they gotta handpay. \n\nNow, I\u2019m at the desk, handing a different lady my ID, and she says \u201cAre you only 19?\u201d to which I gladly say \u201cyeah\u201d. She then starts telling me that this location is 21+ and that only some of there locations are 18+, which to be fair it did say on the website, just not which locations, which is why we went in to find out. We didn\u2019t see any signs walking in and literally had our IDs checked by staff before winning. Anyways, she calls her boss who says to pay what\u2019s left from what I put in out of my 20$, $7.30, instead of the 1,000$+.  Am I at fault or did I just get robbed?\n\nUPDATE: After writing a very long and strongly worded letter to the place and their parent company, and informing them that I\u2019d be contacting the Wyoming Gaming Commission and an attorney if we were unable to solve this problem directly today, I received a call from them today that they will be both banning me and paying me out! I\u2019m so grateful for all the advice and PMs. Glad I didn\u2019t have to escalate it further, but the fact they were able to do this in the first place was wild. Gonna have a real annoying 3 hour total ride back up to Wyoming to claim this though.  ",

Feels a bit extra for the situation especially given the reality of us just having fell asleep. I, as far as I\u2019m concerned, have a squeaky clean record too. No reason for concern that I would\u2019ve done something horrible to this woman. Can I report this at all? Was this legal? ",

They don\u2019t appear to have had a warrant, which makes sense because there was no evidence of criminal activity. Neither you nor your roommate consented. A landlord cannot consent to the search unless they have retaken possession of the property, which doesn\u2019t appear to have been the case. Exigent circumstances requires imminent threat of harm, escape, or destruction of evidence. None of that is present in your case. While you need to have a thorough conversation with a lawyer, it seems as if the police may have violated your 4th Amendment rights. I would definitely talk to a civil rights lawyer. Some criminal defense lawyers also take these cases. Good luck. BTW There are a couple other exceptions to a warrant requirement but they aren\u2019t applicable (plain view, automobile search, search incident to arrest, etc.).",

The new rules were that you could not have more then 4 absences in the school year and 12 tardies. Almost everybody can not attend now. The students are mad and the school is saying no refunds to tickets already sold. Tickets were 65 each and 100 for couples. Over 240 tickets have been sold prior to the new rules. Is there any legal action our parents can take? \n\nUpdate: I took the advice that you guys left on the comments. I notified my parents and friends to tell their parents. Enough parents complained and they ended up keeping their rules and offering refunds at first but then once everybody got their refunds they realized that they had sold basically no tickets so they removed the rules all together and now everybody can attend prom. Thank you guys for the advice.",

            "author": "qdobatruther",
            "score": 13931,
            "text": "I had a fairly traumatic birth 4 months ago. 22 hours of labor with contractions starting 5 min apart, not being brought to a birth room for 8 hours, resident put in my original epidural wrong because I apparently have 10% scoliosis so attending had to redo it. Not sure if you\u2019ve had an epidural but they HURT. Then the catheter slipped and the epidural stopped working after just 5 hours and no one came to fix it. Was told to start pushing before I was at an appropriate station so I had to push for 5 hours. But the worst part of it all has been what the delivery doc did immediately post birth.\n\nWhile I laid there in agony from feeling birth with no active pain meds, my doc furiously stitched me up for 35 minutes. I felt every stitch because she shot me with novocaine but immediately started sewing before the meds set in. Fair enough, I had a 3rd degree tear so she had to work quickly. But she sewed me SHUT. I\u2019m not exaggerating, the hole was completely covered. In the fog of post birth, I remember the most painful part of the stitching was at the end, when she took her hands and sharply pressed outwards on both labia, as if to separate the stitches she just put in. I screamed in pain but she did it several more times.\n\nI\u2019m a first time mom so I didn\u2019t know this isn\u2019t normal. I thought she was \u201ctesting\u201d the stitches, but now I know she was realizing her fuck up and trying to separate her overcompensation. Immediately after that, she started telling everyone in the room that I only didn\u2019t have a fourth degree tear because I have a \u201clong perenium\u201d. This was said MULTIPLE times and charted so profoundly that the second doc I went to mentioned it the moment I went in.\n\n4.5 weeks into my recovery I finally had the courage to look between my legs and see why I was still having so much pain standing, sitting cross-legged, and just in general after so long, and saw that I had no hole. I went to the doc who delivered me and she said \u201cwell, after you give birth the tissue is very edematous. This is within the range of normal. You are young and sexually active, have your husband do some perennial massage. You might have a very slight skin bridge and if you really want, I can snip it, but I\u2019ve only had to do that once or twice in my entire 27 year career.\u201d\n\nI left feeling so depressed. I couldn\u2019t even get my own finger in and was really looking forward to getting back to normal intimacy with my husband. I wouldn\u2019t let him touch me for weeks even when we were messing around because I felt so painful and uncomfortable down there and spent so long fearing any other doctor in her practice would tell me the same thing and cover for her, when the only other doctor I trusted was on her practice. \n\nI had to beg to see the other doctor for my 6 week checkup because they didn\u2019t want me to go to anyone but the doc who delivered me. It took until 10 weeks for them to finally let me see the other doc. When I finally got to the doc I trusted, she told me that I could potentially achieve penetration, but I\u2019d need topical lidocaine creams and lots of lube. When I told her I wanted to enjoy having sex since I\u2019m literally 28, she said \u201cyeah I completely understand, if that doesn\u2019t work call me and I will refer you to our urogynecologist so she can do surgery.\u201d I asked if she could just snip it in office like the other doc had mentioned since it was just a skin bridge or labial adhesion, and she said \u201cno this is the suturing and it would need to be revised on the operating table under anesthesia.\u201d\n\nWell, I tried to have sex and it was agonizing and unsuccessful. As I could see and feel, the hole was sewn shut. I went to the urogynecologist and she immediately got me into surgery (within 5 days) and the before and after pictures I took of my vagina are haunting. It looks normal now. It was so obviously sewn shut in the pictures before. She removed nearly two inches of skin that had previously blocked the entry. Turns out, I don\u2019t have a \u201clong perineum\u201d at all. The recovery has been painful and has kept me from my bond with my son as I can\u2019t hold him or get down on the floor and play with him. He\u2019s starting to stop smiling at me when he sees me because I\u2019m not getting quality time with him. \n\nAll this to say I wouldn\u2019t be seeking to sue if the delivery doc had been honest at the 4.5 week appointment. If she had even said something like \u201chmm it\u2019s not healing right but you\u2019re correct that intercourse would be unsuccessful and painful for you. Let me refer you to the urogynecologist.\u201d I would have gone and that would be that. But I went through weeks of feeling depressed, mangled and unfixable only to have a delayed recovery since the doctor wanted to protect her reputation and have me just never have sex again I guess?? The pictures are clear as day that I was sewn shut. Do I have a malpractice case? I don\u2019t want to go down this path if I have no shot at winning. I have no idea what I signed when I went in at the start of labor but I intend to give birth at the same hospital again with the doctor I trust, who is unfortunately in the same practice as the bad doc.

After my pap, my doctor offered me a cancer screener from the company Grail. I asked if insurance covers it and she said that I could make payments on it every month. I replied, \"I don't want it if my insurance isn't going to pay for it.\" She said that her lab assistant could help me with that information. The lab assistant who helped me told me that the doctor told her that I wanted the test. I told her that,\"I don't want it if my insurance doesn't pay for it.\" She said,\"Okay\" and smiled before asking me to sign for several labs on my blood that the doctor ordered. The lab assistant gave me told me that Grail would contact me about fees. I figured that this meant that they would let me know fees and information somehow to get this done. Later after time, I received an email with an attachment that I opened that had cancer screening results and a $900 bill. After contacting them, their local representative, the lab assistants, the lab they worked for, and then the doctor, I finally got answers. The representative from Grail told me that the doctor's office receives a commission for every test they conduct and reminds the lab technicians to ensure that they ask clients before conducting the test if they agree to receive it. I did not agree. Grail keeps sending bills and says that they can't do anything about the bill I now owe. My doctor told me that I signed paperwork to have the test done, she remembers that I had initially told her that I wanted all the checks on my blood and that I can surely pay $30 a month for this test. I told her that I had told 2 medical professionals that I did not want the test and that I signed for my blood tests, not that one. I also told her that the lab assistant did not explain anything to me and that I didn't want another medical bill because I have other medical bills I pay every month. She said that no other client has complained and that all her clients are fully explained the test. I told her that I hadn't explained anything and that I must have slipped through her process. She let me know that I signed for it and that I was responsible for it. I feel tricked. Is she correct? I thought about filing with a small claims court. Does anyone know if I have a case that could win to give her the responsibility for this bill?",

No calls, texts- I have heard zero from him since this day.\n\nThis past Wednesday, I found out, on my own, that a photograph he took of me while we were together was being used for a \u201cnude\u201d exhibition in an art gallery (that is not in my home state.)  It is an internationally juried show.  This photo was included in an online gallery exhibition, as well as a book you can purchase at the show. The photo is extremely intimate, as I am fully nude, face showing, very recognizable.  I never ever gave permission or consent.  I was never asked if this was okay.  I am devastated.  \n\nI contacted ex bf with a text \u201cyou do not have permission to use my image\u201d. He did not respond.  I thought I was blocked, so I sent an email to him with that exact statement.  Hours later, he responds, stating \u201cI understand.  I respect that and won\u2019t use it\u201d.  Then he proceeds to text that he takes this seriously, he thought he \u201chad my permission\u201d, and that he called the curator and the photo will be off the gallery wall the next day.\n\nHe called me to \u201ctalk about it\u201d and was completely non-chalant; stated \u201cwe\u201d made that picture and he didn\u2019t think I would have a problem with it because it was \u201cart\u201d.  He said he had \u201cno intention\u201d of hurting me. \n\nI have been in a really bad place mentally/emotionally because of this.  I am in shock, devastated.  I\u2019m not exactly in a place where I can afford lawyers retainers (4k was the cheapest)\u2026 i have called some lawyers, they say they can send him a \u201cletter\u201d requesting that all forms of this picture will be removed from public display.  I am a person that is very recognizable and known in my community. I am a single mother. I have missed 2 days of work because of this. I am in a dark place.\n\nI asked him point blank- \u201cif I had not found this on my own- would you have even told me about it?\u201d And his response was \u201cprobably not\u201d.\n\nWhat can be done?  What are my options?  Thank you in advance for any advice/support/help.  ",

There are many exceptions, that would require consent or at least be highly advisable. \n\nHowever, while you can license a photo for editorial use or for sale, typically, in order to use a photo for commercial reasons it requires a release.\n\nThere's also the context in which the photo was taken. Generally speaking, photos taken in a public setting, or where someone would have unlimited expectation of privacy, will be legally sound to be used. However, privately taken photos that weren't expected or intended to be used publically, could be an issue.\n\nI would ask how much the juice is worth the squeeze for you. Litigation on something like this could be costly, and it doesn't seem like you are trying to sue for monetary compensation. If your goal is to simply have this photo no longer used, then it seems like the easiest route is to also just contact the gallery and tell them the situation. Once these galleries here that you would be seeking legal recourse, they will remove that photo immediately. Also, well I don't know anything about your ex, that's a judgment call you have to make as far as if he would honestly remove that photo. \n\nSo long story short, yeah he probably can't use a private nude photo of you in an art exhibition, but as long as the photo gets removed, that might be the best outcome for you. Good luck and sorry this happened to you",

I wonder if you\u2019re the first partner he has done this to. Might be a weird kink of his, because I am not buying a professional photographer doesn\u2019t know he needs consent.\u00a0\n\nHe knows the legal more than commoners. Like what measures does he take with other subjects? Any differences? And like did he make sexual advances toward you or say sexual comments about your body that if you\u2019re the subject and not the gf, are those behaviors not sexual harassment. \u00a0If I work on my partner as a patient, I can\u2019t make comments about their body or touch them because they are my partner because in this instance we are doctor patient and they are due all the considerations of that relationship. If he claims subject artist he loses the more intimate privileges of bc/gf- if he wants protection by it, you should get the same relationship protections and in this case it would be subject/professional.\u00a0\n\nDid you request his professional services (ask him to take it) and did he then use the material you commissioned without your consent? Even if he waived the fee, I would think she would have the rights of the purchaser instead of him having rights as an artist, because his primary relationship was professional client, if not bf/gf.\u00a0\n\n\nAbove are just some possible scenarios he might try to defend his actions. I think he either did it spitefully, or with intentional disregard for OP. I think he knows OP would likely have said no. Due to his profession, he understands the unique nature of how he has caused harm, now and into the future by including it into print. Even when things have been corrected after print, they cannot be corrected fully.\u00a0\n\nThe gallery might be liable for not making sure they had consent to publish the materials. I wonder what measures they take to make sure they aren\u2019t participating in producing pornographic images. It\u2019s not publishing art, it\u2019s publishing perpetual harm when the subject doesn\u2019t consent. I feel they can\u2019t claim no harm no foul if they are the ones publishing, promoting, profiting/benefiting from the harm. As a sponsor in the event, they have a responsibility to make sure policies and procedures exist and are enforced.\n\nI think that if you\u2019re the one being harmed and the other is advancing themselves at your expense without your consent, you should be eligible to recoup, especially since you will have ongoing therapy bills and continued harm because people have already bought the book.\u00a0\n\nI would also like to see proof that this photo was removed from all forms of media and all the measures have been taken to have the process remediated and that the image/digitalis etc need to be destroyed. I\u2019d ask him to provide me with a copy of all the communication so you can satisfy or contact them yourself. I\u2019d probably send a cease and desist letter/demand letter.\u00a0\n\nYou can probably find a template that gives you a good idea. You don\u2019t get into the emotional of why, how, etc. you might be able to get an attorney solely to help with drafting the letter. If you\u2019re going to draft it yourself, I\u2019d keep it as basic and as simple as possible. I\u2019d inform them it\u2019s unauthorized use, whatever your demands are regarding the removal/retraction, and request to be furnished proof of the measures they took to rectify the situation. I am not sure if this would be good advice, so hopefully you can find someone who can help with the letter for \u00a0$200-500 depending how much pre work you can do getting timeline and or a pre written for review.\u00a0\n\nIf you end up going legal, you could be introducing your information to public record so I\u2019d be more interested in a settlement and I\u2019d have an attorney mediate that and go for attorney fees.\u00a0",

Taking pictures on private property or in places where a reasonable amount of privacy is expected (restroom) is a much different story. \n\nWith that being said, in this day and age you should probably get model consent forms or an ID of some kind before doing any work with nude models. \n\nNAL, former photographer who worked in a commercial capacity.

We thought he went inside to grab a drink or use the bathroom. My husband decided he needed to use the bathroom as well so was waiting, but he was taking a while so he went inside to check. That\u2019s when he caught him leaving the room. \n\nWhen my husband demanded to know what he was doing in there, he was speechless and couldn\u2019t give  an answer. We fortunately keep a nanny cam in her room so we were able to go back and see that he crept in into her room, touched her face, then walked back out (presumably to check if anyone was coming), and then went back inside and grabbed her hand. Thats when my husband started walking towards the room. He was in my kids room for no longer than 2 minutes and, luckily, my daughter had no idea what happened. \n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that he was predating on my daughter and testing to see if she would wake up. My husband and brother-in-law immediately kicked him out of our home and he is permanently cut out of our lives.  We will be filing a police report tonight, but do we have enough to file a civil restraining order as well? \n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever try to get access to my daughter again but I want to know if there are other options that we can pursue to make sure he never gets near her again, and also so that he doesn\u2019t potentially get access to other kids.

As such, I find it unlikely you will be able to find an attorney to take this on a commission basis.\n\nIt also very much depends on how the media was altered, the context it was presented in, etc. \n\nMy suggestion is to find a disability/mental health rights legal organization.

Your first step would be to figure out a way to get a John Doe subpoena to get the information from TikTok about the poster.\n\nFinally, I want you to know this: while the video is highly upsetting to you, the fact that it is upsetting means it is not a reflection of your true character. Your loved ones and friends will feel no differently about you because of this video. Strangers are also highly unlikely to recognize you. These videos are, unfortunately, a dime-a-dozen. It might also surprise you how many people will feel genuine compassion.\n\nTake care, internet stanger. This is a bad thing for sure, but it doesn't have to define you.",

Now, the shop says they\u2019ve determined they were counterfeit and refuse to pay or give the cards back. They have yet to provide substantial proof that they were fake\n\nFrom my understanding, they have no legal grounds to hold the property. Obviously it would be illegal for my sister to sell potentially fake cards, but we want to have them tested by an independent party to the sale.\n\nWe do have reason to believe they may be real. The card shop *just so happened* to have listed the same cards for sale on their website after receiving my sister\u2019s lot of cards. This could be a coincidence, but something rubs me the wrong way. Any advice would be appreciated! \n\nEdit:\n\nI appreciate all of the advice! As I said in some comments, I\u2019ve confirmed at least some of the cards are fake so I\u2019m inclined to believe the shop. While I don\u2019t agree with the policy (and stand by my assessment that it\u2019s technically illegal) I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for them to have it in place. I will not be naming the shop as I have no interest in being an asshole to a store that\u2019s just trying their best \n\nAlso, while I appreciate the advice, please stop private messaging me. I don\u2019t know jack shit about mtg and there\u2019s not much I can tell you that I haven\u2019t said here. \ud83e\udef6",

You would typically see major transactions on collectibles like this when the product has been sealed and rated by an authority. This would mean it has documentation and has been determined legitimate by that authority. Were your sister's card rated? Or were they just loose cards that she'd collected?\n\nIf the shop offered to pay that high a price for loose cards with no guarantee of authenticity, it starts to smell like a scam because that's a crazy way to operate. Even if your sister gets her cards back, how will you know they are the same cards and haven't been swapped out for frauds in the time they've been in the shops possession? This whole thing is very complicated by the fact that the shop already has her cards before you had a trusted 3rd party look at them.",

This sounds like the Sister got one of these, hopefully not through ordering them herself, thought she had a gold mine and sent them in. \n\nOne of the reasons this type of transaction is so dubious is how absolutely easy it is to tell a counterfeit  card. A simple 5 seconds test with a Jeweler's Loupe (a so called 'green dot' test) will eliminate like 99.9% of current counterfeits that aren't being created out of a multi-million dollar industrial grade printer. For high end cards there are even more easy tells. I find it strange that someone who had such a valuable collection could not do such simple checks. For the vast majority of counterfeits you can simply shine any light through the card and it will look different than a real card. MTG cards are very hard to perfectly counterfeit.",

Just for some additional information I will say that it is usually EXTREMELY easy to tell if a Magic Card is counterfeit. There are multiple very easy, very fast tests that a counterfeit will fail. I do not believe it's possible for a perfect counterfeit of these types of cards that the OP is referencing to exist, as they are likely vintage MTG cards from decades ago and you'd also have to match the ink, stock, and aging. \n\nHonestly in my PERSONAL opinion if someone tried to sell me such a high end vintage collection and it was all counterfeit, I would have a hard time believing they didn't know it was counterfeit.
