                    "body": "the yellow-capped ones are a species in Amanita section Amanita that contains isoxazoles and will be of medical significance but extremely unlikely to be fatal (lower right yellow-capped might be a different species but is in the same section with the same toxins), the red-capped one in lower left is a Russula and no particular issue\n\nwhat is the age of the person who ingested the Amanitas and how many did they ingest?\n\nhere is some info on the isoxazole derivatives, ibotenic acid and muscimol, in the Amanitas:\n\n\u201c .. So your dog (or human) ate a muscimol containing Amanita: what does that mean? ..\n\n.. First off, stay calm, it is rare that this causes any severe symptoms beyond the drunken state your pet may be exhibiting ..\n\n.. Being this mushroom is commonly eaten and posted to our group numerous times a day, we decided to make a linkable post about it that contains answers and information about the scenario you are now in ..\n\n.. if you have concerns, you can contact your vet (or human equivalent) with the ID of \u2018Amanita muscaria or close relative that contains the same toxins\u2019 ..\n\n.. There are a variety of Amanita in a subgrouping we call \u2018Section Amanita\u2019 that contain muscimol & ibotenic acid (Isoxozal Derivatives) which are neurotoxins and not to be confused with *muscarine* which is a different mushroom toxin found in other mushrooms that requires different treatment, confusing the two in regards to treatment can have a negative impact ..\n\n.. Symptoms typically begin quickly within an hour of ingestion & typically subside within 12-24 hours ..\n\n.. Symptoms generally are characterized by acting drunk, including:\n\nNausea\nConfusion\nDizziness\nAtaxia\nVisual Distortions\nSleepiness\n\n.. And in extreme cases: ..\n\nMuscle Spasms\nSeizures\nComalike Sleep\n\n.. And in very rare instances: death ..\n\n.. The dose makes the poison and is relative to how much was ingested vs. the weight & age of your dog, it hits puppies harder (potency also varies between species & by mushroom) .. \n\n.. the syndrome covered above also applies to human consumption ..\n\n.. Overtreatment of symptoms are often more dangerous than the effect of the mushroom, so please consult your vet for medical advice on moving foward ..\n\n.. Some common Mushrooms that contain these toxins:\n\nAmanita chrysoblema\nAmanita muscaria\nAmanita persicina\nAmanita crenulata\nAmanita pantherina\nAmanita gemmata(junquillea)\n\n.. There are many other species in this section of Amanita that contain the same neurotoxins. If you were given a name that differs from the five listed above AND referred to this post, it is a close relative to those above spread between different subsections, complexes, groups, etc. .. \u201d",

The toxin cannot be detoxed even with the help of N-Acetyl L Cysteine or Glutathione. So unfortunately it does lead to coma/death in most incidents of ingestion. It\u2019s actually been historically responsible for killing a pope AND a Roman emperor. \n\nThe entire Amanita family is no joke, though most will just make you really, really sick. As you can imagine, it\u2019s absolutely critical to learn to identify the kinds you can have, and if you do ever go mushroom picking, start by learning the deadliest and the safest (like the boletes family which are almost fully safe with the exception of scarlet boletes). And just stick to picking what you can recognise without a doubt. That means you\u2019re certain of the colour, stem, cap, and bulb. \n\nI grew up picking mushrooms with my grandfather. Then, I took a day class in Ireland (mushrooms are different in every region, and I didn\u2019t want to risk it.) and even that wasn\u2019t enough. I would never pick without an expert by my side. \n\nThis is an excellent subreddit where people take these things very seriously and approach mushroom picking responsibly. \n\nHere are some excellent resources on the Amanita Phalloides if you\u2019re curious. \n\n https://bcmj.org/articles/worlds-most-poisonous-mushroom-amanita-phalloides-growing-bc\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1omOUbsCl7A",

Anyway, I basically got mushroom fever, got 4 mushroom ID books to cross reference, and started eating dozens of different wild mushrooms all around me.  You\u2019d be surprised how many have such incredible features there is almost no way to confuse them with something seriously harmful.

It\u2019s not a superficial surface level problem, it goes deep into the wood. \n\nSome mushrooms aren\u2019t quite as destructive to buildings, but the majority of them are an indication of already damaged wood and the fungi certainly don\u2019t help. I believe this species of mushroom in the photos above are known to be particularly damaging; they quickly and efficiently break down wood to extract nutrients. \n\nYou\u2019re likely going to need to demolish a decent part of your deck surrounding the portion where the mushrooms are growing. Depending on how expansive the damage is, you may want to look into just redoing the entire thing. If someone says they can fix it by just focusing on the mushroomy spots and not the surrounding area (and not addressing the issue of water damage) it will just be a band-aid, and likely only delaying the inevitable.",

There are of course plenty of parasitic fungi, but predominantly when you see shelf and bracket types of growth, it's an indicator of already dead wood, not wood that is dead because the fungus has killed it. This is definitely an oversimplification, but generally it's something other than the mushroom which is the cause of tree mortality. I'm not super familiar with serpula lacrymans, but a quick search shows it's mainly an issue with construction materials and is saprotrophic, which would support this. Most of the fungi associated with actively harming trees present themselves as cankers (weeping, sunken pits), branch dieback, galls (swollen wood), irregular growth, etc. There's some exceptions like armillaria root rot which presents as mushrooms at the base of the trees. What you're seeing in your forest patch could be something else that looks similar, given that s.lacrymans is predominantly found in structures",

Probably just better as furniture at that point.\n\nIf this was a house I imagine it would be good to try to cut out the rot along with a buffer and see if that works.

Last year he harvested 4 ton\u2019s of corn and 2 of beans mostly by himself. He uses horses to trample the bean plants and the wind to blow the trash and impurities off the beans. Every year around September when it starts to be harvesting time he invites friends and family and we go and start cutting down stalks and carry them back under a huge tree and start a fire and roast corn on the open fire and feast. Quite often we find Huitlacoche as well and we roast and eat it as well or the ladies take it and make blue tortillas with it. Delicious.",

A straw was included and used for puncturing the coconut at the time of consumption. Recommended storage was at 4\u00b0C\u20135\u00b0C in the refrigerator, but the coconut had been kept on the kitchen table for 1 month after purchase.\"\n\nBacteria and mold growth are occasional/inevitable results of packaging food without preservatives.
