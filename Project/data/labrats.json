Are you up to date with tetanus vaccinations?\n\nBy no means am I saying you should continue this line of work if it isn't for you, I completely understand and respect your decision. I am just curious to what led up to this situation, were these dopamine KO rats by any chance or some other special strain? Or were the rats not used to being handled? How stressed were the animals? What kind of experiments were being done? I have a lot of questions regarding the conditions in which they are kept, handled and used for experiments because rats are usually very docile and don't lash out like that unless there is something off (pain, stress, fear, something medical or even just a certain genotype for particular disease models). Either way, this animal is clearly communicating it isn't happy and feeling comfortable, I would take that as feedback to critically reflect on how the animals are experiencing the study and if there are welfare improvements to be made. Sometimes the conclusion is that nothing can be changed, but sometimes we overlook, to us, minor things that can make a major difference for them.\n\nEven the way animals are being habituated to being handled and to procedures can make a major difference, it is definitely possible to handle them with little stress for both your and the animal's safety. No picking up via the scruff or tail, keeping painful and stressful procedures to an absolute minimum, not wearing PPE that was used in a different portion of the facility and being as scent neutral as possible yourself and taking time to get them properly habituated to whatever needs to be done.\n\nThis is not a 100% foolproof, I have had one rat (in over 200+ rats used in my study :( ) who would just lunge at your hand the moment you got near the cage. That one had to be distracted by presenting him with a pen of the same colour as the gloves for him to bite into, while he would be scooped up from behind. Once picked up, he could be secured on your arm to prevent him from biting you (or swaddling them in a cloth can also give them a sense of security while preventing them to bite). Perhaps this is a useful tip for those who still have to handle a rat like this \\^\\^.",

There was even the shadow of the ceiling fan moving with the light on; that's how realistic it was. And some rodent-like animal, like a cross between a rat and a ferret, bit my left hand. It bit between the first and second lines of bones, and i felt the little grinding sound as it fully closed the bite. \n\nI screamed, but no one heard. I tried to wedge my fingers into the side of the animal's mouth, to no avail. And i had the sick idea of my only escape. So i grabbed the animal around its body, took a deep breath, and ripped it out, breaking my hand bone in the process. Then i woke up.\n\nI probably learned about, or saw media of rodent teeth and learned about hand bones within a few days before, because otherwise what the fuck was my young brain on?\n\nAnyways, i always get that nervous with animals with long incisors. I love em, would happily pet a domestic or tame one, but ill also be afraid while doing it",

The rats might get an injection and then are anesthetized and imaged every so often or  there are aging studies where the work doesn\u2019t even begin until they are over a year old but no real handling happens unless the lab member wants to put the extra time in to do it.

DDT enabled the conquest of insect pests in agriculture and of ancient insect-borne disease just as surely as the atomic bomb destroyed America's military enemies and dramatically altered the balance of power between humans and nature. The public endowed chemists, at work in their starched white coats in remote laboratories, with almost divine wisdom. The results of their labors were gilded with the presumption of beneficence. In postwar America, science was god, and science was male. Carson was an outsider who had never been part of the scientific establishment, first because she was a woman but also because her chosen field, biology, was held in low esteem in the nuclear age.",

Reductionist approaches can be great to work out the basic workings of the most fundamental natural processes. A lot of my work is molecular/cellular biology so I do work reductionistically most of time. Often reductionism is the way to start getting a general idea of how something works (e.g. isolating one specific receptor protein and figuring out it's kinetics, ligands, expression, etc.). \n\nHowever, there are clear boundaries of what can be explained via reductionism. The brain is a good example: You can not explain brain function just by explaining the function of every single component of the brain. [Holistic approaches are just as important in science. That's why scientific fields like e.g. systems biology have emerged and are becoming more important.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3067528/) It is important to not only see all the parts of nature individually but to see how all those little parts interact and create something way more complex (-> holism). The discoveries in quantum physics also indicate that [a more holistic understanding of nature may be necessary to make sense of it.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physics-holism/)\n\nReductionism and holism are just two different scientific approaches and equally useful and important for our understanding.",

I started my masters this year and my advisor gave me a project that a previous student was working on. the phd student told me to read that persons thesis and work the project accordingly. \n\nThe thesis had no mentioning of western blot. \nnobody told me to spare some samples for WB analysis. When we harvested our samples, the phd student told me to isolate rna from all of the samples. so i did... I isolated RNA from all of them... and mind you, it is a transgenerational study on mice.\n\nNow I have no samples from f2 generation. I dont know even if I have from f3, i checked the -80 freezer and I couldnt find any tubes, even from the previous student, because my rna box shows I must have spared from f3 but f2 is all 8 per group when it should be 4. I am fucked. I am fucked beyond imagination. \n\nI dont know what to do. I dont know how I should confess my mistake. I just want to die. I cant breathe. \n\nWe were going to look expression profiles of certain genes and now I dont know if it is worth shit without WB. I just want to kms at this point. I cant deal with it.\n\nUpdate: I just talked to my supervisor, and she said \"that's what you were so sad about? it's ok, you are learning, we'll be repeating it anyway when the main project is accepted. thank you for your honesty and go eat something.\". I am very lucky to have her. \n\nEdit: you all are so kind, thank you so much. I will take all your advice to heart, work hard and fuck up harder :D. I realized that I've been under so much pressure due to my faculty position (RAs are part of the faculty and semi-tenured in my country) and I was trying so hard to prove myself, I had a complete meltdown at the sight of my first mistake. But I am glad it happened the way it happened. Last night I had the best sleep I had since I started working and I feel like a giant boulder was lifted off of my shoulders. \n\nLove you all <3.",

When my students and team members make mistakes I tell them I\u2019ve made every mistake. One of the skills in science is to be non-reactive. Eventually you just become calm all the time because failure is such a constant part of our work. In bio you will make great strategies, plan really innovative or clever projects and everything will fail and you will have to simply respond to the failure by going again whatever that means. Whether it\u2019s designing a new experiment armed with new knowledge, whether it means learning about an entire new area you never knew existed (which by the way I am the biggest secret nerd lover of), or whether it means overcoming really difficult times. Failed projects, failed companies, failed work relationships or misplaced trust. But you just learn to watch, as everything burns and you are calm, and already you are adapting the next plans to go again, sharper and with even more stupid jokes about failure and getting funnier all the time from the trauma \n\nYour attitude would be a pleasure to have in any lab. Another important thing to remember that many people probably told you is that as the student this was all a failure of those who were supposed to teach you. If I gave you a project where we needed to do protein analysis and I hadn\u2019t sat you down and talked you through what we plan to do and why, and stressed again and again that we need to remember some things, and asked you with slight panic in my eyes to please also remind me because this is your project and I will forget some details later, then that would be my failure. The role of our leaders and mentors is to guide us so that we can learn faster, and bring our level up to be a part of teams operating at a really high level together",

Then, you unleash them on a few tasks that are unimportant/easily replicable so you can judge their work style/inherent competence.\n\nShoving someone at a project with \"figure it out\" is not conducive to anyone.",

I've been in this type of research in an academic setting for 10 years or so now, and if I told my student \"extract everything\", and she did, I could hardly be mad if my instructions were unclear.\n\nThis shit happens, and it's the reason why I always check that I'm on the same page with the people I collaborate with. Even so, someone with the same level of experience as me managed to pipette samples into a 96-well plate in the wrong order (they were supposed to be placed vertically, not horizontally) and it almost cost us a ten thousands of dollars and a sequencing project down the drain. Thankfully I was able to guess the mistake and we could verify it by the genders of the samples (phew). \n\nI was the one who was supposed to pipette this stuff, but I had to go away for another project - I gave this person crystal clear instructions (and even wrote them down), it was still an easy mistake to do.\n\nI do think we tend to blame ourselves too much. Don't worry, your life isn't over - if someone gets mad, I hope they're professional about it. If not, that's just them being childish. It sucks, it hurts, but you have to take care of yourself.",

I have a pet snake and I feed it regularly, so handling dead mice is just ok for me. But after breeding them, observing them from birth to death generation after generation, handling them every week for weighing, i started to notice their little personalities. I got my animal experimentation certificate before working with mice and got additional training to reduce their suffering after I started to feel empathy. I am very efficient when holding them, giving them injections, collecting blood samples or when sacrificing them, I am so god damn efficient that other lab groups want me to lend a hand when they are doing their experiments, I worked with hundreds of mice at this point, yet, it is still heavy on my heart. I accept the upsides and the downsides. I do what I have to do and cry afterwards. I can't change the way I feel. \n\nAnd finally, I never made a mistake before. I dont know how to handle it. I triple check everything when I am working, I repeatedly ask questions to more experienced people. Also, I worked in various fields, they all had clear protocols and anally tidious postdocs or phds that drilled every step into my head. Except this lab. I was told I should be continuing the project as it was written in the thesis, which I did, and I assumed it was the protocol. It is my mistake to make assumptions but I don't know why the phd didnt warn me in any point of the process when I was showing my work and asking questions all the time.",

That is because of things like this happening or the project pivots as it is already underway. You will say something about how the promising RT-qPCR results prompted you to include WB on the next round of subjects. The fact that this is a continuation of another student's project means someone else will probably continue it after you. That is very common in research, particularly 2-year programs. You now have the foresight to drill deeper into the overall plans for the samples before you start your next project. This is a learning experience. Do not forget that learning is the point of academic programs. No administrator, professor, or higher ranking grad student expects you to be a fully trained professional. This is your FIRST YEAR!

Tramionication, a process involving the introduction of trammonium ions into molecules, opens avenues for diverse chemical transformations, with implications for drug discovery, chemical biology, and understanding biological processes.\n\nStudies exploring the tramionication of zxepens have revealed promising avenues for accessing novel compounds with potential bioactivity. By introducing trammonium ions into zxepens, researchers have demonstrated the synthesis of structurally diverse derivatives with enhanced biological properties and activities. These findings not only expand the chemical space accessible for drug discovery but also shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes.\n\nSeminal contributions by Smith et al. (Year) [Reference] have laid the foundation for understanding the tramionication of zxepens in a biological context, elucidating its implications for cellular pathways and pharmacological applications. Building upon this work, subsequent studies by Jones and colleagues (Year) [Reference] have further advanced our understanding of tramionic zxepens, showcasing their potential in various biological assays and drug development efforts.\n\nIn summary, research on tramionication of zxepens represents a significant advancement in chemical biology, offering new tools for manipulating biological systems and designing bioactive molecules with tailored properties. This interdisciplinary approach holds promise for addressing key challenges in drug discovery and advancing our understanding of complex biological processes.",

It will take years and the lawyers will all get fat, but it's not like they're going to stop selling Bambu printers anytime soon. Maybe they need to find a loophole for the purge tower or something. \n\nStratasys can eat a dick, they're charging over 20k for something that is outclassed by a P1P, let alone an X1E. The way they sat on patents is literally the reason 3d printing is behind by 20 years of what it should be. I think they had a patent on the concept of a hotend or something basic like that.\n\nThey still have tons of patents on all kinds of goodies and they're absolutely abusing their monopoly. But even if bambu is magically deleted from existence, all the other printer makers have seriously stepped up their game now that they've been shown how it's done. Competition means the customer wins. I love it!",

Fun fact: there\u2019s only one sink in the whole lab that provides distilled water, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, that\u2019s where the biologist has decided to post up for their weekly water sample collection.\n\n\u201cHey, are you going to be here long?\u201d I ask, already calculating how much longer before my glassware starts gassing out the entire room.\n\n\u201cNo, but I did just start the flush so it\u2019s gonna be a couple minutes.\u201d\n\nSure, no big deal. Except I\u2019m watching the seconds tick by while my compound prepares to greet the lab with its special brand of stench. And here\u2019s the kicker: this biologist could\u2019ve used any other sink. Literally, any other sink.

Of course not. \n\nI stand there, awkwardly close, thinking maybe they\u2019ll catch on that the situation\u2019s a bit more urgent than their weekly water routine. We\u2019re practically shoulder-to-shoulder, just staring at the water like it\u2019s the only source of entertainment. Finally, after standing there for what felt like an eternity, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I muttered something about using the other sink and stormed off to the one with regular tap water. After using that, the glassware started giving off a nice, foul-smelling cloud\u2014though, let\u2019s be honest, it wasn\u2019t quite as foul as the biologist I had stood next to. Seriously, does this guy even shower? If I\u2019d known I was going to have to stand that close to him for so long, I might\u2019ve needed a respirator just for that.\n\nSo, while I hope they got their little sample, maybe next time, think about not hogging the one sink that could save the lab from both a chemical nightmare and a questionable personal hygiene situation.

It works, but it's needlessly complicated. The protocol commandeth:\n\n* Step A is carried out in TBS with 0.05% Tween;\n* Step B is carried out in PBS with 0.05% Tween; \n* Step C is carried out in TBS with 0.1% Tween.\n\nFor ten years, students will prepare three different buffers for this workflow, never knowing that the original protocol was cobbled together out of three separate projects that each just required physiological pH and a bit of non-ionic detergent, where the original experimenters just grabbed the bottle that was handy off the shelf. Nobody ever tests to see if it will work with PBST all the way through, because nobody wants to risk a failure.\n\nSecond are the (sometimes-related) instances where someone mistakes *documentation of a particular run* for *requirements of the protocol*. Put another way, the conflation of \"things that have worked\" with \"things that are *required* for the experiment to work\".\n\nI might use a particular brand of 96-well plate to read absorbances, or particular volume of Erlenmeyer flask to make up the buffer, and record that I did so in my notebook. Someone converting those notes into an SOP might not realize that *Brand X Model A1234 medium-binding* plates aren't critical, and that any flat-bottom clear plate will do. Some might not even realize that it's okay to make the buffer in a beaker instead of a 500 mL Erlenmeyer. And so you end up with hyper-specific requirements that are almost totally irrelevant.\n\nBy these two routes, a lot of meaningless ritual can inadvertently get baked in to lab SOPs.",

Having a protocol always say 20 ug when you really only need 5 or less or need 40 or more, can make a huge difference and/or be wasteful.\n\nKnowing how to assess your run to increase or decrease voltage in electrophoresis can both save time and save experiments, same with a transfer. \n\nThere have been times when people have blindly followed a protocol when spinning down tissue homogenates and didn't use common sense when there was still small floaties in the sample, so they measured protein anyway not accounting for the fact that those unliberated floaties are differentially affecting protein count. Then when they do the Western their housekeeping bands are all over the board. \n\nIt's soooo important to understand what you are doing rather than to blindly follow a protocol. That's why people end up with failed experiments over and over. You need to know the science behind the techniques to know how to leverage resources to make things work.\n\nThis is why I prefer a very broad protocol rather than specific. Some specifics are important and those are the most essential things to follow. But other specifics can lead you astray. Any scientist worth their weight will tell you protocols are guidelines, not rules. In my lab I intentionally keep protocols brief, because if you can't fill in the details on your own, you should talk with me because things may differ experiment by experiment depending on the goals. I want you thinking critically about what you are doing so that way you don't destroy valuable tissue blindly following a protocol that doesn't work for this specific purpose.\n\nHaving recently hired and trained some technicians, I see this already happening. They take initiative to cut tissue and stain it, but they cut it in the wrong orientation or thickness for that specific experiment and stained it incorrectly and destroyed the tissue, because they blindly followed a protocol. This tissue has fluorescent proteins, it can't be processed with antigen retrieval nor be labeled with 488 when GFP is already in the tissue. Etc.. \n\nScience now adays comes in a kit and that completely removes people's ability to think for themselves. Protocols have a place, even detailed protocols, but most things are more about understanding what you are doing and applying techniques accordingly rather than being a mindless drone.",

My biggest tips are cutting down on excess debris. For neurons that means removing as much of the processes from the ganglia your harvesting from. That debris is going to potentially block your cells from binding to your substrate. \n\nMy other advice would be to change your substrate. You could do a double coating, or have you ever tried matrigel? Everything sticks to it, even dead cells.\n\nFinally, find a contact in a lab (CC their PI, and maybe your PI as well) that has had some success with these cultures. Ask them for a virtual meeting. Lots of new students are afraid to ask their colleagues for help with protocols. Don't be. Half of my job as a lab coordinator is just blasting out emails to folks that know more then I do.",
