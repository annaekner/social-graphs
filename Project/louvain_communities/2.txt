[TOMT] A French word I thought was English that started with a C
Ok so this is a bit weird. There was this word I knew and used to think people used frequently, but when I searched it to confirm it's definition, it was French. It wasn't some word which could be used in both the English and French language like "concierge". I had to actually go onto a French to English online dictionary to find the definition. Or it was oftenly used in both languages and I'm just stupid. The word was about as long as 8-11 letters like "consequence". It started with a C, and the next letter was a vowel. So no words like "check". The vowel definitely wasn't "Y", and probably not "i" or "U". I don't think it had any accent marks either, or it had little to few. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and any and all help is appreciated!🩷 PLEASE HELP FRENCH PEOPLE!!🇫🇷
[Solving comment *(by Disastrous-Factor-44)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1d6rmhw/tomt_a_french_word_i_thought_was_english_that/l6unxro/): Contraire or chauffeur?
Could it be connaissant, as in knowing, which is where connoisseur comes from, which can be used in English as well?
Croissant
Crudités?
Connoisseur
You've sent me down a real rabbit hole with this question. Here are some possibilities:

connoisseur

chauvinist

chandelier

cabernet

camaraderie

contretemps

corsage

couture

complaisant
I thought long and hard about this: 
Could it be...?

-Contretemps
-Charlatan
-Cabaret
-Cache
-Couture
Are you certain it was a “C” or could it have possibly been “accoutrements”?
Cauchemardesque? 

There are a LOT of French words that start with C, but if you say it’s not a noun, there’s a good chance it’s an adjective. Here is a list of 1001 French adjectives starting with the letter C. http://www.cocoledico.com/dictionnaire-adjectif/lettre-c.xhtml?nbr=0
Chauffeur
do you  remember the definition, or in what context it gets used?
[Centenaire](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/french-english/centenaire)?
Coiffeur as in hair stylist.
Cul-de-sac
🇫🇷🇫🇷
Coquette?
[deleted]
Cavalier
crépuscule - meaning twilight?
Cretin
[removed]
Comme ci, comme ca?
Canard
do you remember anything related to the meaning or what part of speech it was?
Clairvoyant?
Croquembouche?
coup d'état
Chevalier?
cabaret, cabriolet, crème brûlée, cartouche
chanteuse?
You're not thinking about consigliere ? - which is a bit like concierge, not French, but sometimes used in English.
Calligraphie? casquette? Coloriage?
Cavalcade?
Doesn’t start with “c” but “qu’est-ce que c’est” sounds like it could and was in Psycho Killer by Talking Heads that was played a lot for a while because it was on Rock Band.
Copacetic?
cologne? Courtesan? Coucou? coup d'etat?
carrement
[removed]
Crochet?
Carreau?
[deleted]
Cochon, cochontuh, or conchonta? Possibly pronounced con-shun-tah. It was used in my family as another work for someone being or eating like a pig 🤷‍♂️ It actually is French for the word pig. Even my Italian wife used the word in her family circle before we met
"Cependant" (i.e. however)?
Caravanne 
Calembour
Chevalier
Corrosion
Corruption 
Capitulation
Cigarette 
And you don’t remember the definition of it?
Coucher?
Reconnoiter?
Carnage?
Comptoir
Cerises
Céleste
Célèbre
Canapé 
Calèche 
Colline
Cahier
Cabane 

?
Chaussures/chaussettes? Shoes/socks in English, starts with a c, is long, is not a fr/eng word, only problem is it’s ch, hope this helps
Info: Can you remember the meaning of the word?
Cognito?
Corpse?
Connoiter?
Caveat?
Carte blanche? Was it for sure a hard “c” sound? If not, maybe sommelier?
[removed]
cauchemar? meaning nightmare in french (which I knew), and is used in reference to sleep paralysis demon (which google just now told me!)
1000% sure it’s French? Capiche came to mind reading your description
Something like 36% of English words have french roots lol
Colonel
[removed]
Contrecoup?
adding some more: cataclysm, calligraphy, caricature, circumstance, civilian, coefficient, conscription, contagious
Cliché 

Perhaps ?
Chouette?
Crucifixion (doesn't end with a vowel, though).

Corvette.

Or maybe in your head, it sounds like it starts with a C. Something like Serviette.

Edit: another word came to mind. Calamity. I k ow you said it didn't end in Y, but maybe the plural calamities
Camouflage
Courvoisier
Coincidence?
Consolation?
Coquelicot?

They also said “or it *was* commonly used in both languages and I’m just stupid.” I wouldn’t consider OP to be stupid just because he was a bit mixed up about the word he’s thinking of.
OH MY GOSH!!! I'm so sorry I wasn't able to see this comment, but you got the word!! It was "contraire". This comment slipped through the cracks from the sheer amount of comments if this post!😅 Thank you so much though! You don't know how much this has been itching in my brain for the past years!!

[TOMT] Girl who wears all black” (kids show?)
My 4 year old is having a meltdown because he wants to watch “The girl who wears all black - black shoes and black socks and black clothes”.  She also broke her picture?  Picture frame maybe?  Not sure if this is a TV show, movie, or YouTube video.  Any help would be appreciated!  He’s pretty sharp so if I show him your suggestions he’ll say yes or no right away. 

Thanks so much!

Also - it’s not Marvelous, I suggested that, he’s saying this girl wears all black 🤷🏼‍♀️

Edit - he’s now saying she has a “ginormous stage” and she was singing with people but she was not playing any instruments. 

IMPORTANT EDIT #2 - he says this is a real person, not a cartoon. 😶 I believe this could be a music video!  Female dressed in black on a stage singing “loudly” into a microphone.  Other people are on stage playing instruments but she is not.  I’m guessing a band behind her. Fast song.  Somewhere a picture or picture frame breaks? 

EDIT 3:  MORE INFO - he says she is singing on a stage and also in her bathroom.
[Solving comment *(by brookefromwales)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1dwqzt6/tomt_girl_who_wears_all_black_kids_show/lbx53lj/): Maybe Kelly Clarkson’s “Since U Been Gone”?
Maybe Kelly Clarkson’s “Since U Been Gone”?
Hotel Transylvania?
Not really a kid's show (for 4 year olds anyway), but maybe Wednesday?
Lydia from Beetlejuice?
Could it be olivia rodrigos music video ”obsessed”?
Cybersix?
not a guess, but you can just check the video history if it was on youtube
Sam from Danny Phantom?
Vampirina?
Show him the band Evanescence.
I’m going out on a limb here, Posh Spice??
Was it The Hex Girls from Scooby Doo?? Someone suggested Sam but maybe Ember from Danny Phantom ??
I'm worried its Karma by Jojo siwa. But hopefully not
Jade from Victorious? She’s a singer who wears a lot of black.
The description made me think of Taylor Swift’s video for ‘Bad Blood’.
this might be a silly suggestion, but could it be Angela anaconda? it's in greyscale and it's like newspaper cut outs of what look like real people, but I haven't seen it in ages so I could be wrong 🤷🏼‍♀️🥲
Commenting
Vanessa from Phineas and Ferb?
i doubt this is it but is it the “i’d rather be me” music video from mean girls on broadway? the only thing i can think of that fits
Maybe ask in r/HelpMeFind they're pretty good about finding things with little information
Not saying you show your kid music videos from 30 years ago… but it sounded so familiar that I just watched the videos for What’s Up?and for B?$&h but no picture frame in either, but it sounds so familiar in a 90s video kind of way!  So curious to know what it is now!
If he watched it on YouTube you could browse through the history of watched videos with him to see which one it was
I know you've ruled out Wednesday. But maybe it's the Adams Family cartoon? Could be the incredibles - Edna meets the criteria.  I'd be surprised if it was, but, Daria?
Bunnicula? My kids loved that show when young
I'm pretty sure neither of these are right, but the two answers that come to mind are Betty Boop and Aeon Flux.
Missy Elliot the Rain. Hahahah.
Glastonbury and cochlea have been on recently maybe saw a stream of someone’s performance
Is it one of these godawful YouTube videos with bootleg Wednesday? https://youtu.be/QiR0aRQ02Ko?si=1z2Bv_g6-SV2lK2M my kids are always trying to watch these 
Try Maps - Yeah Yeah Yeahs?
Perhaps it's Hilary Duff? She wears all black in a few videos like this one. 
https://youtu.be/G7csF3BVQ5A?si=LLXgDONCqUteMyDD

Edit to add this one too from a movie.
https://youtu.be/uMsyO0sVLok?si=pqfwci7_ps5Jqpe5
[removed]
The Descendants? Live action Disney + show
Maybe Wicked? Is she green lol
Is it Lisa Loeb? She did a kids album in 2016 and some of its music videos are on YouTube. She sometimes wears all black!
The Descendants - Mal maybe?
[removed]
Is it the witch Helen from the Disney show Kiff? She's hilarious.
Lorde maybe?? Her older stuff from 2013
Could it be a music video? Catwoman? Batgirl?
[removed]
One of the girls from Blackpink, maybe Rose?
Could it be the music video for ‘Seven things’ by Miley Cyrus?
The live action Loud house show? There’s a daughter named Lucy who wears all black
[removed]
The Loud House? There's a Wednesday-type goth kid in it
Mabye the live action loud house show?
Maybe something lady gaga or Adele?
Burka Avenger maybe (cartoon)
An old one but Heart the band?
If it was watched on a computer,can't you look at the history to get an idea?
Simone Simons!
I was thinking maybe Bad Guy by Billy Eilish
Could it be Julie & the Phantoms on Netflix? I don’t remember her in all black the whole show but this was my first thought!
[removed]
Rebecca Black - Friday?
[removed]
Have you ever watched Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour with him?
Does you child watch reruns or do you make them watch old shows? Kind of sounds like it could be the Shadow segment from Bear in the Big Blue House?
Edit: If it's a youtube video, it might be the Bad Apple music video?
Could it have been someone on a show like America’s Got Talent? Or Lip Sync Battle? :)
could be so much lol

try looking through the youtube history, on youtube mobile you get to it by:


homepage > you > history > view all


im thinking maybe a recent eurovision performance like Aiko - Pedestal or Bambie Thug - Doomsday Blue. There were multiple "girl wearing all black on stage with band" this year, I think at least 4 or 5, so possible he came across one of those

Poppy's newest song New Way Out has her in all black and on a stage, no band behind her though
Not pop but maybe he’s seen a Poppy music video?
Rebecca Black Friday?
[removed]
OMGGG 

He says, “YESSSS!  This is the girl!! THIS is my favorite song!!” 

This has been driving us crazy all morning. You are amazing!!  👏 !solved!
Congratulations, you've been given 1 point for solving this post! You now have *2* points.
Ahh I was so confident this was it - we just watched one of these movies like 3 weeks ago.  He says it’s not her 😭 thank you though, great guess.
He’s now saying it’s an actual human person singing on a stage, not a cartoon.  So I’m now looking for a music video of a girl/woman in black singing an upbeat song into a microphone and somewhere in the video a picture or picture frame breaks?
I thought the same thing - maybe he saw her somewhere!?  Unfortunately it’s not it but thanks for trying.
Not this one, but thank you!
Was also thinking this
Thanks for the suggestion.  He said, “she doesn’t wear a cape.  She’s not a superhero.”
Not this one, but thank you!
Not this one, thank you!  I put an important update up top - I’m now thinking it’s a pop music video, not necessarily one geared to kids (but definitely would be OK if a kid watched it)
This is not what he was referring to - but we’re definitely going to put this on later!  Great stuff!
Such a good guess - this is along the lines of what I’m thinking it probably is - at least in terms of genre. It’s not her, but we do play pop music like this on YouTube and then let the algorithm decide what songs are next.
Unfortunately not, but thank you!
It was not… phew 😅
me too. although it opened the door for me to teach my kids about KISS lol
Not this one, although good guess - we do watch that one!
Wow, memory unlocked!  🔓 not this one, but thanks for trying!
Not this one, thank you though!
Good suggestion- I’ll try, thanks!
Not these, thank you. 

He’s now saying it’s an actual human person singing on a stage, not a cartoon.  So I’m now looking for a music video of a girl/woman in black singing an upbeat song into a microphone and somewhere in the video a picture or picture frame breaks?
Such a good one but sadly, it’s not it!!
Thankfully, no 😅
Not this one, but thank you!
He said not her 😭 thank you for trying.  It’s gotta be pop music though if it’s a “real life human” singing.
No 😔 he loved this though, so we will be watching a lot of this in the future lol
lol not Elphaba, but I wish he would get into some musical theater with me!  I showed him anyway and he goes, “Nooooo - she’s not a witch!!” Thanks for trying.
Not this one - but I’m putting this on my list to check out later.  I had no idea she released this!  Thanks for the suggestion.
He says no 😔
I like this direction, Lorde probably was in the rotation of music videos, but he’s saying no. 🫤
I’m thinking 100% has to be someone like this.  I haven’t found the right video yet - singing in the bathroom, rocking out on a stage?
Not this one, thank you!
Not this one, thank you!
It's not the band Babymetal is it? They wear all black and are pretty boppy. My son likes to watch them.
Hmm cartoon or real? Whats her hair color? Black im assuming. But if theres one or two more details I'm sure someone will get it.
Check history in youtube...maybe you get lucky and find it
‘So kiddos, there’s KISS, and then there’s this’
Start watching that video and it will eventually cycle back to the one your kid’s looking for.
[removed]
Bummer. I figured it was possible since she was a Disney kid and wore black in a few videos.
Gimme Chocolate!!!!
Cartoon.  Black hair.  He says there’s music?  Again, likely not extremely helpful 🥴
He’s now saying it’s an actual human person singing on a stage, not a cartoon.  So I’m now looking for a music video of a girl/woman in black singing an upbeat song into a microphone and somewhere in the video a picture or picture frame breaks?
I looked, no dice.  The thing is this kid has a crazy good memory - so when he says “I saw this yesterday” it literally means anytime within the past 2 years.
This is a solid suggestion.
I said "Why is she dressed like Gene Simmons/thedemonchild?" And shes like "Who's Gene Simmons?" Me: "give me the remote"
Ruby Gloom?
Not this one, but thank you.  Apparently he didn’t know what cartoon meant.  I’ve since showed him the difference and he’s adamant this is a real person.  I’m pretty sure it’s a music video or a live-action musical movie.

[TOMT][MOVIE] A movie my dad wants to watch but can't remember
So my dad was telling me about a movie but he can't remember the name.

The plot of the movie was that a family goes to a lake house with their daughters because the parents have issues. And then the daughter takes a boat over the lake to another house which is exactly the same as their house and the parents doppelgangers are there. Apparantly the doppelgangers are the "worst part" of the parents. The ending is that they drive home and the daughter and viewer is not sure if they are their real parents. Apparantly at the end the dad gets killed.

My dad said it was released in the last couple of years. He estimated 3, but could be a bit more.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks in advance! :D
Sounds like Superposition by [Karoline Lyngbye](https://letterboxd.com/director/karoline-lyngbye/)

My dad said the film only had white people in it. And its centerd around a lake in Scandinavia

[TOMT] Okay I feel like I'm going crazy bc I can't remember this movie and it's such a weird line that no one believes it's a movie and thinks I dreamed it! 
[TOMT]
I watched this movie when I was like....18? 19 maybe? Like 5 years ago but it wasn't new it was a couple years old. And I remember VERY little about it except it was a slasher film and the nerd was trying to get lucky with the big t!tty Goth girl. I don't even remember if he had clothes on but I think he was high or drunk, one of the 2 and singing a song that went *"Helicopter Dick, Helicopter Dick, Can't Get Pussy(may have been 'none') without Helicopter dick."* I know! It's such an odd line and he does this weird pelvic dance where it like swings kinda (that's why I can't remember if he had on clothes or not). Oh my God PLEASE HELP ME FIND THIS MOVIE SO PEOPLE BELIEVE ME! I've tried googling it or the "lyrics" but I can't think of it and don't remember what site I may have seen it on. I was told to come here. Not great quality movie, probably C-D budget.

Sanctuary; Quite a Conundrum? 

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2049518/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk
Not sure why or what to comment, I'd just really like some help finding this movie and my other one got removed bc I didn't comment within an hour...
I think those lyrics are from the song "three way" by the lonely island (the parody group with Andy Samberg from SNL). Maybe look for movies with Andy or that song?
What year did you see it? You mention your age but we don't know how old you are so we don't know how long ago you were 18 or 19. Could have been 2 years ago, could have been 30 years ago.
Slasher and big titty goth girl makes me think it’s a Troma movie?
Is it a movie called "Quite a Conundrum"
This isn't it, but it reminded me of the helicopter dick [scene from No Strings Attached](https://youtu.be/WV7velLMd7I?si=r-3sfHIEcWGpPv4E), which made me laugh.
The Slaughter? Came out in 2006.
It's not a horror movie so this isn't going to be what you're looking for, but there is a scene in Forgetting Sarah Marshall where he is naked and does a little "pelvic dance"... "I've got a surprise for youuuu."
[https://tv.yarn.co/](https://tv.yarn.co/)

This is the site I usually use to look for movies using lines spoken In them.
Very out of the blue guess but Pecker? John Waters, 1998. Probably too old for your movie but it’s the first thing that came to mind. Waters claims IIRC they basically invented helicoptering 🍆 for that movie.
Could be Night of the Living Dorks?

https://youtu.be/0Gbf1Rpvgzg?si=p1nOtUgfnZhzHWdx
Was it all in English? Bunny the Killer Thing (2015)
Bruno? I think there’s some helicopter dick action in that
Weird offer, but slasher and big titty Goth girl actually reminds me of Blair Witch 2, the movie we don’t speak of.
Here you go.

I doubt it had anyone from SNL in it, very low budget film. C-D budget.
About 5 years ago ish. It's like a D budget film.
That limits the possibility down to at least 1,000 movies
I thought the same thing but I looked. This has been driving me crazy for years lol
Lol that's funny
No but that looks interesting!
*slap, slap, slap*
Lol that's funny
No but that looks funny
I just checked. There weren't zombies it was just a killer.
Absolutely lol dumb American hs/college kids drinking a lot and basically doing all the party stuff. Some drugs, some s3x, some drinking, some killing. You know, the normal Young Adult. movie.
Lol definitely not Bruno I've seen that
Lol DEFINITELY not it
No it wasn't lady gaga it was just a c-d budget movie.
Maybe see if "three way" is the song you are thinking of (the lyrics go "helicopter dick, helicopter dick, to impress a chick do the helicopter dick") and if that is the correct song, you might be able to search what movies quote that song? Not sure if that would help give you additional search queries.
I mean that’s still fewer than “every movie ever”
I looked that isn't it. Lol why downvote me bc I said something legit about the movie?
True
I didn't downvote you, I am trying to help you find it! I thought it might be that song since the lyrics are so similar. I tried [quodb.com](http://quodb.com) to look for that specific quote but came up empty. Good luck with your search!
I wasn't saying you did it lol sorry I was laughing at whoever did 🤣 probably someone else I'm arguing with over the fact that someone should have something of theirs replaced if it was lent out and returned nasty when they didn't have permission to lend it out in the first place. But thank you for looking and introducing me to a new sound finding site.
[TOMT] What (probably cartoon) character is my 2 year old pretending to be?
So I have a 2 year old. He rules. He is also super vocal and has been talking a ton since he turned 1. 

We keep his [bath toys](https://www.shopdisney.com/toy-story-bath-set-461072272021.html) in the bucket they came in. 

Every night while he’s in there, he dumps out the toys, and puts the bucket on his head (kinda looks like a robot)🤖 , and says “I’m ____ _____.” In the past, I’ve thought he says “Hank evil” “hey evil” “very evil,” but I can’t figure out the character. I do think the second word is evil. 

I’ve asked him to repeat it a bunch, and every time I ask where it comes from, he just says “from the pumpkins.” This leads me to believe it’s some character who puts a pumpkin on his head. 

He watches a fair amount of TV, usually but not always Disney plus including a lot of the Muppet Babies (my first guess would be the Halloween episode), Bluey, PJ Masks, Paw Patrol, Super Kitties, Mickey Mouse, Dora, and a few other shows. Always cartoons or animated, and could be a movie too. 

Here’s the [vocaroo](https://voca.ro/1aDwbaKVCi4x) of our conversation tonight. 

UPDATE: here is an even clearer audio [vocaroo](https://voca.ro/1jJNTnDhvgdr).  

🚨 MORNING UPDATE: 🚨

Thank you to all you sleuths who’ve helped already. 

This morning he was watching Boss Baby in the living room and I rudely interrupted to have a very frustrating, but productive conversation with him about some of your suggestions. 

Here’s the full [video](https://imgur.com/a/4DsTiit), [(Part 2)](https://imgur.com/a/CR6hQEI), [(Part 3)](https://imgur.com/a/8QTyGDN),  [(Part 4)](https://imgur.com/a/X1HIXhv). Keep in mind he is 2. No he was not choking, his water could wait. 

An important note I’ve learned: if he says “no” it’s a definite no. If he says “yes” it’s a “maybe, if I’m currently paying attention to what you’re saying, but I might have stopped listening” so take any “yes” with a grain of salt. 

He’s also clearly not as familiar with the streaming services landscape as I’d like, but he’s getting there. 

Some key points: 
- It’s not Wall-e
- It’s definitely a character from something. He did not invent this. 
- it’s not some derivation of Jack Skellington
- Not any of the main shows he watches 
- He said it’s a movie 
- He said it’s on Netflix 
- it’s a boy, who gets scared and runs and flies. Might have wings. 

SO I EXITED BOSS BABY and started scrolling through Netflix with him. Here’s [that convo](https://voca.ro/17bDlAhPgCc2). 

TLDR, it might be something from the minions. He pointed to the main guy (Steve Carrel’s character). 

Forgot to mention: my wife is a speech language pathologist with kids and also can’t figure this out. 


UPDATE 2: we are making our way through all the despicable me movies and minions shows for the time being. Fairly confident it’s from that. 
Sam Eagle from the muppets
At first it sounded like he said Finding Nemo for the first words spoken.  

Sometimes it’s better to pretend you know but act like you don’t with toddlers.  Oh right that is the fish from finding Nemo but could be something else.

Ask him what the character looks like can help too.
Rarely has he said the first name in 2 syllables, so not positive if it’s one or two.

Also meant to mention we are in the US.

UPDATE: added a second (clearer) [vocaroo](https://voca.ro/1jJNTnDhvgdr) where he repeats it a few times.

Could it be that he is just inspired by Halloween season and imagines that by pulling a bucket on his head he turns into jack-o'-lantern, for which he has come up with his own name?
1. Is it possible that he's talking about decorations that were out for Halloween a few weeks ago? Did he see a Nightmare Before Christmas character blow-up in a yard among pumpkins? Or something like that?

2. When my kids said something I didn't understand, I always asked them to show me. Maybe you do and he says it's far away OR he immediately goes to the TV, even points you toward the streaming service.

Food for thought! Anyway, good luck! Kids are adorable and listening to you guys chat reminded me a lot of my son taking baths when he was little.
Is the bucket red? Animal? From the Muppets?
The name doesn't sound right, but the bucket on head and mention of pumpkins reminds me of the Scarecrow from "Spookley the Square Pumpkin."
Gonzo in the muppets babies wears a helmet and does the great gonzo/evel kanivel thing. He also wears a pumpkin on his head in the [Halloween episode](https://youtu.be/bIesNjA1O_4?si=6U1KSqr2K7yrCiog).
[deleted]
Someone mentioned that it sounded like he said something about Target. This is a super long-shot... 
There was that pumpkin ghoul decoration for Halloween that was at Target that went viral on Tiktok I think (I'm not on the platform but a friend was talking about it)... like, "I'm not a Jack O Lantern, My name is Lewis!" or something like that.
Here's a video, the whole, my name is Lewis part that I kept seeing online happens at about 55 seconds in. 
https://youtu.be/cF3vgi8qfbY?si=6bMDm3iPRlzYstIx
There is an episode of the animated series Over the Garden Wall with characters with pumpkin heads, but it's not really in the toddler age range so seems unlikely. The biggest pumpkin-head is named Enoch.

It sounds like the Toy Story image in your post is just to show what toys came with the bucket, but if he's thinking of a Toy Story character, the first one that came to mind with a bucket-shaped head is "Evil Emperor Zurg."
Honey Beagle from Bluey. She wears [green glasses](https://blueypedia.fandom.com/wiki/Honey) so maybe that’s what’s inspired him
I have no idea but I have to say that was the cutest thing I ever heard.
If he says he's evil with a bucket on his head it might be from the [SpongeBob SquarePants Movie](https://youtu.be/uWRQmxHC4JA?feature=shared), maybe he's trying to say "from Plankton" the main villain of the movie who uses remote controlled bucket hats to enslave the city's residents.
Evel kenievel and the bucket is like a helmet!
Eva? From Wall-E?

I don't understand the "heh", but I can see how the bucket would work for making him feel like Eva. "From the pumpkins" could possibly be "from the cartoons".
I played the Vocaroo for someone who works with toddlers, she said the first part it sounds like he's saying "Halloween"
I think you're kid is trying to say "I'm invisible".
I'm sad because I thought my 4 year old could translate this for me, but she also said it sounded like "hono evil" and didn't know what it could be from.
Super random but my first obscure thought was “head evil”? Like maybe when the mayor from nightmare before Christmas has an “evil head”? Maybe the bucket is like his hat? And that could be “from the pumpkins”?
Could he be making something up?
Harry and his bucket full of dinosaurs!!!

Edit:spelling
I have no idea, but I'm fully invested in finding out. You two are the literal cutest. I thought I was going to die laughing from your confused "Who??" questions. I'm actually crying laughing.
I’m wondering if he is saying he is “very evil” or “turning evil” and instead of pumpkins he’s saying bucket.  Like he’s turning evil from wearing the bucket.   

Like pretending that when he wears the bucket on his head it makes him very evil?
This has to be THE sweetest TOMT, ever!

I really hope he's saying "you're an owl"

Who?

You're an owl.

Who?

You're an owl.

Who?
Rolie polie olie? They are robots.
Is he possibly saving "Dr. Meanzo", which is Gonzo's alter ego in Muppet Babies?
This is a pretty far stretch, but when my sister and I were small kids she was insistent that she wanted to be “evil” for Halloween. After a long period of questioning, my mom figured out that what she actually wanted was to be a *devil*. Is it possible that “evil” is just a kid-ism of some other word, and the bucket on the head represents “ghost” or “dark” or something else scary?
Sam the Eagle, or Sam Eagle, could be why the first name sounds like 2 syllables? 

Absolutely adorable.
Is he pretending to be the Bank of Evil from the despicable me movies? Like he’s being a building with the tub on his head?
Could it be “Bank of Evil”? [the video where little Gru says it.](https://youtu.be/U3V3ZTdCzoQ?feature=shared)
My guess is Gru when he's wearing the space helmet to shrink the moon in Despicable Me. Gru is always trying so hard to be evil and going on and on about his evil plans. 

But I'm not sure exactly what he's saying in the bathtub. Maybe "I'm evil" and not Hank Evil? And the pumpkins are the minions?
My 3 year old is adamant that the baby (your son) is saying "Hello Evil", a line from the movie Bad Guys. He said Mr. Snake wears a hat and the baby is saying Hello Evil from the movie.
Sesame Street had “it’s pumpkin day” featuring Elmo in a hat, recently. Has a catchy tune even.
I can kinda hear "Hannibal", and I'm reminded that Hannibal Lecter used to wear one of those face masks, but I don't think your child would be watching such movies at his age.

Could it be he watches any series with mecha/robot characters?
I've been listening to the 2nd vocaroo exclusively, but I just listened to the 1st vocaroo, and when you ask him what that's from, it sounded to me like "Wonder ___ Kids".  I found a series called Wonder Grove Kids, and when I listen to the vocaroo, that could really be what he's saying.  Is this anything someone might put on for him?  They have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbmyHlr6pMk).  I have no idea if they air on actual television or if they are just web limited.

I've watched a few 3 minute episodes now looking for ones that might involve a bucket or a robot, and haven't found any that are conclusively linked to the character he's identifying as.  The three main kids seem to be Dee, Chris, and Peter.  Peter could maybe work for the two syllable last name with a long e sound, but most of the things I've found involving buckets or odd hats feature Chris, so  there's that.

Is this series familiar to you?  If so, possibly worth trying to track down the episode that might be making the link for him.
Maybe finding Nemo when he and his dad are in the bucket at the zoo?
Would he be able to describe more about the character if you asked him?  Not just who he is or what he's from, but things like what he does, what he looks like, what he says, etc?
There’s a character from Despicable Me called Ms. Hattie. She is “evil”. So maybe he is imitating another character and reenacting a scene where someone is saying Ms. Hattie is evil?  
There’s also a character named Eva, so it might be worth checking out.
To me it sounded like he was saying the 2 year old version of “Halloween,” so he’s pretending to put a pumpkin on his head and saying “I’m Halloween!”
Best fit seems to be Vector Perkins, juvenile supervillain from _Despicable Me_ - absolutely from the minions’ universe! 
 
I think your son also said the word rocket once or twice, which is another clue that fits. Victor’s dad is the president of the bank of evil - that’s why he says the word ‘evil’ maybe? 🤔
 
Victor wears a flying suit with a helmet - I think that’s what the bucket on the head is representing.
 
Now, I’m also wondering if he’s gotten a bit mixed up with villains’ names… as there’s one from _Minions_ called Herb Overkill? It’s a complex universe, so can’t really blame him!
The Toy Story toys + evil robot makes me just to Zurg in Toy Story?
Could it be this talking Tom cartoon? They stop the evil ghost/pumpkin by putting the trash lid on him. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2wZOTOoDBVg
Now it occurred to me that since the bucket is transparent, could it turn into a SPACE HELMET when pulled over the head? However, I don't know how space and pumpkins go together...:-D
I don't have a better guess than Sam Eagle but it sounds to me like he's saying one word, not two.
One of the Lilo & Stitch sequels (and maybe the TV show also) has a villain named Hamsterviël. No connection to pumpkins.
could he have watched the  spongebob Movie?the first one where plankton makes  everyone wear buckets
Could it be Haribo the gummi bears? Maybe he received some when trick-or-treating, hence 'from the pumpkins'?
I know you said his name is Jack so he'd just say that, but Jack the Scarecrow is from Spookley The Square Pumpkin and they've been showing a lot of the music videos lately on Disney Jr AND he wears a bucket on his head. Or, his head is a bucket. Could he be saying "Scarecrow"?
Are there any characters that are astronauts? The clear bucket could be an astronaut helmet?

Could you take a picture of your kiddo, then show kiddo the picture, and say, “can you draw that for me?”  That’s how I finally understood who my daughter was dressing up as when she was little.

(My daughter would run around the house with blue swimsuit bottoms on her head. To her that was enough to “dress up” as Sonic the Hedgehog! 😂 Her drawing was CLEARLY Sonic, that’s how she saw herself 😂💗)
Try posting this on r/toddlers. There are some incredible Toddlerese translators on there.

Edit:  See [“keekeecahcah" solved](https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/s/0qLWKGWrfy), lol.
Is it possible he doesn't know the name of the character he's imitating, so he's using a bit of dialogue related to the character as their name?
Why am I so invested in this, lol? Kids really are like little drunk adults aren't they.
Honestly, this should be a game show. A panel of contestants interviewing babies to decipher their code. 😂 Thanks for the laughs!
Pinnochio?
Could he have seen Jack Skellington?
Mighty Eagle from Angry Birds.
It sounds like Captain Evil to me
I have no ideas, but that audio was cute to listen to!
The meter sounds like magneto, who wears a helmet. Any chance you'd had xmen on while he's around?
Is he saying WALL·E and Eve? Like from the Disney movie WALL·E.
I heard something eva like from wall-e
This is all so wonderful! My guess is a mishmash of things, and he may have created his own little character.
In the Lego Batman movie the Joker (I think) says “hey evil army”. Could he be quoting that?
a veeeeeeeeeeery long shot but you wouldnt happen to watch AEW, a wrestling program? sounds like hes saying "very evil" and theres a wrestler who wears face paint named danhausen who has a saying of "very nice, very evil"
Bunsen Honeydew dresses up like Devo (with a red bucket on his head) in the episode "Oh my gourd" which is about pumpkins.

I don't think he gets a name that sounds like this though.
Has he watched The Lion King recently? It kind of sounds like maybe he’s saying “hyena” and there is a scene in “Be Prepared” where the hyenas are wearing skull helmets. It’s around 1:10 in [this video.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=08-uyfp2iPM&feature=shared)

It’s probably a stretch and I have no clue how pumpkins factor into it but my daughter latches onto random scenes like that so worth a shot!
Wall-E? Trying to be a robot with the bucket. And saying "Hey Eve" which sounds like "Hey Eva" kind of.
Sounds to me like Headless Evil. The Headless Horseman is usually shown with a pumpkin head. Could he have seen the Disney version of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow?
For some reason it reminds me of Wall-e and the way he says “Eve-uh!” But there are no pumpkins and I don’t think he has a bucket on his head at any point. Trash, maybe but I can’t remember for sure.
It sounds like "Captain Evil" to me. Wild guess, but were there any jack O lanterns he saw at other houses, during Trick-or-treating, or otherwise, that he said he liked? He could be emulating that look and doesn't know the name because it's not a kids TV character.

I also posit Dr. Evil from Austin Powers, and the bucket is his bald head, but I'd have no clue how he'd have seen him given the programming you said he watches!
MORNING UPDATE: 

Thank you to all you sleuths who’ve helped already. 

This morning he was watching Boss Baby in the living room and I rudely interrupted to have a very frustrating, but productive conversation with him about some of your suggestions. 

Here’s the full [video](https://imgur.com/a/4DsTiit). Keep in mind he is 2. No he was not choking, his water could wait. 

An important note I’ve learned: if he says “no” it’s a definite no. If he says “yes” it’s a “maybe, if I’m currently paying attention to what you’re saying, but I might have stopped listening” so take any “yes” with a grain of salt. 

He’s also clearly not as familiar with the streaming services landscape as I’d like, but he’s getting there. 

Some key points: 
- It’s not Wall-e
- It’s definitely a character from something. He did not invent this. 
- it’s not some derivation of Jack Skellington
- Not any of the main shows he watches 
- He said it’s a movie 
- He said it’s on Netflix 
- it’s a boy, who gets scared and runs and flies. Might have wings. 

SO I EXITED BOSS BABY and started scrolling through Netflix with him. Here’s [that convo](https://voca.ro/17bDlAhPgCc2). 

TLDR, it might be something from the minions. He pointed to the main guy (Steve Carrel’s character).
Sounds like he’s saying Hey Eva like from Wall-e. Has he see that? Maybe the bucket is to make him look like a robot?
Is it possible he's not saying "Evil" but "ville" as in the ending of a town name? So instead of "Hank Evil" it would be "Hankyville"? Is there a town in a kids cartoon with name similar to that with a pumpkin patch?
Bit of a reach here- but Despicable Me has a ‘Bank of Evil,’ so maybe it’s a character from there?
Donny (A minion) from “Despicable Me 2” With a jelly jar on his head
One other thought - 

When "The Great Pumpkin" (Snoopy) rises out of the pumpkin patch, the moon backgrounds his head.  And he's a Beagle, which sounds like Evil...
Since he’s sure it’s from Minions, what about Herb Overkill? The bucket could be the crown?

https://despicableme.fandom.com/wiki/Herb_Overkill#google_vignette
Can’t we pick this child up from daycare early? The internet needs answers Jack
Could he be pretending to be Gru when he’s dressed like [this](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/e6874483-fb47-46d5-8c98-bca53382a560/scale-to-width/755)
Big Hero? Like Baymax maybe?
  u/Blatb00m  

Spookley the Square Pumpkin was on Netflix and Jack the Scarecrow wore a bucket on his head. The pumpkin does get launched in the air and flies.  

[Jack from Spookley](https://imgur.com/a/pVZZTeD)  

[Clip of the pumpkins calling Spookley evil](https://youtu.be/TqPgC3rDvVA)
Evil Bratt from Despicable Me 3? He has that funky hairstyle that could look like a bucket on his head..
I feel very invested in this - I know how frustrating it is to not know what your kids are talking about. He’s very verbal too and pretty easy to understand. Is it possible to check your watch history to see what it might be? I’d check both Netflix and Peacock, as he said Netflix like Mario, but you said Mario was on Peacock, but then latched onto Netflix. I’d be inclined to think that it was the same streaming service he watched Mario on. Total long shot that doesn’t at all match what he is saying, but Netflix has a movie call Spookley the Square Pumpkin, and the scarecrow character looks just like your kid when he put the bucket on his head.
Can I just say you and your wife deserve to be parents of the year!  Your little guy is perfect!  He has at 2 years old captivated an entire world literally hanging in his every word!!!
Is he still doing this? Any new clues?
Im desperate for an update on this lol
Evil Knieval had a character in the last Toy Story, that’s likely it
It may not be a character. He may have made up a villain “He’s Evil” to be a bad guy for all his toys.
Zurg from Toy Story?
The last part sounds like eebo or something like that.
Eva from wall-e?
Sounds like Return to Oz.
Could he have watched 'over the garden wall' ? There's a village of characters that wear pumpkins on their heads.
There’s a character on Bear and the Big Blue House that wears a bucket on his head - Yucker Tutter I think?
I thought it sounded like “Halloween”
Maybe EVE from WALL-E?? Sounds like he’s saying EVE the way WALL-E does ?
Eve from Wallie? It sounds like Wallie saying her name
is he saying medieval? like a medieval helmet? might sound like it on the vocaroo
Has he watched Finding Dory? Hank the Octopus? 

A bit of a stretch but it could be “hank evil” and “bucket” rather than pumpkin?  The octopus is orange and crawls into containers, that’s all I got 😂
Could he be saying Wereanimal? Muppets Babies has a Halloween episode where Animal becomes Wereanimal and wears a pumpkin helmet at some point
Fievel from An American Tail?  His hat was very important to him.
Something we do with our kids is get them bath crayons and we guess what they’re drawing. This feels very similar
I lost the reply, but my daughter agrees with the "bank (of) evil" one.

Can't wait to see this solved!
Could he mean “Herb Overkill” from Despicable Me?

No idea where the pumpkin comes into it though 😂 Although Herb does make all kind of funky gadgets, including a hypno hat…
He’s definitely telling you he’s a hero from target in the first one 😂

And Harry Evil in the last one. 

Does he watch Henry Danger on Netflix? 

I used to have kids show me what they were talking about, they’d run to me when a show was on or being me a toy. Ask him-he clearly has the ability to show you! 

Also, your kid sounds adorable!
Maybe "Hank Nemo?" There's an octopus in Finding Dory named Hank, and he carries Dory around the aquarium in a bucket. There's also a scene where he reveals he's terrified of being touched by humans, and swims away (which might look like flying).
is he a character from hotel transylvania 2. Dracula? Frankenstein? I know they call Frankenstein frank in that movie.
If it’s on Netflix then go to your recently watched.
First of all, he talks just like my nephew (he's 5 now), so cute! Secondly, have you tried Over the garden wall? There's a particular episode where there are skeletons who put pumpkins on their heads and they're considered evil at first. There's also a giant pumpkin head that's supposed to be their God or something, idk. It aired on cartoon network, but maybe it's there in netflix too?
Hey Arnold? There’s an episode with a pumpkin, and they have some crazy hair dos that he could be imitating with the bucket?
From Hank is Evil: The Movie? https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3468802/mediaviewer/rm1400557569/?ref_=tt_md_1 

It’s a guy in a top hat.
Apologies if someone has already suggested this, but I wonder if it's Bruno from Encanto ... 

Around 1:35 in this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIOHX-jbFdM

He makes the spackle.
He’s a haribo. From one of the Halloween pumpkins with candy in them. He’s probably the fella in the rocket on the Starmix packaging.
There are three Halloween specials on Netflix with the “Super Monsters” characters. One of the monsters is a vampire/bat so he flies. On one of the covers he is coming out of a pumpkin. There are also characters named “Henri” and “Igor”
Has he possibly seen Megamind? Trying to emulate the big head, the whole movie is about him being evil and all. Could it be that?
I don't know who he's talking about, but I did have a similar experience recently with my daughter.

She was telling me about some princess character that I didn't recognize.  So I asked her a bunch of similar questions.  She kept acting frustrated that I didn't know who she was talking about.  She was giving me all sorts of details about how she had a show and there were 5 seasons, etc.  Eventually, I realized she was just making up a new character and asked her if she was making up the character and she said "yes!"

So yeah there's a chance he's just trolling you.  My kids are great at trolling us.
I'm pretty sure he is saying "he's evil" and likely quoting a line a character says in a film instead of pretending to be a specific character named 'Hank Evil.' Maybe from the Mario movie or Minions or the SpongeBob Movie. Like some minor character is talking about a major character and commenting on how they are evil and hiding in a shell (or something).
A character from the How to Train Your Dragon franchise? The dragons can fly and a lot of the characters wear helmets.

Maybe one of the Vikings in Tangled? Big scary looking dudes but they're actually all softies at heart. At least one has a face covering helmet.
Does he know Darth Vader? And maybe thinks his name is something evil?
Could it be from the The Great Pumpkin from the Charlie Brown /Snoopy cartoon ??
I searched “pumpkins Netflix  kids” and Spookley the Square Pumpkin came up which appears to feature a scarecrow with [helmet](https://imgur.com/gallery/BFte4Pq) on.   
  
I also found [this article](https://crazylifewithlittles.com/little-kid-halloween-movies-on-netflix-right-now/), you can try showing him the pictures from the other shows.   
  
I did see your update and it seems he may be referring to Gru from Minions, did you know that original movie is called Despicable Me, maybe he’s trying to pronounce that. FWIW, the DM movies used to be on peacock earlier this year.
Hahahha the intensity I can imagine OP is wanting to know cracks me up. “Who?… who? … who?”

If this was my child I would want to know just as much as OP probably. Chances are that your son is using his imagination and made a character up?
Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space?
I was about to wonder if it's the [boss of the Bank of  Evil](https://despicableme.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Perkins) from Despicable Me but I don't know if they say the words "Bank of Evil" and I doubt he can read.
Could it be green goblin from the new Disney plus Spider-Man amazing friends? He throws pumpkins and is evil/a bad guy. His hat is kind of bucket like!
Has he seen Encanto? There's a part where Bruno puts a bucket on his head and calls himself Hernando.
At first it sounds like he kept saying "her evil" but it's so hard to tell. Maybe it's something with a female villian? I've been through this with all of my kids and once you figure it out you're going to do the biggest eyeroll ever lmao. The way he says punkin is so cute! It reminded me of that viral video of the guy who kept making his mom try to say pumpkin pie but she couldn't say pumpkin
By any chance does he neigh while doing this?
What a nice baby
at the begining of descpicable me 2 there's some minions wearing buckets like kinghts
So there are two possibilities and both are long-shots.

**1.** He may be repeating something said and not a character's name.  There's a point in the "Minions" movie where Bob becomes the King of England.  So he might be saying, "hail King Bob!"   He also might just be saying, "I'm evil," after mimicking putting on a helmet or mask.

**2.** Netflix tends to show previews for other shows at the end of movies or when you hit the end of the last season of a show.  He might be mistaking another character for being in the Minions movie because of this.  The movie "Igor", which isn't made by Illumination (though it's also 3D animated with a character shaped like an inverted triangle), is also on Netflix currently.  So he could be saying "I'm Igor."
Here's some movies and shows I found not a lot but they could be it. 

1: Spookly the square pumpkin
2: Dreamworks Spooky Stories
3: Super Monsters Save Halloween

I'll look some more also but these could be a good place to start since he's 2 and probably watches animations
Head evil!
Lmao it’s vector
Could he be using it as a pirate hat and saying Santiago?
Honestly, it sounds like he's saying "Im pretty evil" but I'm not familiar enough with toy story to know if it's a line from that
It’s a Halloween costume that he saw.
Early childhood teacher here!  What I hear is “head of evil.”  Any chance there is a Halloween episode of one of these shows where they say they’re fighting the head of evil?  Maybe someone entranced by a pumpkin head
Has he seen Hercules?  Perhaps “Hades Evil”?  
The bucket part is a mystery though
I think he’s just trying to say, “Finding Nemo”! I think it’s that simple.
Sounds like he's saying Harry Epo
Maybe Harry Potter?
I think in the first one he is saying something about the bucket
Is he WALL-E? A little robot guy (hence the bucket) and he's friends with another robot called EVE. THE WAG WALL-E says her name sounds kind of lok "Eve-a." Skip to about 2:40 and you can hear them talking.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XOu0bBh19rs
WTF, does this kid do anything but stare at a screen?
[deleted]
[deleted]
Could it be from My Big Big friend where Yuri goes to a party as a robot?
When my kids were starting to talk and it was hard to make out, I would ask them to show me. Can you ask him, when he is out of the tub, to show you who he is pretending to be when he is in the tub?
Does he watch YouTube kids? It sounds like he's saying "Harry" (I'm not sure about the second word, maybe people? Maybe from the cartoon [Harry and His Bucket Full of Dinosaurs.](https://youtu.be/8V2UAip5Kww?feature=shared).
I have no idea, I keep hearing "Hannah Eva" and that means nothing to me.
could it be over the garden wall? its CN not Disney but maybe there’s some of it online and he’s seen it. there’s an episode where chatacters wear pumpkins as clothes and hats
Ok, could it be this??
Kids YouTube video, the girl and channel is called Eva, and there’s a scary pumpkin character 

https://youtu.be/cyCo4CIt2gI?feature=shared
[I have no idea.](https://www.amazon.com/Barry-Learns-Brave-Little-Eagle/dp/1098632370)
Could it be Dr. Meanzo (gonzos evil superhero alter ego) from muppet babies? Or Meaninal (animals evil superhero)
Could it be Green Goblin from the Spider-Man and his amazing friends Disney Junior show? 

From one of the episodes I saw with my nephew he was throwing Jack-o-lanterns filled with laughing gas around.
It sounds like he's saying hyena, like maybe Lion King?
I just hear Harry Evil but I have no idea who that is.
Halloween
Hernando or Jorge from Encanto? the ones where bruno puts the bucket on his head lol
"I'm hella evil"

Better sleep with one eye open brother
Sam the eagle from muppet babies?
It sounds like it starts with a P
Could it be from the Minions: Rise of Gru and the way he says Bank of Evil? https://youtu.be/TU_cMIc2j3E?si=fVGqkXtDESMY0vBs
Could be a character he has invented entirely!
Just sounds like he's saying I'm halloween
Jack the Scarecrow from Spookly the Square Pumpkin?
Daddy Evil 😈
Astro Kid/Terra Willy?
Arpo?
Ron's Gone Home?
Those are all the robots I can think
This may have been suggested already in the comments and I missed it but the bucket is clear and it has a Buzz Lightyear toy in it...could it be Buzz and the clear bucket is the clear faceplate/ dome of Buzz's helmet? The "(blank) evil" could be him trying to say "Lightyear." Or possibly "Evil Emperor Zurg" and it's supposed to be Emperor Zurg? Zurg had a bucket shaped head...once again this may have been said already...over 600 comments I may have missed it
Could it be Vector from Despicable Me? He’s orange and goes to space.
In the video you posted I heard “time kids” not pumpkins
A minion? They look like buckets or pumpkins and are said to be evil in the minions movie. Also Gru head is pumpkin shaped.
Hey Arnold? His head is pumpkin shaped too.
I want it to be [Grim & Evil](https://youtu.be/B4BzOWOTb1Q?si=uZvAG_Nq1-D0Lnlu) because Evil con Carne is a brain in a jar on top of a bear's head, but I don't imagine your kiddo is watching that 🤣
He might be wild knuckle from Minions: Rise of Gru considering he keeps pointing him out and may have made up a name bc he forgot it. Wild Knuckle is a very dad like character so he may like him bc it reminds him of you.
Possibly Vector from despicable me?
There's a scene from minions [here](https://youtu.be/HENVx4Xg2P4?feature=shared) where the pilot minion says something that sounds similar at around 2:40. Keeping in mind minions don't speak English. There is a scared boy on the plane in this scene too
Mighty eagle angry birds
Is it Herb Overkill from minions?
Captain underpants? There’s a character named Harold whose head kind of looks like a bucket. Also have a Halloween special…Captain underpants has a cape and flies
Grim and Evil?
SLP here! also trying to figure this out based on speech sound errors/patterns across videos. would love to see a speech sample of him just talking a bunch to see if i can figure it out 🤔 (also not super familiar with all the kids shows these days but i do work with kids so i’m determined!!)
Buzz Lightyear? He flies and runs, has wings, has his own movie...
I can sort of hear, "I'm Eeyore."
Has anyone suggested a character from the Cuphead series on Netflix? There are a bunch of “evil” characters that work for the Devil, one has a square head like game dice. My 4y/o niece is obsessed with the show and she was dropping terms like Carn-evil (the evil carnival) and I had no idea what she was talking about! :)
It sounds like captain evil but I have no idea what that could be
From “emo” (Nemo?) and friends with a bucket. Could it be Gerald the seal or Becky the bird?
Zero from NBC?
Iron giant ?
It’s snoopy (the beagle) red baron The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown.
Maybe it's 2001: A Space Odyssey? there's Hal 9000 and there's an article about him being evil, additionally it's a movie that was on netflix a while ago idk if it's on there now
There's a Halloween short movie on Netflix called Spookly the Square Pumpkin.

I don't know if there's a character in it with a similar name to what 2yo's saying, but it's close enough to Halloween that it may have come up, it's on Netflix, and "Pumpkins"!
Sounds like Harry evil. (At first I thought he said "Devo." The band with flower pots on their heads.)
No Noggin from the Curious George halloween movie comes to mind. Although it doesn't necessarily sound like the examples you provided. Same number of syllables though.
Maybe Over the Garden wall? There’s a character with a pumpkin for a head in that I swear
I think it’d be funny if he’s saying “I’m Bane” from Batman
Can you ask him to draw a picture? I get that he’s 2 but it may help a little…
Captain Underpants?
Hey Evo, Hey Eva? 

Sounds like an ad.
Could it be a Halloween movie? Netflix has one about "Spookly: The Square Pumpkin and one of the characters has something on his head.
Dr. Evil
Was gonna say jack skellington maybe worzel gummage?
Someone from box trolls  or a nightmare before Christmas's thingamajig (like the mayor or boogie boogie (or the trick or treater's)
Bowler hat man!!!
A viking?
Could it be Spookley the Square Pumpkin?
Okay so just my hot take: in the minions rise of gru there’s a scene where “fly like an eagle” is playing and maybe he’s combined the scene and “fly eagle” into the scene in his head cannon

They take the pilot hats and the fly like an eagle song plays and they fly the plane. Perhaps??
I hear finding Nemo. I’ve listened to it like 10 times and I just hear Finding Nemo.
Hattie from despicable me?
Dekker moon boots from boss baby? But Tim as dekker. He puts a bucket on his head to be an astronaut and solve crimes.
It's not The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown , is it?
It's buzz light year....
That looks like it might be from Spookly the Square Pumpkin. The scarecrow guy has a bucket thing on his head. I am like 99% sure that it’s on Netflix
I’m hearing “finding Nemo.”
There’s a kids movie on Netflix called ‘Spookley the Square Pumpkin’, that has a character (a scarecrow) wearing a bucket on his head.
There's apparently a character from despicable me named Herb Overkill... closest sounding name I could find from the minions universe
The scarecrow from Spookely the Square Pumpkin? It's on Netflix
To me it kind of sounds like he’s saying Halloween (something) like Halloween bowl or something sounding similar
Could he be saying “spy kids” instead of pumpkins? Pls update us!!!
spookley the square pumpkin?
Maybe it's the I'm not a jack-o-lantern I'm lewis. But he thinks it says I'm evil.
Is it jack (the scarecrow) from Spookley the Square Pumpkin?
Could be vector from the first despicable me movie or I think it could just be gru, would make sense why he's saying evil because they are super villains, Im sure in one of those movies they probably say "I'm evil" while putting on some kind of hat lol
How about [Over the Garden Wall](https://www.google.com/search?q=pumpkin+head+cartoon&rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS1062US1062&oq=pumpkin+head+car&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgBEAAYgAQyBwgCEAAYgAQyBggDEEUYOTIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIICAcQABgWGB4yCAgIEAAYFhgeMggICRAAGBYYHtIBCDg1MTVqMWo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:99d4496e,vid:FR4-Wu3pY28,st:0)?
Could he be saying “The Penguins”? Referring to The Penguins of Madagascar? Maybe a character from the show?
Dr. Nefario? El Macho?
netflix? superwings?? it was on netflix atleast in north America
Maybe 'The Angry Beavers, Baron Bad Beaver'
Not sure what he’s saying but he may be referring to the Halloween move Spookley the square pumpkin. The scarecrow wears what looks like a bucket on his head. It is on Netflix.
Might be a longshot but spookley the square pumpkin,
OP! Did you ever figure out what he was saying?  Hope you are well.  :)
He's SO cute!

Poor little kids!  They try so hard to be understood and it just doesn't happen.  They patiently repeat themselves over and over until we understand or just pretend to.

I will never get over how amazing it is that little ones are able to learn their first language without another language to explain the one they're learning.  I speak English, and I've been trying for decades to learn Spanish, and I'm still not there.
Did we ever have any more breakthroughs on this?
My Magic Pet Morphle? Spookley the Square Pumpkin? I hope he's not saying Hannibal, although I haven't seen the movie so I don't know if there are any pumpkins or buckets in it.
I was hoping this would be solved by now! 😭
Why do I find this oddly wholesome
Could it be vector from despicable me when he's on the moon
Well mine would have probably meant Sam from Trick 'r Treat....sometimes Gage from Pet Semetary.
This is a good guess - I’m going to ask him tomorrow if he’s Sam and he’ll give a clear answer either way.
And it sounded like he said "Sam the Eagle" the first two times. (adding the "the") 

Sam eagle is also sometimes called "Sam the Eagle"  At least he was back in the 80's.
And the muppets is pretty close to the pumpkins
Agree, both looks like a buckethead and explains the 2/1 syllable
Listening to the Vocaroo, there's absolutely no way it can't be this. I'd put money on it.
I always miss the muppet posts.
“the eagle” is definitely my vote. Must be muppets.
This is definitely it.
Yes! The bucket spout looks like a beak. And OP said “might have wings” so it’s likely it’s Sam. 

OP, could you show him a box of crayons and ask him to pick the colour of the character. 

I mean showing him photos on Google would help too but it could be fun deducing.
> pretend you know

> but act like you don’t

I understand both these things separately… but not together?
I was going to say finding Nemo too and he is orange like a pumpkin
Yes. Pretend you know, act like you don't. I have used this strategy several times.
I agree that he is saying finding Nemo. And I don’t hear pumpkin I hear bucket. So I absolutely think he is talking about finding Nemo in a bucket. 
Show him that scene in the Dory movie and see if that is it. 
I have a child with speech deficits so I’m used to deciphering and having these conversations to figure it out. Side note: my daughter has gotten REALLY good at describing things because I ask her to describe a word when I don’t understand it (to keep her from feeling frustrated by asking her over and over and over). 
Best tip of the tongue post btw :)
This is my vote- Finding Nemo and he's Nemo in the bucket!
I heard this too. And I thought maybe "pumpkins" could be "popcorn" at first from Finding Dory (when the bird carries them in the bucket, then sees friends eating popcorn and joins them, then gets popcorn container stuck on her head.) But it could be as simple as Nemo being orange like pumpkins.
I thought about this and something with Jack Skellington, but oddly enough his name is Jack so I’m confident he would say “Jack o lantern” if it was
Nice tip I’m going to try that tomorrow
Bucket is clear. He loves animal, and it could be a character animal plays, but def not what he’s saying.
Yeah that's what I was thinking or plankton from SpongeBob SquarePants but none of what he said sounded like it.  I swore I'm hearing him say "Dr Evil" or "Harry Evil"
I think this is it. 

It's on Netflix. There are a lot of pumpkin characters. The Scarecrow is called Jack, Jack wears a bucket on his head, and Jack officiates the Jack A Lympics games.

I think he's calling Jack "Jack A Lympic."
So I just rewatched both Halloween episodes, and never names himself. It’s bizarre because one whole episode is about fozzie picking a spooky costume (“the noodler”)
oh this one’s good
It does sound like he says Eeyore in the first video!
And “from the pumpkins” could be that they saw it at Target during the Halloween season when there were pumpkin decorations decorating and sold at the store… so let’s say he saw whatever it was next to a Halloween display at the store so he thought the pumpkins were part if it?
This is the most likely answer.
Exactly what I thought of
[deleted]
Came here to mention Over the Garden Wall as well since the younger brother, Gregory, wears a teapot on his head and episode 2 is them visiting a bunch of pumpkin people
Oooooo good guess I will ask him
I don't think they ever call her beagle though. I didn't even realize honey was supposed to be a beagle
Yeah, I'm stumped, but the way that kid says "From the Puumpkins!" made me so happy.
I’m cracking up from the WHO? WHO? x10
This was my guess too!! 
“All hail Plankton!!!”
Do kids today have any exposure to Evel Kenievel? God, he was such a cultural icon. Do we have an equivalent kind of person, who’s famous for something other than sports or performance?
OP THIS!!! Disney + has Dinsey XD shows and Kick Buttowski is on there and the cartoon is about a kid with a helmet who does stunts trying to be like Evel Kenievel!!!
Red baron great pumpkin
The wings could be Evel's cape!
Hasn’t seen wall-e unfortunately
If he watched nightmare before Christmas they sing "this is Halloween" when Jack is being paraded around town. I wonder if he thinks Jack is called Halloween
I thought this too because this is how my toddler kinda says Halloween and many multi-syllable words come out like separate words when he says them.
Odds are low. He loves pretending to be characters from shows and movies, and it’s so specific I don’t think he would have given something made up a name.
This was my guess as well. My 4 year old watches it.
I didn't know if it was just because I'm Australian, but I was definitely hearing "Harry"
I hear “Hi evil” or “High evil” or something like that.

Edit: “Heh evil”? I don’t know.
They are?????
No but great callout. He loves dr. Meanzo and has dr. Meanzo stuffies (and the froginizer). He says that clearly and would take about his evil guy mustache
Does he say Muppets clearly... he could be saying from the muppets
Goddamn this might be it. Can’t wait for him to get home from daycare to ask
This might just be it! Confirming after daycare
Love this suggestion.
He’s definitely saying “from the pumpkins” - he’s said it a few times in the last few weeks
Yes! I agree!  Show him a picture of Nemo and  ask him, “Who’s this guy again?” and see what he replies.
And Miss Hattie puts the kids in the 'box o shame'! 
So maybe he's been put into the box by Hattie who's evil? And maybe he confused Minions with pumpkins??
Doubt it based on how he says it. And that he says it comes from the pumpkins
I think it’s this too. That weird scarecrow is very memorable lol. Could you show him a picture of the character and ask if it’s him that way?
Okay u/Blatb00m I may have found something. My wild guess is that your kiddo is saying that he is “Transylvania” from the song “Transylvania Twist” 

The “Hankee-evil” is “tRAHn-sYLVania” 

The character that sings The Transylvania Twist is Jack the scarecrow from [Spookly the Square Pumpkin](https://www.netflix.com/title/81141689).

#The scarecrow wears a bucket on his head and has pumpkin friends. It is on Netflix. There are cartoons [and a live show.](https://youtu.be/fFJcXUgxV9E?feature=shared)
Definitely possible. We are going to watch Despicable Me tonight to see if it rings a bell for him
This is a good guess!
Nope but good guess. That does sound like it. I’ve just never watched xmen in his lifetime (nor has he)
Does he go to daycare? I wonder if it’s from a book or something at school.
it's also owned by Mr. Perkins. Perkins=Pumpkins, maybe?
I thought this too!
I watched this clip with him.  He loved it and initially said “yea” but later backtracked. I asked if he’d seen it before and he said “yes on your phone”
Haha thank you! This has been way bigger than I could have imagined
I was thinking the same thing. Jack Pumpkinhead.
Right? It could just be Halloween and he's candy in a bucket 😆
Seconding Megamind, or his fish henchman.
He hasn’t seen yet
It’s definitely a character - he is always repeating things like this from shows or movies, and he says it’s from Netflix and I believe him
Hasn’t seen it unfortunately
Right now we’re making it through despicable me, rise of Gru, and minions movies. Still no concrete answers
This is a great guess - will check
We thought my toddler was saying "sexy" when you would put on lotion for the longest time. Which freaked me out because how would she have heard that word let alone use it in a context of lotion???? Then we found out she was trying to say SUNSCREEN. It was such a relief but also like "really? This is what I've been worried about for a month??"
geek
Lol That's how toddlers develop their imagination. They imitate what they see...
“Scary Eva”
And maybe he’s saying from the muppets rather than from the pumpkins?
Oh yes the fact that minions speak gibberish really complicated this!
okay apologies if it’s already been said but since his toys are from toy story, could he be zurg?? and maybe he’s saying “he evil” or something? or maybe if it’s minions related, herb overkill? and he’s thinking his name is herb evil? or just omitting a syllable to make it sound more like “evil” than “overkill”?
p.s. I’m not convinced he said the word pumpkin the first time. could have been “cuphead”! lol. :) can’t wait to find out what your little guy has been watching 😅
Hm. Not a bad guess I’ll follow up with him. He loves boss baby
Not buzz. He loves buzz and lets us know about it often
I think he’s calling the minions the pumpkins now
Unfortunately he’s not on Tik tok yet lol
This was a huge rabbit hole for us. We watched it all. And he was enthralled with it. But he said no at the end
This is my operating assumption. He has a helmet too. But haven’t gotten a good confirmation.
Hasn’t seen it
If he’s anything like my toddler, he just says “yes” to whatever I interpret his words as 🤣
I can visualize how a clear bucket on the head could kinda create Sam. Damn that's adorable.
Yea I was thinking this too but honestly thought it was just me hearing things. I hope this is the answer.
"Oh you're that character?!?  He's the one that wears that thing, ya know, he wears...wait what does he wear again?"  That sort of charade
There is a scene where they're riding in a bucket carried by a bird if memory serves.
I guess he already knows how to pronounce his name properly? I just listened to the Vocaroo (and loved it!) and I was wondering if he could try to say "Jack Evil"... English is not my first language so I have no idea how kids pronounce English words at that point, it just came to my mind. (On the other hand, you probably would have realized it yourself if he had said that, right? :-D)

However, it is probably more likely that he has invented that character from a cartoon or a movie.
Please post if you find  the answer.  I have no suggestion but am totally invested in finding out what he”a doing!
Actually....nightmare before Christmas, if he has seen it....the kid characters Lock, Shock, and Barrel have a bathtub they run around in...and I am pretty sure at one point one of them has a bucket on their head?
I think it's possible someone greeted the character in some way and the kid mistook it for a name.  For example, if someone said "that's very evil!" about something a character did I could see a kid thinking they were actually saying it about the character, and his name is "Very Evil."  


Not saying that specifically, but something along those lines could have happened.
>or "Harry

My guess was"Harry" too. Possibly from the cartoon [Harry and His Bucket Full of Dinosaurs ](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0493094/plotsummary/?ref_=tt_ov_pl). Thought it could be "Harry People"
Maybe he came up with his own name for ‘lil scary Gonzo? Take a screenshot and ask if that’s ‘Hey Evil’.
That's a good name! Picking names can be hard but you found a good one!
Also, I'm super invested now and can't wait to see if this group figures it out! :D I know how hard it can be to decipher toddler-speech and references.
We almost named our new kiddo Jack Louis!
name doesnt match but I second this
The Pumpkins made me think of Over the Garden Wall but I don’t know if there is a character that sounds like what he’s saying
Toy Story 4 had a character based on him.
It feels about as likely as his kid claiming he's Gore Vidal or something.
My toddler was Evel Knievel for Halloween this year 😅 he keeps trying to ride his little bike thing down slides
Even fewer remember Super Dave.

Such sad times we live in.
Duke Kaboom.
Isn't he in toy story 3/4?

I think I'm thinking Duke Kaboom hahaha
My kid has an evel kneivel stuntman with a stuntbike. he LOVES him
Johnny Knoxville
He’s in Toy Story
That's just bad parenting lol. Jk.
Does he have a cousin or friend or sibling who’s slightly older that makes stuff up that he could be riffing on? Because I know things I didn’t think would register or said in passing were absorbed by little ones even when I myself was one. Like saying I’m a burrito instead of a superhero or a queen/king when kids were putting pillowcases around their shoulders. I could see a sibling or someone saying they’re an astronaut and putting a bucket in their head and your son copying them?
Haven’t listened to your updated convo and it doesn’t fit some of your updated clues, but the original clip sounds like “Hattie Evil” to me. Mrs. Hattie is a villain in Despicable Me with ridiculous helmet hair. Maybe??
[removed]
Showing him the minions and seeing if she says they are pumpkins would narrow it down.
I just listened back and now I can hear that very clearly too.  LOL.  It's like the Blue/White dress for me.  I can hear them both.
Sounds like from the buckets to me lol
If it’s from Despicable Me I wonder if it’s as general as the bucket representing the minion goggles or something specific like [freezing Vector’s head](https://youtu.be/yQ1mZpYvrH4?si=tDWfZsgXQTwgelDx). Hoping you find out more because I’m invested!
Oh, fair enough! Good luck finding out!! I’d be just as invested as you if he were my son haha
https://youtu.be/6c2HoZwg5jk?si=cNjNagqZOlUIvyKy
arpo the robot on youtube?!
OHHHHHHH! Well now I feel silly!
And purposely “accidentally” get things wrong, so they correct you! Sometimes you get more details that way!

We still do this sometimes when we help with homework.
There's a scene like that in Finding Dory. Marlin and Nemo are trying to get to Dory, and some seals suggest getting help from a bird. She carries them into the aquarium grounds in a bucket. The bird is, uh, weird.
Your English is impeccable for not being your first language.
Yeah that was my thought
>And that name, Spookley.  
What kind of name is that?  
It sounds evil.  
Spookley. Spookley.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqPgC3rDvVA
Instead we named him Jack Russel!
Lol my partners name is Louie Jack
Duke Kaboom!
Im kind of sleepy and for a second i was like - Toy Story had a Gore Vidal character????
Say what now?
🤣
And the steel drum band!
Thats a character based on him, not actually him

i also found a little ebo robot that looks like he can move around and lift and dump things. is he being ebo the robot?!
Right right.  It's been awhile.
Thanks. :-D I know my English is ok, but I often check grammar and other small things with e.g. Google Translate. Actually, I created this account here precisely because I wanted to practice my writing a little, because in my everyday life I practically never have to produce text in English (or speak it). I understand it almost perfectly, and my passive vocabulary is huge, but if only you could hear me speak, haha. It's so different when you have to find the words in a second. Writing is a piece of cake compared to that.
Potential smoking gun
Still Canada's greatest stunt man.
I'm saying that OP's child's exposure (and hence likelihood to costume as) Evel Knievel is as about as likely as their exposure to Gore Vidal.
also also the first couple audio clips make me think the first word is two syllables. gah!!
I would never had guessed you are not a native speaker. The only thing that could possibly give you away is that your English is too good.
I've wanted to learn other languages and have even spent *multiple days* trying to begin at step one but...I never get far at all. So I really do respect your skills and determination. It inspires me.
Ah yes, thank you. We also don’t have as many “public intellectuals” as we did back in Gore Vidal’s heyday.
Yeah, I guess I could at least use less commas so I'd blend in a little better, lol. And maybe think about grammar a little less. ;-)
I agree! My dad was Portuguese and spoke and WROTE 9 languages. His English was better than 99% better than native English speakers 😄
Especially "public intellectuals" that are little children. Though probably more than there were back then because of early exposure to the internet and media.
Ah, there is finally one thing...but it is a mistake more than half of native speakers make too - technically you would use "fewer commas", not "less commas". Fewer is used for items you could count (commas, pencils, dollar bills) and less is used for things that can't be counted (water, happiness, sunshine)
Fewer dollar bills but less money.
Fewer raindrops but less rain.

It's a small thing but it does stand out to some of us 😁 but yes, your English is better than many native writers, and I totally get that speaking it is harder! I can read and write french to a moderate degree but would put my speaking skills at about a kindergarten level...or lower!
Noooo! :-D I know that difference actually... No idea why I used that word, maybe I wrote something else at first and accidentally left it there - or I'm just tired and didn't bother to double check everything.

  
Either way,  I'm glad you caught me, lol. ;-)
>Ah, there is finally one thing...but it is a mistake more than half of native speakers make too - technically you would use "fewer commas", not "less commas"

That's not a mistake, it's a preference. At no point in history has that ever been the dominant usage.

True, "fewer" can *only* refer to countable items - i.e. it *would* be incorrect to say "I have fewer flour than I need", but "less" has always referred to both countable and non-countable items.
It would stand out to some of us as a grammatical error but personally it would not give away your ESL experience. I know more than enough native English speakers who would have said “less”, so while it is good to know the difference I wouldn’t sweat it :P
[TOMT]White male actor, 60s, tall, thin, white hair, kindly face, might play a doctor or scientist
Today at the grocery store a guy walked past me (I work there). He looked so familiar that I said “hey how you doing” thinking maybe I know him from somewhere personally but couldn’t quite place where. But he didn’t reply, which made me think I was wrong. But now the more I think about it, the more I think he was actually an actor that I recognized. Definitely not a list or even b list.

He’s between 60 and 70. White actor with white hair. Kindly face, maybe lips a little on the larger side. I’m picturing him in a white coat, so doctor or scientist. Honestly kind of “bill nye” ish but not bill nye. And it sounds very mundane but I even feel like I remember him saying something like “Well now that *is* an interesting question” while in an explanation of something. 

It’s been driving me insane all day. Does anyone have any ideas? 🙏

[TOMT] word for pot of leftovers
On the last day of a camping trip, my godfather’s brother threw the weeks leftovers all in a pot and served it for breakfast. He used a word I’d never heard before or since to refer to it. Please help me think of it!
[Click here for a link to the answer!](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/190gzgh/tomt_word_for_pot_of_leftovers/kgohsjr/)
Pastiche?
Mishmash?
Rummage?
Melange?
The word’s user was from Seattle- he captained a ferry from WA to Juneau. Perhaps it’s a regional term

Also, he served in the Navy. Might have come from there
Slumgullion?
Macafouchette?

dejafood?
Mulligan Stew? That's a nickname for a "whatever you can find" type of soup associated with the homeless or transient population
maybe since he's Navy he called it "Midrats" (all the leftover foods served for midnight rations)?
Muss go (must go)
Garbage Plate?
Slop?

That's what my grandpa would call stuff like that.
Hash?
Scran ?
Slumgullion? Chop Suey? Hodgepodge?
Scrounge?
I think this is a specific different thing but burgoo?
If it's mostly soup and stew, I've heard it called "stone soup"
Recalentado? Soup d'jour? Witches brew?
Mishmash
Goulash?
Scrapple?
Leftover Parfait
Smorgasbord?
My mom's boyfriend when I was a teen called it Guamanian Cowyak.

🤷‍♀️
We call it Bubble and Squeak?
Salmagundi
Dogs breakfast?
Leftover Surprise? Kitchen Sink Stew/Meal?
Potmess?
Kitchen sink?
Ifits?  As in "*if it's* left over, it goes in the pot".
Pottage stew is one term
Musgoes (must-goes)
Lagniappe?
Glop?
Perpetual stew?
Mishmash?
Hutsepot? It's a Dutch word for this but It may have carried over.

so- why are you not able to communicate with this cook?      it was a trip your are trying to forget except for the name of a dish?     LOL
goolash?
Goolash?
Ohhhh my god!! RUMMAGE!

Thats it!

A real word, but not a typical food word!
Solved!
Congratulations on your first point! Nicely done.
Its LIKE that- a word that works for nothing else. But thats not it
dejafood lmao love this
Oh wow both great terms- neither are the one im thinking about, unfortunately
I saw that on quora earlier- not that
Thats such a gross term for food- nope, not that
Rochester special! I am from Upstate NY originally. Not it tho
No- it was a kooky term. Something I’d never heard before referring to food
No- weirder 😂
Oh thats a new one- not that though
Hodgepodge is the one that feels REALLY close but it doesnt hit exactly

This is a word from my childhood. Havent heard it used in 25 years
Haha no
Ohhh good word! No tho
Ive heard that too- not that tho
Nope but i like recalentado
Nope
Nope
Ahhh the Pennsylvania delicacy  no not that
Haha nope
Nope
Hahahahahaha
Bubble and squeak is fried potatoes and cabbage! Sometimes with beef. I didn't know it was also used to mean any leftovers cooked up together.
I read that earlier. I love that term- hilarious! But not it
I wish it was this! Great word
Nope
Nope- I read a bunch of quora answers after my sister and I talked about it and i couldnt remember the word. I know reddit will get me out of this tangle
Nope
Not that but unique wors
Ive heard that one but thats not the word he used
Nope
Woah thats out there- not that tho
Nope
No not that
Nops
Never heard that  not that tho
Nope
Nope not that
Nope
Haha well both my godparents have passed away and I am not in contact with his brother
Nope
[removed]
Hotpot? That's also the name of a specific type of meal, but I've heard it used to mean hodgepodge since the words sound similar.
lol, I didn't see it as too likely (I'm Texan and even here Scrounge is an unusual word for that dish, so didn't see much chance someone from far away used it) but I figured I'd offer anyway. xD

Hope you find it!
do you remember kinda what it sounded like? if you do could you record yourself [saying the sound](https://vocaroo.com/)?
Good thinking but thats not it
Thanks!
Hotchpotch
It MIGHT be this. I gotta dredge up some memory and see if this is the one
Or possibly potpourri?
[TOMT] Another word for a baby mobile?
There’s another used to describe a baby mobile (those rotating things that hang above a babies crib. For the life of me, I can’t remember what it’s called and I can’t find any answers online. Please help I’m actually getting angry that I can’t remember this (NOT SOLVED)

EDIT:

At this point, I have heard so many alternate words for “baby mobile” that I’m not sure I will even recognize the correct answer if it was thrown in my face. For my sanity, I’m going to try to let this crusade go. For anyone who wants the answer, here are the most familiar answers I’ve gotten:
Music-go-round,
Rock-a-bye,
Lullaby,
Turnstile

As other redditors have pointed out, it could have been some made up word that my child-self deemed it as, it’s entirely possible. It’s looking even more likely considering nobody has been able to give me the answer. 

I hope I’m wrong and someone figures it out, I’ll keep an eye on this thread
I don't know, even the people on the Quora page I found all call it a mobile. Except for the one guy who said "flypaper"...

You're not crazy though. I definitely get the feeling like I've heard another word for it at some point. There's this weird empty feeling of something that once was. So faint that you're not sure if it's real enough, yet strong enough to give you the feeling that something used to be here.
Baby Carousel?
[deleted]
Totally isn’t it but I’m really vibing with “infant chandelier”
I’m completely with you, I swear I remember there being another name. I even remember using it for most of my childhood and then learning the word mobile later. But I’ve never found the words or remembered what it was. 

Good luck lol I really hope someone gets it.
Whirligig?
Maybe you should ask some parenting sub as well
Well now **I** feel like it also has another name!
i almost said revolver before i realized that probably was not it 😭
Fascinator? I know it’s a hat but I still picture a mobile whenever I hear the word
Is it the different pronunciations of "mobile"?

Some people say "mo-bile" but some say "mo-beel"
Okay, this is weird; I was about to answer your question and the word slipped out of my mind before I could grab it, then I read some comments and it seems like the same thing has happened to a lot of people. I haven’t seen this happen before. This is really odd. I feel certain that I’m on the verge of having the word spring back into my mind at any moment.
So annoying because I also swear I used to call it something else before I leaned mobile... Want to say it started with a p...
In other news, this post now shows up as a Google result when searching for alternate words for mobile
Now I'm annoyed because I KNOW I used to call it something else, but idk what
Youve got me convinced this is some sort of Mandela effect at this point. I feel like a vividly remember calling it something else as a kid but can't remember. My brain keeps going back to the letter L but i cant find anything.
I feel like it has to do with the movement.
Kenetic something. Planetary. Revolution. Kinda like kaleidoscope. Helicopter. 
It bothers me that I can't remember.
There is definitely another word; OP is right. And I hope OP knows that I am now being driven similarly insane. Will respond in all caps when it comes to me.
I have been rabbit hole-ing this for the last 2 hours. It’s going to drive me insane lol.
Wow. Now this is going to bother me too. My parents called it something different growing up as well. Fuck
Baby susan
Stabile?
Aeromobile?

  This same subject came up for me a few weeks ago and I didn't think mobile was part of the term I remembered, but after an eBay/etsy antique mobiles deep dive, I'm 95% certain this is the word I was thinking of

(edit: I'm from Florida too so could be regional)
Since you’re from Florida maybe it’s close to the Spanish word (pesebre, ambulante, belén, maracas, maraquero) Carousel/Carrusel, Rattle. Maybe it’s the action: dangle, flyer, swing, spinner, ambulant (ambulatory), floater, portable, modular, wind chime 

It’s probably none of these but I feel like I just created one of those Wish products with the super long descriptions
Calliope?
Some shops call it a baby safari if the hanging toys are animals
Satellite? Suggested by my bf
baby crib dangles??
Oh God, Floridian here and it's killing me. Something to do with rockets or space? Like the word is spacecraft themed or like after astrological bodies?
Playmobil?
I am actually convinced there is another word why can nobody find it, my brain is itchy now and I fear I’ll never sleep again
Nursery or music mobile? Calder's mobile?
Do you remember who used to call it a different word? Do you have a grandparent who speaks another language that might have referred to it differently? 

Is it potentially a name only your family used?
Diorama?
I'm with you, there is another name...hmm...
Baby merry go round lol
Some call them a cot mobile. Also, a slang name is whirlygig.
I just call it the spinny thing
I think I’ve heard them called dials.
Please help🙏
There is another word, it’s a semi-obvious one but I can’t think of it either now!! Killing me!!
This is going to drive me totally insane now.
Suncatcher, rainbow catcher or something like the word "celestial"? Or something like astrolabe, or observatory?
[removed]
I grew up with it being called a rotary
The only other “official” word for it is “stabile”, but I wanna say I’ve heard someone call it an “orbit” or something like that before.
Theres definitely another word might start with a C
Grew up in the Midwest and I swear mine was called something different too. One word, nothing “mobile” about it. It was kind of weird, iirc.
Chandelier maybe?
Used to call them Soothers.
Ugh add me to the list of needing to know!!!
Ariel
So I’ve been looking online - there are a few brands/types that maybe were used? I’m finding some called Squigglys/squeak-a-boos or music-go-rounds… but those are brand/mobile specific. Not a general term. Could you have had one that was called by the brand name & then the name was applied to all mobiles?
A crane?
I had this super sure feeling that there’s another word for it, but i’m doubting it now. It feels like a mandela effect.. driving me nuts
I’m so invested. I can’t wait to figure out what this answer is
This word has bothered me for years too… this feeling of knowing “mobile” isn’t quiet the right word but that’s the only one I could come up with, and it felt “off” somehow…. I just never brought it up to anyone and instead called it a “spinny thing” when looking for one for my child. It’s perplexing so many others are experiencing the same thing.
OP I've been thinking about this post for days trying to remember what we called it when I was a kid and finally remembered in a dream last night: Playmobil(e)
Kinetic Art/sculpture?
Dangler?
Rotator
Perhaps you’re confusing it with an Orrery?
I feel like it’s a French word
i dont really have any ideas for specific words, but maybe try thinking along the lines of brand names, like paracetamol can be called "Panadol" or those sticky things you put on sores can be called "band-aids" or "steri strips"
calder mobile?
Could it have been an Irmi mobile? I think that was a popular brand name for them in the 50’s-70’sish. Maybe you remember calling it by the brand name instead of a specific word?
Bunting?
Ambulator
Automaton?
Maybe an antique toy expert/seller would know?
Long shot but maybe canopy/baby canopy? (I know it’s traditionally used for the fabric canopies hung over beds but similar concept so I thought it might work).
We called any of the musical or moving baby things "soothers."
Rockabye?
Baby dial
Canopy?
can you ask whoever raised you? maybe it was a specific word someone in ur family said because they just didnt know the word😭😭 its more common than it seems
Captivator? I think I might have made it up but something in my brain feels good about it lol
The only other name I can find is *Kinetic Sculpture*

[Here is the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_%28sculpture%29?wprov=sfla1)

Edit: I just want to add that I've only ever heard/seen it called a *mobile*.
A Mary Winchester
I'm from Pittsburgh. My mom had her 3rd baby when I was 5 and my brother was 1.5. I'm positive I remember her calling this something different, too.
I also can't remember the name, but I believe it's 2 words and has "wind-up" as a longer version of its namr
Arghh. I know what you mean. I swear there's another word for it too. The Mandela effect? Ha
This is actually insane. There is a term for it, that isn't baby mobile, that I must have called it as I DON'T call it a baby mobile.....and I cannot think for the life of me what it is! 

I feel like I've gone mad
Omg there is another name. Fudge.  The more I think “carousel” the more i think that’s it, tho it doesn’t feel right
Baby carousel?

This post has been driving me crazy. This is what I was stuck trying to think of- hopefully same for you 😅
This may not be helpful but is there any chance you’re thinking of the word “bassinet” to describe the crib instead?
Elliptical
Orrery?
annoying lol.. but we called em mobile's up north
I think I've heard them called zephyrs.
My Mum always calls them spinners but she’s Spanish so English is her second language
Playmobile?
This post just reminded me I had a conversation about this years ago and never found out the other word. Please update op if you find out what the other word is!
Turnstile
Baby chime?
A few people have commented whirligig, which reminds me that I have also heard them referred to simply as a 'whirl'.
People have already suggested my answers. But you're not crazy. I was probably in my mid-teens when I first heard "mobile". They were definitely called something else growing up in the midwest 80's for me

It's like how pacifiers were always called "foolers" for me growing up and I was probably about the same age when I learned their true name as well

I feel like suncatcher is probably the most likely, going by the Wikipedia page, but who knows. It's definitely not a Mandela effect though
Safari, Diorama, Chandelier, Carrousel, Dreamcatcher, Scene, Merry Go Round, Roundabout, Lullaby, Projector.
Are you from an english-speaking country? Could it be a word in another language
Suspension?
Are you just mentally pronouncing it like mobile phone? I've always heard it as "mobile" but pronounced "mo-beel."
My great grandmother used to call them either a cot spinner or a chandelier. That’s probably not what you’re thinking of but you jarred my memory.
Some mobiles have planets on them and apparently a planet mobile is also called an orrery?
A dirigible?
For some reason my mind went to those windmill pinwheel things. I feel like I can remember someone calling a mobile a pinwheel
i know in new england, sometimes they're called wind/crib chimes. 

other ideas:

baby gym

baby gyro/gyroscope

cradle spinner

??
Rock-a-bye?
We called it a mobile when I was little but I'd say it "mobeel" so now i think I called it two different things but I didn't. This made sense in my head
Must be lullaby. I think that’s what I always heard as a child in New Zealand, and mobile was the more American word
Kinetic sculpture
[deleted]
OK this is really weird because I've had this exact conversation a few years ago.. and we never found the answer. There's definitely another word
Carriole ?
I bet this is coming from some shared experience, like a famous slang usage for baby mobile on a TV show or something
In Danish we call it an "uro", haha
Roundabout? 
Or I have just come up with Enchanter
Damn you 

Now I'm almost certain I know another name for them but also can't remember it 😡
Dream catcher? Chimes? Sensory toy?
Propeller?
Is the term  you’re looking for *crib/baby fascinator* or *focuser*?
Definitely baby carousel! Especially when they have little horses and stuff, like a real carousel
We used to call it a chime
OP, what country are you from? Sometimes different regions have different terms for things
I used to call them ambulants idk
In Danish it's called "uro"
Bed/crib bell?
Spinnerette? I dunno, I made that up
Dreamcatcher?
BabiPhone
Spinner?
could it be that your word comes from a different language?
Attention diverter
Amazon also refers to them as “crib bells”
Are you thinking of Perambulator?
Projector / lullaby
Odradek, just trying my luck
Baby hanger, crib hanger
Montessori is like it, but that's more the hanging style ones laid down on the floor. I, too, think there's another name for it though
If it was planet themed it could be an "Orrery".
I'm pretty old, also a mom and worked in the toy industry for decades as a buyer and managed both toy stores and baby stores. All this speculation is fascinating...but they're mobiles. They've always been mobiles. In every catalog, on every stock list, on every shelf tag. I am in the U.S. but have been to international toy shows and as far as I know, mobiles.
I've heard them called a carousel?
carousel ?
Montessori?
Sun catcher?
Merry go round?
Aerial?
My dude...my wife just got it, that fucking sexy siren .

So it's mobile, but we used to say it differently - pronounced like Mo-beel, not like how you would normally say mobile. I am 99% certain that's why this is fucking everyone up - it's the same word said differently!

I really hope that's it for your sake!
Kinetic? Chime?
Twirler? Spinner? Ring Around The Rosie?
It’s not a lullaby is it?
I’m familiar with the terms ‘bed bell’ and ‘rotary’, used interchangeably with mobiles
Bed bell?
Play arch is my last idea. Good luck!
I always called it a cradle
Cradle?
Whirligig
“sky”??
Frieze?
Babymobile
Straw mobile?
Are you getting it confused with a baby play mat gym? These are baby toys that are a large mat with two arches that cross to form an X. Little baby toys hang down off the arches and the baby can lie on the mat and play with the dangling toys.
Maybe a wind chime?
Dream catcher
Crib mobile.

The term you're looking for is likely "crib mobile."
mobile
baby blimp?
Musical (cot/crib) mobile?
I think my parents used to call it a stabile, but that might be a British thing
We called them busy bees when I was a kid
A dial, a pendant, or solar system? I say solar system as you can get model solar systems that spin like a child’s mobile [here](https://www.potterybarnkids.com.au/planet-mobile)
hey, okay, has anyone asked you where you're from yet? i strongly suspect this is a regional thing but wouldn't be able to tell unless given an area
Montessori Mobile, Gobbi Mobile, Munari Mobile, Dancer Mobile, Octahedron?
My little brother has something called an “activity center” in his crib, it attached to the side and had noise makers and other buttons and bells to keep him entertained. Thats the only thing he had in addition to what we called the mobile.
Suncatcher?
Crib toy hanger?
Not quite the same thing but I've seen hanging toys referred to as 'bat-at toys'
I want to say pacifier, I don’t know why. Vague memory that I’m not sure hasn’t been implanted from this thread. 

I’m in Aus and the one for the mouth is called a dummy.
still mobile but said "moe-beel" instead
Flensted?
Stork's nest?
Bed bell?
Flier? Glider ? Dreamglider? Musical?
Hangings, dangers?
A dangler?
Air mobile? Or aeromobile?
I’ve heard people call it a soother before
Air castle
Zoetrope
I think it's colliape like u/VenusMarmalade suggested. Or at least that's the word I believe I was thinking of.
Rotary?
I don’t know if it’s because it was a popular animal nursery theme at the time (late 80s early 90s) but I feel like I remember calling them “jungle mobiles.”
This truly sounds like the perfect question for the radio show “a Way with Words”!
A BABY BAUBLE??? That popped into my head
Perambulator is the old word for the buggy itself.  Might it be related to that word?
Collider
[deleted]
Hangar? Playpen? (I know that one would be another word for where the baby *is,* rather than its toys, but maybe you're conflating the two?) I know there's another word for it and this post is going to drive me crazy lol. If I remember to I'll ask my mom in the morning and see if she knows.
This probably isn't it but wind chime? 

I have a strong feeling I've seen and used a different word as well but not sure what, and now it's going to bug me until I figure it out!
Is it possible you're thinking of a dream catcher?
baby bed bells?
Cascade?
Planetarium? Or perhaps a word on this list? Lots describe orbit of things... https://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/glossary/indexp.shtml
Mesmerizer??
My grandma used to call them "soothers" or "fascinators".
Fascinator
An absolute shot in the dark:

A waltzer.
Is it one word or is it like a 2- or 3-word phrase kinda said all at once?
[deleted]
I feel like I remember a phrase like “____ cycle”. This is definitely giving me Mandela effect vibes!
Whirligig?
The version  of the mobile that babies use on the ground, my mother called it a jungle gym.
[removed]
Baby walker?
Musical bed bell?
This doesn't seem right, but marionette came to mind.
Pendulum!
Birdy? Pirouette? These are just shots in the dark tbh, I have such a weird feeling about this topic and idk why

Gonna sound sooo stupid but the closest word that scratches the itch I can think of is a mashup of birdy + circle. cirdy or something
I had this same conversation with a friend about 3 weeks ago, I am CONVINCED there is another word but I too can't think what. Please let me know if you find out 😂
Is your first language English or something else? I know a lot of languages have their own names for these so it could be that
Crib hanger?
An ornithopter maybe? I immediately thought of the furniture item in Animal Crossing…
Rotator? I’ve heard them called that when they are motorised and turn by themselves
Whippletree?
Rotunda?
I saw flyguard?
My girlfriend and I are going crazy trying to figure it out😭
God damn it, now it’s bothering me too. The closest I can come is cot something.
Me too! I hope it's not some weird Mandela effect.
I feel the same!! I was pregnant two years ago and had this same spiral and still haven't found the answer
Possible Mandela effect
I’m feeling the exact way you are. I know in my heart that if my mom were still alive, I could phone her right now and she’d immediately know. I know she used the word, I have, it had multiple syllables, and some people used ‘mobile’ and others used ‘________’. BWAH! This is going to keep me awake all night.
Same, exactly the same
The Mandela Effect
I’ve been searching all over the internet since seeing this post because I feel exactly the same way
Nah that’s not it, but thanks
This is what I heard it referred to as when I was a little kid, in the early 80s 

I think 1992 was the first time I had heard it being called a mobile
This is my answer too
I grew up calling it something else, I know there’s another word for it. I’m so frustrated 😭
I will never call it a mobile again
If the Reddit community can’t solve this, then I am truly fucked🥲
This is what I feel as well lol I’m waiting for my mom to message me back 😂
That 100% should be a new usage for fascinator.
I wish that was the word so I could just put this thing to bed
I was legitimately gonna guess this.
Nah it’s a completely different word
Mo-bile is the thing for babies, mo-beel is the thing for Batman. Not gonna lie though, when I read that title for a second I thought they were talking about the Batman kind but for babies lol
Please, for the love of god, jog your memory 🥲
HAH that’s hilarious 😂
You’re onto something, I’m on the same wavelength

Edit: just throwing it out there because this word sounded familiar, a periscope is what is used on a submarine to view the outside.
I think it does have something to do with movement, I want to say it’s something like ‘perambulator’ (I know that’s a pram/stroller, I’m just saying that it feels like it’s a similar word). I tried googling because I feel like I’m losing my mind now, and I found someone who asked [the same question](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatstheword/s/EOfqegH9vO) four years ago. If I can’t recall this by tomorrow, I’m going to try phoning my stepmother and see if she knows, or asking older people, because I’m certain that I learned the word from my mother.
I also thought of something like kaleidoscope as well…
Gyroscope, chime, ornament, carousel
I’m literally going insane over this
I’m already driven insane 🤪
Never heard of this but if it rotates, that’s a genius name. Someone mentioned a rotary, which is the mechanical attachment that hangs a mobile and spins it. “Baby rotary” sounds familiar but nothing comes up online.
Oh that's very cute
Underrated comment. No matter what rating this comment is, it's underrated
Maybe it was just aero?
Unfortunately none of those
I think this is it. Or at least it's the word I was thinking about
Weirdly this seems... closer than anything, if I'm also "remembering" the word they are thinking of.
this one triggered something in my brain.
Sun catcher?
Me and you both brother… the most familiar ones I’ve heard were rock-a-bye and lullaby but I don’t think those are it.
I called it a different word as a kid. I’m from florida if that makes any difference. I feel like this is the Mandela effect because I swear to god it was called something else 😂
This is what we sometimes called them when I was a kid.
That’s what came to my mind.
This might be it.
It's this for sure
Diarrhea?
Nah, I thought that at first too
Great job suggesting the only word that they specifically said it's *not* lol
This is the only correct answer
That sounds familiar. Can’t find it online as a thing though. I’m starting to lean towards Mandela effect. 😂
This is ringing major bells
That’s what I thought of almost immediately
The one I’m thinking is “baby dial” which I commented.
I’m from the Midwest, too! I think it’s an older-person word that has gotten replaced by ‘mobile’.
A baby's chandelier. 🤭
Here that's what people call pacifiers/dummies
Nah, I wish it was the answer because I’m sick and tired of thinking about this
We did too.
The world may never know
Aerial?
It’s possible, but none of the ones you named match
It has to be the Mandela effect at this point
quick search turns up Chico, Cam Cam and Cloud (catering to the post that insists it started with C)
I wondered about that too. Here’s a good article that talks about Calder and the beginning of the mobile art movement and it might give you a clue.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_(sculpture)
This is a good thought
Nah, unfortunately not
Oh! That’s a great idea!
Nah I asked my parents and they say they only called it a mobile.
Nah, that’s not it. Thanks though!
Haha! That’s a good one😁
You and me both 🥲
Whirlygig?
South too
No, but interesting
I will update immediately if anyone gets it
I'm glad I'm not the only one that heard it called this. I tried googling it and did not get much.
That almost scratches the itch, but not quite.
Idk man it’s feeling like the Mandela effect for me😂
I’m from the U.S. 
it could be another language but I don’t think so
Unfortunately not. It’s so funny, I have heard a hundred different names for this and somehow none of them are the one I’m thinking of. It’s absolutely killing me!
It almost scratches the itch, but I don’t think that’s it
Why can nobody remember 😭
Nah
The U.S.
It’s a real word; spinnerets are the parts of spiders that make the silk! 😊
Why on earth would people downvote you for trying to help?
No?
Nah
Nah, that’s not it. But I’m shocked at how many different words there are to describe a “mobile”
-_-
Nah, that’s not it
Nah
Okay I'm not OP but I swear this is it, although Google doesn't show any results for mobiles being called aerials
That’s not it 🥲 but I’m sure your wife is still a sexy siren
So I just came back to this thread after visiting it last night and I woke up convinced this is what it is. As kids we all pronounced it wrong or pronounced it wrong in our minds and now as adults it *feels* like it must be a different word when it’s just the different pronunciations. I think it’s also confusing to people because some called them “crib mobiles” or carousels so it’s all just mashing together in their minds
Nah
They are looking for a word other than mobile. There are always like 3 people who insist on suggesting the same word. I don't get it.
Nah I’m talking about the ones that hang above a crib
I’m sorry you’re being downvoted for trying to help!
Are you serious?
I have been participating, nobody has got the answer
There’s another word
'Pram' is a synonym for 'stroller' or 'pushchair'.
No it’s not man, I specifically asked for a word other than mobile 😂
Dude, obviously not
Aww, it’s so dumb! *pats your head*
I wish that was it so I can just put this thing to bed, but it’s not :(
I left an email for them, let’s hope they may figure it out 😬
That’s not it
Nah, that’s not it
That's a hat in the UK.
Unfortunately not :(
Believe me I will scream it from the mountains if I figure it out
This is going to haunt me until we find the answer because I’ve never ever called it a baby mobile or any of the other things people have said! There’s another word for it!!!
Hey weird tip, there’s an episode of the children’s show little Einsteins in which we learn the magic spaceship is from a baby mobile, but I swear they use another word for it there.

If you wonder how the hell I remember that, I guess it’s just ingrained in my mind from childhood 🤷‍♂️
I know what you’re talking about, and I don’t remember that word either lol, but I know it exists! 

I asked my sister, she said she knows there’s another word too, and now she’s mad at me because she doesn’t remember it either haha.
I went and found the little einsteins episode, and no dice. I’m at a loss now lmao
Rotunda?
It is.
It fits and is pretty. Id say this is the answer lol
Holy c rap...that you could recall which year (30+ of those ago) when you first heard a very random word piques my interest way more than the possibility of a pseudonym to "baby mobile".
[removed]
You know what op? Screw you for this question. I have spent so many hours with this taking so much space in my brain. I swear I have heard it called something else as well and started a huge debate at work and here we are a day later and still no resolution. This is driving me insane lmao. One coworker called it a kinetic and it almost scratches the itch.
Dude this is actually going to drive me insane now because you're right and i can't think of the word either
Does it have the word mobile in it or is that completely out?
Have you asked one of your parents if possible? Maybe your family had its own word for them?
It certainly fascinates!
It never occurred to me until just now that I pronounce the word "mobile" the exact same way (MOH-bul) in every instance,, except I pronounce baby "mobiles" the same way as "Mobile" Alabama. moh-BEEL.
It’s also a city in Alabama. Pronounced “mo-BEEL”
gyroscope??
Yeah, it's something like this. I feel like it started with an r or k like Kazoo, but not. My only other theory besides Mandela is that lots of people grew up with that object ever present at a time we were developing our vocabulary, so maybe we all had our own word for it.
Thanks I just made it up haha


I think it was probably the same deal for op, someone in the family just made something silly up
Perhaps it was just a word you invented when you were a kid?
I think you've tainted my brain cause I'm now thinking it had another word too.
We called it by a different name when I was a kid in the UK too. Word began with an R, I believe, but I can't think what it was. Something to do with turning or spinning. Not roundabout. Something similar to rotary, but not quite there. This post has brought it all back except the word.
this is making my brain itch because i agree that there is a different name i even tried googling it and only get baby mobile
South Florida? If so, it may be an anglicized Spanish word.
I'm from Florida, and I agree that I used to have a different word for it.
I’ve asked my husband (who was born in Florida) and I’ve lived here for 35 years. We are both thinking there *is* a different word for it. His guess was “kinetic sculpture” and for some reason I kept thinking of “ambulatory” but I think thats something else, like a walker. Do you know if it might be a case where the mobile is referred to by a brand name instead of the standard name? 

My other guess is as others have said, carousel.
Nope, this has been bothering me for 20 years. I am certain there's another term but I have not been able to remember it either!
What region of which country are you from? Perhaps it's a local phrase.
Yeah I was thinking like Solar System dioramas, that can look a lot like Crib Mobiles.

Judging from the downvotes I got from suggesting that, apparently we are in the minority in calling them that lol
It’s not that
Aehrraid?
They’re like the 90th person to suggest “mobile” and it’s driving me crazy😂
At this point it has to be the Mandela effect
I’m with you on this. I can’t believe googling this as an image does not bring one up at all. This sounds so familiar!
Your comment, as well as the one saying “turnstile,” itched the scratch in my brain the most so I feel like you’re onto something here!
In the sky?
[removed]
Good luck!
What region?
They use it as a disagree button
People downvote people for the most ridiculous shit
Nah it’s not it
Nah this is not it man😅
I'm with you - I am almost certain this is what OP is misremembering, but memory is a funny thing - I remember I described, perfectly, a scene from Pan's Labyrinth, but when everyone was screaming that's what it was at me, I was like "nah, don't think so" - it clearly was, now looking back at it!

I know I've got the answer here haha OP, damnit you need to submit to my answer!
Yes. They're called crib mobiles, too.
I wanna know what it is when you find it but I'm pretty sure it's just called a mobile. I'll be happy to be wrong though!
Sadness
This has got to be a Mandela effect
Nope
I just remember who my father was dating or married to at the time and that tells me the year

My stepmother, my father’s second wife, was the one who used the word mobile
I’m sorry😂😂 how do you think I feel? The most familiar answers I’ve gotten are rock-a-bye and bauble of that helps you at all. I don’t think those are it but maybe that’s what you remember😂
Baby carousel
Glad I’m not the only one 🥲
Completely out
I asked my family and they all call it a mobile
What about moe-bile, thats how i say it
Also true for specific vehicles like Batmobile and Popemobile!
I feel like this could be it but this thread has me questioning everything
I honestly wouldn’t be surprised at this point
For some reason when I was a little kid I called cinnamon butter "bull-butter" and that's just what my family called it from then on. I didn't even know that was why until my parents said "we have no idea but for some reason you called it bull butter and now it's like a running joke"
Routunda?
I don't think this is it, sadly. The word for "mobile" in Spanish is "móvil."
It’s possible but I’m not sure
Sorry, didn’t know if the phrase “cot mobile” was helpful or not.
When you lose small mind, you free your life
Rotary
Let it sit with you, I am almost certain that's what it is.

It explains why no one in hundreds of comments from across the world has been able to find this mystery word, but agree with you that there is one - it's just a mystery pronunciation.
But I specifically asked for a word other than mobile😂
Count me in for the Mandela effect! Because I feel like i grew up calling it one thing, then finally heard the "right" name when I was older (like a teen). 

Okay, you said you're from Florida. When would you have heard this? 00's, 90s, 80s?
I know. But i like it. Das what im sayin
Oh yeah, you're right!
Me and you both, and nah that’s not it
When I was little similarly to you but after hearing my family spell w a l k i e s so our Border Collie wouldn't loose his shit, i asked shall we go for a p u r g e. All looked at me like wtf, I thought we were just spelling stuff. Now it's a run ing joke lol
Good word, but no. Something a kid would say but also maybe something a bit advanced. Like you'd be surprised to see a 5-7 year old say it but a 10 year old it'd just be accepted. Not 100% on it starting with an R either, but that's what my mouth reaches for.
It’s fine lol, no harm no foul
That sounds familiar.
No man, it’s 100% not that
Reddit hive mind strikes again
I remember hearing this mystery word for the first time while playing Fallout 4.   No one says it in game, but I feel like someone told me “hey, you know that’s called a XYZ.”

At the beginning you know, you got your lil baby & Codsworth takes him to the crib & the crib has a… whatever it’s called lol
Okay you twisted my arm. I'll start FO4 again, you know for science
[TOMT] [MOVIE] A movie my mum thought would brainwash me
When I was a kid I saw this weird movie. We watched it and I remember it being very strange but not knowing why. I went to go rewatch it but the dvd was gone. I asked my mum where it went and she told me she got rid of it. She said it had quite sinister undertones meant to brainwash kids or something. I’d really like to find it to see what she was talking about.



Here’s what I very vaguely remember:

- It was about children in the apocalypse possibly

- There was some kind of junkyard

- There were robot insects maybe

- At one point they stumble across this pristine factory that looks very out of place in the environment

- There’s a scene I remember vividly of a kid on a sofa eating cheese puffs, but then a girl comes up and says it’s not real. He then takes off a headset or something and he’s in a giant hamster wheel powering the factory.



That’s all I remember. I hope it wasn’t just a dream I had. I really want to know what my mum was trying to protect me from. Plus I want to see a potentially terrible kids movie. If anyone has any ideas please let me know.
[Click here for a link to the answer!](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/17ymy8k/tomt_movie_a_movie_my_mum_thought_would_brainwash/k9w41o7/)
The adventures of Chris fable?
Hope this is identified. I would very much like to see this movie.
I need to know what this is now! OP, try cross posting to r/whatsthatmoviecalled
do u have an estimate for when you watched it? like are we looking for something released around the 2000s or like around the 70s lol
Mirrormask?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Uzzvmc0Dro
Mindwarp maybe?
Spy kids 3-D, game over?
You seem to have watched a lot of the pretty niche movies people are commenting. If you were really young it’s very possible you’re mixing the movies together and creating fabricated memories
It remind me of an episode of Futurama which may have been based on the movie. It's The Cryonic Woman and the wiki says this: Gangs of savage children and adolescents are found throughout science fiction, including films such as Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Escape from New York, Escape from L.A., and Logan's Run. Also, a similar concept is featured in the Star Trek episode "Miri". Predating all of these, and notable as the decline into savagery is the entire subject of the book, is Lord of the Flies by William Golding. It's interesting to speculate whether the Lost Boys of J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan play and books fit into this category.
PLEASE HELP!
This could be a bit of a stretch but

&#x200B;

[The Peanut Butter Solution?](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089789/)
Maybe the movie "9" with Elijah Wood
What year were you a kid?
Was it animated?
This isn't recent, but was it Solarbabies?
could it be the girl with all the gifts?

https://youtu.be/fYkw4MgPR8A?si=zvJtDvWeb_halDYw
Sounds like the Canadian show “ReBoot”
The City of Lost Children?
Turbo Kid?
Could it be the show “The Tribe”?
The 2003 version of [A Wrinkle in Time?](https://youtu.be/E-dwfpxyDSg?si=yG7gqYWRD2GZ7bUp) 

My parents also wouldn’t let me watch it because they said it was evil somehow. It has a pristine factory in the middle of a town too
Doom Runners maybe?
The city of Ember has a lot of the themes you’re talking about
*following*
Strings?
Maze Runner?
Shorts or also called The Wishing Rock (2009)
Sounds similar to the show I watched as a kid called the odyssey.
Could you ask your mom? She might tell you now that you're older.
https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/21-virtual-reality-movies-ranked-from-awful-to-amazing/2900-1874/#1
Is it any of these?
Could it be "The City of Lost Children"?
Maybe ask your mom and figure out why she thought it was brainwashing kids or where she got the idea? That could produce a couple of helpful tips. 

I know some people had issues with the Golden Compass and I know that’s not the answer. 

I hope you find your movie. :)
Brit or US film?
You're not thinking of A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) are you?
The call up? 2016
DOOM runners?

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_Runners
I think the movie you’re thinking of it called The Host. It’s been a while since I’ve seen it though. Really good movie.
Maybe you confused the movie "City of Ember" with another movie?
astroboy, perhaps? also sounds like sharkboy and lavagirl.
Mars needs moms?
A wrinkle in time?
Your description instantly made me think of AI: Artificial Intelligence but I don’t think it is based on the hamster wheel part
Long shot. But could it be the movie Gamer? (2009)
Small Soldiers?
I’m sure I’m wrong, Ready Player One?
I’m sorry did you say it was a kids movie?
Snowpiercer? The details are off but it could be...
9? The robots do kind of look like creepy insects.
City of Ember ?
AI: Artificial Intelligence directed by Steven Spielberg (2001)?

That has a junkyard with fighting robots and maybe the pristine factory is where the kid meets the blue fairy? Or possibly where he was made? I don’t remember anything about cheese puffs though
Virtual nightmare?
[Enders Game?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film))
The maze runner? 

Another idea would be maybe one of the sequel movies.
[Surrogates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogates)
I'm pretty sure I also watched this..... could it be Astro Boy 2009? I don't think it was in my head but that's all I'm coming up with
star kid?
Return to Oz, 1985?
AI? (Haley Joel Osment)
The lawnmower man?
Following
City of ember?
Could it be TomorrowLand?

https://youtu.be/lWZ7O-RrATY?feature=shared
The Dark Crystal by Jim Henson, the Muppets guy?  
  
The City of Lost Children?
9?
A boy and his dog (1976)
Toy Soldiers?
Everything except the cheese puff thing reminds me of the Maze Runner films, could it be those? I think the first was released in 2014
We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story
Honey I Shrunk the Kids?
I don't remember anything about this movie, but could it be [La cité des enfants perdus](https://youtu.be/pcQjsI0Mutw?feature=shared) (The City of Lost Children)?
A movie i haven’t seen myself but have seen advertisements for that this description reminds of: the goonies. Skimmed the description on wikipedia and it sounds vaguely similar. Not exactly but it’s mu best guess for sure
Bridge to Tarabithea.
Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker?
Solved!
Congratulations on your first point! Nicely done.
I don’t think I have enough karma to post there but if someone else could that’d be so helpful!
Oh yeah sorry haha; I would have been like 7 maybe? I’m 20 now, so like 2010? Plus or minus a couple of years possibly. I think it was from the 2000s
Wow!  Don’t know if the movie is any good, but that’s a helluva trailer.  And it does fit OP’s description.
that was also my first thought
No I think it’s more recent, like 2000s or 2010s maybe
Man, I love that terrible movie. Got it in a two-pack with Brainscan.
It sounds exactly like spy kids 3d tho :(

&#x200B;

Like, that scene abput the cheese puffs etc... is straight from that movie and is so specific I can't imagine it being anything else.
No haha, I love that movie though
It also has spy kids 2 vibes
[deleted]
Omg I'm so glad you posted this, had a weird flashback to that movie the other day and couldn't remember if it was real!
No but that is a really great movie
I watched North with Elijah Wood when I was, like, 2 or 3 and only remembered the bunny and "it was all a dream". Spent almost three decades looking for it every year until I finally found it via our god google and was finally reaffirmed that I wasn't crazy, it was just a really early memory of a really obscure movie. Drove me crazy basically my whole life.
Yeah sorry haha; I’m 20 now and I think I saw it when I was like 7, so around 2010 maybe?
No but I think it had some really terrible cgi
was gonna say this reminded me a little of big hero 6
No I don’t think so
Lmao the same movie came to my mind.
No it’s not unfortunately
That was a good show.
The evil dead/thriller episode.  What a show.
No sorry
I don’t think so but I saw the trailer and it looks awesome
also came to say this! i have the dvd box set, such a low budget show with heart!
Yeah the vibes of this movie fit with the description pretty well
I don’t think so
Hey!!! Was thinking of that one too
I was kinda thinking this too. It ticks most of the boxes but doesn't include the hamster wheel moment.
I don’t think it was city of ember; I think what I’m thinking of was relatively low budget and obscure
Right?
Same
Same
Same
I just looked this up and the puppet one looks really cool. But I don’t think so no
How did you get strings from.the description?
No but I do remember that movie being bonkers haha
No unfortunately, but I am a fan of Amelie which was directed by the same guy. Haha not really relevant but nevermind
I’m British but I think it was American, although I’m not sure
I don’t think it was city of ember; I think what I’m thinking of was relatively low budget and obscure
No, great movie though
Awful.
No unfortunately
No but that’s a good movie though
No haha it was much more obscure
I think it was yeah
Honestly that was my first thought too. The kids weren't on hamster wheels but they were cogs in the machine.
No it was live action; but 9 is a great movie though
I don’t think it was city of ember; I think what I’m thinking of was relatively low budget and obscure
No unfortunately
Definitely nothing like the goonies
Sorry to ask the obvious but have you asked your Mum?
Could it be any of the movies mentioned on [this page?](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HamsterWheelPower)
hmmm gotcha, new question vis a vis the hamster wheel scene were either of those two main characters or were they bg characters? and do you remember if the "its virtual" reveal is something setting the premise early or was it more of a twist ending? sorry if this is too many/too specific questions lol im now very curious

edit also am bad at subtext does "robot insects maybe" mean ur not sure if they a) were robots b) were insects or c) were actually part of the movie at all
Hugo?
I mean, that’s in his comment.
I hope it's the movie OP was thinking of. They apparently haven't seen this comment yet
North is an absolutely crazy movie, if you haven't already seen it, the Siskel and Ebert review is a hilarious watch.
Add that to your original post.
Ready Player One?
*how*
Tell me you've never seen Big Hero 6 without telling me you've never seen it. 🤣
Loved it when I was a teenager!
Honestly sounds like a fever dream of someone who fell asleep watching the matrix.
The box office did NOT agree ☠
?? I’m sorry
I find with a lot of these "the memory" is what throws us off the most. The vibe tends to be more correct. The first one of these I ever did was about the opening of the movie Brain Donors and the OP couldn't have been more off on most of the details, but I recognized the vibe immediately.
No it’s a great question! The whole virtual reality thing was later in the movie. It’s the main character who doesn’t want to leave VR I think, but then he does and he’s in a giant hamster wheel. The hamster wheel is in a huge room with a bunch of other kids in hamster wheels. It sounds so weird saying it out loud but I think that’s what happened.
from Roger Ebert

[I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/north-1994)
Honestly the whole movie was one big fever dream. Idk how I remembered even enough to search for it at such a young age, but honestly for the longest time I thought maybe it was MY fever dream and not a real movie.
Okay North was released in 1994 so I was 2 when I saw it the first time and it was so bizarre I somehow remembered it for the next 3 decades.

[TOMT][phrase]What is a phrase or idiom about a person who is out of place, or feels like they don't belong?
Hello everyone,

I'm trying to find a phrase or idiom about a person who feels out of place or not belonging. I think it's something along the lines of "a duck in a sea of fish" which is definitely incorrect but so close to a real saying, but I just can't figure it out. Help!

EDIT: just to clarify, it's definitely got to do with animals, and there's no negative connotation to it as far as I know, just that the person in question is weird or different than the others
[Click here for a link to the answer!](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/187f7lb/tomtphrasewhat_is_a_phrase_or_idiom_about_a/kbfof9r/)
The black sheep? The ugly duckling?
Clown at a funeral. Dolphin pulling a dog-sled. Dirigible from Atlantis. These are hot new idioms for you!!
It's close to a fish out of water or a wolf in sheep's clothing but both of these imply either struggling, or a pretender. I'm looking more for the phrase about being different. I keep thinking it's animal based idiom but I could be wrong
Horse of a different color
Longer saying but maybe “ if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.”
Square peg in a round hole
It's not a comparative idiom, but "outside cat"?
I bet this isn't it but you made me think of the line in Beck's song "Loser":

In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey.
Fish out of water
Could you be conflating two idioms?

You cited "fish out of water," in one of your comments. There is an expression: "like a duck takes to water," and it's pretty much the opposite of "fish out of water." It describes the situation when someone is a natural at something.

Lost in the sauce
has to be black sheep
Yeah, "black sheep of the family" sounds like it.
I'd say no to black sheep because it carries a stain on it of disfavor or shame. OP isn't looking for that -- I don't think.
Very creative but not quite!
Not quite! I think this is close though
You just reminded me of the horse in wizard of Oz
Not quite - I'm looking for a saying about being different, not about being good or bad at something
Not quite what I was looking for although it works
IT'S A CAT. omg

The saying is the person is a "different breed of cat"

Thanks so much for the trigger!!
Solved
Congratulations on your first point! Nicely done.
It's not it but that's awesome, thanks!
Butane in my veins and I’m out to cut the junkie
Has to be this, especially with that example, ‘a fish on dry land’ I’ve heard before too but perhaps that was one of my immigrant friends lol, we sometimes mix up the expressions.
That’s called a malaform IIRC and I think Wikipedia has a whole list of common ones lol maybe OP should read through some of those!
I could be, but it's neither of those. It's about being out of place, not about someone being good or bad at something
Not quite...
I've never heard this using those birds, but it sure seems to fit OP's criteria.
Maybe it describes me, but it's not the phrase I'm looking for haha. Thanks though!
Not quite! This implies that the rose is better than the thorns, the one I'm looking for is not better or worse just different
Stranger in a strange land was my first thought. But it’s not animal-related.
Yeah it's neither of those. I used similar words as an example and that's on me but it's not those
This feels very close but it's not what I'm looking for. Maybe it's not a bird but a different animal
Not quite it. I do think it's ocean related but not this one sorry
Reminds me of "Rice ball in a fruits basket" from Fruits Basket the Manga/Anime.
Mmmmm bagels
Not what I'm looking for but amazing haha
this seems the most accurate judging by all the other comments
I haven't heard this one before specifically but I think it works haha
I've always said zebra in a barn full of horses, but this was my first thought too.
r/suggestmeabook
Good book !
I have never heard of these before but they are amazing, thank you haha

Hmm not quite...
🤣
Not quite...
I think this is close but not as "aggressive"
Haven't heard that before, ha!
Nope...
Nope, I'm looking for one that's about being different as an observation rather than something that needs to be fixed
Alternatively, theres also "guppy in a pool of sharks"
Haha I like that
I’ve heard it as odd bird
Sheldon Cooper should be his own idiom haha
Haha what
Nope
No...
That's a new one for me!
No, that's for an issue that people don't l aren't addressing
Technically correct but not the phrase I'm looking for
Never heard that before!
I like this one! But the one I'm looking for doesn't have a connotation of being damaging to the others
Something like this
No, sorry
Why is this downvoted so much? Feels like it fits better than most of these answers

Edit because comments are locked.
I didn't say it fits. I said it fits better than most other comments, and none of them got downvoted for that. So why did this one get so many?
Nope...
Not quite these, I think it's animal related
Haha not quite, it's more general than about age
That's more or less specifically time-related.
Not quite
I think there's an animal involved
That's certainly visual haha
I saw someone else suggest this as well
Not the proverb, sorry
Descriptively correct but not what I'm trying to think of!
I think it has less negative connotation
Not quite
[removed]
Not quite
Not quite, those are more about being forced to conform, the one I'm trying to think of is just stating a difference
Not quite
Nope
It's like the apple one but not with fruit
I think it's exactly this meaning but in English it's not this
Nope...
Great movie, but not the idiom I'm looking for!
Also a great movie but not what I'm looking for!
There's a negative connotation there
Nope
Not quite...
Nope
Nope
I really like this one but it's not it!
Nope! No negative connotation, in this case regarding appearance
Nope
Sorry no
Kinda but not it
Yeah that kind of idea
No
Nope
I agree
Somebody said horse of a different color and op said close. We might have our answer
yes. black sheep or odd duck. i think OP said no to both but id wager they’re mis-remembering or the saying is unfamiliar to the general population.
Solved
Except OP says [it isn’t](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/s/nmtCZcphn8)
I love talking to immigrants about American idioms. Or just like, weird things Americans say. My Persian friend loves that we eat a meal in the US, a fancy meal, called Surf and Turf. Another one that made her laugh a lot was when I said someone was a “cat burglar”. She was like “CAT? You are saying Cat? The animal? Cat Burglar?”
I understand. "Fish out of water" is about being out of place, though. In your [first comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/187f7lb/comment/kbdwx6g/), you said it implied "struggling or a pretender," but it also implies being out of place.

It, along with "square peg in a round hole," "horse of a different color," (which have been suggested by others) were the ones which sprang to mind, so I just wondered if you were combining the two idioms in your head.

Could you mean:

Odd duck?

Odd man out? 

Also, is it possible you first encountered the saying you're looking for in another language? It could be that it's an expression in French, or Mandarin, or Swahili, or whatever, and just isn't one common to English.
Different kettle of fish?
Fish out of water was my next guess lol
A tiger of a different stripe?
Best of luck! Hope you can find it :)
I suggest *Stranger in a Strange Land*.
[deleted]
I have a redheaded stepchild.  I once referred to something as a redheaded stepchild in front of him, he took that personally. lol
I think it's something like that but less aggressive?
I've heard odd bird as well.
You'd have to be an 80's kid to understand [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7oD_oX-Gio)
I read your post like an hour or two beforehand. Was lying down with my kid after they woke up from a bad dream and it popped into my head. Damn I thought I was onto a winner lol.
It doesn’t mean the same thing at all
A bull in a china shop refers to (usually) someone who is floundering and flailing around, more or less accidentally causing extensive damage, especially to rather delicate objects/subjects. So no. It doesn't fit at all.
alr
Feel free to reply "Solved!" to the parent comment. OPs tend to give a point to the person who helped them get to the answer. I will say, though, that this isn't the oldest comment to mention a cat, but if something about this phrase triggered it, then go for it (you can only give out 1 point).
Unable to award a point. If someone else gave the answer, please reply `Solved!` directly to their comment. If you found it yourself, no further action is necessary.
Ah weird, I didn’t see that, didn’t scroll for every single answer. Maybe it’s something like ‘judging a fish for their ability to fly’?
Big fish in a small pond and fish out of water have two different meanings.

Big fish = outgrown (usually intellectually or in a job) their surroundings

Fish out of water = clueless, no idea what's going on

Edit: replied to wrong comment, sorry
My favorite might be ‘it’s raining cats and dogs’, I can just picture it in my head 😄
I think it is in English. That being said I am multilingual so it's also possible I'm confusing something.
This seems like a good guess! Also reminds me of “cat of a different coat” (which is a line from the song The Rains of Castamere in GoT, not sure it’s a “real” idiom exactly)
Thanks!
I grok this book!
Amazing.

I do love me some Reese's...hmmm
I love that you just made this up. This is now a thing. I can't wait to use it in a meeting.
This was literally from when cats and dogs used to sleep on the thatched roof, and a heavy enough rain could break the roof open.
"Just fell off the turnip truck" is one of my favorites.
Good luck. I'm sorry I couldn't be of help.
You have been opponents plenty helpful, thank you for your time! I'm now trying to rack my brain in other languages, too lol
[TOMT] Help finding Movie or Show that traumatized me as a young child. 
This is a long shot as I only remember certain parts of this movie/show. 

Here's what I remember:

There is a family of four. A mom, a dad, an older brother and a little girl. One or two men break into their house and kill everyone but the little girl. She survives because she hid, my gut tells me she hid under the stairs but I also recall her hiding under the bed or in a closet? After the killers leave she runs into the forest, and she survives off of a piece of bubblegum or something crazy like that when she is found. I think it ends with her in a hospital, her voice is hoarse and she can't talk so she communicates by writing on a white board. I believe she may be communicating with her family's killer in that last scene. 

Here's some more context: 
This was in the early 2000s, perhaps between 2006-2011 as my older sisters was the one watching it and she lived with us during those years. 

I've tried asking her if she recalls this movie show and she says she can't remember but it sounds familiar. Perhaps I may be confusing two different movie/shows with each other or combining them in my memories but alas any ideas would be very helpful!
Kind of sounds like an episode of CSI titles Gum Drops. A little girls family is killed, she's kidnapped but leaves bits of her gum for her rescuers to follow. 

Editing to add: it ends with her in the hospital communicating by writing, she's too hoarse to speak.

Kinda.
So far, the only movie that seems kind of similar is High Tension, which I believe came out in 2003. But it doesn't feel right, and I want to know if literally anyone else in the world remembers this film how I do lol
Maybe the movie [Dark Places](https://youtu.be/SpG5dWV7piw?si=ojdi3d1gfJw-zXCX)?
*The Girl Next Door* (2007) or *An American Crime* (2007)
Martyrs, 2008?
Solved!
OH.MY.GOSH. 
You have NO idea how long this has bothered me. I have been trying to figure it out FOR YEARS because it scared me so badly as a kid. thank you!
I had to delete my response. I was thinking the same thing.
Congratulations, you've been given 1 point for solving this post! You now have *2* points. *(It's been 5 days since your [last point](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1duttr4/tomtmovie2000s_a_movie_where_a_woman_wakes_up_in/lbjbgxo/).)*
For whatever reason that episode has always stuck with me.

Might also be the heavy rotation it pops up on that CSI streaming channel (Pluto, I think?).
[TOMT] A song that has "wave goodbye" or something that sounds similar with lots of screaming
I have been trying ages to find a song that sounds Soundgarden -ish and Silverchair-ish and has lots of screaming, especially towards the end of the song. The only lyrics I can remember are "wave goodbye" or something that sounds like that. This phrase is repeated lots throughout the song, along with some rock/alternative music and instruments.

Hope someone knows what I'm talking about :)

Originally by Soft Cell, could also be that.
It's a long shot, but "Grand Unification Part 1" by Fightstar has "wake me up" in the chorus, which could be mistaken for "wave goodbye"? There's also a lot of screaming towards the end of the song in particular.

Omg. Long shot here, but I reallllly think this might be *Goodbye Waves and Driveways* by The Rocket Summer!
Too late to say goodbye by Cage the Elephant?
Photograph by Nickelback. It’s hard to say it, time to say it. Goodbye, goodbye
Good night, travell well; from the killers??
Maybe "child in time" from deep purple?
It’s not Tongue Tied by Grouplove?
"jimmy" by tool. The song contains the lyrics "wave goodbye" somewhere around the 4 min mark I think, and there is plenty of screaming.
BFMV did a song called Say goodnight is it that you’re thinking of?
*Wow* by Spin Doctors has the phrase "*say goodbye*" throughout and has a lot of different people singing over each other at the end, which might be remembered as screaming.  It's from same era, but is poppier than Soundgarden or Silverchair
This is probably a long shot, but I recall that "Everything" by Nine Inch Nails starts its second verse with "wave goodbye". It's hardly alt-rock and it doesn't really have screaming, but the song is mixed very loudly and some parts could be mistaken for borderline screaming. Someone else in the thread suggested another NIN song, that one could be worth looking into as well.
Do you recall when/where you heard it? For example: recently on the radio, in 2003 on rock radio, background of a movie, etc.?
Gone Away by The Offspring?
Far Behind By Candlebox?
The Toadies -[possum kingdom](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EkwD5rQ-_d4) ?
When I think of repeated screamed lyric and Soundgarden my first thought is “Outshined,” you could be generous with interpretation and hear “goodbye” instead of “outshined?”
Totally not the Pixies wave of mutilation but I’ll say it anyways
Sextape by deftones ? They scream “tonight” a lot especially towards the end and is rock alternative
Filter - “Hey Man Nice Shot”?
My wave by Soundgarden?
Was it “clumsy” by our lady peace?
Be Quiet and Drive (far away) - Deftones
Everything by Nine Inch Nails?
Black hole sun by Sound Garden? It has 'Won't you come' and screaming at the end.
Be Quiet and Drive( Far Away) by Deftones
Is it Save Tonight by Eagle-Eye Cherry?
Ooh is it possibly Aha's Manhatten Skyline?
[Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goobye](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jsaTElBljOE) by Steam?
Is it possible you heard "say goodbye" instead? Might help your hunt
Kalopsia by Queens of the Stone Age?
Could it be Wave Goodbye by Framing Hanley? Not really Soundgarden sounding, but definitely has the screamo element throughout the song and a lot towards the end, but most of the song is rock/alternative without being too hard rock.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEoaXDuN4js
Song to Say Goodbye by Placebo?
When Worlds Collide - Power Man 5000? 

It's screamy, and popped into my head with the phrase "wave goodbye" (lyrics are 'this is what it's like when world's collide')
The first thing I thought of was Sleepwalking by Blindside….fair amount of screaming and “Goodbye” as like part of the bridge
i think the answer to this one is definitely a-ha - Manhattan Skyline!
"Manhattan Skyline" by A-ha

Goodbye Waves - From First To Last
Soft Cell: Wave Hello, Say Goodbye?
Say Goodbye by Hunters & Collectors
"Hate Me" by Blue October?
“You Always Say Goodnight” by The Juliana Theory?
Goodbye waves- from first to last
Could it be Say Goodbye by the Hunters and Collectors.
could be very old U2 : [Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpsAg5ypK4Y)
Last goodbye - Jeff Buckley?
This is a long shot, but [Shawn Mullins - Lullaby](https://youtu.be/hG9C0VwruXE?t=223) ?  


Rock a bye, not wave goodbye
The Nixons' "Sister" has a lyric in the chorus saying "saying goodbye," that might be close.  Maybe?
First thing I thought of when I read "wave goodbye" was With Teeth by Nine Inch Nails, probably isn't the right song since it doesn't match the rest of the description but you never know 🤷‍♂️
Xerces by deftones?
System of a Down - Streamline?

Sounds to me like you're describing Wave Goodbye by Ty Segall band?
Sounds like kalopsia by queens of the stone age

Says "wave bye bye" though
"wave goodbye" immediately made me think of Manhattan Skyline by A-ha. Although I wouldn't say it has a lot of screaming, they do sing passionately for sure.
Consider asking chatgpt3?
Hunger Strike - Temple of the Dog  is your answer
Boston - more than a feeling?
Sounds like bright eyes to me a little bit, but I'm realizing I initially thought you meant crowd screaming, not singer screaming. So I thought maybe False Advertising.
The Empire Records cover of [Sugar High](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwIYdlO7yWk)?

Human by the killers
I’ll be waving my hand watching you drown, watching you scream?
[Say Goodbye - Skillet](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_XzA0FEEyF8) ?
Don’t know but Say Hello, Wave Goodbye is a great song by Soft Cell.
Third Eye Blind -[Semi charmed life](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=beINamVRGy4) ? Edit: please disregard, another has made this guess.
This is a long shot but could it be "Tangerine Sky" by Slightly Stoopid ?
Brand new day from dr horribles sing along blog?
Third eye blind?
This may be way off base, but Hanson has a song called Hand in Hand that has the phrase “say goodbye” repeated a lot throughout it and at the end.
Bastille-pompeii
The end of Hand in Hand by Hanson? Lol
Was it RA?
Cancer - My Chemical Romance
Goodbye- 28 days? Definitely yelling.
Say Goodnight by Bullet for my Valentine?
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7MPzv78cWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7MPzv78cWs)  Jeff Rosenstock - Wave Goodnight to Me
Could you have misheard "what it takes" instead of "wave goodbye"? "What it Takes" by Aerosmith has Steve Tyler's characteristic 'screaming'.
Godley & Creme, Cry checks all the boxes!

https://youtu.be/IvzFt8PPXvE?feature=shared
These seems unlikely, but “A modern myth” by 30 seconds to mars?
Not quite the same lyric, but is it "Kissing You Goodbye - The Used"?
The end has a lot of overlapping singing/screaming and is a slower song of theirs.
Kissing you goodbye is repeated several times throughout the song as well as part of the chorus.
Could it be vanity and greed by Silverstein?
Probably wrong but 
Do me a favor by arctic monkeys?
Long slow goodbye by queen of the stone age?
absolutely not, unless someone's made a cover of it, "but anyways":

Erasure - "[My heart... so blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zOdi9E_pmk)", from the "[Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderland_\(Erasure_album\))" album (1986)

("Wave goodbye" is repeated throughout the song,  
and despite it having a crescendo at the end, I'd say it's very very calm.)
Sail by Awolnation?
Probably not since it’s a metalcore song but…

[Vanguard](https://youtu.be/6kC3mN-qaBg?si=RAAbtzgWpy4xb5Xd) by August Burns Red starts with “Wave Goodbye” repeated in the opening verse.

[Dark Title Sequence Song](https://youtu.be/66VnOdk6oto?si=2R8PYc9fWTV9pDia)

My chemical romance- To the end
[https://youtu.be/HZI0KyBjaGs?si=clKt4Xnwrvaw1zOG](https://youtu.be/HZI0KyBjaGs?si=clKt4Xnwrvaw1zOG)  I was 18 and in this crowd. :)
[Say goodnight](https://youtu.be/2jzytzlkla8?si=gXbtfv_x2WhjheLf) - bullet for my valentine
Probs not this but Afterlife - Avenged Severfold
Lyric is 'say goodbye' with little bit of screaming throughout the song
I highly doubt this is it, and "waves" and "goodbye" are used in separate lyrics, but a song that I thought of that wasn't mentioned here is "Second Chance" by Shinedown.
Kind of a long shot here because he says “say goodnight” but Head Club by Taking Back Sunday comes to mind.
Steven by Senses Fail?
Slippin through my fingers by Mamma mia?
Goodbye by Depeche Mode?
Moist - "Sunday Comes" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG_RzCEtNCQ no screaming though...
Live and Let Die - Wings?
Possibly later than what you're looking for based on other guesses... Simple Plan "[Time to Say Goodbye](https://youtu.be/0qs6fICWBw4?si=BI7vn75fQPVBvC2m)"?
Cast, walk away?
Goodbye we're falling fast by Aiden?

Edit: corrected song name
Is it “It’s About Showing Up” by Blegh? https://open.spotify.com/track/7ztdb8r0mwxUtkoBHhZ6bB?si=KWQ1777fSHeIzU2y89sbig
Definitely a long shot, but could it be [New Normal - Jack Stauber](https://youtu.be/b4lNq4nhdDQ?si=RYNNX-jVVNtTLMGo)? The "say goodbye to those that cannot join us" lyric and the screaming immediately brought it to mind, but he only says it once, not multiple times.
Is it "say goodbye" by Greenday?
Murder in the Make Believe Ballroom by The Blackout?

"Say goodbye" is repeated a lot and there's some screaming.
Might not be it but this reminds of the end of “Cheek to Cheek”. There’s some screaming and a part where they say “goodbye”
Skillet - Say Goodbye ?
Could it have been "say goodbye"? If so could it have been

[Say Goodbye by Hunters and Collectors](https://open.spotify.com/track/5AKaW81jkQVDd4t7SNuJDx?si=bcX5qXCJQSa_3uwjTYDCeQ)?
All I can think of is: Slaughter the martyr from Machinehead.

Eta: starts a bit slow. And then comes the harder music.
Screamy goodbyes suggests it might be something like [Goodbye (Astrid, Goodbye) by Cold Chisel](https://open.spotify.com/track/5ej8axgwRwWnlMuqas4YDL?si=G0GkasAuRs21glHLNekAVw) but it lacks the waves or says component.
Is it waving through a window from dear Evan hansen? Lol
Its got no screaming but i'l say it jusr incase, i mean maybe you heard a cover idk, but 'Wave Goodbye' Steadman
Say Goodbye - Creed?

Say Hello Wave Good Bye by David Grey?
Is it by chance a Will Wood song?
Matchbox twenty -how far we’ve come
Not too close to what you're describing, but I guess it's possible. The Bouncing Souls [have a fun song with "goodbye" in it](https://youtu.be/y-jg09VzfaM?si=sXeendBQKb2d584Z). Hopefully someone out there forgot this song exists and wants to hear it again.

As U Wave by HalfNoise?
Goodbye We’re Falling Fast - Aiden

“Say goodbye” is repeated throughout.
Don’t think it’s the right vibe but As U Wave by Halfnoise
This Love by Maroon 5?
Not sure if it's been suggested yet, my first thought was The Movement of a Hand by Bright Eyes
Maybe "Tears Me In Two" by The Stems. It has the "wave goodbye" bit over and over. It's an 80s Australian track with a 60's garage vibe to it.
Goodbye - Bear in the big blue house
Airplane by RHCP has a bunch of kids at almost the end who yell and then are told to whistle which they do right before the song finishes
Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind
Chop Suey! - System of a Down?
When You Die -MGMT. It's more 'alternative' than alternative rock specifically though
This love - Maroon 5
Kissing you goodbye?
Is it that one song that goes “na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbyeeee”
First guess was Queens of the Stone Age - Long Slow Goodbye:

https://youtu.be/4a3iYuaovBA?si=ubv5u_w3obDMDto1


Second would be Shinedown - Black Cadillac

https://youtu.be/smvwKuqt_qU?si=MJ1-8wwPGFs-vP-o

The second song repeats the “Wave bye-bye in a long black Cadillac” chorus over and over in the ending.
Vanguard by August Burns Red is likely your answer.
Long shot, but maybe A modern myth by 30 seconds to Mars? Doesn't say wave goodbye, only goodbye. But it's alternative and it has instruments and Jared Leto screams goodbye towards the end. Still a long shot.
Manhattan skyline by A-ha? 

It starts slow then builds up not exactly to screaming, but the singer gets real passionate
Helena - My Chemical Romance chorus is like “so long and good night” maybe you’re thinking that
How to save a life
"A Modern Myth " by 30 Seconds to Mars?

In "man in the box" the "feed my eyes" part in the chorus could be misheard as "wave goodbye"? No screaming on that song though.
My brain is telling me it's a Nirvana song, but that guy's cray yo
Smile and wave - Headstones ?
This is a very long shot probably but the end of “give me love” by Ed Sheeran is just him screaming “give me love” over and over
Say Goodbye - Green Day
Circa waves - goodbye
"From the Ground" by Hollywood Undead?
[Real Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUe4zYAZsMg) by Indigo De Souza has a section of the song towards the end where it descends into frantic screams. Could be this?
Probably a long shot but is it dealer by Lana deal Rey?
Probably a long shot, but a song I really like by Juliana Theory is called "You always Say Goodnight, Goodnight" 
The song is about 9 minutes long, the beginning of the song is slowish with piano, but near the end they get loud and faster while he screams "you always say goodnight" which I could see as misunderstood as you "you always wave goodbye." Probably not the song, but i like it anyways so it may be worth your time.

Scream Goodbye- Handguns
You said it isn’t wave goodbye by chris cornell (that would be the obvious choice), but try all the other songs from his album euphoria morning. Like cant change me, preaching the end of the world, steel rain.. or any other.
I know you said wave goodbye, but this song came into my head while I was reading your post. He does scream “thanks a lot” at the end of the song a lot which is on theme. [THANKS ALOT](https://ThanksaLothttps://g.co/kgs/j1jH2p)
A song to say goodbye- Placebo?

The Teacher by Foo Fighters? There are a lot of goodbyes in that one. Newer song.

Not a lot of screaming but maybe Interstate Love Song?  Stone Temple Pilots
Eulogy, by Tool?
Song to say goodbye by placebo? Not necessarily screaming at the end but the music itself sounds like screaming
Manhattan Skyline by A HA
Also a long shot, but [Silver Sun Pickups - Lazy Eye](https://youtu.be/O_zvGIBreoI?si=hH926QDOTsWZTRmJ)
Sugar Boats by Modest Mouse! “Wave bye sugar boats” and ends with “bye” repeatedly and chaotically.
Save Yourself by Stabbing Westward?

It has to be Wave Goodbye by Ty Segall (band) 

https://youtu.be/-FSTSlyB9sQ?si=oRdmwGo2edgdFONv
“Say Hello, Wave Goodbye” by Soft Cell??
“Black Cadillac” by Shinedown

I actually really think I got this one
Any of the live versions of Heart So Blue by Erasure would have that. "Wave goodbye" is repeated often 

They also have tons of remixes if all their songs.
It sounds like you might be looking for the song "Blow Up the Outside World" by Soundgarden. The lyrics include the phrase "blow up the outside world," which might sound similar to "wave goodbye." The song features Chris Cornell's powerful vocals and has a distinctive grunge sound.
The Used - Bulimic

"Goodbye to you, goodbye to you, you're taking up my time
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you"
Is it rock or is it more like emo?
Wave Goodbye by Framing Hanley?
Goodbye Beautiful Day by Aviatic?

OMG yes this is the song!! Thank you so much
Solved!
Congratulations on your first point! Nicely done.
This was the first song that popped up in my head.
https://voca.ro/1g8I3uYisLyH

Here is my crappy rendition!
David Gray did a cover of it

[here](https://youtu.be/NSXQWj0HEBE?si=cGJrY-TD3ajxtgSu)
Came to mention David Gray who does this at live shows sometimes changes the lyrics but has a chorus of Say Hello, Wave Goodbye”.
My thoughts as well!
GOOOOODBYEEEEE
NICE TO KNOW YOUUUUU
we had tickets to see Incubus in LA and we lived in Vegas. Drove there with my brother in law,his wife, 8 month old daughter and good friend. Can you guess what my brother in law left in the safe in Vegas and the concert was that night?......THE TICKETS MY BRO!!!
YOU HAD.... 1 JOB, WELL 2 CUZ YOU WERE DRIVING!! 
That song hits a nerve for me 😆
Man, I’ve not heard OLP mentioned in sooo long!
Damn good song!
I thought this too!
Also seconding, though i thought i was thinking about Cherry Waves
my first thought as well, I'LL BE WAVING GOODBYYYYYEEEEEE
I almost wrote this comment word for word until I saw yours lol
I’m banking on this too
i was about to comment the same
I thought it was this song because of the matching lyric, but it's not :(. I may have misheard the lyrics though so it could be something completely different.
A song that sounds like soundgarden with the lyric “wave goodbye.”

“Wave Goodbye” by the lead singer of soundgarden?

No.

Hahaha
No, the song is much slower :(
My first thought!
This song is so fucking good tho.
It's [wave goodnight to me](https://youtu.be/z7MPzv78cWs?si=hX-FN5eHK6h-8jmI) yeah that's what I thought too.
I came here to mention this but I saw OP say it’s a slower song.
This was my first thought too!  Here's a link to the part you reference, followed by the much louder chorus. https://youtu.be/WY2r28M1TrY?si=yV5BFeOX\_L8gv1Ww&t=28
Ihsahn and Einar Solberg also do a cover of this which is a bit heavier. I wonder if it's that?
That's what I was thinking of
First one I thought of, too!
This was my guess too
It doesn't sound like Silverchair or Soundgarden though.
Such a criminally underrated band
I came here to say this one.
Happy cake day
This is actually what came to my mind immediately
Ugh I love Chronic Future so much. Thanks for reminding me it’s time to listen through their album again.
I went to middle school with that guy, same bus stop. I've never heard anyone mention them before!
The whole time I was reading through this post I kept thinking "there's a nine inch nails song like this...I can't remember the name of the song but they had an entire tour with the same 'wave goodbye' name". So thank you for posting the song name!
Was going to bring this one up.

Trent never released it on album, he only played it live and would often open concerts with it. Great song.
He’s so good!!
Not quite, but it does have a similar vibe. It's less hard rock I think??
was just abt to comment this
Was my guess too
Ahhh the only 30 Seconds to Mars album I enjoy
I was thinking Oasis too, but could be Don’t look back in anger.
Kind of, has a more edgy vibe to it though
I was thinking the same!
I was thinking the same!
Wave goodbye.   To what you were.  The rules have changed.    The lines begin to blur. 

  Awitha Teetha!
Wow, first person I’ve seen on here that knows of Mika outside of Grace Kelly lol
No, is more rockish and has similar vocals Chris Cornell
Love this song!
No, it sounds more modern then that song.
I’ve loved this song for over 20 years and never even knew it was a cover. 🤯
So sad that was a one album project.  Soooo good
This is what I immediately thought of.
Nailed it.  🎯
This was my guess as well
I LOVE MERCURY REV
“March into the Sea”
Thank you for not saying “Where Is My Mind”.
My first thought as well
Yeah I was thinking U2 “Seconds”, which ends that way and is kind of “yell-y” at the end
This is my guess also.
What I reckon it is too. I heard it first from that sketch and I play it to my friends and they hate it UNTIL it gets going and we basically play out the sketch but they never know it ;)
Was gonna comment this too
This was gonna be my guess, too.
I think the same thing this has to be it
??? They don’t yell, they sing, the song is called Aeroplane, and OP mentioned nothing about children
Wait ignore this I thought this was a parenting group hahaha
Long shot but hey
Their song Vanguard literally starts with “Wave Goodbye” but I’d doubt it’s them since OP didn’t seem to be talking about a metal song.

u/LunarLegend75 ,to me, your vocaroo sounds alot like the song that's been suggested by u/gk29003. Did you check that one out yet?
This was my thoughts but op then mentioned a little rock to it
Dude, it’s gotta be our deftones boys, right? Idk what else it could be
Could be a cover of this song? Some covers sound very different than the original, so if the lyrics somewhat match but the song doesn’t, it could’ve been a different artist’s take.
There’s a song called wave goodbye by Ty segall band and I have a strong felling it might be it
You laugh but it's stuff like this that makes this sub so much fun
I’m just happy seeing Jeff mentioned
They’re definitely one of my faves. And SO good live.
Thank ya thank ya!
That’s awesome! I have only found one person irl that actually knows the band. They’re so good
Agree!!!
I firmly believe that Life in Cartoon Motion is one of the single best albums ever made. It is extraordinary rare that every single song on an album is individually fantastic, and LICM is one of them. 

I can only really think of one other example: Torches by Foster the People. Maybe Back in Black by AC/DC as well.

ETA: the best song on LICM is My Interpretation and its criminal that its not more famous.
Absolutely gorgeous song.

The ending lyrics in David Gray's version are taken from/inspired by Into The Mystic by Van Morrison.
That is wonderful. Limmy just understands how people work
[removed]
I came here to suggest it, so, same!
Except they guessed it three hours before OP posted the vocarooo. Good on them, I think they got it.
[TOMT][BOOK][CLASSIC] That book everyone read in middle school
It's a story about two people who are pretty close, and one of them has down syndrome or something. At the end, one of them says something like "think of the rabbits, bitch" and then shoots him in the back of the head. I remember that it was a mercy killing because some bad people were after them, or something?

Kinda wanna go back to it and read an analysis of  it because surely he didn't *have* to shoot him, right?
Of mice and men. The quote does not include bitch
It's a classical book that's pretty old, I wanna say 1940s or something? Total guess tho

Solved! Thanks
[TOMT] Two girls locked in bunker by a guy claiming there is a sickness going around the earth and he’s keeping them safe. After awhile their skepticism grows and they kill him. Once they get out, they discover the world has actually gone to hell and there are crazy aliens taking over everything. 
They begin to stop believing him after one of the girls has flashbacks of him running her off the road with his car and essentially kidnapping her. She has some type of amnesia and her memory of the event gets clearer over time. The man repeatedly claims he’s keeping them safe from the outside world (ironically actually the case) but they begin to think they’re being held captive for nefarious purposes. Both girls are unaware of the state of the world outside because they were put in the bunker by the man prior to either of them finding out about the aliens. One of the girl might have died during the escape, I can’t remember. One of the first things that happens when they escape is this random women pulls up to the building they ran too when they escaped the bunker hatch nearby, and she stumbles to the house (more like a shack) door trying to get in. This is when they realize something’s not right. I think the women is clearly fucked up in some way so they don’t let her in and then she’s merc’d by the alien creatures. I think the creatures are on all 4’s and like super fast, can’t remember though. The setting is like tall grassland cornfield Kansas type place. Pretty interesting movie. Anybody know what I’m talking abt lol?
Sounds kind of like Cloverfield with John Goodman but it's been a long time since I've seen it.
The man is burly and a force to be reckoned with. They destroy the bunker with fire and eventually burn him alive as they climb the ladder
Hell yea dude that’s it, nice one thank you for that.

[TOMT] [WORD] A word that means to get rid of something
It means to get rid of something or put something away, I think. I keep thinking of the word 'relegated' but the definition is a bit different. I think the word I'm looking for has a similar structure though, and almost definitely at least three syllables. Thanks in advance for helping me find the right word!

Edit: it definitely means more to retire something and stop using it, than to throw something away. Pretty sure it starts with a re- or de- or ne-

It is not relinquish, decommission, defenestrate, renounce, eschew, negate, or renounce

In the context of your description it would be like 'to be made redundant', 'to take a redundancy', 'she's not retiring, her position was made redundant'...?
Divest
Redact?
Disposition (that is the term we use at my company when we retire equipment from service—fill out a Disposition Form)
Discontinued
Discontinue?

I have a feeling that otherwise it might be considered “jargon” in that it carries that specific meaning just for a specific field, e.g. “disavowed” for secret agents and *Mission: Impossible* stories.
deprecate 

At least in a software engineering capacity it means to stop using something in favour of a better way of doing things. Often the old way will continue to be used/supported for a while but you should move to the newer version.

Eg: That version of the api is deprecated, you should use v3 instead.
Expunge?
Remit, intermit, keep in abeyance
Eschew?
Excision?
declutter?
Remand?
remove, reduce, recede?
dismiss, disband, negate?
Deregulation
Resignation or resign
Demilitarize?
running out of words, so much has been guessed. maybe it's not the word itself but like how it's used in a phrase. i.e. you say it's put to rest/retire I'd guess you were meaning 'out to pasture'
Decommission?
Disband?

Abdicate?

Deprecate?

Dismantle?

Retire?

Exfiltrate?
Consign?
Foisted?
Delegated could mean to have gotten rid of the responsibility of a task to someone else
Rescind
Denigrated? Disparaged?
Things are often ‘relegated to the shelf’ etc when you stop using them or sports players are ‘relegated to the bench’ so it’s likely the right word. 

If not then: 
- reneged 
- rescind 
- resign 
- regress
Eradicate?
Sequester
not a re-, de-, or ne- start, but tossing "sunsetted" into the ring
Yeet?
Deaccession? (Typically used in the context of a museum/library's collection)
this is killing me😂
Retrograde
Requiesce ~~, as a somewhat improper (?) English verb form of "requiescence" (at least, this is my best guess)~~

Seen more commonly in Latin as "requiesce in pace" which seems to be the original R.I.P.?

Edit: I'm psyching myself out now 🙈 If "acquiesce" is a verb in English, I don't see why "requiesce" couldn't also be a verb in English. But "requiesce" remains solidly my guess, regardless!

Edit 2: OP come back 😭 I feel so confident with my guess
Remit? As in to remit something, to put into remission. Consigning it away.
Redacted?
delegate? dispatch?
Deposit? Haven’t seen anyone put that. Starts with de-, has three syllables and can be fitting to the definition.
Divest or Divested maybe?
Remediate?
Apologies if it was already said, but sometimes people use the word sunset as a verb, for shutting something down / decommissioning it.
Based on your description, the word you might be thinking of could be "obsolete." It means no longer in use or outdated, and while it doesn't have three syllables, it fits the context of retiring or stopping the use of something. Other possibilities could be "discontinue" or "displace.

Eradicate is what I got from "relegated," but I'm not sure it quite fits
I think you are looking for relegated but as part of the larger phrase "relegated to the dustbin of history"
resignate - to force or otherwise cause the resignation of someone or something
Demarcate?
Negate?
Came here to say this. It’s gotta be this.
I didn't know that, I've never heard it used in that way so I do think it's another word that just sounds similar
I'm gonna laugh so hard if the answer is "yeet."
Decommission is very similar in meaning totally he word I'm looking for
Not this one
This is my guess as well
Based on the edit, this is my guess as well.
Deprecated is more like a reduction of quality than getting rid of something
No, I'm pretty sure it's a longer word
Or obsolete
Nope
No, not it
Nah this has to be it
No :(
This is very close but I don't think it's it
I lean towards purge as well. Especially due to its connection to the word regurgitate. OP may be linking the two
This definitely isn't it but thank you for teaching me something new!
we used to use it when talking about throwing a drunk out who was making as ass of themselves.  as in *"that's it!  you're 86'd!"*
Renounce is pretty close, I do think it starts with re-
No, it means more to retire something or put something to bed
This isn't it but I think I'm looking for a synonym of retire
Terminate is a good guess but not it unfortunately
This would be my guess.
This isn't it unfortunately
I did think this at first but I think it means more to lay something to rest, if that makes sense? Like to decide to stop using something or to stop following a plan?
This was going to be my guess as well.
Pretty sure op isn’t thinking of throwing out the window…
It's not this unfortunately
None of these
It's definitely only one word
Nope
No neither of these
I wouldn't say it's either legal or scientific to be honest, it's more along the lines of meaning to retire something or to lay something to rest?
No, it means more to get rid of something, or to retire something I guess
Gotta be this
No, but thank you
[removed]
No I'm definitely thinking of a verb but thank you
It's not bequeath. I agree, I think we're running out of options and I might have just imagined such a word 😞
Regulated? Less because I think its the answer, more because I misread theirs
so simple, yet so elegant. monosyllable!
*to the word I'm looking for

Sorry decommission isn't it
Im very surprised relinquished isn’t it. Perhaps in the same vein as decommissioning something, you then seek to “repurpose” it?
Deprecate?
Retire?

Like when an old worn sweater has been retired to the back of the closet.
[deleted]
No, that would be depreciate. Deprecate (especially of software) would be like defunct code.
How about decommission? I commented it on the main post, but assumed it’d be buried. First your description quite well. Anyway, hope it comes to ya!
renounce?
Redacted?
Recant?
Reassess, Re-evaluate or Redundant?
repatriate?
Relinquish
[removed]
I do believe you are actually thinking of relegated. Like in Ted Lasso, when Richmond FC was relegated to the Championship, the key is they were downgraded/retired from/excluded from the Premier League.
redundant, as in redundancy. Used in the UK a lot, hardly ever in North America.
Damn, good luck? It's like an itch lol is it repudiate
[removed]
Maybe extirpated? Terminated?
Requiescence?
resign?
Deaccession?
Is it deactivate?
In software, "deprecated" can mean basically "usable but obsolete because something better has come along to replace it." Like features or code that have been superseded but still hang around just in case removing them causes errors are "deprecated."
And in other contexts, it can mean a practice that, while not outright unacceptable, is no longer preferred.
This is the one I'm thinking of too
No it's definitely a verb, but with a very similar meaning as to make something redundant
Thank you, I've been trying to think of this word for about a week and I keep going to say it and just saying relegate instead! No not repudiate but thanks :(
Which is pretty much what it means in software with the added caveat that it may become obsolete and unusable in a future release.

[TOMT] [MOVIE] Is this disturbing movie I remember real or not?
Alright. There’s this movie I watched as a kid that deeply disturbed me. I’m unsure if it was real or not but it was really disgusting. I guess I just want to know if I made it up or not so I apologize for what I’m about to describe to you: 

All I remember is that the characters are all in some kind of cabin in the woods. I think it was snowing outside. 
Anyway, in the cabin was a mom with her two kids, late teens/early twenties I think. (I’m 95% sure they were her kids, but maybe I misremembered that) There was also a man who I assume held them captive. 
He ordered the kids, who were siblings (whether biological or step-siblings I don’t know), to MAKE OUT. The kids looked up to the mom like "Mom, we don’t wanna do that wtf” but I think the mom told them to do it because she didn’t want them to die. The man had an axe by the way. So the siblings make out and the mom watches and looks disturbed and I think even angry? And now this part I’m unsure about but someone kills the siblings mid-act. I just don’t remember if it was the man or the mom. I’m leaning towards mom, though I don’t know if it’s because she was ordered to.

I must’ve watched this around the early 2010s. But the movie could’ve been released from anywhere 2000-2013. Obviously it’s some kind of horror/thriller. That’s all I remember. 

Edit- Some other small things I vaguely remember that might help: When the two were made to make out they were lying on a couch. There was a big fireplace in the room. It was a place with a lot of snow. I’m now leaning a bit more towards the mom being the one who ended up using the axe on both of them. I think the mom was also blonde with short hair possibly.

Sounds like Cary Stayner, the Yosemite Park killer, in real life
It's probably not it but for some reason it reminds me of Dogtooth
!!!
It almost sounds like The Lodge but that came out 2019 😕
I think I saw a movie like that recently. Does the cabin end up caught on fire at the end?
Is it the cottage (2012)?
Barricade (2012)?
Maybe Lake Dead (2007)? Some details don’t match up though.
Probably not the movie but reminds me of the movie The Lodge (2019)
It kinda makes me think of a movie called Funny Games, but I'm not sure.
The details are off but it reminds me of The Devil’s Rejects somehow

Congratulations, you've been given 1 point for solving this post! You now have *28* points.
I’ll look into it. Maybe they based a movie or something on him.
That’s such a weird movie. And I could see this happening in that film, it’s been a long time since I watched it.
I was thinking that's what it reminds me of but it wasn't in a cabin
I don’t remember. After the two are killed with an axe, I think the mom and possibly also the man (not 100% sure about this) run out the cabin. You can tell that it must be some place that has a lot of snow, it was hard for to run. The man chases after her and I don’t remember anything else because I was so disturbed I ran away to hide in my room, because I didn’t wanna watch anymore lol.
Unfortunately not.
Not it.
I’ve seen Funny Games, it’s really good but unfortunately it’s not the movie I’m talking about.
That’s unfortunately not it.
Wasn't John Travolta in that?
the serbian film has nothing to do with snow or cabins. Just alot of extremely deranged porn scenarios
Not it.
Not it.
Nope, that’s not it. The kids in the movie I remember were way older.
I thought mama too at first with kids n woods, but there was no making out or bad guy dad figure I think

Although OP did say they could be misremembering 🤔 but yeah
that definitely did not happen in serbian film
100% not that movie lol
You shouldn't guess a movie you don't actually know much about because it is also disturbing. It's just super unhelpful. Imagine if someone was asking about an action film with a giant sea monster that eats people and attacks the main characters, who then kill anshark with explosives and I said, "I haven't seen Finding Nemo because I don't like movies that take place in the ocean so, why would I ever watch that, but this sounds like something that would happen in that movie."
Was that just a random guess? Nothing in that movie matched the description lol
Not it.
The Macaulay Culkin movie??
You're thinking of The Devil's Rain.
Yeah, he's actually the godfather to rob zombie's children, and John was having trouble getting work after he did Battlefield Earth, so Rob gave him a little cameo.
I feel like horror/incest/murder movie spectrum is *a bit* smaller than "movies that take place in the ocean".
You're right, I am...but apparently he was in both (and I don't want to see either one--no scary movies, thank you).
Wait wait wait, what. I have seen that movie so many times. Where is John Travolta????
That is a fair point. But the horror/incest/murder movie spectrum is at least the same size as movies that take place in the ocean with explosives and a shark.
I really don't think John Travolta was in The Devil's Rejects.
JOHN TRAVOLTA IS IN TDR?!?
Now that may be true!
[TOMT] [BAND] [EARLY 2010s] The worst edgy emo band I've ever heard in my life at a concert
This one has been haunting me for a while now. 

I'm from the United States, Idaho specifically, and the concert was at the Boise Knitting Factory. I was 12 to 13 when I went to this concert with my "friend". This friend was into music ala Blood on the Dance Floor and other bands similar to them. The concert had a lot of different bands, but this particular one is what stands out. 

They were absolutely horrible, and I can't remember their name or their music for the life of me. I do remember how they looked however. One of the band members, possibly the lead singer, wore a white, almost circus conductor looking white jacket. He was blonde and had some sort of Norwegian or Swedish accent. I had given him a pin of Germany from Hetalia and he wore it during the concert. There was someone who had a channel dedicated to interviews and videos of concerts of bands like this, and my friend and I tapped on his shoulder while he was recording as a joke. This is how I know footage 100% has to exist somewhere. 

I also remember the drummer having long hair. I believe the band had four members. My friend and I actually chatted with the band before and after their turn in the concert and they were very pleasant, even if their music was awful. 

I would give anything to find this band again so I can hear just how rancid their music was once again.
Farewell My Love?
It wasn’t Dot Dot Curve? The lead singer wasn’t Scandinavian but every time he opened his mouth, it seemed like he had a different accent. His name was Spanky 😭
I have already checked a concert archive website and looked at all the concerts that played from 2010 to 2013 and I'm still stumped. There's probably something I'm not able to articulate that could help me find them.
Is it possible that it was Mindless Self Indulgence? They’re akin to BOTDF and are not very good. Their website says that they played Knitting Factory in 2008
[Volbeat?](https://youtu.be/vEN3mQ0ql30?si=jdVEJLZrtxAW9k58)
DUDE HOLY SHIT YEAH THAT'S THEM
!SOLVED!
Congratulations, you've been given 1 point for solving this post! You now have *29* points.
Just looked them up, that isn't them unfortunately.
Definitely not. The band I saw was not popular enough to get that many views.
