Average twitter user take.
There is no way in chance that GTA 6 flops financially even if it somehow is the worst game ever made. Did these people forget how much money GTA 5 made in day one, when people didn’t even know if they would like it or not. And it has made like 12 billion by today. Rockstar are making a profit on GTA 6 the first day they release it. 
The first week it will make its money back, definitely
...And how long has *GTA V* been selling?  And is it still getting updates to this day? lol

Take Two and Rockstar will print money with this one.  Which is kind of paradoxical considering how many AAA games have tanked or sputtered out quickly upon release.
> State of Leonida will expand over time

I can’t _wait_ to see this with my own eyes so I can finally believe it
GTA V sold 11.2 million units in the first 24 hours.  Lets predict GTA VI sells 20 million in the first 24 hours- that's $1.4 billion.  Imagine what those numbers look like after 3 years.  Anybody who does not think GTA VI will break every record GTA V set, must have been hit by a drunk driver several times.
Where does this “$2bn budget” keep coming from? Does anyone actually have a source on that? Because I’ve heard it several times now but nobody seems to source have a source for it.

Sounds unrealistic as hell, even for Rockstar.
GTA 5 earned $1 billion in its first days, GTA 6 will do the same on pre-orders
damn even I would buy it if people said it was bad, It likely will be profitable before it even releases due to preorders and such
It’ll probably make its budget back on pre orders it’s the most anticipated piece of entertainment of all time
Ahh twitter, the place where all functioning brain cells go to die
Meh, this is nothing. You should see what people post on this subreddit
im about to buy a new console prior to the release just to play this game, so…
I don’t really believe the development since 2014 thing (unless there’s any official information). There were probably rough story and setting sketches but I feel like they wouldn’t have actively started developing the game until after RD2 launched
I guarantee that GTA VI will break even the day it comes out
I'm seriously considering buying an Xbox just for playing this game on launch. This take is pretty bad.
The game will make its money back in under a week
Didn’t GTA V make like a billion the first week? Also I think they make like 750 million a year from shark cards alone. Now because of the long anticipation for GTA 6, this will hands down be the biggest game release in history and they can do 2-3x that easy. Especially considering most women now like to play video games too compared to 2013. This game will pull crazy numbers.
it'll probably make that back just in preorders lmao
That person should be required to pay everybody money if he's wrong.
How could anyone doughty gta6 at this point, also 2 billion seems like an exaggeration
lol they’re gonna make billions the first weekend
If you consider the copies sold (PS3/4/5, Xbox 360/One/Series X/S, PC: total well over 200 millions), the money made on GTA Online with Sharkcards, the merchandise, the various collaborations (like with Epic Games but not only) etc...GTA V alone made Rockstar something in the tens of billions of $.
Now consider it's a game that came out 11 years ago, in an era with less socials, less consoles available, less active public, more ignorance about the media and with obviously less importance on the trademark "GTA" (even though it was already huge), plus the game then being smaller under every aspect considerable and piracy being even less of a problem today...yeah, probably Rockstar will be economically on par day 2 at max. Not even the time for reviews to come out and word of mouth to spread enough in case it's a total disaster. And it won't be.
GTA 5 grossed 1B in three days back in 2013

Do with that information as you will
I hope a scalper situation doesn’t happen with physical copies when it releases
He’s blocked on my Twitter.
This guy is clearly delusional or regarded. Either is bad.
Hahahahahahahahha. GTA made 11 million in its first 24 hours. 

In 2024 it's calculated it's sold over 200 million copies. 
It's also predicted the game has made over 8.5 billion dollars. 

And this was back when gaming was popular but not as popular as today. Everyone and their God damn mothers will be sitting and playing this game when it launches. You'll see a mass sick leave on the week it releases.
Oh my god, same shit any guy with half brain could say
 Im so glad im not the only one who thought this when I saw that bullshit 😭
They will make that money back in 2 months and it will triple when it comes to pc with the fiveM / sixM support
Didn't gta v make a billion in a few daysv
Twitter guy: “There’s no way this game is going to make its money back.”

R*: *posts a TikTok about the stripper booty physics*

Internet: “SOLD!”
[deleted]
they are so stupid god
twitter users are braindead
This guy doesn’t know gta 5 made roughly 9bln with a smaller budget than what they allocated to gta 6
Preorders alone they will make their money back easy
GTA V is literally the most profitable single piece of media of any form every created in the history of mankind. 

They’ll probably 10x their money.
I would be surprised if it didn’t surpass a billion in the first weekend let alone the first week
Not only will it make its money back, it..yes it’ll make its money back
Broh, they paid for it out of pocket. Gta online has a bigger GDP than a lot of countries now
I will literally buy the console just for this game.
Lol they're gonna make 2 bill in the first day, watch
I don't think people understand how much fucking money this game is gonna make. Its 100% going to be the most bought game of all time and it hasn't even come out yet, we don't even really know what's in it. Its probably gonna make its money back in a few days at the latest.
The economy is going to crash because everyone will be calling out of work for 2 whole months 😂
This guy is obviously delusional. I've literally seen a rapper say that they aren't beefing w/ anyone just so they can make it to play GTA6 lol
Better start saving now, folks. $2B is gonna be a hell of a mortgage...
Rockstar will DEFINITELY make the money back in a very small amount of time. This is their most crucial project!
dudes wrong about 2014, it started dev in 2016 around the time rdr2’s rage was nearing their 60% ready stage, which would explain the early rdr graphics shown in the leaks, and also would explain the later assets that match rdr’s debug/low quality models, not to mention lucias face texture being a flipped more revealed version of leons neice from rdr2’s beta, and also the leftover gta 6 assets in rdr2 and the rockstar source code leaks
It will make twice its budget within a month I’m sure
Give them 3 days.
it will make its money back with preorders
lol, homie has never heard of shark cards
GTA 5 made over 8 billion btw
please make gta6 good…. i cant take anymore disappointment in my life
I think they already made them back with gta online.
They really don’t know do they😂 This game will **literally** make 2-3 billion in the first week. Hell, looking back to GTA V, which GTA 6 is expected to perform much much higher than, they made over 1 billion in the first 5 days.
GTA6 is gonna easily make 2 billion dollars in the first 3 days 😂. This guy should do some research first . This is the most hyped game of all time in Recent memory, everyone's going to be clamoring to play it once it comes out. 
If that second trailer is true then boy am I excited
Assuming the base version is $70 they’d need to sell 28m copies to break even. That will be light work
man im still pissed its not releasing on pc right away
As it is coming to Xbox Series S, I am thinking of pre ordering it. But, I know that I will enjoy it more on PC.
lmao what a guy
As Penguinz0 put it, this will sell more than the Bible
It’s making $2B on launch day. Mark my words
The most anticipated videogame of all time won't make its money back? Fair enough so!
Will literally make its money back with sales and shark cards within 2 months
Lol. Isn’t GTA V literally the most successful entertainment product of all time? I feel like I might have read that somewhere. 6+ BILLION dollars-ish made on it so far. 

Some people are just morons
I honestly hope it doesn't make it money back

Ever since Take-Two(owners of Rockstar) scrap KSP 2 a game in early access they already took pre orders for and fired all the developers earlier this year I been hoping GTA 6 fails
Fuck Twitter 
Nah this Twitter incel Cleary knows more than the company behind the most successful gaming franchise on earth…
There's no way they don't make a profit even if the game is not as good as the previous titles
Some people are a little clueless on how much money is not only made on selling a game, but on how much they make through in game purchases
Is it actually 2 billion? Wasn’t it 1 billion quite a while ago?
Lol what a terrible take. Literally clueless Twitter user
They're making that money back in the first week alone
Coming to pc later... sucks my soul out every time :(
Rockstar such a small company spending SOO much money guys!! >!/s!<
It's Rockstar. They'll make it back by making everything in the online expensive to make a lot of people buy shark cards. Or whatever they'll call them this time.
GTA V made 800 Million on its first day ($8.5B to date), and the anticipation for VI is much higher plus a whole new generation of adults want this game in top of the 30+yo that were in their 20’s when V released. I’ll be shocked if it doesn’t gross over $1B on launch day.
pc at a later date is a massive L. by the time its on pc the peak of the hype will be dead.

Itll be big, but not as big as it could/should be
It is likely to get that money back way before it comes to PC (maybe even at launch), then getting the money back from Pc release (Pc enthusiasms and those who want to use mods). Then there is the sharkcards money wherever they come (the reason why we get that many microtransactions in games is because they amount of money companies get from those is crazy)

  
And maybe Epic will give it away in a few years (and they get money back per download)
Game would be a huge success if it had good driving physics, gta nailed driving. A map that bug HAS to have a good driving system, gotta be enjoyable to drive
Wdym? If they can get 30 million people globally to buy it for $70 equivalent they've made the $2 billion back, that's not including in game purchases, potential subscriptions, expansions, etc..

To put that in perspective, Grand Theft Auto 5 sold 200 million units.
Yeah they possibly going bankrupt after this one, but like I said had they do not bullshitted and wasted their time on Red Dead 2 and cyberpunk then we would have been had this and things would have went smoothly but no let's bring back the worst video game we ever made and then let's try to make a game based off a Blade Runner, I don't mind the Blade Runner base game though
GTA Online basically pre-paid for this game
Back in 2013 gamers were a minority, I remember you could even be bullied for that, and still, GTA sold for more than some films, now gaming is the popular thing, a lot of people are into it, no way THE open world game doesnt break any records.
GTA V had less hype and it made $1.15 billion the first 3 days.
I don't think this gta become a decent game. There is a huge hype behind this game and I don't think it's a good thing.
At most two days, that's how long it'll take for GTA 6 to break even, that's for sure.
It definitely will
State of Leonida will expand over time. I don't understand that. How will that affect single player?
GTA V made a billion in a couple of days; GTA VI is the most anticipated game of the decade. GTA V/Online also makes like $500 million every year due to Shark Cards and the game still sells. GTA VI will probably have Shark Cards and GTA+ from day one.
There are a lot of games coming out lately that don’t make their money back despite selling super well. This is due to the crazy inflating costs of game development.

I don’t think this will apply to GTA 6 - if V is anything to go by, this will make a fortune at launch and continue to do so for years - but I can get why these think this, looking at recent industry trends.
"State of Leonida will expand overtime" Can someone casually explain what it means to my stupid brain?! 



This sounds exciting!!!!!
My prediction on opening weekend:
sale - $2 billion
average user reviews - Oh god this game sucks, GTA IV/V so good
Lol 😂
Just remember GTA online microtransactions made over $750,000,000 last year.
Twitter user has an unbelievably dumb take? What’s new?
I think the reason so many people think it will fail is because of the PC Master Race. Which, while yes, that phrase is a joke. It’s not really a joke anymore… man I just wanna play my Xbox in peace.
It will make a billion before its even released
GTA5 makes a hair under a billion dollars *every single fucking year* due to online. GTA6 is gonna be fine lol
2 billion dollars? How much did GTA5 sell? Yeah... it'll make that back in sales alone. Add in all the microtransactions and it's just gonna make a tonne of cash!
They know what they are doing
You see GTA 6 Countdown and you flush the toilet.
It’ll make its money back in the first week. GTA V did a billion in 3 days. It’ll also be sold at least twice on multiple generations of consoles
I'm still trying to find where this 2 billion dollar budget info came from. As far as I know, it's made up bullshit.
The thing is even worse case scenario if the base game will not meet projections, eventually their online model will make them a shit of ton of money. So, don't see how this project can't fail in any capacity.
Didn't they make a billion dollars per year in just microtransactions a couple of years ago?
GTA 5 makes back it's money every few months, and they game is 11 years old, they're joking that GTA 6 won't be profitable. By the time they make the PC release, it will have already been profitable.
You guys are HIGH on  cope if you think GTA 6 will be a flawless game. Even if it comes from Rockstar.
I'll for sure be doing that GTA+ shit on the new one I bet.. that's their plan all along and I know I'm a sucker for it :/
Omg if it actually comes on PC, my life will be complete.
This shit is NOT EXAGGERATING the most hyped game of possibly all time. With it being literally a meme in the gaming medium. Even if its shit (which i doubt cause its fucking rockstar and they always cook). It will sell far more than GTA V did. And that’s saying alot
So hoping it's only for current gen consoles. It's time to leave PS4 and XBO behind
Nobody tells him how much GTAV and RDR2 made in their first month…..RDR2 their last game made over 700 million in the first 3 days.
Oh it will. They are called shark cards and Rockstar made billions from them.
They will make up that 2 billion within the first couple of days.
It wasn't 2 billion either Jesus
Newsflash everyone - GTAVI didn’t take $2billion yo make. Hope that helps!
I’ll give it 1 weekend
Yeah that's last GTA most of us will witness in our lives

There is no way they will develop another game if they make an online mode
with 2 billion per unit they’ll make their money back in no time, crazy how expensive they made it just because they know we’ll buy it anyways
It crossed 1 billion mark in 3 days
That guys a moron
It’s gonna be the highest selling piece of media ever
Absolutely clueless take. The game will make its money back in the first week.
Considering GTA 5 had made over 8 billion on a by comparison tiny budget says all you need to know.
*Inserts shark cards*
Can we please stop giving these idiots clout? Unverified claims and statements taken as fact by people just astounds me. 

Just ask for a source. If they cannot provide a legitimate one, then it’s made up stats.
I wanna know where people got this "costs $2bn to make" theory from. No game, in history, has come even close to that. Take Two nor Rockstar are just going to have an uncontrolled budget like that. 
It will make its money back within the first month the game releases.
Tell me you’ve never read anything about GTA online without telling me you’ve never read anything about GYA online challenge - easy
It will 100% be the highest earning piece of entertainment within the first day of release. And it really sucks that it isn't immediately releasing on PC because that would basically double the sales. Fucking Rockstar just trying to make people buy the game twice.
2 billion is...a lot, assuming this leak is true. 

I don't think it'll flop, but it's definitely going to be less lucrative than they would hope, and might take awhile to become profitable. 

That's an absolutely brutal cost.
A quick google check says 5 made like 7 billion, so I’m confident that it will recoup the cost
High on what bro ???
Too big to fAAAil
“In developement since 2014” is the best joke ever, no way the game is in full developement for more than 6 years
I fucking hate how people on twitter always act like they know that they’re talking about
Is that $2b real cause rockstar never says anything
Whoa whoa whoa… PC at a later date? What the fuck. It’s 2024.
lol someone didn’t google how much money the last one made.
>Coming to PC at a later date 

🥲
New PS5 bundles are still selling with GTA 5
GTA 6 started after RDR2. RDR2 was all hands on deck. No, GTA 6 most likely cost like $500-600 million.
GTA V made its money back on pre-orders alone and than was 1 billion. lol
They’re adding RP to online. That alone made content creators over a combined millions of dollars, so how will 6 not make 10x more. Ppl just be yapping
His favorite game must be League Of Legends
GtaV make about a billion first week, it might not be instant but this game is going to practically print money
It will make its money back inside a week. Red Dead Redemption 2 made $725m in its first weekend and GTA6 has far broader appeal.
Absolute brainlet
It doesn’t even have to be good to turn a profit. Week 1 sales alone will probably do it
itll be the most bought entertainment product ever
If the biggest movies can gross around 2 billion worldwide and cost a quarter as much as a game, it’ll turn a profit quite easily
Lmao Rockstar will make that whole thing back in a month, guaranteed
and people complain about how much Star Citizen has raised and this game won't even be a fraction of it lol
Gta6 will triple that gtav made well over 2 billion i think it made 500 million in the first 24 hrs
Whatever the price I’m buying it pre-sale….they’re definitely going to make their money back
Expand over time.....bring on the road blocked bridges of nostalgia
If they sell 1 billion copies at 10 quid, they'd have way more profit then cost.
So when it's expected to be 50-100 and over 180 million purchases, they'll make around 18 billion - 2 billion in costs. 16 billion in total. Clearly elons social media is filled with mathematically challenged children.
It won't flop, but it'd be really funny if it did.
It will make that the first week, mark my word
Tell me you don't understand how businesses make money without telling me you don't understand how businesses make money.
As much as GTA V/Online has sold, 2 Billion is not feasible, more than literal nations make for a game??
If it costs 2 bill, no way I'll be able to afford it.
Its gonna make its money if not in pure copies sold then in all the shark cards and online stuff theyll sell till 2035
Any one else frustrated that it's not releasing at a similar time on PC?

I can understand the 2 year gap for GTA V, but the game market is so much more PC dominated today compared to console.
I still don’t know where they got the $2 billion cost from. I don’t think Rockstar has announced anything like that.
it’s gonna break every video game sales record by a country mile, quickly
No way take2 will greenlight a 2 billion budget for a video game
This might be the first game to get close to or cross a billion in pre orders alone.
This game is gonna match that if not exceed that within the first month of preorders.
Not releasing to PC right away is a slap in the face to be honest.  Like an EA level slap in the face.
Weird move to not release on PC on release day.
GTA V made its budget back through pre orders.
Twitter takes have always been goofball shit. The whole this is going to be on PS4/Xbox One thing on
their was funny. GTA is a series that draws as much casuals as it does core gamers, that's why it seems like there are so many clowns in the GTA community who don't know much about gaming. The whole 'PS5  and Xbox won't gave the install base for them to just do PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions" when we didn't even know the release or the first trailer. 

Don't get me started on the Twitter response to the leaks back in 2022, again a bunch of people who don't know jack squat about game development looking a bunch of pre-alpha footage and saying the game looked back, even ones who were dumb enough to look at the untextured NPCs and judge judged it as a finished product or something. Like seriously, there were people who seriously look at that and thought Rockstar would launch a game with unfinished NPCs around. 

I love Twitter because damn it provides plenty crazy stuff to laugh at but damn is that site a beacon of stupidity. How about the time when that dude posted the video of Niko shooting up the hospital and saying he hoped we get interiors like that again in GTA6. And you had people going all Jack Thompson talking about how they shouldn't have stuff like that in the game, and the only reason for the outrage was that he was shooting people in a building… like bro so it's acceptable to go outside and just shoot random NPCs in the game but go into an interior and it's a no-no? People really tried to argue that on there and had no go points about what the difference is. 

Because I guess since a lot of mass shootings happen in buildings that it looks bad, when we had mass shootings before and around the time GTA4 came out. Yeah because no mass shootings ever took place outdoors? Around the same time GTA4 came out is also when researchers, people who were studying if video game violence influenced real life violence came to a definitive conclusion that there was no link. 

I remember that dude GmanLives got dragged for putting his two sense in on that. A YouTuber whose whole channel is based around reviewing shooters and other violent video games. Dude really says he doesn't kill NPCs, he kills cops and the bad guys the game tell you to and people reminded him of the content he makes.

All that but yeah, the idea that GTA6, the most anticipated video game ever and follow up to the single greatest selling and most profitable piece of media over any media ever is not going to make it's money back is a goofy ahh take. The online portion is going to make up for most of that guaranteed. Hate it all you want and I barely about GTAO myself, but it's an inevitable fact. All the pay-to-win mechanics and shark cards galore, you know it's coming back.
Underestimating how stupidly profitable GTA Online has been.
They sold 16 million units in the first 5 days (GTAV). At $60 a pop, that is $960,000,000. In the first 5 days. I personally bought the Special Edition for $150. But we will keep the number rounded down. 

To date they have sold 200 million copies. At the rounded down number of $60, that’s 12 billion. If they spent 2 billion dollars on GTA6, they’re still up 10 billion dollars. This is the simplest of simple maths, that don’t included any expenses. Oh yea, and also not including in game purchases. Personally, I bought Special Edition, I bought the PS4 GTA, the PS5 GTA, a couple of shark cards(which I regret). They’ve got at least $700+ from me alone. And I’m just counting me as $60. 

Rockstar games will be alright.
Gta is a literal money printer
If it released on PC day 1 with console at the same time it would make 2bn in the first week
Is this the most expensive game ever to develop
GTA V made that in the first week 💀
This guy needs to realize that the price for a video game is more than a movie ticket.
Watch this game not even launch in a playable state lol
is this a crazy or weird enough thing for someone to say for you to go out of your way to screenshot it and post it on reddit? weird
Whoever believes the game cost 2 billion to make is insane
Imma need a PS5 soon
Introducing shark cards in GTA 6 online, boom. Billions made.
Crazy to think it's still more than a year from finally releasing. Dropping trailers/reveals when release is more than 6 months out needs to stop already. 
GTA VI is gonna blow up 2b just in pre-orders
If i had a dollar for evertime i heard a GTA map will expand over time
So is the gameplay gonna be the same as GTA V, (Drive to place, shoot guys, drive to other place, listen to conversation, shoot guys) or are they actually going to do something interesting with this series.
The last game was the most profitable media release of all time lol
Didn't GTAV make over a billion dollars in just a few days?
O my reason I Will get a ps5
"Release to PC at a later date"

Welp, there goes all enthusiasm I had for launch day. They keep doing this just so people on console will be tempted to buy the game again on pc! I know why they do it, I know there's literally no way to stop them from doing it, but can I just be a lil upset that PC users have to wait?

They did this with RDR2, they did it with GTAV... it feels like that one spongebob meme where Squidward is looking out the window on Spongebob and Patrick having fun
Nobody is ready for the microtransaction onslaught
Just imagine how messed up the servers will be it’s everyone on them and the presumably 62 player sessions
VI is definitely making 5-7 billion it's first week.

These twitter people don't know anything about GTA.
I will buy it just to cheat and blow up cops for endless hours and i aint the only one
Even if the main story was woke (child friendly) it’s not like the online in gta 5 hasn’t already been censored for years compared to the story. 

Online will still be fun.
Correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t gta 5 make 1 billion in the first 3 days?
Considering GTA V made a fucking billion dollars in 24 hours, and it wasn't nearly as hyped as this game, GTA VI will return its 2 billion dollar cost in under a day.
GTA6 anticipation is the Avatar of video games
Anyone with any decent intelligence would know that GTA 6 is going to be the greatest and best selling entertainment product of all history when it comes out. I bought my shares in Take Two Interactive, y'all should do the same I'm finally.
>State of leonida will expand over time

I doubt it
people are so naïve and also just don’t pay attention to history, Rockstar is known for this exact thing.
I think they can easily move more than 33 million copies of the game (assuming $60)
GTAV has been speculated to take in more than 8.5 billion USD. Even if GTA6 done half of this.... GTA6 may not take as much because of the sweet spot time period GTAV released but im sure it will do almost as well.

Without a shadow of a doubt it will be one of the top 3 fastest selling games ever.
Can’t wait to play this one on my series s at 15 fps
I don't know, I don't think anyone's gonna buy a two billion dollar game. Maybe if it was sixty or something.
it already has
Holy the smooth brains, not a single wrinkle on that thing for sure
It’ll take time, but they are definitely going to make a profit 😅
GTA V made 6 billion largely due to the outstanding success of GTA Online
Shit, if Rock Star makes a great game like V, which has generated 8.5 billion.
Oh of course it will. GTA V made $1 billion within 3 days and has been steadily selling very well ever since. Plus there was the Ps3/Xbox 360 version. Then the PS4/XboxOne version. Then the PC version. And now its the Current gen version. 

All of those sold REALLY well and still sell. Plus the billions they made off GTA Online that they no doubt will do again in GTA VI. 

V game broke so many sales records for every version it had. People have been waiting a literal decade for VI.
GtaV alone paid for it already🤣 and this is one of the most anticipated games ever, like a lot of us were early 20’s or teens when it came out now we have our own money, watch most of us buy the most expensive edition of the game with our adult money!!
People say this about everything, even Apple. They spend $30 billion a year in R&D and recoup all of it in iPhones alone.

People who shriek “unsustainable spending!” Are not business oriented. The cost of doing business is extraordinary. Last large company I worked for spent $100k for a 30 second tiktok by some 24 year old influencer like .02% of the Reddit population would even recognize.
8 quintillion shark cards
I have purchased  V three different times, PS3/4 and PC.  PC players will buy it at least twice, console first due to it being available way before PC...
Probably an ADHD mush brain zoomer born after 2010.
Dude your mad. This game will want them billions in profits, a billion easy in the first week alone!
Trailer later this year? Is this reliable? (Serious question)
Also coming to PS6 and PS7…
They've also spent $2B over the span of several years and if I were a betting man, their online variant for GTA 6 is going to be supported for over a decade. Given the direction the company has taken towards micro-transactions and a subscription plan (GTA+), I can see them at least tripling their investment but it'll probably be more.
Gta5 made about 8 billion tho, so it might have a chance
GTAV has already paid for GTA6
Regardless of what happens, nobody can deny that GTAVI will be the most important video game launch in history so far.

I don't think I've ever seen this much hype for any single product, ever.
Typical salty pc nerd
I don't think this average twitter user understands the wrath that GTA 6 will unleash on its release day.  As someone already said, GTA V had made 1 billion within its first three days. But fuck 3 days. IN 24 HOURS ALONE, it made 800 MILLION US DOLLARS.

And given that the PC version will be released at a later date, and according to statistics PC users are 3x console (not GTA stats, this is overall). GTA VI will surely make the money back. And not to mention the amount of people that will buy numerous shark cards.

GTA VI, won't only earn profit within a year, but change the gaming industry and make a unbeatable record.
And it only costs that much because it's parent company is so bloated on their budgets and taking too damn long. 10 years is far too long for a game. Especially in a franchise. This game started off the previous GTA. So, those assets, tools, etc making starting again much easier.
This game is going to make so much money for soo many years. It’s not just all at the release date. It’s for the next 10 years
You could argue with the amount that they've made on gta V that they already made their money back.
Even if they don’t they’ll get it with online’s micro transactions
All that means is that they are going to double down on the gta online.. to make that money back.. 🤦🏾‍♂️
Would take about 23 millions copies at full price to make its money back.  GTA V sold 185 million copies (lots at a discount I am certain). They will make it back easy.
So many ppl has die waiting on gta6
With inflation plus the he evermore rising amount of people that have played the game plus social media which will surely hype the game even more, they will make billions in a matter of days
Two billion dollars in development costs, that's crazy. Even if it is GTA. This is risky for Rockstar, I think they will make the money back but Take Two are not going to be happy constantly doing this.
I'm pretty sure GTA Online had made GTA 6s money back already
This will be either a $100 game or have a stunning amount of microtransactions. Or it will be both.
I have a feeling their going to if not triple it, but double their profits based off of the sum they have, and are ‘still’ throwing into the game
Yeah GTA V made its entire budget back with pre orders alone
gta 6 is going to break records
They'll make more than 2 billion in the first day.
GTA V has made an obscene amount of money and still does well. 6 will most likely do even better
I'm calling it, GTAIV is literally going to be a glorified GTAV expansion.
That guy definitely logged onto GTAOnline directly after tweeting that.
Every person with a console will buy the next GTA, it will make its money back in the first day.
Yes, they are operating at a lose. I actually donate 50% of my salary to rockstar energy drinks
If there are pre orders it’ll make its money back probably before the game comes out
I know I’ll be there for the midnight release unless every publication warns me that R* releases their worst game ever.
According to a year-old article GTA V had made $7.7 billion. Sales and shark cards really add up.

https://watcher.guru/news/how-much-money-has-gta-5-made-since-its-release-in-2013
I saw this aswell and was lowkey amazed because why would u think THEE Grand Theft Auto VI, the game everyone has been anticipating for more than a decade now, ain't gonna make back that amount of money.
xbox series x AND s. so we kno not to get it for xbox 👍   good looking out. coulda had the game out 3 years ago if it wasnt for xbox
My only hope is the hackers drop $8M on everybody like they did for V
Question for the pc players you guys going to wait for it to come out or get it when it comes out on console and then again on pc?
He is baiting to release pc version same day
Rockstar: **"Hold my Alligator-cards."**
Blud doesn’t know GTA V made 13 *billion* dollars
I don't think I'll play anything else for a while after this game comes out. And I haven't even played GTA 5 in like 5 years. Everyone will play this game dude. The money is not a concern.
So it's not on old gen. I'm on ps5 so I don't mind but some of my friends are on ps4
It’ll make its money back in under a week lmao
ahem

-$69.99 (approx) per copy

estimated 20-25 million copies on day one (based on the 11m copies of 5 day one and the hype surrounding 6)

-1.3 to 1.8 billion usd day one 

problem solved
Not only will it make its money back, it will sell a boat load of consoles for Sony and Microsoft
Gta 6 will make more than 2 billion in first week or so. I guarantee it. Cause the amount of players increased from last time when Gta 5 launched.
Pre-orders will make that 2 billion easy
Later date??? How much fucking longer do PC players have to wait???
It will make ten times that if not a hundred
So it’s gonna be $70 dollars a pop

Assuming everyone who watched the trailer buys one that’s around 70 x 200,000,000 = $14,000,000,000 alone + holiday buys + eventual PC release.

Man they’re gonna be swimming in cash

I’d say it would make at LEAST 10 billion in the first year or so, if PC releases too
I’m ready for summer 2028 to play in pc
Im just upset that ill have to go buy a console to play on launch. Then ill have to buy it again when they release it for pc...
The game is the first wava... lol

Their trump card is those MTX sales. GTA+ and gta 6 shark cards. I call them gator cards.
It'll sell 3b the first week lol
Wow later PC release what a bummer.
I mean R* and T2 made probably 10billion off of GTAO/GTAV in the 11 years it’s been out so I don’t think they’re worried about VIs production cost. 🤷
unrelated, im so happy gta vi countdown blocked me on twitter
Take-Two's most recent earnings call revealed that Grand Theft Auto 5 has sold 200 million copies in its lifetime, with over five million units in 2023's Q4 alone. This means that the game has made estimated over **8.5 billion dollars** to date. It's also the second highest selling video of all time. This guy is deluded.
State expands as time goes on.. So we’re getting an unfinished game?
It’s saying what we already know
They'll definitely make their money back in a week.
I will bet money that rockstar will break even (including advertising)?94 turn a profit with a month of the games launch
They are definitely going to make their money back at least especially with the gta online era that’s been going on for the longest. It’s really going to get milked now
It’s going to be profitable in the first 10 days tops
I don’t think he knows
Some people have the worst takes
It’ll take them a few years but yes they will make it back and then some
I'm buying an Xbox just so I can play it so there's that
cant wait to get it on pc 😩
The customizing and monetizing gonna be so insane they might make that back first year or two. By 5-6 they’ll probably hit 10B
Someone wanna tell him GTA5 made just short of 9 Billion?
It will in a week.
Bruh. Get serious. Make that shit back WITHIN the week of launch.
They are selling it at 120 bucks it’s been confirmed
It’d sell a lot more if they cared about PC people…
Please oh please don't do the subscription thing or battlepass 🙏
It will make back the money within the week. Without a doubt.
This is the *Take* culture we are in. Surface level insight followed by proclaiming something, stupidly. 

If he knew anything then he would know GTA doesn’t miss. GTA5 made $815M in the first 24 hours it was released, over 4 times its budget. And now it’s at $8.5B after 12 years, and I don’t even think that’s counting the online transactions for GTO.
Doesn't GTA V make about 500M a year just from Shark Cards?
with over 60$ price and shark cards? yeah its good lol
gta made 1 billion in like a week, i think gta6 can more than double that
Bro I’m quite literally getting a after school job just to buy a ps5 so I can play this when it releases, it’s gonna make it’s money back
Coming to pc at a later date :(
GTA 6 won’t make its money back, GTA 6 Online will makes its money back several times over
God I hate twitter/X and its degenerate community
2 billion is something they will likely SMASH in 2 weeks. With GTA V making a billion in 3 days in 2013, I can only see gta6 matching that at the very least, especially as it’s the most viewed YT video ever in 24 hours even after it got leaked on twitter
Is it really true that its in development since 2014???
They really don't understand just how many people are anticipating this game.
it got cut off, it actually says no way it makes its money back in the first day
The game made like 500 million in one year JUST from online microtransactions. 

This dude doesnt know how much money GTA prints
Who's willing to bet the online will still use peer to peer technology causing online on pc to be infested with another decade of cheaters
lol I’ve seen a lot of stupid theories and predictions on gta6 but this one is the dumbest one.

One thing we can safely assume is GTA6 will make its money back within a week after release, then go on to make more money than any game in history.
Is this a joke? They’ll make that back in less than a week. 😂
I don't think it'll make its money back within the first month. I think if it does (which lets be real it probably will.) it will be through the over monetization that will be GTA online 2.

2 billion is A LOT and yes while others have mentioned how/why GTA 5 made the money it did... It also did so during an arguably much better economic climate. Today's economy is nowhere near the same as when GTA 5 came out. I don't see it making another billion off launch sales alone. Maybe 1.5 but not 2 bill right off the bat.
its obvious bait u big fish
Considering how much money gta v made in one day plus how awaited gta 6 is, they’re making they’re money back in under a week
History has shown that a game becomes a flop after everyone has bought it.
2 billion is genuinely excessive for development 
Will it generate this much in revenue? Yes most definitely
The development of RDR2 was 540 million 
There's no way there'll be a 400% increase in development cost
The world economic will feel the effects when this game releases
Theres no way that they dont make there money back even if its the worst game ever(which it obviously wont be cause its gonna be the best)! people would still buy for the first week and thereby they make a profit
![gif](giphy|2w6I6nCyf5rmy5SHBy|downsized)
I would love if they skip out on online a little bit long for gta 6 in replacement for gta 5 so that we get a map expansion , I would love to leave the Main island regularly like a 5M Sever but official.
Easley make it back an more
I'm not sure of what I'm going to say, but I think GTA VI gets money back before day one because of pre-order. Like, almost everyone will pre-order the game and when you pre-order, you actually buy it.
Some purist will wait the physic game and the maddests of us (like me) will pre-order the game and during the download, will go get the physic maxi ultra limited pigeon edition lmao
There's more green money than green trees now these days.
Each GTA has historically been the biggest singular entertainment release (of any type) since San Andreas.

This will make its money back within the first 24-48hrs of GTA V was anything to go by lmao.
I extremely doubt its been in development since 2014, someones clearly made that up but something that i do know is that gta 6 is the most anticipated game and the devs know it. They'll 100% make record profits off of it and i hope the people at the top dont exploit that by making them rush the game and cut corners for even more extreme profits (extreme greed). Ill be shocked if they dont have to release a load of post launch patches to fix shit. For greed purposes they did however buy fivem after fighting it for years untill they realised they could profit from that too. I worry about the game
It will make its money back with shark cards alone.
Easily will make it back!!
Budget will probably be like 1.3 billion. 800m-1b for production and the rest for marketing and license issues
I get how anticipated this is, I feel like it'll definitely make its money back asap even if not everyone is on the current gen yet.

GTA 5 released with no shark cards or anything. GTA 6 will, and it'll do exactly what GTA 5 did and remaster it for the gen after to try double its sales.
I am not sure whether it will run well on Xbox Series S, cause that console only have 10gb
Not sure if it’s just me, but a lot of the main stream games have lost their appeal. Battlefield has tanked, cod is just cod, apex is full of hackers, etc. Back when GTA5 was released, there was a lot of popular games competing, but now I feel like GTA6 is going to be in a league of its own, if it lives up to the hype, and they having minimal issues upon release, this game will be the new Fortnite once it’s released. I don’t see this game having paywalls like the rest, but of course there will be micro transactions. Fingers crossed, waiting for release on PC.
Oh it will, I bet in a week, or even 24hrs
GTA V made a billion in the first three days. That was back in 2013. When social media was still taking its’ form, video games were not nearly as popular as today (the last decade has seen an explosive increase) and GTA was still being viewed by the general public as ”that game where you kill prostitutes and steal cars”. Not to mention the extreme success GTA Online has brought.

I would be widely surprised if they didn’t make back their money in the first 24 hours.
They will make 2b in pre orders alone
>First weekend

This one will shatter all the records
[deleted]
Yep, this will break all records in entertainment history by a landslide lol
This game going to span two console generations. Some people might buy it for the PS6 like some bought GTA V for the PS4 & 5.
Gta5 has made 8.5 billion in total according to Google. So..
Honestly they will probably break $2 billion on the first day.
You think it will make 2billion in one week?
If they had a pc port they will, I ain’t buyin a whole ass console just to play this game
Then some too 😂
first day
It'll make profit on its pre-orders
I’m not even a huge fan of the franchise and I’ll be getting it.
They plan on this being the last one. They’ll update this game until the end of time like Fortnite and WoW.
This will be *the* biggest video game of all time. I'm very surprised it cost 2b (is that true?? Like is that confirmed? lol) but if any game could make that back, it's GTA6. If it's anything like movies though, it might need to make 2.5x its budget back which would be like 5b - but to date, gtav has made 8.5b 🤷‍♂️
i think we can consider GTA 6 AAAA
GTA print money. Rockstar like Money.
Ya, after the success of the one they seem to have really taken this seriously. They have taken their time, as they have watched a lot of these open world games succeed and fail. They probably have their shit together on this, especially after watching GTA5 and RDR2.
Through the years, upgrading consoles and getting a PC, I've probably bought GTA 5 at least 4 times.
Same, I remember hearing about this years ago about how it will have a changing map
Don't take that as a fact. That account is one of the more notorious GTA VI misinformation accounts on Twitter. Everything he states as a fact is completely based on unverified rumors.
GTA VI will not only sell 20 million units on the first day. It will - by far - exceed those numbers. The video game industry (and also the internet) has grown so much since the release of  GTA V (trailer numbers and hype speak for itself).
i’m one of those 20 million that’s for sure
It depends how many people have bought a system by Fall 2025.

RN, about 60 Million people have bought a PS5 and 28 Million have bought a Series X/S.

Put in perspective, when GTA 5 came out, the PS3 and 360 each sold 80 Million.

So idk if it'll break GTA 5's record.
As of March 2024 they've sold 200,000,000 copies of GTA V. With approx 5M sold each quarter 

Bare in mind though that there have been card bundles and re-releases included in that number
It's a rumor someone made up long ago and people for some reason loved running with it
GTA V cost $250 million to make and it was considered the most expensive game ever made in 2013

RDR2 costs $500+ million to make and it is still considered the most expensive game ever made

I wouldn’t be surprised if Rockstar broke that record again with GTA VI
A lot of times people are just pulling budgets from their asses. Game industry tends to secretism, and while sometimes reputable insiders and analysts can give budgets a lot of times is just twitter warriors making it up to critize or glorify a game. Until somebody with reputation says it i would call it bullshit
I think it is the budget allocated overall not the cost, people on Twitter are stupid
The gta 6 hacker gave that number
If Rockstar opened pre-orders right after the 2022 leaks. I would've pre-ordered it then.
its bait
Same 😂 and I’ll actually probably buy GTA V to warm up for 6!!!
Development includes conceptual phase, demo, script, asset creation then coding, engine was also being prepared for gta 6 during rdr2 development, there are modern weapons in rdr2 hidden deep, leftovers after gta 6 demo. So yeah dev starting right after gta 5 sounds real.
It was in the 2022 Bloomberg piece by Jason Schreier and that's more than likely the pre-development/conception stage. It's like RDR2 being often touted to have been "eight years in the making"  by people because the preliminary work started in 2011 is factored, but it didn't go into full production until around GTA V's completion; making it closer to five.
Pre-development most likely started around then but yeah, active development couldn't have been possible until after RDR2.
they started dev around the time of rdr2’s first trailer in 2016, the exact date not known but around that time
A billion in 3 days.
I think that's a loss less likely now that there are soft copy mechanisms.

When physical production was a limiting factor, economics takes over and scalpers can exploit it.

But the limiting factor for downloads is the R☆ server...which admittedly could fail under the strain, but there's no way for scalpers to act as an alternative source.
Both at this point.
3 days.
No one knows for sure, but definitely not 2 billion dollars, that's just a rumour that popped up that people for some reason started to believe.
It is already confirmed to be.
possibly within two to three days lol
24 hours is a stretch but I actually won't be surprised if they made the 2 billion back in 24 hours. A billion in 24 hours is a safe bet
Also there wasn't a decade long hype surrounding GTA V.
1 billion is insane, I saw the post and thought: 2 billion? They are not making their money back..

But if V made that in one day…  VI is going to make it faster, even if the story is shit just having  V mechanics with better graphics is going to make people wanna buy the game.
especially since you can buy the games digitally now, no waiting at your local gamestop anymore lol
video games were def already deep into the main stream in 2013 lol
_"When social media was still taking its’ form"_

This time, social media can either be a blessing or a curse. If the game's good, it will be all over the social media and sales will boom but if the game's bad, it will be all over the social media for all the wrong reasons like cyberpunk and then the game might tank
What? Dude, gaming was ***HUGE!*** Were you around when Halo Reach came around?

Social media… *it was taking shape decently well.*
With the ease of preorders and digital copies this generation, it would not surprise me if they make their money back before it even comes out
>video games were not nearly as popular as today (

Agree with the rest, this part is pure nonsense though. The home console market now is half of what it was in the mid 2000s, let alone 2013. And I'm not talking market *valuation*, I'm talking pure console/game sales. The best selling consoles of all time were all released in this period, it was a wild decade for gaming.
Mate social media has been around since 2000s lol it wasn't forming in the 2010s my space and bebo life 😭

I am curious are you 20 or under? (I'm not dr disrespecting) lol
I will agree with everything but the social media portion. This was when YT was extremely popular for content creation , Facebook had spiked already, Instagram still had majority real users. (Idk about Reddit I wasn’t on it at that time.) and like right before twitch really started to pop off.

If anything, this was when social media was really taking off. And GTA basically grew up with it.
I wouldn't call 2013 a year when social media was still ”taking its form”. Twitter alone has 200 million plus users in 2013.
Social media has been an established thing since like 2008 bro
Don't doubt that. Either 2B or very close that week it is up for pre order.
Especially with all the new players, how big social media has become (2011-2013 it wasn't as prevalent)
It is kind of a more casual gaming experience, I wish you the best with it 😀
Second AAAA game ever /s
Yrah cuz thats what i fucking said the second the trailer got to my eyes
With that kind of budget, yeah, probably.

Quality will likely be on par too.
Just like GTA V and RDR2, I imagine any kind of expansion will be online only
[deleted]
While it definitely will end up getting it's money back, i don't believe it will "by far exceed those numbers" in one day, 20 mil sounds about fair assesment in my opinion, If we look at some of the bigger releases in recent years.

Elden ring took almost a year to reach 20 mil and it made a huge splash online with many people promoting it. it is less "for the normal gamer" but it is still one of the biggest releases of recent years.

Hogwarts Legacy - 12 million in 2 weeks.

Call of duty - While they don't say specific numbers i found a list saying that the best selling game "only" sold over 31 million in it's life time.

So yes gaming is bigger than ever and GTA 5 is in a ballpark all of it's own with over 200 mil sold in it's life, it still is a life of 10 years with first console release, then pc release, then next gen release. I still think 20 mil in a day is reasonable and maybe far exceeds it in first week if game is good
Over a year to go until launch, we'll likely start seeing a big uptick in console sales starting from this Christmas.
I think it will, ps3 and 360 sales increased a lot when gtav came out even tho it was very late in their lifecycle, same for the ps4/xbone in their infancy. There are people out there that’s just waiting for it to come out so they can snap up their long awaited ps5/xboxes just for the game. I’m fairly sure that Sony and Microsoft will be making even more consoles for the release window/months to come after the game comes out.
But PS5 will be nearing or past 100 million by late 2025
I personally know 4 different people still on last gen consoles and are waiting for GTA 6 to buy a ps5.
A jump from 500 million to 2 billion is huge. I believe it will be a billion at most.
A whole $1.5 billion dollar increase from RDR2  for GTA 6 is insane. 

If that’s the case then that game cannot lack in ANY department 😭. It’s got to set the game up for consistent expansions for the next coming 10 years.

A billion dollars is crazy in itself and that’s just an extra $500 million from RDR2.
And later admitted to having made it up.
GTA 5 was $800 MILLION in 24 hours, $1 BILLION in 3 days so it will be interesting to see what 6 will do with its insane hype.
Of course it will. GTA 5 made $1B in 3 days when almost everyone had to go out of their way to a GameStop to buy it. Now everyone’s gonna buy GTA 6 from their home
I think they’re gonna charge more than the average price for their game if development cost $2B, like the average game where I live is $89.99 CAD for a PS5 title so I imagine it’d be closer to $109.99 CAD which would for sure get them close if they did that.
yeah it was only 5 years so it’s crazy to think about how huge GTA 6’s launch will be
GTAV is the single most profitable piece of media ever created.

Over it’s lifetime it has made $8bn
You got to admit though lining up at midnight to get a new game was absolute vibes
Sure, it was mainstream. But it wasn’t ”Ariana Grande having an in-game concert in Fortnite” mainstream, or ”a League of Legends animated series is Netflix’s best rated original series ever” mainstream. And these things were three years ago, now it’s even bigger.
Seriously. This comment was added by a 16 year old.
'social media just taking it's form' ' as if it weren't already dominating daily life
Dawg sure it was big but gaming has become way bigger since then. There is more generations that will play. It was also before the pandemic, which caused a lot more people to explore gaming
What's the first?
I know loyalty doesn't equal profitability, but R*' ignoring single player content for fans like myself who have played since GTA1 sucks massively. Gotta appease the multiplayer-obsessed 12 year olds on their flying motorbikes I guess.
I don't preorder or buy games day 1. Ever.

I will buy GTAVI day 1.
Fromsoftware games are not comparable to GTA in terms of popularity
>Elden ring took almost a year to reach 20 mil and it made a huge splash online with many people promoting it. it is less "for the normal gamer" but it is still one of the biggest releases of recent years.

>Hogwarts Legacy - 12 million in 2 weeks.

>Call of duty - While they don't say specific numbers i found a list saying that the best selling game "only" sold over 31 million in it's life time.

These three games you mentioned, put together, make 1/5 of the hype surrounding GTA VI
One of the reasons I got an xbox, but gaming is still pretty strong except it has shifted to PC. It’s still completely possible that it’ll sell less than gta5 but there’s no way it doesn’t make the money back within a few weeks. Honestly if i could go back in time I would’ve built a PC rather than buy an xbox but in 2020 you couldn’t even build a comparable PC for twice the cost of an Xbox.
I am one of them. I’ll wait for the PS5 Pro to be released, GTAVI will be the first game I play. 

I did read a bit ago that Sony will be releasing the Pro at a similar time to GTAVI, may be old news tho
I'm curious, aside from games taking longer to develop now, what even is the thing that is costing this much more as years go on? 

Pushing new technologies? Isn't that basically just time as well? A bigger studio or more studios together maybe, but can they really just double their developers and keep the development under control?
Yeah I’m just letting him know where it came from
GTA will easily make $800m in pre-sales
It did also take another year to make its second billion though.
They already missed the boat on the generational price increase. It'll be a hard sell to do it again.
yeah it was lol, i hope people still do it just for the nostalgia and tradition purposes
I did this exactly one time. For the original modern warfare 3. I had a great time. I wish I’d liked the game better lol
Video games have been huge in the US and Japan way before anywhere else bc of xbox, playstation, and nintendo. Id say it hit mainstream around the time the 360 and ps3 came out.
Yes, it was. I would say cod mw original was the point in which gaming went fully mainstream
Also its been 10 years since gtav and 24 since gta 3.

With that in mind, now that you mention generations, there will be way more households where father and son play gta together. Maybe some grandpas too
Skull and Bones was apparently a AAAA game, according to Ubisoft. It flopped massively.
That Gollum game
skull and bones apparently, but i always saw RDR2 as rhe first truly AAAA game
honestly, current state of cyberpunk
At first multiplayer content was available for single player. I remembered testing cars first in single player before buying them in MP. The moment they took that from me I lost interest. 

Through SP heists I was already a billionaire. So it was a perfect testing environment before grinding towards something in MP and not get disappointed.
My first intro into GTA was installing the demo of GTA1 onto my dad’s brand new Pentium 2, so I’m 100% in the same boat. I have no interest in the direction Rockstar take their games after the launch of their single player campaign unless it’s more single player content
All the technical stuff probably. Mainly into upgrading their engine to handle more stuff.
Almost half of that cost is the marketing budged.
A Company filled with 1000+ employees, all from each individual Rockstar Studio.

I remember how a big fraction of SpiderMan 2's budget went to employee pay (based on details from the Insomniac Leak).  

I'd say most of the budget goes to shareholders, marketing and paying studio staff.
I could see it well above $1bn on day one if they launch with online + micro transactions.

I liked the way that they did V though. It gave everyone a chance to play the story and learn the new mechanics instead of jumping straight into a lobby of griefers.
And at least half of that should go directly in my account tbh
And has a total revenue exceeding $8.5 billion. They would need to fuck it up spectacularly to not get their money back.
Well, with an extra billion people on the planetz it probably won't take as long
Sit outside for a physical copy, take it home, download a patch before you can play. Modern gaming.
And mothers and daughters. Along with husbands right alongside their wife. 🙄
My ol pep pep loves himself a session of gtao
Played it, felt only AA lol
Skull and Bones got delayed and retooled so many times it's a wonder they didn't just cut bait. They were in too deep, probably. Most games don't get better after that long, that's for sure. Sleeping Dogs is probably the only one off the top of my head. Maybe LA Noire and the original Red Dead Redemption, too.
I still think there's a ton of us out there, we're slightly older but far from being actually old, so it's not like we're dying off. But I guess every year there are more people joining the fandom who have never seen the early games, and come from other online games so that's their focus.
I replied to someone else with this but the majority of costs is pure salaries. 2,000 people made RDR2 - even if they make $60,000 per year, that equals out to $120 million PER YEAR.

If the game takes 7-8 years to develop then that easily hits $1 billlion, idk where the $2 billion figure comes from - pure speculation
Nah actually I doubt it. GTA is super popular and Rockstar doesn’t need to spend a lot of money marketing it. They just need to put up a few trailers and hype is maximised.
Yeah, that was a great strategy, but I’d be willing to be the majority of V players got it for the SP story, so they were fine with running around LS without the online component.

But I’m sure that is going to flip for VI
Nah, they're probably gonna wait so it's not gta c online at launch lol 

Still remember the 3 characters that I lost 😔
Agreed.
More like zz
Triple eh
It was more DD
IIRC Ubisoft received funding from a government (don’t remember which) to assist in developing the game (Ubi thought it would be that big of a deal) so they were basically obligated to release something
Yeah I gotta say I played RDR when it came out, but replaying it after RDR2 was awesome. Some obvious clunky-ness but a great experience
Little sad honestly. I couldn’t believe they put coop in San Andreas 🤣
My first GTA game was GTA IV, but I'm fully with you.
Yes i actually forgot that. Rockstar pays at least half a billion in salaries.
Coca-Cola is the most popular brand of soda, known all around the world and they spent $5 billion in advertising last year.
OP you’re a typical redditor speaking out of your ass about topics you don’t know about haha
And that piece of shit was in development for over a decade too lol
Singapore
Absolutely incredible addition. And I found a glitch through co-op which made CJ permanently headless, and gushing blood.
Give me their budget, 200 million, and a decade and I could make something better with YouTube tutorials and Unity lol
If only gamers realised AAA only means budget anyway, so yeah S&B and GTA6 will be AAAA.
As long as Rockstar releases something that’s not as broken as Cyberpunk 77 on arrival, it’ll make bank.
Still cringing over this one...
How does she still have a career...
[deleted]
This is so damn hard to watch every time I see it..
Anyone have an update on how this ultimately played out for her?

Surely this tanked her, right? Right???
what a fucking villian story
Need context. (Obviously this is shitty)
Why did she post the full thing?
holy shit
[deleted]
Here's her apology - 

https://www.reddit.com/r/iamatotalpieceofshit/comments/plpojz/influencer_who_was_exposed_for_abusing_her_son/
I have several questions. If this were a recorded video, why would she not cut this part out? And if it were streamed why would she give the kid instructions on what to do for the video?
Well there's a person who could die and the world wouldn't care.

Kid would probably be better off.
Sociopath.
This is worse than Alex Botez recording her thumbnails. I'm sorry, I see the terrible tragedy of this but cannot help but laugh. Poor kid man, this seems like an over the top animated sketch.
Fuck, I remember this video. This sums up the narcissism of vlogging. Nothing is genuine anymore when you are a slave to getting views.
We created this reality. Only can we can fix this reality. Or we can be complacent, because we want our youtube sugar rush. The point I'm making is that most people don't have strong morals & ethics and when you hand them a tool that allows them to make money by adhering to an algorithm and the worst aspects of social media, some people are going to exploit it. We are as much to blame as they are. We created this reality.
I'm usually a sucker for cringe videos but I couldn't make it till the end, that was brutal
It is sooo fucked up. This is a different breed of cringe. I forgot this video existed - so watched all the way through again, but damn, what a terrible mother. That kid is going to need serious therapy when they are old enough to understand how fucked up their mom is.
Here's her apology -

https://www.reddit.com/r/iamatotalpieceofshit/comments/plpojz/influencer_who_was_exposed_for_abusing_her_son/
Probably apology video and then shift to Jesus talk. Or tradwife bullshit.
I think she was some "momfluencer", a grifter using her family as props to get internet fame. Here she is making a video about their dog being seriously ill. However, being a dumbass, she forgot to edit the end when she was bullying her distraught kid into taking a proper sad pause for the thumbnail. 

A truly awful person.
Accidentally. 

And once it's online.. It ain't goin' away.
I think she was streaming and thought she'd turned it off. Went to take a pic for the cover photo and viola! Published the reality of this kid's awful life to the world.
I went through a rabbit hole of people reacting to this video on YouTube and not one single video has the original users name. Lol. Anybody know it?

Edit: Her name is Jordan Cheyenne

Ha ha, I was reading the link and I thought it said “influencer who was exposed for a bussing her son“ and I was thinking what the hell is “a bussing”?
>Only can we can fix this reality.

No we can't. It's like saying only we can fix grifting televangelists. These people are parasitic scum that prey on the uneducated and the gullible, and they will be everywhere. They can fix themselves if they want to. Grifters are not exclusive to YouTube.
Wow, thanks. That's pretty cringe too. She somehow promotes her podcast in the apology lol
Oopsie
Oops

Like flys swarming around a carcass
Thank you for your feedback. I only ask that you try to read my comment again without distractions. If you still feel the same way, cool. Take care.
Indeed.
Ha! You know what's awesome, I just the other day joked about someone misspelling this same word! 

Their's was radically different tho - like "Vwuhh lah." Lol
Tbh I didn’t watch much of the content I was just trying to find her name. Seems like she was just an influencer who accidentally left this clip in a video. Looks like she was still making videos up to 7 months ago but has since called it quits.
bro cant comprehend that he might be wrong
MAGA podcaster forgets to log into his black female 💪🏾👩🏾 alt before false-flag attack against Kamala🤦‍♂️
And the fake bad grammar as the cherry on top🤦‍♂️
His explanation is even more ridiculous.
"I've been Black all my life"

  
lol, if it was satire it would have nailed the dumb repubs.. sadly its reality
How frequently this happens would not surprise me in the least I’m sure.
"Mommy" lol great fake blaccent buddy lol.
That’s the problem with lying all the time, it’s hard to keep track of
Writing the tweet in AAV is   * *chefs kiss* * cringe.
I’ve been black my whole life is going to be my Xbox bio lol 😂
I would love to know what the woman whose picture was used thinks about all this.
Low effort psyops
I literally don't know who this is, but I hope people don't let him forget this
Been seeing a lot of these lately. You can feel the desperation
I love that he went with the "Clara!!" excuse
This fuckin' bacciagalupe.
Sounds like fraud to me
Oof
"I've been black all my life."  You don't say.  

Unless your last name is Jackson color me unsurprised.
are we just not going to acknowledge that op is a propaganda account
Lavern Spicer, the women pictured, has addressed this multiple times. Yall making something out of nothing promoting fake news.
What if he just identifies as a black female?
It's not bad grammar. Its a dialect African American vernacular English
Who hasn't logged into their social media on their friend's phone? I mean, amirite?
lol what was his excuse?

What is AAV?
how is this so obviously aav? It just sounds like any normal english to me
That's his good friend, she let him log in on her device, theyre close. So she's fine with it, they love each other actually. And she's a communist (which is not an issue).
She was down with it. He tries to explain it on his twitter.
And why wouldn’t his ‘friend’ come out and say anything? Do they not exist?
Exactly! Also, who hasn't pretended to be black online before, that's my normal kind of Tuesday my brotha!
He said he forgot to log out on his "friends" device.
You might try reading the article to find out
Holy shit you people are gullible

I mean, he’s a proven liar now. Not going to take his word for *anything*.
It’s funny because the “woman” who posted would be the friend that made the post. Unless someone else checked their social media on his friend’s phone and made the post, which looked like his friend posted it, from his account. Damn I’m getting lost in all this.
downvoted for telling someone to read the article instead of just the headline is peak Reddit lol
And downvoted for reassuring the truth is peek reddit trying to peak harder
This site has been devolving into being filled with lowest common denominator morons for years, and seems to be accelerating since the company went public. The level of discourse is getting worse and worse every day.
After over 400 hours of exploring I finally found a river!
People told me they were out there, I didn’t believe them but then I stumbled across I this beauty on Leviathan 4.
That’s a creek, you could hop over it without a pack
Still never found one. They really need to add more of them.
That is dope. I've never seen one. Where did you find it?
Now all you need is a van.
Land in a swamp biome. With the modern map it's very obvious if there are any local map tiles that consist of lakes, swamp ponds or "rivers".

Starfields "rivers" are really a collection of interconnected swamp canals, that exists on a single map tile, so there are sadly no rivers that snake their way across multiple map tiles on the local map.
For those unable to find rivers... Go to planets with a lot of flora and use your surface maps. They are out there.
I found one behind the sulfur mine Barret and Lin mentions. should probably go back and open the new map he got
Skyrim!?
More rivers are needed more forests more life.
I have played for 12 days befor finding the oil rig :P It happens
Pretty much all wetlands regions have rivers, and swamps, you can find them a lot easier now with the surface maps. Katyid I-a has some, Ka’zaal has some, there are even frozen lakes on Ixyll where the Elios retreat in the northern region that are partially frozen that you can swim in, Codos has lakes with actual fauna in them.
[deleted]
There's a river in New Atlantis right?
This seems like a major blind spot in procedural terrain generation. Starfield, NMS, Valhiem, all have the same problem. Water all exists at only one "sea level" elevation, and while some simulate some liquid turbulence, it never truly flows from one place to another. Seems like if you want a real river or a mountain lake, you need a crafted environment.
Job well done explorer
Now park your van right over there. You know what to do, Cowpoke.
Never thought of this I've never found any lakes or rivers
This appears to be outside Riverwood.
Noice
I'm unbelievably jealous 😂
Once I found my mom living on a planet
Now all you need is a van
Need a boat and fishing mod now.
have you not played since before the local map update?
If I'm not mistaken they are common in jungle biomes.
There are a fair number of them in Swamp biomes (particularly in Newton)
Pathetic
Isn't there a river in New Atlantis? The water fall that pours down by the bridge?
Thats not a river thats a creek :)
easier way to find them is to land on earth like planets, and open local map. if it will have river like water at map`s corners, then it will be "common" through out the planet.

problem is that most of those planets are toxic in one way or another, and non toxic ones are not colorful.
This is, sadly, one of the disappointments I have with both Starfield and No Man's Sky. No running water. Only ponds, lakes, and oceans. Mainly oceans.
Sweet jebus, I never thought about it.
There are rivers?
Need rovers so you can park your van down by there
Hyla II has some beautiful ponds and some are winding and go on for quite a while. Swamp biome.
Stupid
Uh oh! You are unable to fast travel with enemies nearby
What is the outfit you’re wearing.
Shit this is a good point and embarrassing for them
I've found lakes. Never a creek or river though.
they didn't want you to see the water physics
Wow that’s really different from the desert or rocky type of environments
Is this in the Bob Ross Sector?
That's the one thing I hate so much, they weren't able to give us waterfalls and water coming down from the mountains etc.
I didn't even know bodies of water existed in this game.
Starfield has plenty of lakes but I have yet to find a river. Honestly I'd like there to be plenty on the right kinds of planet.
there are no real swamps either
To be fair I think procgen has a hell of a time assembling rivers
Weeeeell.....let's just say I hope modders will add procedural generations with (real) rivers, way more frequent lakes and maybe some underwater features...I don't ask for a subnautica conversion...just being able to poke our head underwater and see that there is some algae and such...
All of the rivers died in the war
RNJesus blesses you this day
I usually see them at the top of planets near the frozen north tbh. I did run for like 20 minutes one time and found some mountain lakes, and small streams, but no rivers.
This reddit is a great reminder of how underwhelming this game is. 400 hours of walking through generated landscapes to find a plain old river. I get everyone has their own brand of fun but brother, just go outside.
Thats cool, I found some in mainly wetland locations too  in level 50+ systems. Pity there arent any going to sea or near a random base etc. Edit: Found mine at Lxyll VI-e moon of Lxyll VI
Isn’t there a river on Jemison?  Yeah, Sarah took me there as part of her missions.
I’m still the early levels of Starfield. I haven’t even touched the powers yet. I just been having fun running bounty hunting missions and doing the Vanguard storyline I’m heading to the heading to the freestar collective
r/helldivers2
Man found shit creek
It took me a long time to find a mini volcano also
And its good shitty water graphics even on ultra 😴
hahahaha 
I've only seen random water once, and that was on Cassiopea 1. I landed at random spot to make a camp after in memoriam and boom was next to a lake. Oh, and there's the planet for Andreja's quest to, but I'm pretty sure that's designed to be on an island.
Is the earth restored mod.
I'm on NG 30+ and I've never seen a waterway. Congrats on the find.
Cooooool. We need more terrain features like this.
Wow I totally didn't realize there's no rivers, this is an eye opener, I wo Der what else should be there but isnt
Sorry bro one of my starborn gifts makes me piss waterways....... wash your hands son...
There's rivers!?!?!
Sudden thought: What if Bethesda have been working on more assets for the game's procedural generation and we're just now starting to see these new map features appear in-game?  Fits with some of the other posts I've been seeing pop up of people seeing things for the first time since the game's release, after investing hundreds of hours in playing.

Another post I just saw along with this one that got me thinking this is "My prisoner is praying I have never seen such a thing before."
So assuming the modding community can create more detailed environments, what’s the engine limitation?

I just want to see what happens if someone creates a big city with lots of AI & lots of detail. I’m curious to see if the engine can even handle it, or if it’s truly just the devs running out of time to add more.
I thought all the planet's were basically the same, with just slightly different flora and fauna!
It would be cool if this game (but realistically a future game) would make accurate river systems. I say it wouldn't work in this game because the as the in-game map seems to show, the land is generated in roughly square chunks, and in the map you can see a 3 by 3 area. Point being that realistic river systems would require more in depth land generation where all the small tributaries combine into stream, into rivers, into rivers that combine and flow into the ocean. It may sound crazy but I don't think we're far off from that being something games can do.
900 hrs, no river. Now I'll be obsessed to find one.
Unless it's flowing it's just a long, narrow lake
I wish they added giant monsters and almost godlike beasts on some of the planets to add a monster/alien hunter aspect to it
There are plenty of rivers with all the crying about this subject
The bar sinks ever lower
The fact this is so upvoted just proved to me how much of a joke this game is.
I thought this was the helldiver sub at first
after 11 years, skyrim player locates river
Mf goes to a “swamp” biome and calls it a river
Real question, as the only one who's played 400 hours - does it ever get fun?
I'm more amazed that this game has 400 hours worth of playtime for anyone.
How do you have more than 18 hours in this dumpster fire

20 hours in: Oh look, rocks!

400 hours in: Oh look, rocks!
Damn… You got a point, now I’m thinking do rivers even exist in this game again!
It ain't exactly the Mississippi.
That’s bigger than some rivers here
We have rivers in Australia that are dry 9/10ths of the year/decade/century
Let’s see Paul Allen’s river.
That counts as a river in the south west
It's a California River.   I have stepped over at least two of them.
Aren’t rivers based on length and depth?
They need to add a lot
Aren’t rivers realistically rare?
There's plenty, you just have to find them B)
More river's = players want to build boats. Then yachts.   If it's not a boat, it's a yacht.
Took this guy 400 hours!
I think the generator for them is broken because they have several biome presets that *SHOULD* make rivers but often dont.
If you head to Leviathan system > leviathan 4 (I think) and it was one of the regions
And I  live in some crash debris, down by.....
People just post these because they’re popular and get lots of upvotes, there are tons of lakes and rivers in the game.
I feel like they're more common if you land by a coast aswell, especially if it's in the wetlands or a swamp.
I always forget about using the surface maps! 

BGS gotta change it to where we open the map = surface map > planet map > solar map > Starmap 

The darn thing is hidden within the survey HUD
You know what's wrong with Skyrim these days? Everyone's obsessed with death.
Totally agree… and bigger everything! bigger tree’s, bigger mountains, bigger fauna, flora, you name it… make it bigger!

Have you tried the GrindTERRA mods? Theres a couple available to increase fauna and flora density’s
Kao?
Thank you kind Sir, it took a while but got there in the end!
Yep! Just behind the blacksmith :)
Huh? thats the second time someone has mentioned a van lol
As you travel between star systems, look for planets within the Goldilocks zone that offer both “deciduous and coniferous forests” – these biomes offer awesome natural environments
You can't go inside the volcano unfortunately. Just lava on top.
Yeah I agree..

Could the engines handle interactive environments? Such as volcanoes erupting or rapidly spreading wildfires, earthquakes, avalanches etc
It got fun for me as soon as I got to New Atlantis!
Lack of rivers bothers me, and the fact that any water at all is just called OCEAN when it's clearly a small sea or large lake at best.
😂
They do.  I've seen several pictures.
Hahaha look, don’t make me go back out there… it took me hundreds of hours just to find this lol
[removed]
I know you're probably thinking St. Louis, or Memphis area, but it's all relative. I've jumped across the Mississippi. In the headwaters inside Itasca State Park, there are plenty of spots where it narrows enough to do it.
You have a point
That may be true but in Starfield Australia is a huge desert. No water, 🧐
That's unfortunate...
the tasteful thickness...
Wow. You just made *that* reference.
Relative to the universe, yes, but relative to the number of planets with oceans and active flora/fauna, no.
It depends where you live tbf, i have one going through my town..

In Starfield though there are a lot of planets that have fauna, but theres never any rivers or lakes nearby for them to drink, all those poor creatures must be pretty dehydrated
If you're landing in random locations... definitely. Human settlements spring up near rivers and other bodies of water, but if you're choosing a random location on a planet it could be a long time before you found a river. What you would find all over the place  is dry river beds. The only way to reliably find rivers is to travel along the coast, and follow them inland.
There are many planets and moons in our own solar system that have either rivers or ancient river features. Don’t think it a rare occurrence. The rarity of rivers in Starfield is unrealistic.
If water, then river
I can’t go six miles from my house in any direction without stepping in one. Midwest USA. Now they aren’t all big but some are 20 feet across some are six.
Mars had rivers and streams.  Titan has hydrocarbon rain, rivers, and lakes.  I think they show up on planets where liquids are abundant.
On planets that have something of a water cycle and varying terrain, they should be, but I don't think there is much real elevation built into the planets.
That’s where the realism starts ? Lmao bad game
There are rivers, seas, lakes of Methane on Titan. So probably not, as we've got them right here in our own solar system.
No. Many of the planets in Starfiled have precipitation of some type (H₂O or otherwise). All of those planets should have streams, rivers, and lakes. These features can dry out or erode if the precipitation is seldom or no longer occurs, but the features should be present.
in america no. there’s a river every 50 miles or less
Don’t know about rare. I think many major cities are on the banks of rivers.  Paris, London, Cairo, Tokyo. 

But yeah, mercury, Venus, the moon, mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune are all completely river free.
But I have a job and such yo
Water is toxic right ? Remember going there.
THE RIVER
Yes. Biomes matter. Unlikely to find a river in the sandy or rocky desert.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv2VIEY9-A8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv2VIEY9-A8)
If that is all that bothers you about Starfield,  consider yourself lucky.
Facts
I ALMOST had it man! lol
No, I didn't say 'Abe Lincoln', I said 'Hey Blinkin.'
I was talking about 2024 Australia not 2032
Eh we deal with it just fine
Sorry I’m in the diablo 2 subreddit and it’s constant.
That statement can't be proven. It should be with KNOWN active flora/fauna. Otherwise, you are including potential planets that we haven't discovered, yet they may harbor life. Remember, just because life needs the conditions like that on earth here doesn't mean all life will be like us, or even carbon-based.
That's a bit of a selection bias, as human settlements have historically often been built near rivers, as it makes for easy transport of goods. Rivers are also good sources of water and may, depending on the region, be very helpful for agriculture.
You are assuming they drink water in the first place. Some animales even hear on earth get their water from the food they eat. Alien fauna may not need water at all.
Or maybe they drink methane and hydrochloric acid ya know?
I felt bad for the fauna on that one planet that had no atmosphere.
I have a river legit right down the road from my house it’s more of a creek but still
That entirely depends on where you are in the world. If you're in Arabia then yes absolutely finding rivers will be difficult. If you're in temperate zones like Europe then finding rivers is a simple case of walking in a straight line in any direction for a few hours. 

I mean just look at this map of Europe alone for example:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/8s9a4e/europe\_map\_drawn\_by\_rivers/#lightbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/8s9a4e/europe_map_drawn_by_rivers/#lightbox)
You found a coast?

Am I playing this wrong?
It's unrealistic but it's mainly due to the limitations of Starfield's procedural generation system. The game builds maps based on pre-designed blocks that are assembled in a relatively random order. Building a realistic looking flowing river using this system would be extremely difficult.
They'll tell you all about "The land of 10,000 lakes" but they fail to mention the 100,000 creeks, streams, and rivers that feed into and out of said lakes.
Quit job, play more Starfield. 
And you're gonna have a lot of time for living in crash debris down by the river, when...
Im sure more will appear after the creation kit ....

" Thank the maker " ....cough cough ( Todd )
Honestly that shouldn't bother him anyway and there shouldn't be anything that bothers anyone. S
It's weird how this game attracts so much of this type of comments. Literally every game I've ever played has so much that bothers me. Except maybe Super Mario World. And Halo 1....oh wait, no....the Library/flood part goes on too long. So I guess just Super Mario World.
... what the fuck?
counter argument:

rivers and lakes are cool
I think they meant relative to the planets with life and water etc. *in Starfield*, not the actual real-life universe and its planets. If you read it that way, their comparison of relative rarity and conditions makes a little more sense.
This is the perfect embodiment of starfield fans. Mental gymnastics in order to make starfield make sense. I love it.
That does seem like you are trying to rationalise or justify a flaw of the game.
None of the settlements are near rivers either.
I’ve never met an alien who doesn’t drink water
Ok but the food they eat that has water in it, got water from where?
But that's not how it supposed to work in Bethesda dislike :P Heck we have lifeforms that have survived in space vacum, everything is possible :D
So do billions of other people. Humans tend to build near fresh water. Ya know, because it's required to live.
There are areas that is true. However, it is far from universal for most of Africa, Australia, Asia, and the Americas. Especially as you get farther from the coast or large bodies of water visible from orbit. Europe is extremely water rich. There are areas on other continents, which tend to be densely populated, with lots of lakes and rivers, but if you’re choosing a random location on earth, finding flowing water can be difficult.
If you zoom in click close to the ocean you can get a biome(coast). It isn’t guaranteed, but if you try a couple of times along the coast you can land there. It’s how you can scan ocean creatures. Once you land check the map or climb up high of find the direction of the ocean.

You’re not playing wrong there is a lot they don’t explain.
True. I was referring to the comment about rivers being rare in the context of actual planets and moons compared to how few we see in-game.
Not if they added in some kind of “layer” system to their proc-gen (or utilized it more if it is there in the first place). Generate the landscape, then generate a river separately and place it over top the generated landscape, carving out a riverbed along its path.
Minnesota is beautiful country. One of my favorite places to visit for camping
I am facing redundancy in the next 2 months so I wish I was free to make such a choice! lol....
You mean....the God Head 😆
So my "Damaged Ship" that I've renamed at least 50 times shouldn't bother me? Or the Crimson Fleet Ghost III that I tried renaming probably also around 50 times shouldn't bother me? Seems like a good thing to be bothered by imo.
But let’s be honest halo is a masterpiece for giving us a war that ended up with multiple fronts fighting each other.
Maybe cause this game deserves it?
The “paul allen’s” reference is in there constantly
No doubt, not saying they arent. Only pointing out that they are making a broad generalization about habital planets in the universe when their subject size is 1.
That is still an extrapolation based on the water cycle of 1 planet. No matter how you try to look at it he is taking what he knows about how earth IRL works and using that information to make assumptions about starfield universe. Remember, its a game, not reality. They can make whatever rules for their reality they want. It doesnt have to be realistic.
New Atlantis is beside a lake, right? 

And Neon is surrounded by water on all sides! XD
Those uses of rivers are much much much less of a thing when your civilization is space faring lol.
Me neither, and I know at least two and a half aliens at this point.
Osmosis
The ground.
Me.
🤓I live in the country but even then I have access to tap water and the neighbor I was referring to has that creek that doesn’t mean he fucking drinks from it everyday and in fact he built the house a few years ago and even then it had tap water nowadays if you live in a first world country you don’t really need a creek/river but sure whatever you say
Correct. A normal person wouldn't be bothered by that stuff.
Just like real life.
I mean, Halo is far from a masterpiece to be honest. But I'm also one of the only people I know who doesn't like it. But I at least have reasons. 
Every game has shortcomings. Bethesda games have a weirdo community of hate circle-jerkers that act like any issue is a personal attack against their family.
Let's see Paul Allen's fuckin Barb build. 

Y'all swing on some weird trees over there.
Physics doesn’t change between planets though, so while it isn’t ironclad, I think his argument does still work a little bit. Water flows the way it flows in a gravity well, assuming it’s in liquid state. And rivers really are just big flows of water. And the rest can indeed be attributed to “it’s a game” lol. Thanks for pointing out the fallacy.
13 days old but brother, other planets in the universe aren't alternate realities lmao. 

Barring extremes (which by definition are rare), a planet warm enough to have liquid water will have a water cycle.
Oh right. I don't remember a whole lot of my visit to neon for.... reasons.
Still a convenience factor, especially given that most human settlement outside of Sol was founded in desperate circumstances.
Aliens drink Brawndo, it has what plants crave.
Where do you think tap water comes from?
Well considering a vast majority of this games player base knows and dislikes that there are many broken aspects i.e ship renaming not working properly, I'd say we are the normal ones and you are not.
Don’t take this as me being mean. I’m just generally curious but what are those reasons?
Yes, but in Starfield it isn't just shortcomings. Oblivion had shortcomings, Skyrim had shortcomings, Fallout 4 had shortcomings.

Starfield just uses completey outdated game design. It feels so outdated, that it's frustrating. It feels like you play a game from 2011 with modern graphics.
Not really, once you're tech reaches space fairing, you're no longer gathering water from the surface, you're mining water from the water table underground anyways. The water is cleaner underground than that exposed to the surface, and usually available in much larger quantities. So it's way less important to build next to a river as you'll likely not use that for potable water. Humans today don't really use rivers for potable water anymore either, mainly just for transportation these days. Take for instance, the Mississippi River, most of the river is polluted beyond the levels that make even fish edible by EPA standards. Same with the Neuse River in North Carolina, there's so much industrial waste dumped into it that nearly every town has stopped collecting potable water from it as the waste levels are too high to make it safe.
Tens of Miles away from my house :)
Nah its cool lol I know I'm the minority with it. Personally, I don't like stories where one person does SO much, over and over, and wins. 


Like, I know he doesn't always win easy. And even some wins are, to a degree, also a loss. But I'm just not a fan of characters who do so much almost entirely alone. It feels cheap, and plot-armor heavy. And unreasonable (because unrealistic isnt the right word tbh). Halo Reach is by far my favorite game because it's not like that. I know master chief has help sometimes but mostly it's just him. 


The arguement can be made that some of my favorite games are like that to a degree, but it's all about scale for me. Yes, one man can take on most of rapture, assisted. But one man taking on entire alien armies / worlds over and over is a bit much. (I know he has Cortana but she doesn't help him actually fight.)
I just don't agree. I've played games that actually feel how you described. To that point, almost every sequel for every game is the same uncharted 4 Plays like 1. Halo 5 plays like 1. Fallout 4 plays mostly like 3. Some more drastic than others, and sure you can try to argue, but it is technically true. 


Starfield has its issues, as all games do, but people really do treat any Bethesda issues as if it's personal. Starfield is still better than a LOT of games in the past few years. It's not perfect but that doesn't make it just plain bad. 
That's literally every Bethesda game your basically saying it's not an issue for all the games until Starfield which doesn't really make sense.
The tap, obviously
Okay very valid points and I agree with you that reach was my favorite also and I did play em all to date even the spartan assaults. It is a bit crazy with how much chief does alone and it does become kinda unrealistic but I take that with how chief is also a trained super soldier with bones like wolverine. With the addition of chief having a real team with him that would have definitely added some extra depth to the story and overall immersion. As for him not having that introduced I believe has a lot to do with the first game being a “solo” game and it was originally supposed to be a top down shooter but changed it to a first person partially through development. Overall tho I agree with you and that with chief actually having his team with him would have made coop and the story much better in turn.
Alone the amount of loading screens is absurd for a modern game. The animations are stiff and feel 10 years old. The combat is just not good, especially if you compare it to like Cyberpunk. Everything that Starfield does, another game makes it better. Starfield excels nowhere.

If you compare Starfield to any big RPG from the last few years, it's the worst by far. I don't say it's a bad game, but theres a reason why so many people dislike Starfield. Cause it feels old and like Bethesda is still stuck in 2011.
Do i really have to explain to you, that context of in which time a game releases matters? Bethesdas game design was maybe good in 2011, but isn't in 2023, especially if you have other first person futuristic RPGs like Cyberpunk that make everything better.
You said where do you think tap water comes from saying tap water already states it comes from the tap if you were to say where do you get water from your sink and I said tens of miles away from my house and then you the tap it would’ve made sense
CONGRATS TO R* the GTA VI trailer becomes the third most watched video in 24h of all time at 88 million views.
The top two are: 
Dynamite by bts at 101 million.
And butter by bts at 108 million.
Huge congrats and we all knew how well this trailer would do, truly historic.
Would’ve been more if YouTubes shitty algorithm recommend the actual gta 6 trailer from rockstar instead of GameSpot.
You literally have to go to rockstars page on youtube to watch the video. Searching “gta 6 trailer” doesn’t bring the video up at all. This video would have broken the record, what a shame.
And the most viewed non music video in 24h
Naw bih it was 90,635,216 views

It still says 23 hours there

https://preview.redd.it/xqf2natrkk4c1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=adff00568f0672c77aa1ae0e62d93e3c32b1c292
That’s cool and all, but why aren’t more people talking about the fact that in less than a day, the GTA VI trailer is within 5 million views of surpassing the first GTA V trailer and becoming Rockstar’s most viewed video of all time? It’s almost certain to surpass the GTA V trailer within the next day or so, and that’s even with people going back and watching the old trailers again as well.
the YouTube-algo, the amount of reposts and the leaked trailer didnt let them get to number 1. Sucks.
Actually, it beat the record 15 minutes ago:

89,245,296 views from Rockstar's YouTube channel

16,870,805 views from Gamespot's YouTube channel

3,105,630 views from IGN'S YouTube channel

=109,221,731

Beating BTS 108,000,000

Congratulations Rockstar Games🤘🏻💯
I searched “gta 6 trailer” then “gta 6 trailer rockstar games” and it still wasn’t the first video recommended, it was like the 4 video recommended smh gamespot and some other channels popped up first, what a shame
Been just over 24 hrs and view count is at 94 million
Sad that ign and GameStop took over 20mil views. Also fuck that crypto leaker. It would have easily hit the record if not for that stuff.
fck that Gamespot channel and others that stole viewers.. what a shame. this trailer could be number 1...
It’s actually the most watched.
Bts is the most SINGLE watched video in 24 hours HOWEVER the gta 6 trailer is still the most overall watched video in history on YouTube.

GTA 6 in total has massed 110 million views in the first 24 hours across GameStop ign and rockstar.

YouTube’s algorithm didn’t actually show rockstars but showed gamespots instead when I searched for it. Didn’t wanna watch a stolen copy and gave rockstar games my views instead.
Who the fuck are BTS
I shit you not, last night, I said "GTA 6 Trailer" using my tv's voice assistant 3 fucking times, it populated it with GTA V trailer every single time. Something was wack with the algorithm
I think rockstar is shadow banned when i type Gta 6 trailer in the YouTube browser the official trailer doesnt pop up at all
Other gaming channels "stole" a few millions I'm sure.
Top 2 spots are both BTS?! Damn GTA deserves the top spot!!!
Is anyone else anxious and nervous at the same time about the future leaks till the game comes out. 

Never in history has a masterpiece of a game has had so many leaks
FUCK BTS
Gameplay trailer numbers are going to be wild. 109 is doable
Crazy being in charge of a product that breaks so many records, social media and monetary wise. Wish I came up with gta lol
Maybe they will break BTS's record with the gameplay trailer or trailer 2

And gta v hit 100 million lol
Definitely watched it like 16 times.
I feel like the early release definitely hurt the view count.
Kpop netizens literally, legally "view-bot" their favorite groups videos to pump up their numbers, they have it down to a science as to how long to watch a video until it counts as a view, then have macros to refresh the page, on many different devices.

GTA being where it is, is an extremely impressive and unlikely feat again until GTA 7.
Howd you get the flair?
If it dropped on schedule I think it would've easily gotten more views, I woke up and saw the trailer was uploaded 7 hours ago.
Al my homies hate bts
This is GameSpot’s m.o. with Rockstar basically. They were the first to break the news about Hot Coffee script being found in the PS2 copy of the game. Rockstar then gave everyone but GS press kit materials and previews of VCS and I believe Bully as well. By the time GTAIV made the rounds RS’s heart softened. Then naturally when V came out, GS gave it a pandering 9 with its only setback being “it’s misogynistic.”
It would be nice if they released the game in this century. It’s gonna launch when I’m on my deathbed.
**Trailer 2 will beat it in few months time**
Still doesn't populate rockstars YouTube channel when searching for the trailer. Gamespot and reactors are all I see at first.
Gamespot ruined the record
i’m in love with it 😍😍
I hope there’s an 80’s club playing all the bangers from OG Vice City.
Would have easily beat the record if the video wasn't shared on the IGN channel and stuff taking away 20 million plus views from the official source
It hit 90 million before 24 hours. I was watching it tick up live.
*89 now
I don't play GTA but the legendary status of the series makes me want to try it out
Top two by that certain Korean g** band. Don't let them near the radio of GTA VI.
Test
Now if we could just get a good trailer
The GTAV trailer got like 9 mill since the trailer came out so somehow VI hasn’t broken its record hahaha
2years is still absurd
BTS This the best!

![gif](giphy|FsTy90hobCESl7aYkH|downsized)
Hold up.   Fact check.  Most top videos are in the billions.  

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos
I will not bother until it is released, tested, first bugs are fixed and it goes on sale, so there is no need to watch the trailer now. The game will probably be around for the next 20 years.
Where do I download this game? I’ve looked everywhere but I can’t find where to buy and download it.
Gta 5 has 96 I think? This is going to break it 100%
Daamn
God Bless Rockstar
Coulda sworn it reached 90 million before it hit 24 hours
Damn I should have watched it more then 126 times..
wowza
It was actually 90 Million
Is CM Punk number 1?
finna be best game ever
damnn!
Congratulations to all of the R* Team ❤️
wow
YEA! MAN BTS IS THEM YALL!!! 😈 THAT IS WHAT IM BOUT!! 😆

It would have been a lot more if YouTube would have recommended the trailer from the Rockstar Games and not from the Gamespot, typically Youtube. But besides music is the most viewed video of all time.
Yoo
Setting useless records.
dope
Are we just going to post the current view count every 5 minutes?
who cares about that
the rockstar knows how hitting new records
I feel honored to have been one of the first mil
I got in at 100k views
Gta V - 100 million views in 12 years
Gta VI - 100 million views in 1 day !
It's fkin crazy
I gave 'em two watches.  

Can't wait for two years from now...
Hell this is super impressive, that mean the trailer is actual hype rather than K Pop fans rewatch the video over and over just to break a record
It just keeps growing! And it’s barely been 2 days
Woah
Wait for trailer 2 or story trailer, it will wipe the floor with dynamite and butter
Imagine if it didn’t leak 😢
Neat! Go Rockstar!
If we had the actual premiere it’d probably beat both of those vids
Who is 1st and 2?
Nice
It brings a tear to my eye knowing it’s finally happening.

![gif](giphy|3o6Zt3AC93PIPAdQ9a)
The ball was dropped
I think rockstar would’ve hit that record if it weren’t for the leaks forcing their hand a day early.
Well, GTA 6's already made 30K from Youtube revenue, it only gets higher and higher from here.
Don't those BTS fans watch videos 100 times to break records and stuff 

I am not familiar with their methods but I refused to believe that views were organic lol
yep
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
101M now.
As of now, it has hit 101 million views almost surpassing Dynamite. Lets go, Rockstar!
Now 101 million
 my goodness, the hype that is building up the game is absurd!! :-)
Does it really count as third of the 2 above it are kpop videos?
Now it's at 100million+
Who cares about those k-pop wannabes, I was cruising today sussing the view count over the three main channels at 23hrs, rockstar 88m gamespot 17m ign 3m add up the extra whatever hundred thousands were we cleaned up, on top of it getting dropped early as well I’m giving it to them!
At least it beat GTAV in terms of views.  A video from 12 years ago
Had to get a bit specific just for 3rd best, but gratz I guess.
I can't stand BTS stans
And thats how you get ahead of a leaked video. Good for you,  R*. 👏🏿
Nice
Guys, how do you think the radio is gonna be? Better or worse than GTA SA? What songs do you would like to be on it?

![gif](giphy|ER9ew0BbQGCDC)
ggs
Let’s go
88m is crazy i remember at the time i was watching it had around 70k views
It beat Dynamite let's fucking goooo

https://preview.redd.it/lz2qymu9no4c1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd23042faffc5732cccfa932e789d853e8e788a1
This better be dope
So... how many views will this trailer get from now till release day in 2025. Any guesses?
Let''s get this record on Trailer 2
I bet you it was a bts plot from the start lol
Man I hope the other upcoming trailers would break the record
The game spot vid alone got about 16 mill, tragic how they stole rockstars thunder like that.
It was so annoying if I wanted to rewatch the trailer and it just showed reaction videos
Perhaps trailer uploads should be restricted to the main publisher for the initial 24 hours?
For real, last night I wanted to rewatch the trailer, typed "GTA 6 trailer" in the search, got about a million "reaction" and "analysis" videos, got the IGN page with the trailer, but not the official one.
Even searching the exact words Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1 wouldn't yield the actual video. I had to search Rockstar's actual channel. Complete joke
Or all those annoying vlogers or whatever they're called
I had the “notify me” set up for when the dropped,  it when I woke up, and the trailer was already out, it wasn’t even on the homepage feed for me no matter how many times I refreshed. Plenty of “reaction” and “analysis” videos being recommended instead though.
Right? Even if I search for it, I get other sources like ign and gamespot.
yeah that's a bummer, hopefully they'll take some time to reflect so they can get my PC version ready at launch.
Or those dumb ass reacion videos
At least theres other measures like total views on platforms or whatever. I remember this metric for No Way Home.
Idk why the hell other companies can post peoples trailers but whatever
But thats on Rockstar for not including „GTA“ in the title.
add to the fact that it being leaked also dismissed the views of R*'s posting of the trailer. Had the trailer dropped yesterday at the schedule time on R*'so channelbi think the views would also be higher in this case as well. Damn shame...
Top spots for me (not logged in) were about 6 reaction channel bullshit.
It's really annoying because almost every trailer I've ever looked up, it never actually shows the original one
Google search itself wasn't any better. Searching for gta 6 trailer gave me IGN, GameSpot and two other videos on my PC, no original at all. I had to add Rockstar to the end to make it find the original. When I now search on my phone, Rockstar is only second with GameSpot first and IGN second.
For some reason, youtube has totally shadow banned Rockstar’s upload for me in search results. I’ll type in “GTA 6 trailer Rockstar” and get every other channel’s upload, as well as Rockstar’s GTA 5 trailer, but can only find their upload if I go to their channel page. This might also be a limiting factor for them
exactly. i search gta6 trailer on YT and the official rockstar video is way down the tab. should be first but my algorithm shows me a bunch of reactions first.
For fucking real. Even if I literally typed in 'GTA VI trailer rockstar' I still got the trailer from other channels. I had to look rockstar up directly to find it. Bullshit.
People don't realise that it's not just the algo issue. Someone was dumb enough to not include "Gta 6" in to the title (e.g like IGN did). Because majority of people are searching it with "Gta 6" not "GTA VI". They might have tags for it but so would other videos, so the exact title match would get priority for people searching. I blame it on Rockstar marketing.

BTW if I search "GTA VI" trailer, Rockstar's trailer is always number 1 spot for me (of course after the sponsored video)
Yep it's really weird. It doesn't matter what you search, you'll only get reposts. So it's crazy that it's gotten this many views.
yep, told a family member about the trailer being released and they didn’t believe me because when they searched it up in youtube, the actual trailer couldn’t be found. had to go to rockstars website to find it
Also something I've noticed, ALOT of youtubers reacting to the trailer are watching it on gamespot
It comes if you search "GTA VI Trailer". I don't know whose fault this is, Rockstar or YouTube. YouTube could've certainly understood that "gta 6" means "gta vi". But it's also possible Rockstar didn't use tags in the vid (I think it's possible to know, I'd check) or could've used "gta 6" in the title or description.
I had no problems pulling up the rockstar YouTube account typing in exactly what you put, not sure what's going on
Who gaf god damn
One of my times (because I think I’ve watched it maybe 8 times) I literally searched “rockstar games” and THE FIRST THING TO POP UP BEFORE THEIR CHANNEL WAS THE GAMESPOT TRAILER 🤬
I tried Bing. Big mistake. Totally useless.
I literally just typed G into the search bar and all the recommendations are gta6 and the first video is the trailer from rockstar (on my tv)
The trailer’s the second thing that pops up when I type that in
https://preview.redd.it/4i6i2vzxqm4c1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0570d838d42f67d31a36ea3faa67400d5c7ad17d

tho they used tags you know
It’s because, for some reason, the video is listed in the music category. You’ll find it instantly through there.

Edit: it was, has since changed.
Same thing here, stupid YT algorithm.
It works for me
fucking bts smh
Yup I saw 90 million at the 23 hour mark in my end too
The counting system within YouTube seams to been broken, through this all. 

They got to fix / polish up the code.
I took a screenshot when the video was 3 mins old the exact release time would've been 5:07pm cst. I took another screenshot today at 5:07pm at 90,231,644 views. Could've changed in seconds tho.
YouTube wasn’t as prolific in 2011 as it is today. Getting 100 million views back then was reserved for select music videos and insanely viral videos. It also wasn’t the go-to source for game trailers
worm include office encouraging adjoining desert toy repeat bake compare

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
Because its a David vs Goliath comparison comparing the Internet today to 2011.
And the stupid person who leaked the entire trailer. Me and homies planned to watch it exactly at the release time but couldn't.
Bad luck I guess
is it official tho?
It beat the first GTA V trailer already, had 100 million after 12 years, this beat it in a day.
By that logic you would have to count all the different uploads of the BTS song together too.
This
It’s because, for some reason, the video is listed in the music category. You’ll find it instantly through there.

Edit: it was, has since changed.
[deleted]
Rockstar is billion dollar corpo. It'll be fine lol
Though if you put that logic into it then I doubt it even cracks the top ten when taking into account Marvel trailers. Like No Way Home got around 350,000,000 views across all of youtube from all of its uploads in the first 24 hours. Endgame or Infinity War were over 200,000,000 iirc.
I like your positive mindset
Behind the scenes
The group that smashes GTA VI
kpop just way too powerful on the internet, don't pay no mind to it
You have to type “GTA VI” not GTA 6. I know it’s stupid why YouTube’s search function wouldn’t be able to catch it with the 6. Shouldn’t they have search tags with “GTA 6” for the official video?
It’s because, for some reason, the video is listed in the music category. You’ll find it instantly through there.

Edit: it was, has since changed.
I am. I am afraid since last time they said that the source code is out... I was so relieved when that turned out to be fake news.
Im also afraid of spoiler leaks. I think I already read a spoiler, because in that spoiler it said that Lucia will be in prison, and some other spoilers, and the prison part turned out to be true.
😘

I doubt it honestly, most people who even knew about the trailer release date at all also probably came across it being released early.

Also people were mad they couldn’t have “watch party” get togethers for the trailer, that would’ve only reduced view count as 6 people watching together = 1 view
Maybe or maybe not, but in less than a day, the GTA VI trailer has 94 million views on YouTube alone, compared to GTA V’s first trailer having 99 million over the course of 12 years. And that number is only going to keep climbing I’m sure.
I watched it 12 times. Did I mess up the count?
GTA fans do the exact same thing, watching GTA VI trailers for 30+ times.

Follow the instructions on this comment, you have until 9AM EST to get the flair!
Yep, if you add together the Gamespot, IGN, and other reposts that would’ve been otherwise consolidated, it would’ve been #1
I just need the Malibu club to play Automatic for the sake of my nostalgia
I ran so far away 24/7
Exactly. It was likely not the #1 thanks to whoever leaked the trailer and fragmented all of the engagement
You're disgusting.
F\*\*k BTS! GTAVI is Art and creates several thousand jobs! Besides that, IGN and gamespot Youtube channels both syphoned a lot of millions of views from the OG video from Rockstar channel. If one counts the views within 24 hours from the Rockstar Games channel, IGN channel and Gamespot channel, you end up with OVER 110 million views close to 111 million views. So in fact 
GTA VI BEAT BTS and factually won. When BTS released their top video with 108 million views, other channels got copyright strike so all views remained within 24 hours on the OG VIDEO. With GTA VI there was a leak first then Rockstar quickly responded with the official video and IGN and Gamestop channels stole the views without consequences and made it impossible for the official video to reach the BTS numbers within 24 hours on the main channel. It's cheating and that's a fact! One must combine the views of the 3 channels for the GTA VI trailer, only then it's fair!
Billions of views in the first 24 hours??
It’s not coming until 2025 💀
haha dope from rockstar I don't think so
Hmm. Good point. We should make it every minute or so. Anyone up for the task?
Music videos for the K-Pop band, BTS
There’s usually a delineation in YouTube metrics between music videos and other content. Music videos traditionally get much higher engagement than non-music videos.
What wrong with behind the scenes footage?
Right. I watched it when it was an hour old and it had about 180k and I was surprised it was so low.
IGN video also stole a bit...but not as much as GameSpot...we would have washed tf out of BTS if we only the had the ONE trailer
So essentially it would of hit the 100m mark, perhaps 102m-106m that would be around 4m off of one of the K-pop videos, which correct be if I’m wrong, is the most viewed video within 24 hours on YouTube.
[deleted]
Why can’t they sue them?
It's a dog eat dog world in advertising! Imagine how many hundreds or thousands that do the same thing!
Yeah that really sucks
I don't understand how they can just repost the entire trailer and not have it taken down? Must have some agreement.
Seriously. I was thinking the same thing. A buddy from work sent me the gamespot trailer in the morning. I replied with rockstars. I thought about reporting it honestly. Some bullshit they literally stole views from rockstar with rockstars product. Like they have more reach then rockstar? Lol
lol right, at one point I had to scroll through a dozen reaction videos before getting to the actual trailer
YouTube's algorithm/search feed is so fucked. It's like Google Images, I swear both have gotten worse.
I tried to show it to my wife and searching 'rockstar gta6' brought up the GTA5 trailer from 11 years ago further up the list. Fuck I hate YouTube
No, stop, won't somebody think of the poor corporations and their missing money?
If Rockstar didn't send them the video, they would have flagged it as stolen. So this was Rockstar's decision to give the big gaming portals the video and allow them to publish it on their channels as well.
I never thought of that, definitely what probably happened.
wouldn't be surprised if YouTube realized that the video was getting view-spammed and the algorithm fucked it
Have to search GTA vi, not GTA 6
Maybe it's changed, but when I searched gta VI trailer it came up, I think it's the number that is messing with the search.
Not to mention I'd guess people have high skepticism towards react content due to years of fake trailers and news.
They really do need to turn off ad revenue for reaction videos like that.

Everyone and their dog knows it’s just the creators trying to stay relevant and farm views.
They did have the tags on the video after the premiere ended early, but the search algorithm still only show the trailer from anything but from Rockstar.
It was fixed after the 24 hours were up, yesterday it wouldn’t pop up
Who the fuck are they anyway I honestly have never heard about them
Tom Scott has a great video about the views situation (back then, 301+). Fully recommend. Slightly outdated but the core ideas are valid
Yeah, could have
Also 90 million people going to the one video in less than 24 hours would almost certainly crash YouTube back in 2011
It was 2011 not 2006, YouTube was a pretty popular platform by then, I'd say that's a good chunk of the overall views.

YouTube was the 5th most popular site on all the web in 2011, not the behemoth it is today but no slouch.

https://technewsgadget.net/2011/12/google-tops-list-of-most-visited-site-for-2011/
Exactly. YouTube was big in 2011, but the amount of active users has more than doubled since then.
I can't reply to EVERY comment above, but while
Yes you all are correct, my point was that GTA VI is ready proving to go beyond even the massive level of hype that GTA V had in its time, which is amazing to me, but not surprising.
He maybe didn't take as much view, because many people would watch it with like 3 friends, so its only 1 view instead of 3. And of course you would watch it many times with ur friends, but even alone I watched it like 50 times :D But maybe my idea is stupid I don't know
In some cases like counting music streams they do count separate uploads but not sure they would do the same here
The math is!
no, its not like how this works
7 million of those came in the last two days. It was at 93 million when the GTA VI trailer was released.
Something about being most viewed video in 24h would get them a guiness record, instead they landed on 3rd place. Sure, maybe they don't care, but must sting a little that it didn't happen.
One of the best revenue generating games of all time, and for a god damn reason!
the nwh and endgame trailer views you are talking about are across all platforms not just youtube.
I doubt that
They get featured a lot on blurays yeah?  Good band. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses)
It's such a big corporation. So many devs are working on the same project. Imagine how hard it must be to keep it confidential which falls on the leaders & Managers of Rockstar Games given how easy it is to leak out anything without anyone knowing who did it. But I believe leaks for Rockstar should not and will not affect their sales for sure.
Get this negativity off my screen.
??? It’s a joke.
I doubt GTA fans were refreshing the trailer after every 20~30 seconds on both PC and phone to hope it counts as another view.
There’s bound to be references to the Malibu club in GTA6, but like any nightclub in the 80’s, it’s not still open now. I hope Mercedes makes a Cameo too!
Get mad

Reading comprehension is hard when the big red “No ur wrong” button is flashing on their engagement dashboard
Wdym?? this trailer was the gameplay trailer the first one was uploaded 2 years ago and had blinding lights in it I think but I think rockstar deleted that one for this trailer. The game is obvs out rn.
Wouldn’t rockstar have to give IGN and Gamespot permission to upload the video? 

From a promotion standpoint, what difference does it make if their GTA 6 ad is seen by 100 million people on one channel, versus 100 million people split across three channels?
Not only that, but if we also got the trailer premiere as scheduled instead of it being ruined by leakers. That way we'd have easily crossed to top 1.
Sounds like when they release the second trailer that we have a mission…
At 106 it would be no.2 just 2 mill off butter by bts
Also people are more likely to put a music video on indefinite repeat and walk around the house cleaning or whatever while not watching it.
\*would have
It’s literally more promotion, while rockstars channel doesn’t get the views - the trailer still does. They honestly won’t care but it is a shame that the trailer couldn’t go further with record breaking.
Hell no. Views for something like this don’t matter, as long as everybody sees this hard work. The more people that see it the better.
Lol its a one minute trailer, not like Rockstar are making any money off of it. If anything its free marketing.
Tf is your comment on about. Trailer are free distribution. That's the whole point of a trailer...
Rockstar doesn’t show ads on their videos, so they don’t have any losses from the stolen views to sue for.
R* probably distributed the video to gamespot and ign or whatever, and they would have revenue sharing arrangements or else YT would flag it as stolen IP.
Arrested.
When do you think the second trailer will come out
I hate how bad this is nowadays, searching for anything is a lot more difficult because most of the results will be shitty reaction videos.
I think I'll just directly go the channel instead of search. That's the best way.
Correct. This is why google now suggests adding ‘reddit’ at the end of any search term haha.
Yeah something changed quite recently with that algorithm. I tried looking up some things earlier today and it was so frustrating I just got off. I don’t know why a website that is such a cornerstone of success would even tinker with its system like that.
Yeah it also shows like 5 results and then just random stuff.
The irony here is it popping up is probably why the GTA V trailer finally crossed 100M
It's not about the money, Rockstar didn't even monetize the trailer. Amd for that reason YouTubes shitty algorithm was pushing their video under cringy assholes.
I just checked again and now finally at least for me rockstars trailer is first on the list if you just search gta 6. 

But ever since it dropped until now you couldn't find it unless you went on their channel.
Yep they fixed it today, but since it was released until today it didn't show up. Rockstar would've made the record otherwise 1000%. Just add the views from the re-uploads.
When the trailer originally leaked, I thought it was just another bullshit fan made trailer made from clips of other games, lol.
Not really, I enjoy those videos and I enjoy watching people who were as excited as me react to it for the first time. A lot of them got striked for playing the song though.
At the time of your comment was posted that wasn't the case and it was within 24hrs of it being posted, not trying to be pedantic but you also seem to be making it sound as bad as possible.
Will check out the video with his description later. Thanks!
How did you get that flair?
Well the record is 'most watched video' and not 'most watched upload'

So they should count together for the record because it is the same video
![gif](giphy|CLhMG06HSUoMiZ1PXB)
Moron.
There aren't many crazy fans that watch their favorite group's MV endlessly, perhaps just a few compared to the large fanbase. They still hold the record for most views, most likes, and peak viewers.
No, we just refreshed it every 1 minute and 31 seconds because **we can't get enough of it**
I heard the place turned to shit because some greaseball bought the place as a front for criminal activities.

schizophrenia
The blinding lights one was fanmade
You stupid bruh
I don't think there is a difference. I think these people are just referring to the record setting capability of the official trailer video
No, in this instance, I believe both Rockstar and YouTube knew the trailer could be the most watched video ever and made a massive deal of pushing people to the official source. Unfortunately, so many people wanted in on the views and reposted it.
It would make more news
Wow that’s insane tbh
Im terribly sorry for the grammatical mistake sir
Just annoys me that IGN and Gamespot and the like puts ads on the ads they upload. They literally just uploaded someone else’s work, how come they get advertisements and monetization?
if its fall 2025, which i hope it isnt considering the revenue predictions, and if there will be 2 trailers and a gameplay reveal then itll be around this time next year, if its spring 2025 then maybe july-september
I'd say in about 6 months
And why people just ask chatgpt any generic questions
Because they can control it more. Control the content, control the conscious.
Oh shit it crossed it? I checked yesterday and it was at 99 million. I was like shit gta 6 almost has that and it just dropped. Same happened to me though. Everytime I search it, it doesn’t come up.
I noticed the same shit yesterday so you're not tripping and I don't think you're tripping.
I’ll point the finger right back at you and call you a liar as I searched youtube soon as I saw this post and it was still the case with no trailer showing unless i went directly to rockstars page 

Do you get a kick out of arguing with people online for no reason? Why would I or any of the other commenters also experience the same thing I stated? I don’t like wasting my time on useless things, even less useless banter, choose what you want to believe
Go to [this comment right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/18ax6xd/official_gta_vi_trailer_video/kc0twg1/) and comment "#TrailerDayOG"

It's only available until tomorrow at 9am EST
yeah i agree, it should count
What, there's seven of you chumps?

Send in Lucia, Jason, Michael, Trevor, Franklin, Niko and Luis
I think so too, but what does rockstar really gain from breaking a YouTube view record? 

Rockstar already has the record for top money earning game, I don’t think they really care about having the most views.
But YouTube is notorious for copyright strikes. If they were concerned about being the most watched video ever, it just a matter of deleting the reposts as they pop up
[removed]
I know of 2 ways to avoid all ads on YouTube that still work even after the recent changes. 

1. uBlock origin is still effective

2. I'm not seeing any ads watching YouTube on the Brave browser.
theyre literally a news publication?
Kind of like Rockstar takes viral moments and makes them into video games to monetize without compensating anyone.
Alright, no need to bootlick so hard. Rockstar most likely asked them both to upload the trailer because it's literally just promotional material. Gamespot and IGN didn't just upload it with no permission. 

Promoting different games by spreading their trailers and other promotional material is literally a part of what they're paid to do so I doubt Rockstar cares about little bit of ad revenue.
Same for me. So disappointing
What are you even on about? I'm simply saying that when I searched exactly what you said, the very first video was from rockstar. You're response even sounds like a bot Jesus

I literally typed "gta6 trailer" you're a fucking liar or a moron and I can't help either
Did you even read the comment? They said that you could easily find the trailer by just searching "Rockstar Games". I did that and had no trouble at all finding it when it had just released.
Thnks bro
Thank you dude!!
Hot
it's just for a show of dominance, like this is what happens when you actually put hard work into your game. or maybe they're just really fans of rockstar 🤷🏾‍♂️ either way would've been cool to be #1 but #3 isn't easy either.
It's not about money, or having views per se, but if they broke the record for most watched videos, that would give them even more exposure.  


So that is what they gain - exposure in media. Two articles instead of one, or one instead of no article as there are media that wont report a game trailer was released, but might report a broken record etc..
It's a trailer. It's free publicity for your game. Striking a trailer is the dumbest thing you could do. Why would R* not want to reach every single person that has turned on their bell for GameSpot/IGN? IGN has 18M subs, for god's sake.

They don't care about a shiny number. They care about overall reach. Also, most of the views are going to come from people watching it in the future. Guess which video YT is going to recommend to folks typing "GTA VI trailer"? You guessed it.
I’m not even saying it for Rockstar or T2. I’m annoyed I have to watch an ad to watch an ad when the channels reuploading it shouldn’t even be allowed to have ads on it in the first place. If a smaller creator did that I’d bet they’d get copyrighted.
and for phones ReVanced works as well.
Yeah but what I’m saying is how come they can profit off uploading it? I get being able to upload but there is zero reason they should get monetization for the video, they literally just clicked “upload” and that was it
I just don’t like watching ads lol wasn’t trying to defend .0000001% of R*’s revenue
honestly we made it anyhow when you accumulate the IGN trailer, the gamespot trailer and the rockstar trailer. 109 mil.
[deleted]
Their game sales will be the true show of dominance
Yeah but I think since it’s rockstar who’s been dead silent besides once since rdr2 released, there would be news regardless of the view count.
THIS
Which as been my point the whole time
Rockstar uses them for additional reach, but they can’t monetize it to support their business?

I’m not fan of ads but this is a strange nitpick. Gamespot wants to pay their workers too.
Sick dude, thanks
[deleted]
Of course there will be news either way, GTA is the biggest gaming, and entertainment product overall (unless we count MCU as one product). But still.. one more record to trigger one more wave of articles about it never hurts.
As a CPA certified frugal Frank to the fuckin core the point is, Game Spot can raise hands and claim “we just want to pay our workers too”.  But think, what are their workers working on actually? They are a freaking game review publication. As bare skill as it gets if you think on capitalism terms.

R* works off the sweat of true skilled laborers. The ever plighted game dev. They have earned some seemingly meaningless stats on their game release trailer. Which is built all on in house, in engine work. 

I’ve been the meaningless little associate in my line of work. Been paid a salary that math’d out to worse than a fast food worker on minimum wage. Fuck off with the it all comes out in the wash stuff.
Did it work?
I don't think this counts as arguing, OP's just sharing his views
Jo Koy totally bombs at the Golden Globes (claims he didn't write the bad jokes)
Jo Koy bombs at the Golden Globes
This was ROUGH. Once he started blaming the bad jokes on other people and kept insisting the jokes he wrote were funny he lost any semblance of class. You can bomb, but you can’t bomb AND refuse to take responsibility.
“I just got the gig 10 days ago.” 

Yeah, yeah, you were 27th on the list, we get it.
The even more cringe part was how they added all the fake laughs to his jokes.
I personally find ALL his material cringe. Nothing against him as a person but his jokes and bits reek of desperation.
FINALLY, some decent cringe.
He set Filipino-Americans back 100 years.
I made it a good, oh, 30 seconds.

Does the Golden Globes really need a comedic host? Ricky Gervais had some success that was basically a roast but even that ran out of steam. They're really trying to make the hosting gig a bigger part of the show than it needs to be.
You know I’ve never found Jo Koy funny at all. I looked up online and I see a lot of people actually liking him so I thought I must have missed something. Looking at this and yeah he’s pretty bland..
I came to this page just to make sure this had been posted.
I will probably never finish this video 💀
A Hall and Oates joke???
I’m Filipino and can’t be more happy about this. Jo Koy has literally one joke and this proves it. I have a lot of family who love him and they won’t care about this but it’s just the little bit of vindication I need.
Dudes whole career is hamming up his moms Tagalog accent he’s the phillipino Michael blackson
He approves every joke, the host approves every single one. 
Once you do that you own it literally and metaphorically… and to throw the writers that wrote the bombs under the bus for what is undeniably a terrible delivery of those ‘jokes’ is classless and unprofessional. 
It’s one thing to bomb… a whole other to blame anyone but yourself. 
I’m not a fan of Koy’s ‘comedy’ but I could respect the hustle… but I lost that respect after this. But also… it doesn’t matter one bit in the reality of our world, but I still felt oddly compelled to write this comment.
Jo Koy is a hack who panders to filipinos.  

"Hey guys remember adobo"

*Filipinos go wild

Jo now thinks he is a real comedian
Who the fuck is Jo Koy?
Fucking finally, this dude uses being Filipino is his whole routine and my family eats it the hell up, to the point where my mom uses the fact that his mom was condescending to him growing up as an excuse to be the same way. "That's just how we are" yeah right.
It’s the people pleaser energy
I want to small liberal arts college in the middle of nowhere of like 2K people. Jo Koy was a mediocre act to get to perform on campus in like 2012. So the fact that he’s hosting the golden globes feels more like a new low for the golden globes, than my college being ahead of the curve.
Jo Koy is the Sebastian Masniscalco of Carlos Mencias.
I watched the whole thing. I think I have brain damage now.
Serious standups can’t stand him. He’s a hacky, selfish douche. I’ve heard almost exclusively bad things about his personality for over a decade. Along with Mencia, he’s one of the few comics I’ve heard famous people openly talk about poorly.
This dude literally was bitching pre-show that he should be as famous as Stephen Spielberg
they couldnt get an actor to just act like a comedian and host this shit?
Wow crazy they gave him all the jokes the minute before it started and he couldn’t make changes or write anything himself.
Sucks. I've seen this guy live some years back and he was absolutely killing it. I think he was a little out of his element here though.  But normally Koy is great live.
The world saw how much of a hack Koy is.
Really tough to watch. Who is this dude, and is he supposed to be a funny guy?
Absolutely dreadful
He only claims to be Filipino because he makes money out of it.
I had a whole dicussion with my friends years ago when he was coming up that Jo Koy is not funny at all. He does not know filipino culture either. I just texted them right now, I told you all.
That was a painfully unfunny 3 minutes and I had to tap out
Ok I stopped after the “plastic boobies” comment. If he didn’t write the jokes, idgaf how many days ago he received the gig and or “jokes”, he still would have had ample time on day one to change it to something better that doesn’t carry on the “let’s degrade women for humor like in the 1900s” vibe. It’s embarrassing that he’s trying to blame others for his inability to adjust humor with the times and or the fact his jokes suck.
I'm glad there is all of Ricky Gervais' monologues to select from right beside this one. Ricky hosting is an all time classic performance. This is just sad.
Oh shit I couldn’t get though it. Yall are stronger than me if u made it
I didn’t make it past “I’m your host, Jo Koy!” with the head bow while he waits for applause. Ugh
From what I’ve seen online, most people didn’t even know who this guy was before the show and neither did I.
I’ve got more respect for someone who writes their own material and fails, than someone who gets their jokes written for them, and then still fails. 

Presumably he read the script prior to the event. If he wasn’t happy with the product, hire someone else. Don’t whine about it afterward.
Definitely not the funniest set, but I didn’t think it was nearly as cringey as I heard it would be. Damn
When is he gonna tell us this whole thing was a joke?
Ironic that they cut back to Martin Short so often given that these jokes sound like a Jiminy Glick routine.
There was even a story on NPR today where they said he bombed (and the woman reporting laughed at the fact that he bombed and then disappeared for the rest of the night).
Idk I thought it was okay. Some of them were a little too crass for the show but overall I’d say he did an alright job. Nothing spectacular, but okay.
There was an article a few months ago about how the Golden Globes were struggling to find a host. Everyone kept saying no. Now I realize why. Also, who is Jo Koy?
This is literally the only thing I've ever heard about Jo Koy, so not a great first impression.
I legit have no idea who this guy is
Who the hell is Jo Koy
Who is Jo Koy?
Wowzers. That's baaaad.
I used to not find him funny. I still don’t, but I used to not too.
Nowhere near as bad as some people are making out. Not great but it didn’t completely shit the bed.
If this whole comedy thing doesn't work out for this dude he could get a gig at SNL.
I actually couldn't get through more than a minute of this.
can the globes die already
I thought this was fine.
The way everyone is going on about it you’d think it’s the worst thing ever. Yes some jokes don’t land and were cringey + blaming the writers on joke quality, but it’s not as bad as I thought tbh.
Oof. Pretentious ass show anyways
But, he’s not even that funny. His name isn’t that recognizable
I feel like anyone calling this cringe has never seen a comedian truly bomb.  Not a Koy-fan boy by any means, but this just looks like a weak/boring set to me.
This is so overblown.
this poor guy... he's terrible..
I tried to watch the video but I was blinded by his teeth.
I mean I honestly didnt think it was *that* bad. I kept waiting for the bombs. 

Wildly unfunny, but that’s like - that’s just Jo Koy or whatever the fuck his name is. This isn’t “out of character” for him - or mainstream comedy these days. 99% of the comedians on Netflix are trash.
Bombs? He was funny… are you white and offended?
1/1000 thank em for their service
Does the host HAVE to be funny? Can't they just be famous and professional? Do they have to yell? This was 10 minutes too long for a reward ceremony that no one cares about anymore.
The Robert deniro joke was funny though
This guy sucks but also the audience is sterile as fuck. Tough crowd. None of them are laughing politely or even smiling. You gotta give at least a few pity laughs if someone is bombing it that hard
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were the best hosts of any award show
I’d been reading about how bad it was all day before finally watching it tonight, and I honestly don’t think it was as bad as they’re making it out to be. I giggled at a few moments.
I dunno, jokes were ok, mildly amusing. But it seemed like a tough crowd, like the audience was against him from the very start, right?
Seal of approval
This seems like a pretty typical monologue. I didn’t enjoy the intentional edgy comments and making people feel awkward though.
This all could have been avoided if it was Ricky Gervais.
[deleted]
I didn't think it was that bad
Why did I think it wasn’t that bad!
He was telling great jokes to a white, bland audience. Jo Koy is a legend and this wasn't cringe. Jimmy Kimmel is cringe. This is something new and different. Some jokes hit and some didn't. He didn't bomb. His writers and audience did
damnnn poor Jo! hes pure gold though!
Jesus Christ this was hard to watch, you can tell this dude thinks he’s hilarious so when his bad “jokes” don’t land it has to be the fault of the audience. Wow, this is what I come to this sub for.
Who is Jo Koy?
Who is Jo Koy?
I’m usually a fan some quality cringe but this guys is so boring and sad god damn I can’t even watch more than a minutee
The dude has never been funny. All his jokes are the same recycled garbage about having an immigrant mom. I know some Filipino women who seem to like him but I’ve never met anyone else who actively finds him funny.
At least he made himself laugh
I don’t find him funny at all and hearing him bomb honestly made my night because I laughed more than I ever did at his “jokes”
Way to blow an opportunity
I was prepared for it to be terrible, I thought he had a couple funny jokes . But then again I was baked when I watched it
Lol who the hell is this guy?
yeah i don’t like his specials that much, and i tried. but this wasn’t that bad
Who even is Jo Koy? I’ve never heard of him before
I was going to watch the video but the comments scared me away. I can’t deal with too much cringe
Lol, so this is where we draw the line now? Don’t get me wrong that was tough to watch and the jokes were very bad but I’ve heard hosts rip people a new one by disrespecting their spouses, misfortunes, deaths, sexuality, race, serious accusations etc but saying the Barbie boobies line is where people draw the line? Whatever.
That was one of the monologues of all time.
I didn't know who he was before the show and I don't think I'll need to know much about him going forward. His jokes sucked.
The cringe definitely set in when he said some he wrote some other people wrote
Stick to telling stories about your mom.
10 days too soon then don’t do it!
In all fairness to Jo Koy, he's never been funny and it was wrong of you to expect him to start being funny now.
Safe to say that he won't get invited to many more nationally televised gigs after this. Can't really go around  blaming others for the bad jokes even if it is true.
I love that “Jo Koy kinda sucks at stand up” is somehow news. It’s like, have we not seen literally everything he’s ever done?
I don't know if I have the power to watch this, I've heard how cringe it is
Reminds me of that cringy bride's maid speech 😬
I mean, he didn’t 100% bomb. I saw people laughing.

But I also couldn’t watch more than 3 minutes. It really dragged.
The Ryan Gosling joke was funny
how am i already cringing 20 seconds in
Lmfao it wasn’t that bad
He sucks. I’m funnier than he is.
this happens when you milk too many Filipino jokes just to get famous
Chris Rock would of killed it. He took a slap from will smith and still was a professional.
Literally the first time I have ever heard of this guy
I thought it was funny
This guy sucks.
i'm super high and i watched this whole thing and had an out of body experience in a bad way. this dude sucks.
The thing with Robert deniro… pathetic 
Well... that explains the free ticket offer I received from my local casino for a JoKoy show.

What a fall from grace.  I remember some years ago, he was selling out shows at Chase Center (or at least was big enough to have a show at all at such a large venue). Now he's "relegated" to small venue casino shows.
yeah learn from norm Macdonald and stare people down until they have to laugh, but then again, that seems like something only norm could pull off
Thats such a hacky move. I remember I did something simailar once on like my 5th set ever and after of the old pros in the back roasted me for it. 
There are shitty rooms/audiences but its still on you to get them on your side.

The other options are sit in the silence like Norm
Or go Nuclear like Burr.

And joe koy (must comics) dont have what those guys had/have to pull it off.
It wasn't great, but I think you all are overblowing it a little. Some of the jokes were worth a "blow air out the nose" response funny
It was super weird bc the first time he did it,  from the clips I saw, the joke had gotten a decent enough laugh actually.
Ouch! And a haha.
Chappelle, Eddie Murphy, Shane Gillis, Tom Segura, Ricky Gervais, etc all could have gotten this job a week before and killed
[deleted]
And don’t forget he ended that comment with “shut up”.  

Can you imagine if a woman hosting did that?  They would be tearing her from limb to limb for her ingratitude.
It was made obvious when he’s yelling about no one laughing
Oh man someone should have told him they would do that.  I have been commenting how weird it was in the clip I saw for him to throw writers under the bus when it seemed like it got a decent laugh.
The wide shots were pretty damning.
They did? It was live.
Anytime a comic says "c'mon, that was hilarious!!" when an unfunny joke just dies and the audience hates it, it really kills their momentum.
His material is just hack. Its the type of boring humor that can appeal to a lot of people without saying anything
Yeah, I agree. I think there are people who are genuinely funny, whether or not they are professional comedians. Jo Koy is not one of these people. He is just a person who understands the "comedy formula" and understands it enough that he can write standup jokes and what not. These types of comedians are the majority actually so nothing against Jo Koy specifically.
yeah no one wants to hear that shit. Either be self depricating or keep going god
He's a bad person too. I have first-hand accounts of him doing degrading with cocktail waitresses from the comedy clubs. It's a "game" these comics play amongst themselves.

edit: being downvoted. ok, i guess he's a good person that does degrading things according to you folks?
This was worse than when Marquez ko’d Pacquio
Dude he was already devolving “race relations” in main stream comedy. He made his ethnicity so much a part of his act that it was kinda racist in itself

We’re all from different backgrounds, we’re all beautiful, and we love sharing it with each other. But seriously every time he came the xm comedy channel I was listening to, I had to change it. You gotta grow with your audience
Speaking for the Asian committee, we would like to wash our hands of this guy
A lot of fil-ams don't fw jo koy cause he makes being filipino the punchline of a joke instead of having genuine observations from within our culture. Compare his comedy to something like [Rex Narette's SBC packer's bit](https://youtu.be/mCTs1SjOM2I?si=7c-K9N24I5dR5-9k) where the humor is puns off of accent play that still presents a likable character that arguably is in on the joke

edit: specified "fil-**ams"**
Even lumpia isn't gonna get that taste out of my mouth
Worse than when Spain invaded.
That’s your opinion not the opinion of the entire Filipino community! Come on
Love how his biggest fanbase consists of Filipino-Americans but most of his haters also consists of Filipino-Americans as well, especially young ones. Seeing a joke about your parents’ accent past 2010 is jarring to say the least
Maybe not comedic but at least charming. That’s what really makes a good host and what made Gervais so good. Jo Koy is up there yelling bad jokes like a YouTuber from 10 years ago
I’m in favor of scrapping the golden globes, if that’s what you’re getting at
Ricky was great because he played to the people at home, Jo (and I don’t think he totally bombed) was playing to all the humorless producers and actors’ egos.
>Does the Golden Globes really need ~~a comedic host~~  to even exist anymore?

Fixed that for you.
I had to stop when he pulled the Robert DeNiro face. I physically recoiled from my screen.
I'm not his biggest fan but Seth McFarlane always made for a great host
>Does the Golden Globes really need a comedic host?

Do we need awards shows for rich, out-of-touch people who play pretend all day patting themselves on the back for their accomplishments?
Ricky didn't run ourlt of steam. People just couldn't handle it. It was and would forever be hilarious.
The woke movement killed this role. When Kevin hart lost the gig due to some comments he made on Twitter 10 years prior, that kind of cemented that role in doom.

Too much censorship and worries about offending 50 different groups. That kind of environment really stifles creativity so you get shit like this.
If you take out the decent hosting, the fact that this is a giant hollywood circlejerk (and not the most important one at that) becomes painfully evident
Man Ricky Gervais is such a perfect host. Like his roast of the general celebrity society during that one hosting gig was so great!
That’s because it’s a shit award that nobody cares about
Nah, Ricky mocking everything aggressively to the point of genuinely offending folks was hilarious.
There are people out there who laugh at Two and a Half Men and Big Bang Theory.
Filipinos create A LOT of noise online. Filipinos love him
I was surprised it wasn't yet. So I had to do my duty.
Same 😂
I will never finish this video.
with a follow up Daryl Hannah joke? was she even there? She hasnt done anything in like 5 years!
They have been in the news last month a lot for a restraining order and catalogue ownership. Still not a great joke, but surprisingly topical reference.
Apparently a Philip Michael Thomas joke had been deemed not current enough.
That one was good!
Yes, it’s his joke that goes, “there’s a hospital here in (city where he’s performing) that has no nurses at work right now” or something like that?
>"Hey guys remember adobo"
Hey man that was hilarious.
Yea I’ve never found this dude funny AT ALL
I genuinely can’t stand comedians who rely too much on doing accents/stereotypes. Russell Peters beat that horse to death ten times over and unless you do it organically as part of a bigger joke it just feels really cheap.
Idk what it is but I know some Filipino artists who think that simply stating that they’re Filipino is worthy of applause or something. Write some actual material, no one cares.
A comedian who made it big from social media, telling basically the same tired joke over and over about his Filipino mother.
I'd never heard of him until yesterday. Wasn't missing anything.
I’ve never seen or heard of him before.  I’m not sure he’s made it big.
[deleted]
What’s wrong with Sebastian?
No way, man, I've seen Jo Koy twice, his shows were incredible. Most of it was him just talking and joking, his crowd control was incredible and the atmosphere was electric. He is nothing like Mencia and the depth of his Asian jokes eclipses base level stereotypes, they actually have depth and engagement. I saw below you mentioned classic guys who I study and love, I think Jo Koy is closer to them than Mencia (ex - you mentioned Patrice, I watched jo koy do an hour of race material similar to Patrices insights on race, race relations, etc, it was brilliant).
Sooooo, you believed that part about him having writers??
killing it with Filipino audience because we laugh at our own. Outside of those Filipino jokes, he is not funny.
Not even that but the premise of “one is a masterpiece adapted from a long book and blabla while the other is based on a toy” is such a weak joke. Like okay what’s your point? There’s no bait & switch, even if it’s been played out a billion times it’d have been much better to say something like “one is based on the profoundly culturally shifting life’s achievement of an American icon and the other is based on a scientist” or whatever.
At least he went out with a racist joke, real class act
His biggest offense was being boring. No charisma and poorly written jokes / banter from what I saw. Admittedly, I probably only watched 2 minutes before I switched channels. Normally I like awards shows as a way of learning about shows or movies worth watching. Couldn’t stick around through his poor performance though
I expected to cringe more. It was simply bland.
You could tell he was just nervous.
Yeah, i never cringed. Doing a stand up and having some jokes not land isnt cringe
Yeah award show comedy never is really that great. The main thing he did that I don't like when any comedian does is admodish the crowd for not laughing.

It's a crowd of sensitive millionaires, of course you're not going to get the uncaring laughs that you would at a blue collar venue.
This is actually pretty accurate. These comments are more cringe, people saying this is like the worst thing ever and it’s really no different than most award shows. I didn’t find it funny or entertaining but definitely not cringe.
Until he started complaining about not getting laughs I thought it was fine. The jokes on these sorts of shows are never amazing. Ricky Gervais was a bit of an outlier but generally they're very safe.
Agreed. The comments acting like he disgraced the golden globes and set Filipino people back 100 years, like, y’all really haven’t seen any bad comedy. I was at a local stand-up comedy show, and the comedian was bombing, so she started to talk about how much she wanted to fuck her brother. It was a clear attempt to be “shocking” and get some (heavily uncomfortable) laughs.
Did you miss the 20 times he told his lame joke and they bombed while he was awkwardly grinning and waiting in expectation for the whole room to explode with laughter only to hear a few underwhelming guffaws and pity cackles from the people the camera panned to at that moment? 

This guy treated the Golden Globes like one of his stand up gigs down at a dingy local pub and that’s why it sucked. Ricky Gervais, in addition to being wittier and funnier, has the makings of a proper host and entertainer.
Honestly, this was the first I heard about him bombing and went in thinking "OP is probably just being a prick and I'm ready to call him out if he's wrong." But then I seriously didn't laugh once, not even a short burst of air out of my nose. I could feel my expectations steadily declining.
How is this not shitting the bed? It was a disaster.
It’s not that bad, but it’s painfully boring and unfunny. It is bad, but not for cringe reason. People raved about Ricky Gervais and I didn’t find that hosting really all that funny either. Celebrities and awards shows are just so irrelevant to me that it’s hard to care.
Id be curious to see the energy in the room before the editing
It's not the worst thing ever, but it's close.
[deleted]
A lot of the laughter is added I think. It’s not really that bad, just painfully unfunny. These comments made this seem like mega cringe but it’s just mega boring.
Lazy comedy, slightly saved by a boosted laugh track for broadcast. Lame.
I think you need glasses and hearing aids
This isnt even as bad as anything Bert Kreischer has ever released
Do you still look at a room full of people and think about covid in 2024?
The man is terminally unfunny. Even his half decent jokes were delivered badly, then milked dry of any humor.
I dont keep up w entertainment anymore. I have zero clue. My wife stopped on the channel for sec and she didnt know either.
He committed the worst crime of all. He wasn’t funny.
Hello, it looks like you've made a mistake.

It's supposed to be could've, should've, would've (short for could have, would have, should have), never could of, would of, should of.

Or you misspelled something, I ain't checking everything.

Beep boop - yes, I am a bot, don't botcriminate me.

>  rock would of killed  
    
Did you mean to say "would have"?  
Explanation: You probably meant to say could've/should've/would've which sounds like 'of' but is actually short for 'have'.

They gave you that ticket bc you hand them your paycheck every week, not because Koy sucks.
Norm didn’t stare people down to laugh, he utilized the space and silence between words to build the joke.  Big difference
"...I'll be doing some jokes later"
Norm didn't care if you liked the joke or not.  If he was amused by it, he was using it.  He did the same thing when he was on Weekend Update.  So many of the jokes would bomb, and he wouldn't back down.  He'd keep after it.  He never got flustered or tried to compensate.  If you didn't like it, too bad.
>The other options are sit in the silence like Norm Or go Nuclear like Burr.

I was at a Burr show a couple years ago where had a rare joke that didn't land.  Instead of moving on, dude stopped and said "you know, if you guys are going to be this much of a pussy this early in the show etc. etc."  By the end of his rant he had the audience in stitches while berating them.  That's a master right there.
You’re bang on. Norm showed us there’s a better way. Bill showed us the nuclear option.
Perhaps, that part is subjective and his humor may just not be for me. But I can’t count how many times he broke from his routine to insist that the audience *should* be laughing. The cringe isn’t the jokes not landing, the cringe is how he handled it.
Which is why it’s extra weird that he tried to throw writers under the bus. Like has he ever watched an awearsa show?  There were decent enough laughs before he said that from the clip i saw.
Exactly. He’s simply a horrible comedian 😂 (and desperate for a job, it seems)
[deleted]
It's not about what gender he is. He's just awful. Plus i'd say everyone pretty much are shitting on him.  

If a woman said awful things and bombed she'd get a lot of hate too yes. Crazy right? 

Bad comedy is bad comedy
Why do you people always try to make it out to be gender or a race thing..geezus...CoUldyOuImAgiNe!!!!???
Makes a lot more sense ... I'm watching like "ehh I mean it's not very funny but it seems like he's getting laughs 🤷‍♂️"
Oh sweet child
Like an artist forcing a sit down. Never a good idea.
💯
It might be the fact that you generalized it to comics in general. Also, referencing a hearsay account and being vague about what actually happened.
Dude made it less than two minutes in this monologue before doing an Asian accent
plus he's only half filipino ... his brain is diseased w/ the desperate need to appropriate a racial identity
Racist against himself! You can’t make this stuff up folks
What are you talking about, he is worshipped in the Philippines.  As are most celebrities with a single drop of filipino blood in them - worshipped in the Philippines for no other reason than they are 1/64 parts filipino
I enjoyed Ricky's golden globes performance but come on, charming? The whole point of his hosting was to be as abrasive as he could and make the audience as uncomfortable as possible. Comedically, it worked really well (in that instance).

He, as a performer, is not charming, he's not trying to be. Even Gervais himself wouldn't agree with that label.
yeah it is so painfully cringey to hear the host suck the cocks of all these actors who hear it every day and don't give a fuck
["We saw your boobs!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugiCxCfqPi4&pp=ygURd2Ugc2F3IHlvdXIgYm9vYnM%3D)
Devils advocate: award shows motivate filmmakers to create interesting innovative work, beyond the achievement of just a high box office. 

If high box office was the only goal, we’d only have franchise shit to watch
To be honest this only makes sense if you’re someone that doesn’t watch movies, TV shows, sports, or listens to music, or has never found enjoyment from any of those things.
Thank you. Those shows are terrible
I mean you see a lot of people actually finding him funny in this very thread. Nothing against them or Koy personally, but like I said I just can’t find him funny at all. This is coming from an Asian guy who loves Asian comedians.
Oh man my wife loves Jo Koy AND lives BBT and Two and Half Men haha.
Glad I don’t know any of them
Two and a Half Men and Big Bang Theory are a million times more funny than Jo Koy.
Wait this is a popular take? To think Big Bang and Two and a Half Men aren’t funny? I’d argue 2-1/2 got worse after Sheen left but to think those shows are unfunny is crazy to me. Both those shows were #1 on tv at one point, this definitely has to be a Reddit take where they hate popular stuff because its cool to hate popular things.
Don’t forget Young Sheldon /s
You did God's work. I couldn't finish it.
I thought that was a rare joke that actually landed
What is the punchline of this? 😭
It’s because any punchline told in a Filipino accent where your Fs are “eps” becomes instantly *punny*. 

(cue laugh track)
Seeing a lot of up and coming comedians reeeeeeeeeally milking their schtick and bombing after...Kill Tony's podcast is filled with this shit
Made it big from social media? I used to listen to his standup over 10 years ago, and I remember that being really funny. I haven’t listened to him or watched anything he has done since, but it seems he has kind of fallen to the Dane Cook type path.
He was big before social media.  Used to hear his stand-up on Pandora back in like 2015.  


It was funny then.
Boooo
Found one of the joke writers.
Nothing's "wrong" with him if you like him!

I just feel like that "genre" of comedians don't focus as much on well-crafted jokes with setups and punchlines as much as they tell stories in a really animated and silly way. Dane Cook is the same. Totally fine for people to enjoy. As far as standup goes, I just prefer to see the artist craft a creatively surprising end to a clever premise and setup. For example: Hedberg, Carlin, Patrice, Burr, Pryor, Wright, Jeselnik, Norm, etc.
Nothing, if you have no taste. He's a total fucking hack comic.
It's not so much the subject of the joke but the structure of the jokes themselves I'm talking about. But again, if they're your flavor, I ain't gonna yuck somebody else's yum! That's the beauty of art. Something for all of us!
Maybe. But he was quite popular with the Latino crowd in LA too.  Either way whatever reason for it he was genuinely hilarious the times I saw him live.
I’m not sure if it was Greta Gerwig who they panned to after that, but whoever that was, her eye roll was golden.
Hahaha that was actually funny mate!
Right? I wonder if he even actually watched the Barbie movie because if he did, he completely missed the point.
The biggest thing he did wrong in my opinion, was start to attack the audience when they didn’t like his jokes. Obviously, you have comedians like Ricky Gervais who tear into the celebrities, but in this case, it just felt like being unnecessarily defensive.
I watched only half but you can’t say the Barbie bit wasn’t cringe, even he couldn’t believe his own jokes
Someone who comes from humble backgrounds trying to relate with rich people. Of course the jokes don’t land, although I thought Koy is funny tho, he’s just being himself and trying not to shit himself in front of these popularity contest elitists.
Because Ricky Gervais has the ability to stand infront of pretty much anyone and take the piss out of them. Primarily because he can laugh at himself just as easily. I have no idea who this this Jo Koy guy is but you can tell he's nervous & in awe of all the super awesome magical rich people around him.
It’s all very predictable
Calm down incel

That I can buy.
Hello, it looks like you've made a mistake.

It's supposed to be could've, should've, would've (short for could have, would have, should have), never could of, would of, should of.

Beep boop - yes, I am a bot, don't botcriminate me.
😂
I was about to say.....there ain't nothing "free" about that ticket.  Dude paid for it many times over and just didn't realize it.
Yep, I'm a degenerate gambler.  But if the tickets were actually SELLING for cash, they wouldn't need to give out free tickets to fill up the venue.
Yes his timing was a huge part of his act because of the types of jokes he told. Timing is important for any comedian, but I feel especially so for Norm because of his material. He of course had it mastered. 

Joe Koy’s material wasn’t good to begin with, but his timing was painfully bad as well. I have no idea how this guy got this gig. lol
And just as important was his composure. Even when people didn’t laugh (which was often considering how he chose to present his material), Norm still seemed as though he was enjoying himself. He had nerves of steel to the point where bombing almost seemed like a badge of pride to him. It added a lot to his likability, so even if the audience didn’t like certain jokes it was easy for him to recover.
Jo Koy and Norm shouldn’t even be in the same conversation. It’s like saying “Well Me and Tiger Woods both play golf.”
That’s what makes him my favorite!
Seriously. Handled it like he had 15 open mics under his belt.
You got downvoted for saying the most lazy spammy comment known to reddit. Just use the upvote button
Sure a woman that bombed would be getting the same.  But that “shut up” is like an extreme level of rudeness that isn’t even being noted with him.  I betcha $20 it would be a headline if a woman said it.  We’ll never know!
Who are “you people”?

To answer your question, a huge side benefit is ruining the evening of “people like you” just by writing a few words.  I have SO MUCH power over you!  It’s crazy!  Why do you give me so much power??  :)  lol

PS I’ll be blocking you so any further effort from you will truly just be for your own enjoyment
O' mine.
“You weren’t focusing hard enough, let me start over from the beginning”
Filipinos aren't asian
That’s not what I said
Filipino-AMERICANS. Not surprising that people in the Philippines like him but most young Asian-Americans (and other children of immigrants) see jokes about accent and frankly race cringy post-2010.
It takes a level of charm to tell those types of jokes and get away with it. That’s the difference between a comedian and an asshole.
Maybe the word they're looking for is charisma. Gervais has it, Jo Koy doesn't. So even when he's roasting the audience, you can't help but think "Oh, there goes Ricky being Ricky."
He's a charming Brit the way he talks and smiles, not much else to say.
there's a charm in being a dickhead and he straddles that line pretty well
I actually enjoy watching the award shows and hoping that the actors and filmmakers who made something that moved me win an award.
Except for the fact that it is very corrupt
My take is they’re definitely outdated. I just can’t stand comedies with laugh tracks anymore. They were funny and in style for their time, but they don’t hold up to today’s standards.
That’s when you know it’s good. Made it 3 minutes tho. Story of my life.
A lot of Filipinos are nurses and many are huge fans of their fellow countryman.
That fucking comedian who's only famous from that story about him being "The Machine"
This happens with a lot of comedians. They are really funny at first so they usually stick to a lot of the jokes that work for them. Eventually that gets old though and people get tired of it to the point that it’s not funny anymore. Dane Cook was the same in my opinion I found him pretty funny and then the shit just got old.
He’s found his niche which I respect. Though I’m also Italian so I’m a little biased
> Hedberg, Carlin, Patrice, Burr, Pryor, Wright, Jeselnik, Norm, etc.

You ain't slick my man, we see you try to include Jeselnik in such a illustrious list of comedians.
Being a story teller that can make any words entertaining is a skill in and of itsself. Definitely not as focused on being crafty with the words themselves, to your point.
It was
He didn't, I don't think he even knew Margot Robbie was the lead character.
What was cringe about it?
I kinda laughed at all the jokes actually, but ya know, ima get downvoted for that shit lmao
Seemed like the audience was against him from the start.
Sorry to hear that. It sounds exhausting - I suppose I understand the cautiousness if you're immunocompromised or something similar.
This is the superior bot.
>He of course had it mastered.

Norm's timing and unique brand of cadence and delivery was pure gold.  He'd deliver a joke than wouldn't land, but he'd remain unfazed with a shit-eating grin on his face.  Loved the guy.
He handled it like the first time I was asked to lead prayer at an inurnment.
Ohhh that makes sense…my bad. And thanks for explaining
Idk what I expect coming into r/cringe 😭
Yes they are
“He made his ethnicity so much a part of his act that it was kinda racist in itself” implies he’s being racist to his own kind/himself. 

Don’t be coy (get it) you know what you said
So true. If you can't be charming, ya gotta be nice.
You're referring to charisma, not charm. A charming host warmly ensures their guests/audience are as comfortable as possible. This is not what Gervais' routines are trying to achieve. He, often to a fault, prides himself on challenging people/ideas and leaning on audience discomfort to get the laughs. A charming comedian gets people on their side. Gervais' doesn't care what side his audience are on, and that's what a large part of his popularity/brand is built on.

To use your own definition: there are plenty, plenty of people (especially in the UK) who think Gervais is in fact, an "asshole" because of this.
Can't stand Jo Koy..absolutely zero charisma
Yeah, I don't really get the overwhelming hate for award shows. I enjoy them...or at the least the concept. The execution has been awful lately. We don't care about bad jokes or long ass performances, just give out the awards.
It’s also basically the only place where the behind the scenes craftspeople like VFX artists and set designers and such get recognised. And they aren’t rich or famous
People say this so often… but I don’t think they realize some of their favorite shows have laugh tracks.
Who?
Aye put some respect on Burt, he would have at least done the introduction with his beer gut out on display 😂😂 and most of his comedy is about his dumb daughters if you watch any of the other Netflix specials. Not exactly unique, but enjoyable in its own way. Idk who Jo Koy is (I keep wanting to type Jo Koy instead lmao) but I don't think he should quit his day job
This was a funnier joke than what either of those comedians usually have.
Man, I thought his last two specials were strong.

Super clever dude when it comes to what I was talking about as far as crafting the joke vs. telling stories in a silly way. I think he's one of the sharpest guys working in that regard.
He isn't popular but he's got great jokes. The punchlines are usually really clever. He should have been more famous a decade or so ago.
Oh, for sure. It’s definitely its own thing. To me it’s just kind of like saying I prefer a singer/songwriter to a Pop star.
Would love the peace that must be your mind
Yeah, it wasn’t nearly as bad as people are saying. The audience seemed like they hated him from the very beginning and refused to laugh.
[deleted]
No it does not dude lol, it’s simply the use of any ethnicity as a selling point that I’m talking about. It doesn’t need to be “racist against ____” to be something less then admirable.

Look at people like Carlos Mencia who had a really shallow repertoire of jokes around his ethnicity, but man were they numerous. And his career did not last long, and a minute of research can show you a bunch of think pieces on why he was so damaging and arguably racist. Contrast that some one like Trevor Noah or Dave Chapelle or Bob Lang who frequently talk about their up brining, their race, their ethnic background, but are much more reflective and nuanced with the issues.

For example: he’s got one joke about the methods we humans have for making rice. Dumbing it down into “hahaha Filipino mom taught me to make rice with the knuckle method, the Filipino people know what I’m talking about” is just a weird unnecessary generalization that doesn’t even have a whole of accuracy. My dad taught me the knuckle method when I was like three, and he’s grossly white. where as my friend whos mom emigrated herself from the Philippines had no idea what he was talking about

Idk maybe that’s a bad example but his jokes that were centered around “how unique my experience is because of my background” is just…

You know what, I’ll just say this: it’s not funny. Maybe it’s not racist, but it sure ain’t an enlightened way of thinking and attacking comedy. It’s not innovative, it’s not new, it’s stale, reductive, and derivative to the point of making people tired of hearing someone just talk about how different they are over and over. Which could be a counterproductive thing for race relations over all. 

But hey idk shit, I’m just saying I think the guy’s done as much or more damage for Filipino culture (and specifically: everyone who wants to incorporate race into their sets) *before* he bombed then after.

Edit: you know what forget everything i said and read what u/Kuyacyph wrote above: “A lot of filipinos don't fw jo koy cause he makes being filipino the punchline of a joke instead of having genuine observations from within our culture. Compare his comedy to something like Rex Narette's SBC packer's bit where the humor is puns off of accent play that still presents a likable character that arguably is in on the joke”

Bam, way more concise then what I said
It takes charm to be charismatic. They are directly related to one another. I don’t know why you devolved this into a semantics argument, but fine, Gervais is charismatic
Yeah, watching Seth McFarlane's 2013 opening linked somewhere in this thread really shows how good they used to be. Over Christmas I watched a bunch of old Ed Sullivan episodes and it got me thinking about a certain spark that late-night, celebrity interview, musical performance based television used to have. Something we might never get back in the current landscape of entertainment.
I said anymore. I used to love Friends, HIMYM, at one point even Big Bang Theory. Like I said, it just feels outdated. I genuinely don’t watch anything with a laugh track anymore, the laugh track doesn’t dictate whether something is funny or not but I often find that it’s a good indicator of the quality of the comedy.
Brent Crystals. 

I mean Burnt Chrysler. 

I mean Burt Kreisher.
In my opinion, within that example, Sebastion would be Post Malone lol. Is definitely a pop star, is also a singer songwriter, and is very unproblematic.
Id certainly love an explanation instead of downvotes and whatever this was
lol now we’re just making crazy excuses for this guy? He did terrible so everyone must have decided beforehand not to laugh, clearly
Interesting - it's everything its cracked up to be for sure. I lived in NYC in April of 2020 and walked past refrigerator trailers full of bodies on my way to get groceries so I understand the fear for sure.

Like many people I'm more of a "ships are only safe in the harbor" person with it at this point, but that's also why I get every booster available and get a covid test if I'm sick - I don't want to be an outright asshole about it either.
He dumb

Don’t bother

>  something less then admirable.

look  
    
Did you mean to say "less than"?

Not reading that novel
What on earth do CHARm and CHARisma have in common other then the same 4 letter root of each word? It has nothing to do with his CHARacter. Just because words have the same words in them doesn't mean they are the same, next you'll be telling me DECIMATion and DECIMAL are related. It's actually about Ricky's CHARacteristics, not semantic.

/s
100% agree with you! I'd liken Sebastion's "flashiness" to Post's use of AutoTune. Not "wrong" by any means and can be quite an effective tool for their art. Where complacency, oversaturation, and reliance on the "trick" can be a real turnoff.

Then the other end of the spectrum, I'd see like a Jason Isbell.  Quiet production, lyrically focused, minimal tuning if any at all... but one plays arenas and one plays theaters. Not an indication of better or worse. One just reaches more folks.
*Whoosh*
Lmao, yeah you right. Fucker got me goin tho
Yeah you wouldn’t would you. You absolute mollusk.
What? Was it a reference I was supposed to be aware of?

Thats some liberal use of the whoosh my friend
You both sound like low IQ weasels

Lemme guess, big sports fan are ya?
Sure buddy
These "Calm down challenge" vids are so annoying and staged. Looks like the new "it's a prank bro" era! 
It's time to stop
jesus christ, there are over 500 million views on that video
I don't know what you're talking about and I'm glad. I want to keep it that way.
On second thought, you know what?  Let that comet hit us.
I get what you're saying and all but this particular one seems super staged lol
This garbage cannot end fast enough
Why is he doing the funny John Lennon walk
There's legit not a single iota of me that cares about the safety and wellbeing of these prank tossers. 
 
No matter what form that takes or the end result.
Nothing new about it, same exact guy has been doing these exact same videos with the exact same dance and song, all over the world for many years. It's brainrottingly stupid and repetitive, so it succeeds and makes him rich.
They’ve been annoying for a few years now
I just want Indian Jokar back..... Miss that dude.
In my country, if you do that you get shot in the face. 
Cringe yes. As shitty as "it's a prank bro" stuff. Nah. These are just cheesy staged videos that are likely mostly consumed by kids. No one is hurting anyone here. 

Just don't watch them.
I like how both cops immedietly reached for their guns lmao
Haaaah
Oh no! I cannot view it in my country. Shame.
I just hope it gets people beaten up and pepper sprayed.

Yes this comment is censored. I actually hope something different.
its staged
The song is actually a banger though.
It's insane how many people like these vids
people are just wildly stupid
Someone is bound to try to this on a US cop thinking it's real.
How far humanity has fallen...
All it takes is the ad revenue from one of these vids to buy you a decent bot farm for the rest of your vids.
when the hell is that tiktok ban going ot happen!?!?!
Definitely staged.  Nobody over the age of ten would be amused by this let alone cops on duty.
nah mate every police officer would immediately lose all suspicion and happily start smiling after seeing that afro
devil's advocate but nobody in the vid is trying to imply that it isn't staged. It is certainly cringe but not in the sense of trying to fool you into thinking it's real.
There's no risk, it's obviously staged.
There's literally no imagination to them, how people find them entertaining it's ridiculous.
Yeah nobody is trying to trick you into thinking this is real.
If only...
I know this as I clearly stated that in the title
I assume its a large portion of literal children under 12 and bots
But... you reposted the video, you help bring views to this garbage.
My brother has a successful company that basically sells novelty junk and gag gifts that people use (maybe) once then it collects dust in the attic. I asked him how he is so successful. His response—“no one ever failed by underestimating the intelligence of the masses.”
"These" is a collective term in this context - not these particular, these as in pranksters as a whole. Apologies, though, as that wasn't clear.
haha oops sorry
I take public transport regularly and let me tell you that fully grown adults watch idiotic videos all day on their phones (often at full volume, with no headphones on).
I posted one video, if anyone decides to watch the others that's on them not me
Did you clap after he said that?
Grown up children. We live in an Idiocracy Documentary.
No one uses big words around you?
I think I nodded and threw him another beer. 40 year old CEOs actually do talk like that in a private setting.

I like swimming in real life, so I should have so much fun with swimming in New Atlantis lake, right? Just swim in circles for hours and enjoy adventure :D

What would you call running into the same mine, research outpost and cryo lab over and over again? Because I probably would call that pretty boring. Can guarantee you if the Astronauts who went to the moon found several McDonalds up there it would have ruined the excitement of their trip too.
Disregarding the AI responses…how embarrassing as a AAA studio to stoop to sending positive PR dev messages to peoples opinions online. Are you kidding me?
Don’t they understand that being in literal space is different from watching it after a load screen on a 2D screen knowing it’s procgen so there will not be anything interesting.

It’s like saying climbing mountains isn’t boring. Well yeah it isn’t in real life, in a 2D screen it might be.
You can never play Starfield your way because your way is wrong. This is literally seen by any moral choice you can make.

Example: I critiqued Cowboy dude for taking his daughter on ships that go on dangerous missions, not only did Sarah and him dislike what I've said, I couldn't even double down on it properly only for having an "apology" option instead. Yeah no I'm not sorry for pointing out bad parenting.

Or don't get me started on the drug smuggling quest where you can never fully reject the drug dealer.

The characters are all bland with basically the same moral compass. The quests are either unrealistic or watered down with no real options. It's soulless and the whole pg thing, not only in terms of sexual content but gore wise, kills the immersion that it desperately needs.
“some of starfield’s planets are meant to be empty by design - but that’s not boring. “When the astronauts went to the moon, there was nothing there. They certainly weren’t bored.” 

has so much meme potential. What a stupid way of defending your game lol
LOL

Like Starfield, these 4 messages are all 90% the same.

They proc-gen'd the messages....lol
Resources that I need for what exactly?

Outposts that I need for what exactly?

Ships that I need for what exactly?
This sounds like the launch of FO76.  "the world is meant to be empty so players can...build their own economy and settlements" etc.
Imagine how stupid you have to be to tell your customers that what they're playing isn't boring because that's what space is really like.

I mean yeah, no shit. Do they think I'm playing a game to do anything but be entertained? If I wanted to be bored then I'd go and do something boring. What a dumb thing for them to say.

Starfield was fun while it lasted but it's a game that to me ended up feeling like a time sink just doing the same thing. There's nothing wrong with people loving it or hating it but it's pretty stupid for a developer to start telling people their opinion is wrong.
Something that is boring in real life doesn't justify something being boring in a video game.
Can someone explain to me what the purpose of smuggling is? If I find contraband, I just fly to The Den and sell it. What would be my benefit in trying to smuggle the contraband past the scanners on other planets? What is the reward for the risk?
"Yes we hear you players, but have you considered your opinions on our game is wrong? We have deemed it not boring."
Astronauts weren't bored because they were the first to land on the Moon and because of all the preparation, effort and thrill that took them there. In starfield all planets are already explored by humans, because they have structures.

And instead of journey and thrill you have a loading screen. There is nothing mysterious or dangerous about space in starfield. You know what you will find on every planet in advance. It's the same rocky plains of different color and "abandoned whatever"

BORING
Starfield is a failed experiment. No matter how much they try to explain to us that we are just not getting it.
The astronauts weren't bored because

1) They weren't going into the exact same building fighting the exact same pirates 43 times a day, and

2) THEY WERE ACTUALLY FECKING ON THE MOON.
"Feel free to leave feedback, just not where anyone might hear you. Here is this website"
Responding to reviews is kind of cringe.
I have no problem with this other than the second one which seems to be a bit of a lie/exaggeration. 

Can anyone confirm that if you create a second character who is polar opposite to your first, “almost every quest” is different? Seems to me that you get a slightly different dialogue every now and then with mostly the same results. 

I suppose there’s quests with around 3 options like using hacking and stealth, speech or straight up shooting but normally the same ending. 


Mass effect would be your example for different choices changing the story, and it even carries over over 3 games!
Bethesda is never shaking the meme that they they're both out of touch with their community and that they don't play their own games.
Wow that first one is very condescending talking to people like they are 5 year olds who have never played a game before let alone an open world RPG.

They basically said "Awww you are bored, well little buddy did you know that there are in fact these things called side quests and you can do them, oh and i know you find things hard so ill also let you know that you can actually build a starship in our game, thats right your very own ship and further to the ship, get this, you can build an outpost, thats right your very own outpost on an other wise empty planet but oh no dont mistake empty lifeless planets as boring becuase in real life the empty moon wasnt boring for the astronauts, now run along like a good little boy and stop acting like our game is bad when its you who doesnt know how to play it."
The comparison to the actual astronauts when they landed on the moon irks me to no end.    
They were literally the first human beings to put their feet on a celestial body that wasn't earth. They had objectives and tasks and samples to collect. They were also real people risking their actual lives doing something no one had done before.   

Compare all this to Starfield. There's barely any planets which don't have a human made structure on them. There's really no sense that you're the first person to do anything in game. When you get onto a new planet, you *could* tediously scan rocks, animals, and plants, but there's no actual reward for doing so.   

And to top it off, spend one real time hour on a planet and congratulations, you've matched in game hours to how long the first astronauts were on the moon. Spend about 3.5 real time hours and you've matched the longest stay on the actual moon.
How the fuck can they say that about loading screens when star citizen and cyberpunk don't have loading screens
Damn that's arrogant af
Oh so they are still doing that thing where they tell us it's a great game instead of proving to us that it is? This is so fucked up, I wonder how far they have to fall before they'll admit that they should have done more with the game. Probably not very far because it seems they have tricked just enough people into thinking it's a great game.

Imagine having this much ego about yourself, when most of your biggest fans, including most of the tenured ones, are not happy. And all you have to say is - you're playing it wrong. 

Also, The only reason they told people that it takes a while to get into the game and so they could get past the 2-hour return window from the game stores.
They made the game boring by design. Okay cool.
I read the name as Bethesda_Karen
Did they just compare the experience of making the actual first steps on the actual moon to exploring a Bethesda generated empty planet?
lmao „just play it better“
I’m disliking Bethesda more as time grows sadly
Bethesda, I did more in a single day playing Skyrim than I did in a single day playing Starfield.  


Something is wrong at your studio.
Have those replies been written by AI or penned by a faceless corporate entity.

How to call your customers idiots without calling them idiots.
Pathetic ass billion dollar company
So the game has empty worlds because it's a space simulator, but when it comes to the lack of manual landing and take-off, it's no longer a space simulator... Seems legit.
The way BGS is responding to reviews on Steam, is extremely cringe.
A dev teaching me that their game isn't boring is peak AAA game factory bullshit
No. It's the gamers who are wrong
I’ve been a Starfield defender but this is indefensibly cringe behavior by Bethesda. They are above this
“That’s not boring”
It's so tacky and desperate. 

LIKE OUR GAME, PLEASE
No, Bethesda. Empty planets are boring.

Procgen in these amounts is boring.

Your game is boring, I'm sorry.
I think the StarEngine video release the other day was directly aimed at Starfield. 

The whole “let’s go in and out of cities and travel light years and dive through a cave and stroke a panda without any loading screens” and the “look we can go to that planet and just fly down there” (paraphrasing)

Kudos to them tho
I picked Skyrim back up and started a new game, after putting about 80 hours into Starfield, which in my opinion is a good game. Starfield is not a bad game by any stretch. 

But I’m about 30 hours into Skyrim and have barely touched the main quest. It encourages you to explore. To go see that cave that’s on the map. Because it may be a small cave with not a lot to do, or it may be a massive expanse that takes you hours to do, but still has zero relevance on the game. 

Outside of the main quest in Starfield, there is no reason to explore. You don’t have the chance of finding something truly different, or a quest that you just happened to stumble upon (aside from go help this miner). You won’t stumble upon a list civilization, or a huge city that serves no main story purpose but allows you to immerse yourself. No humanoid alien species. Nothing different and exciting and rewarding. It’s a very binary experience.
“We purposefully made a bunch of the planets empty and dull, like real space”      Okay? It’s a poor concept and boring.    I’m playing a video game to escape the boredom and monotony of the real world.   Having an explanation for a bad idea doesn’t make it not a bad idea.
Bethesda: "Just play a different character" 

Me: Ok, I want my next character to solve all their problems with violence and kill people who get in their way. I can do that, right? 

Bethesda: "...."
They just cannot accept that this game missed the mark. It just does not have the same magic as elder scrolls or fallout. 

Really makes me worried for the next installments of those games…
I really hate that “going to the moon wasn’t boring” line. It is such absolute BS. When our scientists went to the moon they were doing what hadn’t been done before and were conducting scientific experiments that the environment allowed them to perform for the first time in the history of our species. When we go to a barren moon we step out of our spaceships open the scanner  and press 2 buttons to tag the 2 resources the entire thing is made of and get back in our ship for another loading screen. Those empty worlds are boring because unlike those astronauts there isn’t anything for us to do there.
This is honestly pathetic
Yikes.
i think it has been discussed plenty, that its ok that planets are sometimes dead. pitty that also the planets WITH LIFE are dead, sterile and meaningless. Side missions lack depth and due to no unique POIs exploration gets dull, seeing outpost #4, next to rock #256 and rock #879 on planet surface rock\_barren #1 is not enough. 

you can throw as much nice words around as you can...in the end its bad design. a game is supposed to be fun. a openworld is supposed to give you the feeling of being free. a RPG should be immersive. and Exploration shouldnt be loading screens.  


whom are they trying to fool with that corporate answer bullshit.....
Lmao. Absolute dogshit company.
This is some EA level BS. 

Feels a lot like 
>The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes.
 Want a sandbox game. No content, just sand in a box. Kthnxbye.
That’s just downright embarrassing imo
Bethesda's fall has been a slow decline since FO4, but this just feels like they're intentionally jumping off the cliff now.
Copy paste game, copy paste developers. Fitting.
.... They want you to feel small..... I'm paying for a game, fill that motherfucker up.
Empty planets aren't boring, only boring people get bored - Bethesda
To all the people going "how can they not realize a game isn't the same as real life?" They do, they just think their fans are incredibly stupid and will eat up whatever bullshit they spew. It's been working so far.
Tbh when I heard this game was coming out I was excited. I bought an Xbox to play the game something I’ve never done before. I had visions of no mans sky game with beautiful graphics and amazing storyline and infinite possibilities. Visiting planets discovering planets looking amazing no one ever visited. Naming your own planets on the web. Dogfights and using a rover to drive over planets. Endless possibilities
Starfield got it half right. It should take notes from no man sky. Hell bloody hire the team if can. I feel I’ve wasted my money with the constant glitches and screw ups. It feels like half a game.  May they will bring out a dlc that changes everything but Bethesda being them will charge the price of another starfield. Disappointed doesn’t cover it
The word exploration just needs to be stopped being used in describing Starfield.  Fast travelling is not exploring. There are some moments of exploration in interior locations, but its very minimal. But exterior areas just don't offer enough to experience the fun in exploration. The lack of hand- crafted level design leaves the player with no surprise and mystery of what lies beyond the horizon. The best part of the franchise earlier titles such as Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim was the world. The number of planets makes little difference if they don't offer enough exploration fans expect and love from your previous games.
The “astronauts didn’t get bored in space” is like saying “This World War 2 shooter is not fun. You think the soldiers were having fun in The Invasions of Normandy?”
That's a lie though. There are no empty planets by design. I can go to the far end of the galaxy, to some isolated moon so far away from civilization that you need two jumps, and there's five ships landing and dozens of facilities everywhere.

I'd have PREFERRED empty planets.
Comparing playing a video game to landing on the fucking moon has got to be one of the most ridiculous takes I’ve ever seen
While they compared real life planet is empty like moon,l or mars. Yes it is but they forgot they are videogames not just a simulator.
Them writing off opinions makes me lose hope for their future games. They’re basically saying “we’re making what we want not what any of you fans want”. Hopefully these are just dumb customer support staff and the developers are actually taking the feedback.
Everyone here including the mods told me to ignore reviews

get your talking points in order mods, don't you want that money

p.s. bg3 is coming out with 80 bucks for a box set and they found out the issue with act 3 (each red/stolen item you stole was getting checked by DM for the entirety of the game) and the fix is coming this week

it's not even a dlc
This feels weird. I would expect this from a sad indie developer not Bethesda. Not a good look.
Thing is bro, this is not real life. It's a game where players want to enjoy it's content not it's empty space.
NOOO BETHESDA THIS ISNT HOW YOU REPOND TO CRITICISM 

*paired with the pic of Walter White screaming from the car*
Did, did this mofo just compared a shitty game to the fucking moon landing?
This is pathetically hilarious
I mean, I get the intention behind the idea of universe being mostly empty and the player feeling small because of it, but I don't think that Starfield manages to accomplish that goal successfully.

Elite Dangerous did, because it was actually presented in a appropriate scale and the planets that you can land on are actually mostly empty, which reinforces the idea of absolute loneliness in the vast void of space. There was also a strong adherence to realism in that game and you couldn't just screw around when the only thing protecting you from the vacuum was a few inches of glass and a space suit. It's a very humbling experience to come up on a planet or a moon that looks like a tiny spot on your ship's canopy only for it to become progressively larger until it fills your entire field of view, and when you finally stand on its surface it feels absolutely gigantic.

Starfield has none of that because all you do is to click on a planet and watch a short animation of landing, and the surfaces of the planets are anything but empty. In fact, the density of man-made structures per square kilometre is almost comically large, because for every tiny square of the planet's surface that you land on, there's like half a dozen human bases all around you. The feeling that this creates is the exact opposite of loneliness because humans are literally everywhere in this universe, and you can't go to a place that wasn't already explored and settled. When I go to a remote system and land on some nameless icy moon, the last thing I wanna see is some crappy shack with a couple of people walking around it aimlessly, and with a table standing outside with some snacks and drinks strewn across it, as if someone was having a picnic... in a complete vacuum and sub-zero temperatures, lol.
Oh god, these responses are as half-baked as the original reviewers are saying the game is, what an ironic shame.
I like to run, so I should be happy I can go on a jog through empty terrain in space right?

I like the game, but their community manager is terrible.
Justifying bad design does not make it any less bad.
I just left them a bad review on steam, hopefully I get a response soon 🤞
Just take the L  lol. This is really sad.
Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle
Starfield was a demo. Boring, lacking content, huge studio and huge budgets.

After Starfield I played Robocop: Rogue City, my god! What a difference! Tiny team, tiny budget, and incredible non stop fun and varied missions.
Hard to evoke any other feelings then boredom when I'm sitting in load screens and fast travelling.
I was so excited for Starfield but I knew after the Fallout 76 fiasco that I needed to curb my expectations. I’ve beaten the game already. I spent a fair amount of time just exploring with no set objective. The scanning of plants and animals is so effing tedious I couldn’t take it. I’ve been playing Skyrim the last few days and even the random dialogue in that game has more feeling and depth to it than any of the conversations I had in Starfield. What the heck happened during the 7 years this game was in development? How do you go backwards in almost every way except for graphically?
If BGS spent this much time on improving the game, opposed to gaslighting us, they wouldn't have a 'mixed' review. BGS has a high bar to live up to. Or should we lower our standards for what is supposed to be a AAA title?
Starfield is a huge disappointment and they're only making it worse by trying to justify it. They need big changes, like what no man sky did.. but Idk if they will. Remember when they released full games and only needed to add DLC? Now they will try and sell us the actualy full game as DLC
It's not 'Barren' because the worlds are empty, it's 'Lifeless' because of all the things that break the illusion that you are exploring a 'real' place. The repetative elements are the cheif offenders here (such as repeat POIs & flora and fauna); but other things like the lack of a schedule for NPCs, the lack-luster Proc-Gen enviroments, Outposts being almost pointless, the shear wierdness of water, yes, even the loading screens. I could go on.

The game is determined not to let you forget that you are playing a game, not for a second, not even a little bit.
They have a ton of modular building blocks, they could easily make procedurally generated stations

They could have giant flagships that spawn in orbits as an encounter that you can interact with

They could have put a single bit of more effort into the planets to make them not borderline worthless to visit

They could have done so much and they decided that 1000 planets with nothing was the best play. Even the planets with things on them feel limited. The moment you leave the area of a city or settlement, there’s nothing worth seeing or exploring. Why even continue to explore when there are only like 12 copy and pasted structures that spawn 600 times per planet? 

Starfield is a 10 year old game released 10 years too late with mechanics, presentation, and quality from a triple A game I’d expect 20 years ago. 

That being said I have like 120 hours in it so I enjoyed my time before I finished everything but holy shit Todd took 5 steps backward with this game
>The intention of Starfield's exploration

I'm sorry but if a Dev has to explain this in the comments of a negative review, you've done something wrong, BGS.

> Try creating different characters

To explore your braindead wasteland? nah bro
Are these PR peeps not familiar with their own game?
"When the astronauts went to space they weren't bored" 

This is Bethesda's "don't you have phones?!" moment.
Imagine having the nerve to argue with your customers, lol.

Todd, it's not debatable, we're telling you how it is. If you don't like it, do better.

Dude obviously forgot he was running an entertainment company.
Bethesda responses as repetitive as their quests.
Players: the game is boring

BGS: no it's not

*And thus the game was not boring anymore.*
Loading screens for the empty worlds, that are expansive, yet walking for a couple of minutes and you reach the border.
Nah man there’s no way this is anything other than a PR stunt. There’s no fucking way that a company composed of game developers and people who sell games, among others, actually earnestly in their heart believe that playing Starfield is in any way remotely close to going to the Moon for the first time in human history. Legitimately one of the stupidest things I have ever heard and I work in a psych ward.
How do they justify the 20 poi dungeons being carbon copied on every world?
All they had to do was make a universe worth exploring. Morrowind, oblivion, fallout 3, Skyrim, fallout 4 and *even fallout 76* all have extremely fun and varied open worlds to explore. Starfield simply doesn’t. That’s why it fails.
This is a classic “we put all our eggs in this basket and we really need you to just enjoy the game because we’re fucked if you don’t” kind of thing.
Can't believe they are out here seriously trying to compare an empty boring planet in a video game, with *actually* going to the moon. Those things are not in the same weight class Bethesda. Shit they aren't even playing the same sport! One is like playing in the world cup, or competing in a title fight in a combat sport, and the other one (the one Bethesda is defending) is like a game of friggin checkers with your 7 year old nephew.
I love Starfield. I've loved the majority of BGS games.  


This is horrifically corporate and cringe inducing. There are plenty of valid criticisms and they should be listening and aiming to improve the game based on that feedback ala Larian.
Lol the excuse for the loading screens. Um, RDR2 and Cyberpunk2077 would like to have a word with you. Quite literally they have very small loading times and are smooth af when it gets into cut scenes. Just means BGS is still developing games like it's 2008. 

The f they on that their game is so massive that they need loading screens. 75% of the planets all have the same cave builds and same layouts. If you've been to 1 science lab, you've been to them all because nothing changes besides the levels of the enemy. 90% of the planets aren't worth exploring because there is quite literally nothing going on.
*BGS giving ChatGPT the prompt and how to respond, then answering bad reviews with it.
Are there empty planets? Feels like every rock I've landed on has at least 3 bases in the vicinity (regardless of where I land), often with a random ship just landing nearby. There's so much activity that it feels immersion breaking.
Bethesda comparing starfield to a real feat of engineering and progress for our species is wild
"There are so many things to do!" Well, yeah, but it's all repetitive, boring AF, and poorly designed so much that it feels half-assed..
Snorefield
comparing going to the real moon to a game moon is so dumb
I generally don't mind the game but these responses are pathetic.  Is this what Bethesda would rather spend their money asking their teams to do?  Even if it's an AI that writes them surely you had to spend time teaching that AI.

Bethesda, wouldn't it be more valuable to ask the development team to either work on bettering the game or work on the next game?  These replies seem a waste even if they were accurate, which they are not.
Pathetic. Making excuses for their own incompetence
"Our game isn't bad, you just don't get it"

Yeah this will go over greaaaat
Three second loading screen my ass
I am a real Dev and definitely not an AI, starfield is great you're just playing it wrong silly gamer.

 Bethesda is so pathetic lol
Yeah the problem is they took something that should be cool and full of wonders (space!) and made it boring as fuck.
Lmao who approved them to do this?
Embarrassing behavior honestly.
We wanted our shitty game to be barren because that's how the moon landing was! Duh!!!
"As developers, our opinions matter more than the opinions of those who play our games."

TLDR
If i had to fill 125gb of space id rather have modded oblivion, skyrim, fo3,fnv and fo4
It's funny how they repeated that dumb take about the astronauts word for word after it received so much backlash the first time. Bethesda is brain dead and tone deaf now.
What a pathetic look for Bethesda. People have genuine and relevant criticisms of a AAA game and their esponse is to be like "nuh uh, you are wrong, see this quote from one of our deva that we think is wonderfully insightful and powerful but is actually irrelevant drivel."

The  Apollo Astronauts were creating history and breaking humanities barriers in indescribably meaningful ways... I am sitting on my couch in my boxers eating chips and drinking a beer playing this game after sitting at a meaningless office job all day... What the fuck are you talking about.
"Starfield has hundreds of hours of quests to complete".

Where are these quests hiding? I did everything there was to see and do in about 80 hours - now, that's not bad by any stretch of the imagination but let's not pretend there's "hundreds of hours" of quests.

New Game + doesn't fix anything for this - joining the pirates on one game and then the UC on the next doesn't make that content magically 20 different storylines - it's still the same questline. Don't pretend starting a new game + is going to unlock hours and hours of new content, because all it does is reset progress to 0 while keeping the bare minimum
all i know is that the new elder scrolls game is going to flop. yikes
Beyond pathetic
It was immediately weird to me that they would remove the ability to loot everything off a body like in Skyrim and fallout. And the fact I can loot a space suit off someone and their jump pack but it still stays on their dead body model is so backwards of them. Oblivion looting was more realistic
Me: this game is boring.
Bethesda: nuh uh! 
Me: yuh huh!
If you have to say “but that’s not boring” to your players, you’re doing it wrong.
tHaT’s WhAt We WeRe gOiNg FoR has been their response all along to players feeling *empty* in both the worlds and their interactions with NPCs, buildings (windows not lit at night), missions, etc. 

They failed hard af, and like nearly everyone else who fails that hard these days ~~doesn’t~~ don’t accept accountability but rather they, “Double down.”
The whole "astronauts went to the moon when nothing was there and they weren't bored" is the most disgusting and delusional retort to why a game was designed the way it is; I feel that's probably severely worse than anything I've ever heard from even Bungie's hollow promises.

Astronauts on the moon have a completely different experience in low G than someone sitting on a chair in front of a screen with a controller in their hands in 1 G. 

Bethesda must be giving their employees hard drugs if they are reporting experiencing weightlessness while playing Starfield and should probably be investigated by the DEA if these are the claims they stand by.
Is this written by AI? Kinda feels like it. 🤔
BGS: "we know what gamers want"

Gamers: "we don't want big empty spaces in an exploration game" 

BGS: "please agree with us"
This is a whole new level of pathetic lmao
I hate the "astronauts on the moon" quote they keep fucking using. It's literally just an excuse to be lazy.
Now they're even trying to gaslight players, saying "actually it's fun you're just thinking about it wrong"
The whole game feels like it was designed and written by the least fun people.  There’s no prose or voice.  It feels so artificial and corporate polished.
“please play over 2 hours so you can’t refund”
"Loading screens between fast traveling"

There's loading screens when entering or exiting my ship. There's a loading screen when taking the Cydonia elevator between the 1st and 3rd (what is there to load? It's the same area!). There's loading screens after docking and before undocking when the long animation could play while the loading happens in the background. Granted running on an SSD makes these load screens shorter, but FO4 and ES5 both run well on an HDD and are only marginally slower, not to mention fewer loading screens than this game has on an SSD.

There are tons of expansive games that do background loading to eliminate loading screens. 
- Loading screens are almost nonexistent in Elite Dangerous, plus nothing stops you from circumnavigating a planet or moon aside from a stuck SRV. Starfield just makes a procedurally generated bubble when you land.

I'm sure everyone else here knows of a game that loads in more than Starfield without obtuse loading screens.

I don't hate the game, I enjoy it. But there are always things that sap that enjoyment.
Not a good look.
Games are 100% made to played a certain way -- shooting behind cover whilst standing still in DOOM eternal and see how much fun you have.

But more often than not games push you to play that way -- just like DOOM eternal which forces you to move around. People are playing Starfield the way it should, it's just that some of those ideas they tried didn't work the best, and aspects of their game design need to to reevaluated.

I hope this isn't representative of how the devs and BGS in general (probably a pr thing tbh) because I genuinely hope they address these issues in ES6 -- I don't think things like empty space will be a problem though considering it'll be back to a traditional landmass.

Some problems with this game are only problems with Starfield -- like the choice to scatter content on a different planets and make you navigate menus instead of actually exploring. However other issues are more reoccurring ones, which include everything from game design to performance issues.

I hope they learn from the criticism and implement it in ES6 , because that game can't be just "alright", "ok" and maybe even "good". It has to be the best game they've ever made as it's one of the most anticipated games ever.
imagine bargaining for better reviews lol
The scary thing is that they've been planning/working on this game for freakin' eternity and it's still bland as hell. Just give me a new Elder Scrolls game before I die of old age, instead of all these games that nobody asked for.
At this point I have no hope for the next elder scrolls game. It will.have to be saved by mods. Bethesda has really fallen off.
LMAO 'but that's not boring'.

No, you're not bored, you're just playing the game wrong!
This game feels so much like Bioware's Anthem, to where I'm wondering how much of the 7+ year development was chopped up and modulated to create this "finished" product. This feels like a rush job from about when Microsoft bought them, maybe a bit before. So much repetitive gameplay to pad out stuff they couldn't finish in time and had to cut. Because if this is actually the product of a long thought out development.......oh boy, ES6 is gonna SUUUUUUUCK....
"The thing everyone is complaining is boring isn't boring!" I can't even fathom the hubris behind that statement.

I'm pretty sure they pre-generated these responses before the game even released because they knew exactly what the complaints were gonna be.
I bought the game and stopped playing it after about 8 hours. It’s just so…. unremarkable.
That moon thing is such BS; like you can’t be bored when you’re inches from space death 24/7 irl. This is a video game. Fucking walking a high ropes course is exciting IRL, in a game it would be fucking dull.
“when astronauts landed on the moon, they weren’t bored” LOL that’s something
Hey if you dont like playing the game just try to play it. 

Warm regards
This is quite sad. 

I do not envy whoever was asked to do this for BGS.
There's nothing there but that's not boring.
Well okay then, my bad.
I mistakenly thought the game was devoid of life and interesting things to do but obviously I misunderstood.
Neil and Buzz only visited one empty planet.
Exactly, in person after however long preparation & what not. 

Its not the same as us regular ppl sitting in front of a screen in a room 🤣
not only that but they had SUPER busy schedules doing actual science.  We didnt send them to the moon to just laze about for a few days before coming home.

And because it was real even the most mundane things were new, intersting, and beneficial.

Do the Starfield empty planets even have things to do like scan unique things for "science points" or whatever system they use?
BGS likes to throw out "it's a simulator!" As an excuse, up until the point you start pointing out how it's not a very good simulator. Then it's all "No it's a game, it needs to be fun!" 

Can't have your cake and eat it too, Todd. You made a bland game and a bad simulator. The game succeeds at neither because it can't decide what it wants to be. Too shallow to be a good game, too gamified to be a good simulator.
Pretty great excuse for them just being lazy with planet design
That comment came off a bit salty imo

Like I know they're trying to "evoke the feeling of grandeur, and how small we really are".

The astronauts that went on the Moon probably felt that way too.

But they probably wouldn't sitting in front of a screen
I'm not actually walking on any of these fucking planets, *Todd*
That is a BOLD hill to die on

"Our procedurally generated emptiness is just as engrossing as the sensation of actually walking on the moon!"
Exactly. They were literally in survival mode. Unfortunately real emptiness does not equal virtual emptiness. Video games have to work very hard to make emptiness palatable due to the fact that there are no constraints on the player. I think Starfield will always be remembered because they went all out on a hybrid between open world procedural element aspect with an RPG only to find that it simply does not work. Everything has to be curated to maintain the player base's interest.
Every time I go hiking I get so bored because there aren't any secret bases for me to explore.
Yeah lol, I can't believe a human actually compared playing a video game to really going to space... Has to be (bad) AI answers
In real life I can dive underwater, even use scuba equipment if I want.
The problem is Bethesda asserting that the surrealness and realism of planet exploration should be the selling point but actually NOTHING else in the game tries to support this game direction.

They think this 'planet realism' is what they're doing, yet we have copy-paste POIs everywhere, ships landing everywhere, and we're expected to run 100 football fields across just to reach a POI while the player can only sprint or walk like a tortoise. They also stripped all realism in terms of survival, NPC immersion and scale of settlements, yet here they are pretending like this whole empty planet thing is meant to feel realistic?

IDK what the fuck is going on with Bethesda but whoever is their main game designers need to be fucking let go
This, exactly, is the issue with the Bethesda argument in those replies to the reviews. 

I just hope that the don’t fall into the same trap that Creative Assembly fell into and further put the fault on the player. 

You need to do some serious mental acrobatics and go down the rabbit hole of logical fallacy to arrive at the point that the player is at fault for not enjoying the game.

TBH I love Starfield, but it does leave a lot to be desired and BG3 and the last CP2077  patch have shown the gaming community that listening to community feedback can be excellent for business.
"The astronauts weren't bored on the moon" 

Yeah because, you know, they were actually on the fcking moon. 

They got launched skywards blasting out serious g-forces in jet-fuel inferno inside a world class engineered rocket, experiencing body-bending forces and breaking through the Earth's atmosphere. 

Yeah, that sounds pretty exciting to me. 

But they aren't doing what we're doing. 
They didn't go all the way up there, whip out a laptop and play Starfield. 

Us? We're sitting in a room at a cheap ikea desk covered in doritos playing this absolute scam of a cash-grab game. There's nothing fun about walking in empty terrain in a game. 

It's like they opened up their game engine. 

File > Load > Preload Empty Terrain... 
and Bethesda thought "Nice, we'll leave it at that". 

Also such a stupid argument by them. They put magic/powers in the game. So immediately - they remove any connotation or relation to real life examples. 
It's like if they tried comparing Skyrim to normal life. Absolutely pointless argument.
Except for when it's late at night and I just want to shoot something. Can't find a single goddamn spacer then.
Yeah and you have like 5 different types max always repeating on dif planets.
That’s a big criticism of mine, there are zero planets untainted by humanity. They’re all are covered in little settlements.

I want to be the first to visit a solar system, one with zero human settlements or even space random encounters. Be the first to walk on a planet or moon.

It’s really weird to me Bethesda never even considered doing that? They made a big space exploration game but didn’t think about giving players the opportunity to do one of the coolest things a space explorer could do…

Edit: please provide examples of planets without structures. A lot of you are saying there are some, but I just double checked the last few high level systems I’ve explored and didn’t find that to be the case.

Edit 2: I’m wrong! Sorry guys, just ignore this post lol.
This pissed me off tbh, there are always outposts EVERYWHERE, and not only are they copy and paste but I was genuinely looking for empty planets to find and claim one as my own, to build outposts on and I literally couldn't. 

You never get the feel of exploring the unknown and to actually be where no human stood before.

Everything is just so soulless and generic, it's painful.
And no compass, no map no vehicles .... For an exploration game ...
It's not us, it's you. Seems to be a trend among entertainment industry nowadays.
The Virgin "you're playing it wrong/upgrade your PC" Bethesda vs The Chad "we read negative reviews so we know what to fix first" Larian Studios
The astronauts weren't boredd why are you?
Lmao ik. What kind of developer tells you to check the discord for suggestions on what to do in their boring ass game. Bethesda fumbled the bag hard on this one.
Surprised they havent said "don't you guys have phones".
(Overly) scripted path of being the "good guy" aside, it's the proc gen that's really affecting it for me. A core set of crafted planets with unique experiences should have been developed, with proc gen reserved for an unexplored fog of war "here be dragons" outside of settled systems. Lost contact during the war or "Freestar tried to settle, never heard from again" could be the rationale. There's just no actual exploration to do al a NMS.
"waiter , there is a turd on my plate next to the steak i ordered "   


"Oh sir, thats a non-edible garnish, you aren't supposed to eat that, in this restaurant all meals are served with a fresh steamer, its for ambience"   


"thats disgusting i don't want a turd on my plate"  


"Sir, you're clearly eating it wrong, perhaps you'd like a different dish, with the soup the turd floats quite delightfully like a little ship"
I really wish they did fewer curated planets instead of trying to randomly generate content on a ton of them. 

I'm *fine* with a barren moon having fuck all on it but some minerals etc. But I shouldn't recognize human facilities down to the abandoned notes in multiple systems. 

Let the empty be empty and make what's developed feel fleshed out. 

What's really maddening is that many unique locations are done so well: Legacy's dress setting was so damned perfect. So it's not like they're not capable.
Um I think you mean “Abandoned” McDonald’s
[deleted]
I find it hilarious, they’re so fucking bizarre and so fun to read
It's really pathetic and depressing.

It's the first Bethesda game I dropped in less than 20 hours. I probably played thousands of hours collectively between Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, and Fallout 4 (though probably more in Fallout NV and I'm not crediting Bethesda with the brilliance of that one).
>Don’t they understand

There's a disconnect between what they understand and what they can say publicly or officially.

Death Stranding exists. I don't think quite so many people hated it.
Seriously. By Bethesda logic Battlefield is a bad game because playing a few rounds doesn't leave me with a lifetime of night terrors, addiction issues, fear of loud noises, and interpersonal difficulties.
Don’t get me started on that 200 year old space ship one. My options are 1: gather resources myself, 2: force them into slavery, or 3: blow them up, but I cant just shoot them. And I’m not allowed to shoot the CEO who’s trying to enslave them. It’s genius design like that that made me quit after I beat the main story.
Yeah the writing is by far the most disappointing part for me. I can actually live with the loading screens and I find lots of the mechanics fun (shipbuilding in particular) but the world and characters are just *so bad*.

None of the characters were all that memorable (a shame, since Bethesda got their best acting in this game). There's barely any worldbuilding to go on beyond genre tropes--space marines, firefly cowboys, cyberpunk setting shameless enough to call itself "neon". Comparing Starfield's setting to something as rich as TES or Mass Effect is just a bummer.
Sam Coe is the worst, but I've started to call the Main Four 'four shades of lipstick on the same pig'. Because at the end of the day, that's what they are.
The hands down funniest "PG" aspect of the game to me was that if you use aurora once you get addicted. Like.........what?? Even Sam Coe who never shuts up about his crazy nights on Neon is like "woah, you took it too far" AFTER ONE TIME??!??
This is why I got it on GamePass. It was so hyped, no one would accept anyone having any reservations, but I wanted to try it before I shelled out 60+ USD.

Sadly I cancelled my sub within the month and can’t play it anymore but it wasn’t worth full price (to me at least).
i finished everything I wanted to do in Starfield recently, and went back to Fallout 4 and god damn it's just way more fun. Fallout 4 does almost everything Starfield does but better
>It's soulless and the whole pg thing, not only in terms of sexual content but gore wise, kills the immersion that it desperately needs.

in an era where gaming is trying to be more and more adult Bethesda deciding to sprint back to the 50s is just *bizarre.*

you dont even see shit like skirts. Apparently in the future fashion is not only dead its been tortured and murdered.

skyrim had *outright decapitations* ffs.
>I critiqued Cowboy dude for taking his daughter on ships that go on dangerous missions, not only did Sarah and him dislike what I've said, I couldn't even double down on it properly only for having an "apology" option instead. Yeah no I'm not sorry for pointing out bad parenting.

Your choices dont matter. none of them do.
What on earth were they thinking by responding to these reviews, especially since the game has been out for months.

I guess they want to clean up the Steam reviews for holiday sales?
Bro they even copied and pasted the quotes around that moon landing thing from the email where their boss instructed them on how to respond to complaints about boredom.
I imagine they had an intern sit with ChatGPT with a short list of key points and statements, and said "whatever the bot tells you as a response, just reply it to some bad reviews. Makes it look like we care more than we do."
Contraband I can smuggle by clicking on a button to fast travel and sitting 6 times in a row and making less than just selling the 100+ guns in my inventory.
The moment I have conscious recognition that the only reason I’m engaging in the activities in a game is so that I can continue to engage in those same activities but on a bigger scale — that is the moment I realize I’m just a hamster on a wheel, and get bored and stop playing.
Well you’d need to ask someone on their discord ofc. Because why the hell would you want to play the game your own way and not have to take suggestions from other players to have fun. /s
Let me go start an outpost network to mine resources and make 10000 components that sell for a grand total of 1 rifle. But I can't move them anywhere to sell them without 30+ trips and sitting in a chair 8 times each trip
To have and to hold, until death do you part.
> for what exactly?

For mandatory merriment!
I'm getting strong " The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment " vibes.
Fo76's problems weren't with its world design, that was fantastic.
[Just gonna leave this here for this "real life" statement, lol. Comparing shit to real life to justify it being boring is super fucking annoying.](https://youtu.be/MGpFEv1-mAo?si=y_9XohL6O28fnV6X)
I'm getting more entertainment from reading these reviews and comments than I did by playing Starfield. They could have done so so so much more.
Thing is, it wasn't boring in real life...
And a sci-fi game. Like the whole point of sci-fi and fantasy genres is to make the impossible possible and as many fanboys told me since launch, this ain't a space sim so no excuse for pointless realism.
But you can get cargo containers for your ship with "hidden" storage. Then you go can go to The Well and sell to the Trade Authority there...big criminal goings-on...tee hee.

Or...stay with me...you could just pick up every gun you find, sell them anywhere and get the same $ for less trouble. Even less trouble because you can sell guns everywhere not just the Trade Authority.

But perfectly legal gun-running isn't as naughty as trading in contraband mech parts.
Am I out of touch?

No, it's the players who are wrong!
Going to the moon: historic, dangerous, could easily die

"Exploring" planets in Starfield: oh look another procgen rock garden, ooooo except the rocks are kinda orange on this one! WoooooooooW!
The same thing happened in Mass Effect: Andromeda. It was built up that you'd be a Pathfinder and explore this new system and make a new home for the Citadel races. Then in practice you just wake up years after the arrival and everything has already been settled and explored.

In Starfield every planet already has a hab on it and you can literally watch other ships come in and land. I'm not an explorer, I'm just another tourist.

Edit: spelling
Imagine making a game with 1K planets in a universe where intelligent life hasn't been discovered yet and then NOT including a mechanic to be the first to discover intelligent life, and then learn how to communicate with it...
This. BGS have proven that they can make a great open world sandbox style “rpg”. Look at Morrowind, Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Skyrim. 

I get that with Starfield that wanted to do things differently since it’s a brand new IP. But they really should have just don’t what they did with fallout 3. Keep it grounded and well routed in the BGS “style”. Instead they did the exact opposite and the game is way too big to possibly pull off. And a lot of that “classic BGS” style isn’t really there. Or if it is it’s very half-baked or blah.
Yea, too much repetitiveness is always boring, strange that Bethesda employees make impression that that is not the case.
[deleted]
They were WHAT on the moon?
Yeah, I like the game but idk what they think this is accomplishing. If someone doesn’t like the game enough to write a negative review you’re not going to change their mind & you probably shouldn’t even try to.
Meanwhile in the no sodium sub they are saying we are "obsessed" with these responses cause there's one thread about them, and also praising them for the responses
I did start a second playthrough, and you're right. There's moments where you get a unique line of dialogue, then it goes back to business as usual.

Seriously, I'm talking about maybe a single line of dialogue is different, for some conversations. It's the difference between "you're a soldier, you can handle it" vs "you're a bounty hunter, you can handle it" and then it just carries on with the same bog standard dialogue.

To say they are "completely different" is so disingenuous, it's hilarious.
Chatting with NPC quest givers felt like there was JUST one path. It feels like playing a Nintendo game where you can’t say no.

“We need you to recover the macguffin”

“Nah, I’m good”. 

“While you said no, I’m sure you meant yes so here’s the quest”

“I said NO!”

“Hurry back, the world needs you!”
>Can anyone confirm that if you create a second character who is polar opposite to your first, “almost every quest” is different?

This is outright false, yeah.  
But there is a slight difference between a gun and an unarmed build: gun build is viable, unarmed is completely unplayable by level 30.
You get the same outcome using a different option. Even with background and traits. I've come across one useful encounter where i could use security skill rather than collecting batteries, and that's it. Haven't seen anything else. And i usually do save loading a lot. 

Different choices  only affect the end roll, and no effect on the game. It's not any deeper than say, marvel ultimate alliance 's end credits. And i loved that game btw.
Their awful UI is a pretty good indicator of the latter.

I'm pretty sure I'd have given up on the game if modders hadn't pumped out a better UI mod in record time.
I get the vibes that the majority of the writing and quest design devs are middle-aged suburbanites that haven't left their cul-de-sac in 20 years.
It seems like they don't play any games at all for that matter. At least none made in the past 20 years.
Well if you look how they have written companions and storys, it is quite evident they think their fan base are preschool kids.
CDPR's The Witcher 3 dropped almost 9 years ago and has some of the absolute best side quests of any game I've ever played, like to the point you almost forget that you're not doing a main questline because of how developed they are. Bethesda not having any side quests that really grab you and make you want to care about what's going on is kinda shocking with how long they've been into storytelling.
You know, some of them actually got a vehicle on the moon so they didn't have to walk everywhere.
[deleted]
May as well have been that.
Just dont be bored
Clearly not they’ve been doing this since fallout. They stick wit the narrative of “no you don’t know what your talking about, we know what we’re talking about” in every response. Stop defending a dev that’s slacking. I love rockstar but I can’t even defend them wit the shit they doing.
There's clearly a problem with how they run the company. There must at least have been someone working there that pointed out how crappy the UI is or how/why some game mechanics are bad. Then they were probably told to stick to their lane. I also have a feeling that the programmers aren't skilled/many enough to be working on a project with such a large scope
People really have turned against this game since launch haven’t they? I guess the honeymoon period is really over now
A game with no content is not a game. There’s nothing stimulating about it. Imagine playing Mario and there was nothing to jump on, no dangers for you to die. You just run to the end of the flat level and jump for the flag.
Ok for my next character I want to be cynically self-interested and screw over people to get my way.

Oh and then I want to play a greasy starship mechanic supplementing their combat abilities with vehicles or drones or mechs or something, anything other than just guns.

And maybe for a third character it would be cool to be really anti-government or anti-corporation and lead a pirate revolution to take down the UC!

Bethesda: "how bout a snarky dialogue line based on your new background and no further changes?"
Also, other video games have made exploring places like the moon fun by realising that the journey to it (and back) is the most important part.

Kerbal Space Program, for example, captures some of the actual fun of the moon landings because you have to work and get better at the game, you iterate on your past failures and learn actual space travel techniques (gravity assists, free return trajectories etc.) to successfully land on the Mun. The sense of accomplishment when you finally make your first landing and plant your flag, collect a soil sample, run your goo experiment, and watch Jeb fall on his face after bunny hopping around is incredible. And even when that is over, you still have to get them home safe, which is not at all guaranteed and can result in more stories of trying to rescue your stranded Kerbals.

And once you have been to the Mun, there are the other planets in the Kerbal system, which involves getting even better at the game, learning even more techniques to succeed. In Starfield, there is no journey or challenge to traversing the galaxy. You cannot ever get better at it, develop new skills as a player which allow you to reach new places which were previously out of reach. You just open up the map and click where you want to go.

You cannot have a sense of scale, of distance, without feeling like you are actually going on a journey. Starfield cuts out the journey, and in doing so makes traversing between its 1000 planets over dozens of systems feel smaller than travelling from Kerbin to the Mun.
You should expect exactly this since Fallout76.
One of my complaints about the game is there aren't any truly empty planets. There are abandonded bases with spacers or pirates everywhere. And even when there isn't there's a random cave with dead miners or a pile of dung with randomized loot that indicate there was someone else there before you. Not on a single planet did I get the idea that I was the first visitor to ever be there.
And it wasnt even a planet!
It doesn't even need to be in-person. I imagine people playing Kerbal Space Program are pretty hyped when they first managed to reach the ~~moon~~ mun. 

Imagine if, instead of building a rocket and making it to the moon after several/many attempts, you just open a menu, click on the moon and teleport there. Congrats, now you're on the moon.
They were riding a literal bomb in an oxygen rich capsule.  If that device crashed half as much as the game the moon would still be made of cheese
They have randomly generated POIs, but they are the same randomly generated POIs that appear on other planets. Play long enough and you'll see the exact same facility on multiple planets, with the same journals, the chef talking about missing tomatos, and everything else match for match at each location (loot in chests is randomized because chests are always randomized, but the layout is the same each time).
They also had a dope moon buggy to drive around in. I got to hoof it on foot in Starfield.
And, just would like them to remember the year that was vs their fucking game being in a freaking "far future"...

&#x200B;

Where vehicles and phones don't exist, but whatever.
I actually hopped back into Elite Dangerous: Odyssey this week and now that they have fixed it, being able to do everything from space to planet seamlessly(with better AI and even vehicles :O) highlighted how mediocre starfield ended up. Elite has the exact same procedural gameplay and planets too, yet both the npc's look more human AND the planetary POI's actually have variety, not to mention the vastly better gameplay experience all around.

We have to get real here they literally recycled skyrim word walls and dragon shouts into a space game, I have little hope for elder scrolls 6.
It's a bad  space simulator and it's not as fun as it could have been. And no some customer support rep isn't going to spin it any other way.
its been a long time since i've seen a game so limited by its technology. the engine just full on can not handle what they wanted to do, so everything got lamer
Yep. Nobody's complaining about the worlds being empty in Kerbal Space Program.
> they probably wouldn't sitting in front of a screen

They also didn't have 999 other planets that are quite similar to explore too. And an unlimited number of multiverses to repeat it.
Also, the Moons Surface in real life is way, way more interesting than in Starfield. 

Steep cliffs, lava tunnels, thousands upon thousands of fractal craters. 

We get a largely homogenous glat surface strewn with rubble, and the occasional hill. 

And of course the Cryolab 200m from the Apollo 11 moonpanding sight. 

Real life planets are not boring, Bethesda just made boring planets.
They should definitely add an in game 30 hour class on scuba safety you have to pay attention to and take a test on to add to the immersion.
Also, comparing exploration of an empty planet to the moon landing is flawed and disrespectful to the players. There's a difference between a select few people, supported by hundreds of other people and the many sacrifices made, to get to the moon versus easily accessible space travel. Does Bethesda think we can't differentiate the two?
[deleted]
Alot of the player base will tell you " you're playing wrong"  instead of the game is boring.
Yeah, "You're wrong for not enjoying this game," is a helluva take. I'm sure that they've thought it at points, but to actually SAY it is kind of amazing.
What's really funny is how these AI comments on steam line up exactly with the excuses that are regularly posted on here, especially the part about space being empty. I'm sure it's not bots though /s
[deleted]
Anything that says “abandoned” has enemies
That's when you quick save in New Atlantis and go postal. It's how I end my sessions usually.
The first time I entered on of *those* caves filled with enemies on a random planet I thought it was really cool. 

Then I found an identical one on the next planet.

And the next planet.

And then they even used the same cave layout in the story quest you meet Andreja.
This right here. That AI bot in the second image acting like its some monumental task to procedurally generate this shit on the fly. It ain't that random... the computer rolls a 5 sided die it ain't that much work Bethesda. Quit the spin
This is the actual problem...

The layout of the planets and the varying levels of sparcity is fine, but the annoying thing is when you do enter a base there are about 8 or so at max so you're likely to have seen the same one already in this session, let alone the game as a whole.
Your point is valid because they are so rare most people aren't even aware that they exist. If 99% of the planets most players will see have random POI then that is the vibe most players are going to get.
You'd think they could have at least included logic to not spawn human POIs in the same area as temples.
You're not exactly wrong. There are a few planets without human made structures on the lower right side of the system, but people land on those planets constantly and you'll still find odd stuff like corpses in caves.

So you're still not going to untainted planets.
Plus no roads, no cell phones, tiny cities the size of outposts... The future really seems undeveloped. The fact that there's spaceships but no cars just seems really weird.
You technically do have a compass.
There's a compass on the bottom left lol
You should see the art industry.

"You just don't understand his vision!"

Nah I do, his vision just sucks.
The Bungie “ We aren’t going to belabor the difficulty of making entertainment “. Aka… the business we signed up for willingly lol
It won't feel like that when we stop buying their games
Larian's support of BG3 has been nothing less than stellar. Bethesda should take notes from them.
I bet being an astronaut is boring AF at times.  Getting anywhere takes forever.  Except for the brief moments where exciting stuff is happening and you might die, it's probably just a lot of trying to not get inside your own head.  And all that is without the endless training and medical tests.
That made me think of this...

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UEcgRPsrL_U
I don't mind the idea of randomly generated content, go ahead and have a billion proc-gen planets for people to go fart around on if they're so inclined, but that should be in addition to the large dense interesting handcrafted worlds that Bethesda games have been known for, not a replacement. 

New Atlantis and Akila City are the only two decently sized continuous areas. Akila City is somewhat interesting to explore although it's a pretty confusing maze at times. New Atlantis is so sterile and bland and boring to roam around in that they added an extra fast-travel mass transit system on top of the regular fast travel system. Wander 50 yards outside of any of those cities, and it's basically untouched wilderness except for random isolated outposts every kilometer or so. There's no infrastructure or connections between any of it. Nothing that makes the planets feel lived on other than a big city that just somehow exists in the middle of nothing. It doesn't feel believable. 

And then the issue with the proc-gen content is that it's just done in the laziest way. Just straight up copy/paste of structures with basically zero variation between them. It's mind-boggling to me that they didn't include any kinds of systems to mix-up randomize the layouts and contents of the outposts.
Make it, say, five or six star systems with 4-5 planets/moons in each one, all *actually handcrafted* and full of interesting things to discover.

The proc-gen systems could have been an optional side activity or something, not the main body of the entire game.
Filled with space hobos.

Like, probably kind of exciting the first time. Not exciting at all every time after that.
Death Stranding is an amazing example, to be honest. Sure, on the surface, you just walk (or riding) around the landscape. But that is far from what player is doing. In the Death Stranding, you have a strategic goal - get to the point you are supposed to, you have a less strategic goal - develop the area around your path. Then you have tactical goals like delivering this or that, here or there, with some satisfaction from completing the mission or setting the new score record or something similar. And development of the area is visual, you can see and use the road you just helped to build and so on. And then there are also several mechanics that makes walking around less boring - with rains, enemies, somewhat complex mechanics of the landscape, balancing weight of the load and so on. So, the player has something to do all the time on all levels in the Death Stranding. In the Starfield we have a limited amount of air and some enemies in specific spots. And very simple landscape that can be navigated without much issues most of the time. And often there is no reason to really explore any particular area also. So, basically fewer goals, fewer things to do, less complex mechanics that make the process more interesting and challenging.
A lot of people hated that game honestly

Edit - just want to add that I own death stranding and still haven’t played it.  I’m not knocking it, but player reviews kinda pushed me away from it but eventually I’ll try it
Death stranding was trying something new and did fully realize their vision. How does that relate?
Omg yes. I wanted to shoot the CEO too, and even the negotiations were half-hearted at best. Like give me some options, let me blackmail them, let them fight it out with my help on either side, involve the FSR, involve the UC. Spice it up ffs. They also just swallow whatever you decide, so unrealistic, at least let them go to war if I give them the wrong proposal and negotiations fail... So disappointing.
And for a lot of quests, no matter which "branching path" you pick it'll funnel you back into one main path for simplicity. 

For example, there's a quest where you need to convince a settlement they're in danger from local wildlife. You can do a bunch of extra steps or speech checks to convince them the danger is real...but they attack right after the speech check, regardless of whether you succeed or fail. There's no point to any of it.

Same illusion of choice we've seen in video games for years, but cranked up to 11.
And pretty much every single quest is like this - no choice or interesting dialogue options.

I implore any fanboy on this subreddit to answer this: how is this piss poor dialogue writing and lack of meaningful choices defensible in a so-called RPG?
Exactly my feelings about it... Maybe the writers were spread too thin, but I think general restrictions to make the game family friendly caused most of this. As you say, it merely goes as deep as the generic genres, but you can't make a good space western, cyberpunk, space horror, or space marines without at least *some* facets of gritty, gorey, sexual realism. Especially Neon the Sin city was a fucking joke compared to real Cyberpunk like cp2077

Even the worst areas are only bad in terms of looks, both in the UC and FSC...
This is the game’s sin to me. I was playing Outer Wilds and Remnant 2 at the same time as this game and the difference in creativity is STAGGERING. So much stuff they could’ve pulled from… Geiger, Lovecraft, etc. It’s like the artists and writers at Bethesda were thinking of the most bland sci-fi plots and art directions they could possibly imagine and then everyone cheered the more bland it was.

“We’ll do a human-only civilization sci-fi game with a sterile NASA-punk aesthetic!”

“👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻  WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN!”
Yeah, after playing Mass Effect 1 for the first time I've just realised how bad the writing for Starfield is.

How on earth, BGS has thought that it's a good decision to not hire actual writers for their BRAND NEW franchise is just beyond me. Instead, they let Quests Designers and System Designers write lore, story and dialogue. Braindead decision.
Especially when my ship exploded and I’m like well good job Sam bringing Cora onboard
Proc gen for the NPCs, too.
All of them are different flavors of goody two shoes and unfortunately they are the only ones with quests that develop their characters.
It really rubs me the wrong way that Sarah EVERY TIME YOU GO TO NEON is like "we're gonna visit the Astral Lounge right??? You gotta do that" AND THEN SHE GETS PISSED IF YOU TRY AURORA 

What is the fucking point of going there if not to try a drug that's only legal there???? Why would she want us to go there if she doesn't want to do the things there???
Yeah smart choice. I played a lot because I desperately wanted it to be good, I don't even mind the loading screens much, I was just looking for the depth, it's super wide (to use the metaphor) so I thought if I look long enough, I'd find the good stuff. 

But every new location and every new quest was just... disappointing. And the only good one I found was over in 1 minute (Juno's Gambit).

BGS needs new writers, the npc dude thats responsible for the character design (seen in the showcase) should've been a red flag already lmao.
Which is a sad thing considering FO4 was not the best BGS game ever made… but I am with you here. The only good thing Starfield brought to me is that now I am thinking of finally upgrading my pc for some serious Skyrim and FO4 modding. Was playing Starfield on my series X and the performance is fine but… man. What the hell is this?
>I guess they want to clean up the Steam reviews for holiday sales?

They're *trying* to "clap back" I think.  Bethesda has always been pompous about their games.  "You're playing it wrong" is VERY on brand.  "Your machine is shit, just buy a new one." et al.

For holiday sales/optics and because there'll be DLC in the works.  

People eat this crap up and, for some reason, still treat Bethesda as if they're an indie studio with 2 guys working out of a garage and we should be grateful for whatever they produce.
This feels like devs who are tired of hearing smack talk about something they worked on for the last several years which is understandable. The issue is a lot of the criticisms are valid and they aren't going to improve by ignoring it.
Holy shit this

"You can smuggle!" Smuggling implies a need for stealth, secrecy. Maybe you need to take certain uncommon routes, avoid security, have contacts, drop points for goods...

Not buying 1 perk, clicking on a planet, and running through security with an inventory full of contraband to sell in broad daylight by sitting in a chair for 48 hours 6 times in a row
When your life is on the line and you're one of a handful of people (if not the very first) to do something on the moon it tends not to be boring. 

But you know what a bad comparison is? Comparing landing on the fucking moon to playing a video game. Honestly, bad form on BGS.
But at least you can use those rocks to build outposts! And the point of building outposts is to… find more rocks?
Considering you can build a single-passenger ship in an afternoon that has the range to visit every single star in the galaxy, why wouldn't you expect to find settlements on every planet you encounter? Honestly it's weird that there aren't giant cities on every planet. Look at how fast the planet Earth was developed: you have an industrial revolution, and within two hundred years, global population increases 8x. When humans left Earth, they already had all the technology that was needed to explore the entire galaxy, and somehow the population went DOWN. They even had cloning and genetic engineering, and they still can't figure out how to build housing or transportation. Just a deeply unserious galaxy.
Nothing convinced me not to buy this game more than the steam dev responses. If that’s their attitude towards the player base I don’t expect they respect them enough to produce quality content.
No game dev responds to reviews like that. It’s awkward.
Hahaha honestly that lack of unique dialogue made me so mad in NG+ and starting a completely new character. Every unique piece of dialogue is just immediately dismissed and has no effect on the story. 

Player: “I’m a scientist and you’re wrong I’m not gonna do that.” 

NPC: “cmon, do it anyways.” 

*quest added
Playing Baldur's Gate 3 after 200+ hours in Starfield made this very apparent!
It's painfully linear isn't it. You don't even get to progress with the more sarcastic dialogue most of the time. You say something like "I'm not sure about this plan" then back to the same text options and you have to pick, "oh boy what a plan, let's GO!!" to actually progress.... So annoying
But consider this: you can kill every enemy in an outpost by sneaking around and killing them all one by one, or you can go in guns blazing and kill everyone in one big gun fight. 

See? That is two totally different paths with completely different outcomes! So much freedom of choice!
Is there a way to add fists to the quick weapon slots yet? Or do you manually need to equip them every time still
Holy shit, did they get that UI mod out in a flash too, and it was leaps and bounds better than the shitshow that BGS has in the game as stock. It's wild how much of an improvement that mod was.
The dialogue is so cringy.  Especially if you have a romantic partner.  I married Sarah and she was so annoying I couldn’t stop laughing.  It was like my guy was trapped in a shitty marriage with a nut.
And you would be right.
This is their big problem. The refuse to learn anything from the rest of the gaming world and work in a total vacuum. The result is a new game that feels a decade old.
And the way alot of the dialogue is written, as well as locations that are supposed to be "tough" it's clear many of them haven't been outside in quite some time if at all.
I was downvoted for this in the past, multiple times, but Bethesda really fucking hates its audience and they don't even try to hide it.
That is the proof, that they never landed on the moon. Beth can't get vehicles on the moon in a fucking videogame in the year  2023. How was NASA able to get a vehicle on the real moon over 50 years ago?
And you rarely even want to fast travel in cyberpunk because traveling manually is often more enjoyable
And you can even mod those out, I have the GTA fast travel mod and the camera just pans over the city.
There's only 1 traversal loading screen I can even think of and it's the masked one going into and out of dog town while it makes you wait 10 seconds to get scanned. I can't even think of others. If they exist it's only like a 1 time through.
It only lasted a week
lol Yep, the amount of grief people got just for saying they didn’t enjoy the game was ridiculous. I was one of them and got downvoted and lambasted as a hater. 

Was kinda sad to see reality slowly creep in for other BGS fans. They deserved better. Gotta say starfield has killed my excitement for elder scrolls vi. 

Elder scrolls is my favourite game series of all time. Far from a hater. But as a fan I’m moving on now.
A huge portion of people felt this way from day 1
I played 200 hours of Starfield. I wanted to love this game since I was waiting for it for so many years, I wanted to be excited and like it. And yet, I was deceiving myself when I was saying: "I love this game, it's amazing!"

It's not. I don't want to touch it ever again. It's a regression in comparison to all previous BGS titles, even something like an Oblivion and Fallout 3.

I'm scared for The Elder Scrolls 6.
Don’t forget that while walking on a completely abandoned planet, space pirates or mercenaries will often land within a few hundred feet of you.
I mean, there is ONE empty planet, the only one in the game with a legitimate excuse to have stockpiles of crap everywhere. But it doesn't.
Could be worse though. No Mans Sky has like 10 quadrillion worlds that have old abandoned bases and loot on them. Every planet in the damn *galaxy* has been colonized before, or near enough.

(That's ignoring the much better procedural generation. I'm just talking about the feeling of Being First.)
Exaaactly, when I first managed to land on and return home from the moon In kerbal space program i was ELATED. I must have been insufferable to my friends because I couldn't stop myself from wanting to tell them about every detail. It felt so damn good.

Starfield was bland in a lot of ways, and the planets are the blandest.

Funnily enough, Stsr Citizen has very empty planets as well, but doesn't have a single loading screen. You land your ship and crew by hand, and even though you've done a bunker mission a hundred times, it's still enjoyable.
Or subnautica, only a very basic story but very rewarding to build your base and reach and discover new locations.
This reminded me of my absolute favorite part of No man's sky -- the first take off. It was euphoric literally flying up into space seamlessly. I was shouting the entire time.
Underrated comment, for sure.
Did they finally fix Odyssey? I gave up on it a while back, as much as I love E:D I just couldn't shake how empty everything felt. Odyssey was fun for a while, but the missions got too repetitive and the rewards just weren't doing it for me. 

Every so often I glance at the sub and think about trying again, but now there's all this lore about thargoid wars and shit that I'm not even remotely caught up on, and it seems daunting. 

E:D is just too grindy. I put dozens of hours into trying to grind mats for engineering, and I'm still barely halfway through unlocking the full engineers list. Traveling to a remote system 1.5 Lys out of the bubble just to break crystals in the rover for two days drains so much of my motivation to play, I really wish they'd make it easier to upgrade everything to G5 and unlock the engineers. That's the only thing stopping me from diving back in to hunt some bugs. AX loadouts without engineering just seem like a death wish.
....and billions of planets that are empty. For a fucking reason. Space is vast, SF is not. Elite has space stations, planetary stations, combat in space, combat on planets, and in orbit with humans, aliens, and other players (once in a few blue moons). 

Elite's "Simulator" rivals that of most any space game to date. It's so incredibly immersive.

Somehow Elite is still missing something. Over the years I've played dunno 2200 hours or some shit. It's the most fun to fly, but the devs didn't keep up. THey didn't do anything the community asked for except "legs". Same ships same game. No mix up no fixing the blatantly obvious balancing issues. 

The developers don't play the game. Same goes for SF. If any SF dev/PM actually spent a few hundred hours playing the product they're making, they'd be ashamed at what a crappy product they released. BTW 525 hours in SF

Hell every couple of years Eve Online devs go in and mix shit up real good and they (mostly) listen to the player base. At least they used to. Eve has been around so long with 20k players at any time of the day because they give a fuck about the product and not the bottom line. EDIT: Meant to say that Eve's devs/pms give a shit cuz they PLAY their product. and honestly try for 20 years to make it better and better. 

$70USD X 10 million PLUS copies of Starfield sold AND WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR SHIT TO BE FIXED! This tells me that the years that I spent as a BGS FANBOI have been wasted on a company that could give a fuck about it's playerbase. 

BGS gave us the ability to eat in the last patch. This fucking shit is a slap in the face. How about paying attention to all the people that have taken their precious time away from gaming and telling you what their issues are on the discord and other platforms. BGS asked us to click the star to point out the issues, but they ignore all of it and give us the ability to eat?

I have spent hundreds of USD in microtransaction in ESO, FO76 and enjoyed myself immensely. With the current lack of leadership and their current disregard for the 10+ million people that wasted their money on a half-baked, half-assed game/"Simulator" this fanboi is oot. I'll go spend my money elsewhere. 

Ciao Bethesda,

Call me when you give a shit. 805-555-4663
I generally think starfield was a cash grab 4 es6
When I went to the Sol system for the first time, first thing I did was look up a map of where the first moon landing happened, thinking they MUST have at least put something to find there, maybe a museum, or maybe just a roped off area with the footprints and flag or some debris to virtually mark one of the most significant achievements in human history. When I landed and saw it was just another procedurally near-flat landscape in a different color, with the exact same POIs in the distance, that genuinely killed a lot of the sense of exploration I had at that point. After a certain number of times thinking you might find something around the next corner, only to find nothing, you just lose any incentive to keep looking
Anyway, I think Starfield tries to bridge the gap between the infinite cosmos and a finite story--and fails.  It's a good lesson for the industry.  Compare all of Starfield's locations to the experience we get with, say Night City--arguably the greatest curated open-world landscape in any RPG.  We all want a huge world, but one that doesn't play on repeat.  CP2077 absolutely slam-dunked this idea.  I even reinstalled Skyrim and The Outer Worlds just to make sure I wasn't imagining things--and I wasn't.  Those worlds feel 10x better than what we get in Starfield.  Despite all the great things in Starfield, I feel this game is a bit of a step back for the genre, and that hurts when you fire up Skyrim for the first time in 12 years and realize how cohesive that world really is.
You should actually have to wait 10 years for your UC citizenship
"Now we're going to do a scuba simulation where you float around and try to touch five buoys in a row at different depths. You will do this 24 times to earn your certification!"

"_motherf--_"
I mean it would be irresponsible to have people think you can just go dive without a PADI or SSI cert.
Bethesda's logic is as good as telling most people to play ARMA and scolding them when they say it's no fun as a shooter action game.

And at least ARMA stays true to its goal of being realistic. IDK what is Bethesda's goal with Starfield here. Realistic planet exploration simulator? Stupid cheesy arcade shooter? What the hell is it? Their game direction just jumps back and forth all over the place.

In Skyrim, it's about medieval fantasy do-whatever-you-want. In FO4, it's a focus on story-telling and factions. In SF, it's like they cant decide. You cant even kill most NPCs in this game, the faction-siding are mostly meaningless, they disregarded seamless immersion in favor of stupid load screens and cheat fast travel and the story and quest writing is utter dogshit quality.
Also the verisimilitude of actually being on a moon, the full sensation you get from being physically there and such is not the same as experiencing it in a video game through the interface and framework of the limited interaction we get from that
This is the only Bethesda game I didn’t binge like crazy since marrowind. It commits the worst sin of entertainment. It is in fact BORING. Exploring isn’t fulfilling because it’s just empty planets everywhere. There are virtually no interactions you randomly come across like in Skyrim or fallout. 

In those games I just wandered around and came across across something that looked interesting. Sometimes there was a fun side quest or character associated with it. 

In Starfield it funnels you into very few areas to do the missions. This isn’t the gameplay I want out of a Bethesda game. I dropped it after 15 hours and don’t miss it at all
I mean ....I think the game itself is pretty good, but it's not the endless experience, in a vast universe, they made it out to be.... currently taking a break because I got bored. 🤣🤣🤣
With how cheap and effective astroturfing is, especially on reddit, they would have to be idiots not to do it.
This is exactly what I said on another comment in this thread. 

The arguments/defenses they are using in those replies are word-for-word the same brainless argument that some "users" on this subreddit are saying. 

Really makes you realise it's more than likely Bethesda themselves running a nice little bot program on here. 
This was just a dirty cash grab and they've spent all their resources on marketing it to get your money, then the remainder of their financial resources on bots and fake "oMg wOw i lUv diS gAmE" threads on reddit to defend what is clearly - a shit product. 

Bethesda has official joined the corporate fraudsters of the world. Well done.
That is interesting, maybe when Todd said 250 devs are working on Starfield he meant they have 250 people going around the internet and trying to discredit critics.
And "occupied cave" has nothing in it.
Unless they're Crimson Fleet
Much as I love the game, I find it incredibly disappointing that without any further explanation I know exactly which cave layout you're referring to.

In fact, at this point I pretty much know what enemies will spawn and where they'll spawn in the vast majority of POI's I run across anymore (as well as where the worthwhile loot is so no need to actually search or investigate).

Again, I really enjoy playing the game, but it has some serious flaws that I'd love to see worked on.
I genuinely want to know what their level designers did for 7 years. I've done nothing but laugh at the game and the people that marvel at the "attention to detail" ever since I found my first pirate camp with playing cards and lawn chair and open beers outside on a planet that was -30 degrees C and forested, and then immediately found the exact same pirate camp and card game set up on a moon that was -300C with no atmosphere.
Hi u/NoNefariousness2144,

I’m sorry you are not enjoying the game. Our load screens are designed to distract you from us loading the same assets on each empty planet. Be grateful that you get to explore space like the astronauts have for decades while also getting to fight some generic space pirates.

We take your feedback seriously and will try to include some of these changes before early access ends.

If you have any more feedback, la la la I can’t hear you.
The *main quest* sent me to that same fucking cave twice in a row.
That's wild, they really pulled a Dragon Age 2 in 2023 lmaooo
Thing is even on those planets, you might not find the buildings, but you can still find caves with a corpse in it and ships landing at random.
There is only a train. The only land vehicle in thr galaxy, besides the abandoned rover. Plus, Akila could really use something like that.
A banana duct-taped to a wall sold for $120,000. 🤷🏻‍♂️
I had to block more enraged "modern art" lovers that sent me hate mail on reddit in one day than several months' worth of far-right lunatics when I posted something along the lines of how a banana taped to a wall isn't really art in some art subreddit. And it was in reply to a thread about how such things are not really art. Oh, they were pissed about my "lack of vision!" Gullible morons.
When's that gonna start? All these "bad" companies are seeing record sales.
Bethesda knows, they don't give a fuck. They're coasting on their reputation.
Man this reminds me of all the triple A devs complaining how BG 3 can't be the new standard. Like okay bro, I will just not play your game then, huh???
didnt they add a much requested mirror to change your characters race or something not even a month in
The other thing almost all of them report is that being in space is a life altering experience they would do anything to have again.

Unfortunately for BGS most people don't feel quite as strongly about their videogame experiences... Especially when some of the most important parts for feeling a sense of scale are just replaced by loading screens.
That's fair - I think they just put way too much stock in the generated content. 

And, like you said, slapping down the same facilities on random planets wasn't a great way to handle it. I'm surprised they didn't use proc-gen to lay out the sites themselves.
>New Atlantis and Akila City are the only two decently sized continuous areas. Akila City is somewhat interesting to explore although it's a pretty confusing maze at times. 

wow so i really didnt miss much punching out after new atlantis.
After awhile it just becomes target practice. The worst part is that there is NOTHING of substantial interest in any of those structures. At least with Skyrim there was always a motivational factor. Starfield doesn’t have that.
Also the music in Death Stranding helped.
What Death Stranding has is obstacles between you and your objective that vary constantly. Hell, even in Skyrim, I might see a location/objective in the distance, look at my map, and start trying to figure out how to get there. The biggest hurdle Starfield gives the player for getting to their destination is a map and menu that handles like a 2 wheeled tricycle or a 5 minute walk on an empty rock field.
Enemy AI and combat being dull are huge problems.  They clearly wanted combat to be easy and the game to be mainstream/accessible so it would sell millions of copies.  The gameplay gets dull pretty fast once you "consume" the content, and there are no compelling gameplay loops to keep you hooked.

You can tell that Starfield had a rough design/development process and what came out the other end was not what anyone had envisioned.  You really feel it late-game when it starts to unravel.
Death Stranding is like a brilliant indie game with triple A paint.
DS is a strange game. And absolutely not for everyone. But if you end up liking it, you'll most likely love it, too. It's beyond unique in many ways.
Bethesda is terrified of doing anything that could cause consequences for the player's actions and possibly lock them out of content.

Which is even dumber when you consider the NG+ system of Starfield would be the perfect excuse to actually do that, as it would encourage players to see the other options.

I think Bethesda is just bad at making games
I call Bethesda dialogue "fat in the middle". Lots of dialogue and "choices" in the middle but they only lead you to a single point at the end.
Even cp2077 night city was to tame for me. Fallout 1+2 were good regarding the darker side. I usually stick to the good side but the option to be a bad guy makes my choice more meaningful and immersive.
I put Sam at an outpost on an empty moon and Cora is still on my ship.
especially since the astral lounge is just a childs dance party without aurora, although given the way the companions are written I wouldnt be surprised if thats what they like about the astral lounge
I truly do not understand how such a well funded studio can have such bad writing in their games. I know making games is complicated, but why does the dialogue feel so bland and robotic. Even the factions feel like generic placeholders with no identity.

I know they're trying for broad appeal, but that shouldn't mean the game loses all character. People talk about this game being a good base for modding, but I don't want to play a game that's a template for the real game. 

If Rockstar can make me care about a bunch of western stereotypes and treat them like real people, and Obsidian (using Bethesda's engine) can make me care about the politics and factions of their world, Bethesda should be able to make me feel something in a new IP where they have free rein to do whatever they want.
Yeah that’s basically what I found. I didn’t enjoy companions too much, I didn’t enjoy the exploration, and I didn’t enjoy it overall- at least compared to other games.

People on this sub called me crazy for not going and buying it because it would be “GOTY” but Bethesda has taught me, repeatedly, to never buy on release. Trying it out at least let me see for myself that it has good bones but it needs to be expanded on a lot.
>People eat this crap up 

looking at the reply tho, maybe not this time
It reminds me of looking up reviews for a restaurant and seeing the owner responding to each negative review.

"Sorry the service was bad, we must have been busy"
"I know you say our crab cakes are bland but they're supposed to be that way so the don't distract from the side of bread we gave you. Do you think sailors had salt and pepper to season their crab with?"
Moon landings in real life were intense af. Pressing W and space on empty virtual moon is not intense at all.
My first moon landing in Kerbal Space Program was intense. The stakes were high, I'd already failed several times, I wasn't sure I'd have enough fuel to make it back (I didn't, sorry little Kerbal buddies!). I was rocketing in and watching my shadow slowly get bigger as I raced over the face of the moon. Pulling off the landing was ecstacy and that first moon walk collecting samples was my reward.

In Starfield I click on the moon and say go there and I'm there. I don't think Starfield should incorporate orbital mechanics or anything, but you're so right about the comparison they're making. Total bs.
You don't have 1 iron for a structure that need 68? Nothing will be done until you bring that piece!

*few screenloads later*

Nice! Now you need to make a generator, a stocking systeme, protection, transportation...

What's that? You want a list about the amount of materials needed for those buildings?

I...I really don't give a fuck, use a crayon or something!
I'm only playing it because I have gamepass.
[Starborn] something something 

[NPC] gee, you say the darndest things!
Yeah, thank god I played Starfield before BG3 and Cyberpunk, those 2 games made me feel like Starfield came out 10 years ago.
You already know the answer pal be honest x)
Just how quickly people mod these incredibly basic QOL improvements into the game really makes me feel like Starfield was built like a shitty assembly line. Once the given system was working to the bare minimum of standards, get started on the next one and dont worry about it.
It's also basically SkyUI and not super different from DEF_UI, wider and with a couple extra sorting columns. 

It feels like someone should have taken a hint from the #1 Skyrim and #3 SSE mod were just making the inventory screen more accessible in the exact same way.
The studio is literally named after Bethesda, MD which is a wealthy suburb of DC. You can’t make it up.
I think they found so much success in games like Skyrim and FO3/4 that they feel they need to stick to the formula. Unfortunately that means they'll never innovate and we get games that feel like they were made in 2012.
And in starfield you simply don’t have the option to travel manually, just fast travel around.
thats pretty cool, i don’t get why these devs don’t understand that all they need to do is add an animation of some sort to cover the loading and people would care so much less. No one wants to watch a blank screen or whatever every time they fast travel its infuriating, especially in a game like starfield where you have to fast travel to go to a lot of places
This is literally me! I put so much hours in, told myself and people I absolutely loved it! Now though? I haven’t picked it up since and have no intention or want to do so. Hell I loaded up Skyrim the other night instead.
Not related to the "abandoned" planet issues, but frequently they will land and take back off within ~10 seconds. So many times I will b-line to a ship that is landing so I can steal it, but it flies off before I'm halfway there. Who thought that was a good idea?
>space pirates or mercenaries will often land within a few hundred feet of you.

I have 6 Constellation IV ships in my garage cuz they pretty much landed on top of me.
I too found this to be jarring and ironic
The NASA complex is still standing, and still has power. But the entire rest of the Eastern Seaboard is a barren wasteland. The Pyramids are still there, but there is no sign that Cairo ever existed. Somehow the Shard is still standing in London but the rest of the city has disintegrated. 

All this within 100 years of Earth being abandoned. Make it make sense.
[deleted]
>when I first managed to land on and return home from the moon In kerbal space program i was ELATED. I must have been insufferable to my friends

This was me except I don't have friends
Times 100 when I orbitally docked the first time, fuck that was hard to figure out
I don't know that story had more depth (heh) than Starfield has in any missions. Finding the story in Subnautica is a creepy slow burn.
Doesn't subnautica have a preset map rather than a procedurally generated one?
Yeah.  The fact that there is nothing save a few structures left on Earth is total shit.  That was a bit of an "oh fuck" moment for me.
3 years, level 6. :)
Not before you go to another planet and clear up a misunderstanding for the instructor.  Once you clear up that bad blood, then the scuba instructor will start class.
It puzzles me that you encounter the temple guardian AFTER obtaining the power. I guess that's why he is pissed.
Agreed. As my grandmother always used to say “Safety first u/O_J_Shrimpson - Especially in battle oriented respawnable video games.”
Let's not forget those people were pioneers! No one had ever done anything even remotely similar, Ever. That was some dangerous work then, and "still" is, but "then" they were using a commodore 64 to run the most powerful engines ever made by humanity. They risked their lives doing what they did!!

I don't think that Bethesda has quite perfected that kind of adrenaline rush by landing on an empty planet in Starfield. Wow, just....wow.
It's a decent linear story-driven sci-fi RPG.

Which has some barebones planetary exploration mechanics and regular side quests.

But somehow got marketed as a free-form, non-linear RPG with a focus on open space exploration.

It's as if Mass Effect marketed itself to be the next Elite: Dangerous or No Man's Sky.
Yup you get it
Right lol
No kidding. I’m 300 hours in and still haven’t sided with them so they still attack on sight if I show up
There's that "deep cave" in the abandoned mine, where there's a big room, a door, a short passage and then a huge room with a broken elevator. The highest-level enemy is always at the bottom of the pit in the huge room, and you can snipe him easily from next to the broken elevator. It's exactly the same every time, with the same guys in exactly the same place, and the same loot with the same robot and the same guy leaning over the railing with his back to me every single time. I mean, Dark Forces has "infinite" replayability if you're cool with doing the exact same thing over and over forever.
It's wild that their attention to detail consists of constructing a small but detailed setpiece then inserting it absolutely anywhere.
My favourite encounter is the low gravity farm on a high gravity world. Constant references to crops growing in low gravity on a 1.5g world.
Their responses are just like this aand scream that they aren't really listening. They are gonna put out what ever they want for as little money possible. If we dont like it then we just be missing the 1000 fetch quest they put so much work into lol
This fucking killed me lol
Hey at least in Dragon Age 2 they'd change up what part of the cave you entered through!
At least some of the companions in DA2 actually had substance lol
And just nothingness sold around 15-18k.. (check out io sono)
Money laundering, art is full of it.
Especialy EA with the mindless sports fans buying every FIFA and Madden every year despite the game being literaly the same as the last one but now it has 2023 in the title instead of 2022. They haven't improved those games in 5+ years yet still somehow makes record sales lol.
Yep,  this exactly. The release rate tempo of their
patches  speaks volumes.
Also a wardrobe to store multiplayer companions
“You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. Fast traveling to the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and fast travel from Earth to orbit, then from orbit to the moon, finally to the surface of the moon, watch a cutscene, and say, ‘Look at that, you son of a bitch.”

― ~~Edgar Mitchell~~ Todd Howard
They were probably too busy working on the environment or outpost mechanics that got scrapped late in development. Compared to any decent roguelike the generated content is so sad
And Norman Reedus. The game would be nowhere near as playable if they had cast anyone else.

Death Stranding is an amalgamation of awful ideas that should never work well in a videogame, which somehow do work well together in DS because Hideo Kojima has made logic his bitch.
I legitimately do not remember any of the music in starfield and I played 36 hours. Oblivion and skyrim music had me stopping constantly to just listen. Death stranding had some amazing music too.
God I still remember walking down a road when it started to pour down rain. All my packages were degrading quick and I saw a rain shelter in the distance. Get there and the player set it up with this very relaxing but upbeat song with a Japanese singer. Sitting there waiting out the storm while listening to that was one the most atmospheric moments I've had in a video game.
Don't Be So Serious was instantly added to my playlists when I first heard it.
I remember Dunkey put out a review basically saying “this game is an abomination” and then a year later put out another video saying “actually I was wrong. This game is super fucking fun.”
Basically a parent now and you didn't even engage in the fun part
Lmfao fr, I just treat my companions as weapon mules for credits
seems like they used a lot of AI. at east that was my impression. blabbering with no real content....nice words to comfort a sentence with legnth that otherwise would have been long over. instead of using it ti enhance dialogs they just made it longer but as boring. its like every NPC is a corporate robot that can only speak like...well.....corportate robots.
And the astronauts had actual jobs to do. They had experiments to perform, samples to collect etc.

And in real life, bending down and picking up a moon rock is a real, tactile experience. That is not true in a video game where you look at a thing and press the button it tells you.
Mine was similar, right down to not having enough fuel to get back. So then I built a rescue ship to go and get Jeb and bring him home. I messed up the landing zone on that one, overshooting my target by some fair distance. I bunny hopped across the surface using what fuel remained in Jeb's lander until it was spent, left lying on its side due to hitting the surface too hard on its final descent and breaking its landing gear. So Jeb had to climb out and make a three and a half kilometre trek across the surface of the Mun to reach his ticket home, traversing craters and hills with limited fuel in his eva pack so he couldn't just jetpack his way across, instead using it sparingly, especially as I had to use some of the fuel to slow his descent in the big leaps he was making so he didn't get hurt.

I got him home and the sense of accomplishment for that was insane.
Weirdly enough, it would be pretty dated 10 years ago. I mean take Dragon Age Origins (14 years ago), and a lot of work went into making the dialogues reference past choices. Also, a bigger party, and better party tactics (Starfield is definitely missing combos with your companion). Oh and 6 fully playable intro sequences, and ongoing storyline impact for all of them. 

Or to put it another way 10 years ago I don't think Starfield would have gotten much in the way of Game Of the Year awards in 2013, when it was against GTA:V, Bioshock Infinite, and The Last of Us.
Yeah I played Starfield after both, and it felt like a bad game from 10 years ago. I genuinely feel like EuroRPGs from 2010s had better dialogues.
They have been dumming down their formula since Morrowind. The most fun element in morrowind was that you literally started of like a loser slave that could get killed by a rat if you ran out of stamina who then slowly turned in to a God after 200+ gameplay hours.  They have never repeated that Morrowind formula, they have slowly taken away everything from that formula that was fun.  I recently started another Skyrim play through, even on hard with fire in one hand and a sword in the other hand you can murder almost anything in the first couple of hours.
Normally I would agree, but it’s not even that. I mean for god sake, we all said on this sub for MONTHS, “I just want Skyrim in space.” Just go back to older threads. I was saying that, we all said that. The fucking formula works.

Problem is when you try to translate that over to a game with MULTIPLE PLANETS with hardly anything of interest on them, it fails spectacularly. So no, it’s not the formula that doesn’t work. It’s what you pair it up with. But I do think that for whatever reason some of the shit in this game feels like a downgrade, or just flat out LAZINESS.
I think they're a thirty year old studio that has a lot of devs nearing their 50s who aren't interested in learning new tech, so we get them phoning it in using work they did 15 years ago
Skyrim is still, to this day, is my most favorite BGS title and one of my most favorite games ever made with 1500+ hours in it. And that's considering I started my BGS journey with Oblivion back in 2010, which holds a special place in my heart.
If I'd see you running towards my ship I would also take off as fast as I can again? ;)
In all seriousness, that planet should have been special. Not impossible to get to, just...tricky. Maybe use the Vae'run stealth tutorial to reach, or something like it. All three major factions should treat it like a sacred place. Because it is. It might not be the most important place in the universe anymore, but it's the most important everyone can agree on.
Agreed. I wrote this somewhere else, but being that there are outposts on far worse planets, earth should have something else wrong with it. Like extreme tectonic activity or vulcanism or something-or people would be living there. Cydonia's setup would work perfectly. Stick a bunker near all the landmarks on Earth in game and explain that various governments/entities tried to make a go of it, and failed for whatever reason.
I mean that doesnt refute his point of feeling like being the first on a planet.
This was me and I have friends but none of them are gamers 🥲
How? What was your strategy? I tried so many times but could not reach 6.
"You can explore so many underwater locations! We have a planet that's just one vast empty ocean. This one has a single platform city to explore.!"
For sure....I mean, there's alot I really enjoyed, and don't get me wrong, I feel like I got my money's worth.   The story was good, and I got really invested in the faction quests..... fully exploring even dead planets was satisfying for awhile.   It got boring though.   I felt like they could've varied companion personality a little better.   Like, why is everyone pissed that in a murderous bastard.   With the Andreja backstory, she would've been perfect for a psychotic companion, but instead she hates the fleet, and like the rest, she gets mad at you for everything.   Also, while they don't need the depth of factions they could've added more entertaining, evolving side quests....I mean, I don't care for feeling like every little quest is a stupid little errand.
I miss that. I accidentally sided with them when one of the quests went south and now nobody wants to kill me. I have a bounty of almost 2 million credits because I still hunt them with extreme prejudice.
This comment was so spot on I frowned at its accuracy.
And where the bodies and loot are, if I remember right
Yeah, DA2 had a fun story and great characters to see you through the mediocre gameplay and repetitive maps. Starfield's gameplay is better, but the maps are just as repetitive and the characters and story are way worse.
Wish they would just send an update or patch to update stats rosters etc instead of sending a new game with no changes every year. But that would be too customer centric
Not to mention how the patches they drop are a joke. “We added basic core functionality that every other game has at launch in this one! Clap for us. WHY ARENT YOU CHEERING?!”

I deeply regret buying this game because of how they are operating. The game was MEH but I had fun. But their behavior makes me upset I gave them money. It won’t happen again. Ever.
It's weird that they haven't patched the game-breakers for console. I have 3 quests I can't finish.
And that is a huge issue when one of the first things everyone is asking you about is the lights you saw and music you heard...

I legitimately didn't even notice the music and now everyone is super interested in the new member that witnessed it
It's one of those games where the actual *mechanics* are what's fun. Getting to your destination is far less important than the journey to your destination. It's almost like a momentum based puzzle game combined with an inventory management game combined with an open world adventure game. The moment you realize that, it changes how you engage with the game.
I have two kids, not looking for a parent sim. 

My wife is still waiting on the fun part.
"Press F to pay respect"
Not only had they jobs to do, they had no respawns. Unlike a videogame, in real life you only live once. So unless you want to quickly die almost 400.000km away from the floating rock you were born on, flying towards and walking on the moon is metal AF. Despite it being a cold, grey and dry rock.

In real life, there is no way to know what you might find on a new planet, bc the universe is not a limited, outdated videogame made by Bethesda.
I did basically the same thing! The sense of accomplishment is what made it
Dragon age origins' characters had so much soul. I can even remember how each one's personality is until nowadays, that's impressive and fun to play.
> Weirdly enough, it would be pretty dated 10 years ago.

Even compared to Bethesda's own games. In skyrim dragon shout walls could be found at the end of dungeons and were a reward for dangerous exploration. In starfield we get a quest marker to exactly where we need to go. Then it's just a case of walking unchallenged into a temple to do the exact same zero-skill sequence.
Really? Because I think this game feels like the exact opposite of that. It feels like they got rid of all of the people who actually had experience at Bethesda, except for the ones who had zero imagination.
I guess that is fai... hey wait a minute... nice try Bethesda.
Youtube showed the cheesey way, hide by the space station thing, get out of the seat, and let the ships crash into it over and over for like 15 mins lol.
You turn the difficulty to very easy lol
If you use the debug tools in the cockpit it gets much easier.
You have to run away and get the opponents to stretch out a bit. Then turn and destroy the closest and run away some more. Takes practice and patience, but it is doable.
>We have a planet that's just one vast empty ocean

That would creep me tf out
Yeah, that pissed me off when I discovered it. I leave no witnesses alive, yet somehow I still owe a bounty? How does that work? I'm not going to just let pirates kill colonists and patrol ships right in front of me, so *not* killing Crimson Fleet isn't an option.
"on sight" FTFY
Yes. The maps were used over and over, but each time they used it all the stuff in it was different. Making it actually BETTER than Starfield which makes no such effort lmao
Seriously, there is zero reason for a sports game to be a yearly release.

The thing is people buy it.  They are literally getting the same game with a revamped menu UI and maybe a couple new game modes.
Yeah I still regret paying $30 to play it early on game pass but I do take some solace in having paid around what the game is actually worth lol. 

That and I’ll get to see if the DLC is any good if they don’t take it off gamepass sometime beforehand to pump up sales.
Dude Skyrim anniversary edition still has game-breakers, you should probably just let those quests go lol.
Yeah my actual response was "there was music?" I completely missed it. On the second time I listened for it and eh. I guess it exists, but it's completely unremarkable
Probably the only thing that ever felt more rewarding was when I rescued a Kerbal who was trapped in orbit by having him eva from his ship to the rescue ship as it flew past as their orbits briefly intercepted. I didn't have the means of docking the two ships yet, or even small manoeuvring thrusters, so that Kerbal had to fly off into the dark void to get into the path of the rescue ship and grab onto the external ladder. If he had missed, he would be dead, there was only one shot to do it.
DA:O is in the top 5 games for me. It's a shame that the subsequent games keep deviating further and further from what it was.

BG3 kinda scratched that itch, and while it is absolutely in my top five as well, it didn't have that darker tone that I loved in Origins. 

*Hopefully*, BG3 ushers in a golden age for CRPGs.
People have been noticing a trend with Bethesda's games where they've become more simplified in various ways over time, as they studio has targeted a more general mass-market audience, and they've been rewarded for that in increased sales. So I get kinda get it. Even though this pattern has often been criticized as 'dumbing down' their games, I could see why they made a lot of those choices in those previous titles. 

But Starfield feels like they've just kept going that path beyond the point where it makes sense anymore. It'd be like building a car where you took out the steering wheel and just replaced with with two buttons, one for turn left and one for turn right. Sure it's simpler to operate, but at that point you've made it so limited that it doesn't really function in the real world anymore.

Game systems generally need a level of complexity to actually make them fun and give the player room to grow. Take any of the Mario 3D games. Moving Mario around is pretty intuitive and straight forward as soon as you sit down and start playing it for the first time and great for new players, but as you spend more time with the game you discover a whole deeper move set of double jumps and triple jumps and wall jumps and ground pounds and so on, and as you get further into the game it expects you to start figuring some of that stuff out. And then beyond the main storyline there's typically some 'end game' activities that require some pretty significant mastery of a lot of those skills for players who want to put the time into it. 

But so many of Starfield's mechanics and systems feel like they're designed just for that starting out player. It's right there and you can get right into it, but then once you do it, there's no depth behind it. There's not much to learn, to practice, to get better at. Learning new skills is basically a binary on switch when you unlock something via the skill tree or a temple. And a lot of those skills really only serve to make tedious activities go by a little bit faster, they don't open up new parts of the game to you. 

I've gotten better at clearing out outposts of Spacers not because I've mastered some fun and interesting combat mechanics, but because enemies generally appear at basically the same place every time in the copy/paste structures and I've memorized them all, and because I unlocked a skill that's basically a wall hack. 

The outpost building system is a big step back from what they put in Fallout 4. In FO4 I could build up almost anything I wanted from individual pieces of walls and floors and columns and so on. But in Starfield all I can do is plop down a handful of pre-built habs and then decorate them with some different objects. But there's way less room for creativity than FO4. I don't understand why they took such a big step back, other than some innate desire to continually simplify everything.
Okay so I’m not missing some legit strategy, the ship they give is simply not up to the task.
No ok wait, I need clarifications because I don't even understand what's the topic if not free experience. And I'm not even sure actually.

Can you explain it to me?
I would love that, I can only play Subnautica so many times
The last pirate you kill calls in the bounty right after you kill the first one.
Upgraded skills play a huge role in that as well.
I beat it legit, the way they meant for you too, hacks on the console lol
Or down the difficulty to easy. Changing the difficulty is a legitimate strategy.
It's possible. At least it was on release, not sure if any of the later patches have changed that. Use the station as cover, circle around and through and hit each ship one-by-one, avoid getting hit by the EMP weapons and max out your piloting skills beforehand.
If you max out the UC flight simulator, you get extra signing bonus and less time to get citizenship.
The 6th stage of the sim, the "canon, best of all time result" is 3 years. I honestly dont think it matters, or changes anything at all besides the cash you get.
I gotta walk into people's offices to talk to them when I'm on the same planet, but these pirates have intergalactic phones. Makes sense.
Crimson fleet be the most advanced pirates ever.
The moon that I'm on just crashed into a planet
Sorry for the dogshit camera work, I tried to capture it quickly when I realized what was happening 

Hats off to being able to play with those reflections.
Damn it vaporized that entire planet 🤣🤣
Moon stood its ground and wasn’t having any of it lol
How can you play with the Christmas lights mod enabled?  My ADD would have me roaming at the mouth after about 2 minutes.
Should've flown into the moon's core to restart its engine. Might have to fight off a crazy AI first though.
Reminds me of elite Dangerous.

In Elite Dangerous. There was a moon with an insanely fast orbital period of thirty minutes around a fuckin gas giant

The crazy part was there was a combat zone in its path.

If you were in the combat zone, you'd see this fuckin rock zooming at you like it's Majora's mask and destroy everything in its wake.

And due to how the simulation worked... It also fucked with the gravity too when it was approaching. And your FSD (how you jumped) would potentially get massed locked so you couldn't escape
Welp, Chewbacca's dead now.
That is... Both interesting and disappointing.
I'll never understand how people play or watch things on reflective screens like that.
So… that means you’re moonborn now?

Oh, I remember when that kind of thing happened in Elite Dangerous. Pretty much the same effect.
This is how baby planets are made.
At first I was like "oh cool they took into account random planetary physics, this massive collision will be cool to watch!"

Then reality set in.
Can you jump on?  I saw this done on futurama so it must be possible
Maybe… just hear me out here… just maybe you have too many mods installed?
Whoops
That’s not boring.
That is a cool moment for sure

Well if nobody else is gonna say it.

That's no moon
Bethesda: You're not playing it right.
Man this game sucks
GOTY...
So they didn't even bother to design the planets in a way that they wouldn't collide, and their failsafe is the planets are hollow... How disappointing
Perfect Game, 10/10, worthy of ALL the Awards!
Damn GOTY for sure. Ain't no game topping this
I have string lights around my room exactly like you do, and seeing the reflection in your screen broke my brain for a second!
Next gen creation engine wooooooo
I’d be so annoyed if I were waiting to see this forever and all it is is clipping entities
Omg..terrible game. Completely unplayable.
Ha ha, way to inertia, no mass
I actually love the idea of arriving on a planet and a cataclysmic even taking place. If the flying element was more intuitive it would be cool to have a mission that requires you to escape via your ship.
 My Megalophobia is triggering
Why are you not more excited. Real astronauts get excited by this.
Thats disappointing…
It just works
I’m not surprised it doesn’t do anything. But I’m more surprised they didn’t program the normals of the planets to be double sided. It would’ve been cool to ATLEAST see the planet form the inside out
So Bethesda coded orbits and such but could not do seamless travel?
Crappy Bethesda game. I was excited at 1st. Had a bit of fun at 1st. Then i got extremly pissed off at the "end" after grinding so hard.

10/10 will never play this game again.
The moon and the planets were not able to see with them reflections.
Ok, I'm not trying to be a jerk- I'm just trying to understand Starfield.

Because I was interested in the game but I've been seeing a lot of the usual bethesda bugs and I had made a comment somewhere and got told "It's not buggy at all, and you can't say it is until you play it yourself"

Every day I scroll through reddit someone is showing off another bug that is . . .REALLY immersion breaking. Entertaining? Sure. But like- 

This is worse than when a base would be in the ring of a planet in No Man's Sky when I was playing that. 

So, is this game the usual bethesda bug mess where you play it- deal with the bugs/wait for a fan patch or is this actually rare?

That's amazing. Thanks for sharing

Fucking hell how does that even happen
My God, it's full of stars!
I was wondering wtf planet that was with those rings for 0.1 second before realising they're fairy lights reflecting.

Nope. Just a normal glitch. Lol.
It honestly looks like a space nuke went off and the blast wave is heading towards you
Oooh maybe a future DLC of a dying planet could be cool! Have to hurry and escape before the planets merge and only thing is left is an asteroid field of debris resources that you can mine ?
this game has gotten wonkier since the update. I was looting dudes standing up the other day, they were dead, but they were still standing allowing me to loot. Does the planet come back after restart?
*Happy Mask Salesman laughing*
I had this bug yesterday. Was really weird. When i was in space, i was located directly at the planet. Don't know how I triggered this, but it pissed me off for like 10 minutes..
that was the coolest thing Id ever seen for about 5 seconds. damn
A bit anticlimactic
Its not a bug. Its a feature.
It’s like a million voices all screamed at once!
I saw this space 1990 episode. Pretty good
this is the kind of stuff i wanted to see in starfield. i purposely land on a planet close to another one or a sun but when i look out into space im never near anything. literally hundreds of planets landed on and i can’t find anything cool like this.
You've been playing for so long that the moon's orbit decayed.
Excuse me but that Christmas lights have to go lol
Thats awesome no loading screen.
It was a hologram, 0% matter.
I've seen this historical document.  It was called Moonfall
Good game 👍
Looks real and cool
More like: "... passed through a planet's surface". 😆
No...YOU were the planet all along...
"We're sorry that you didn't enjoy the moon crashing into the planet. In real life, moons crash into planets without warning all the time, and the inhabitants of those celestial bodies don't find it boring.

ITS FOWTNITE
This games getting more buggy with every day. I can barely play for 45 min without it crashing anymore
God they did such a half-ass job with starfield
Is this what they mean by the realistic empytness of space?
Did it crash into Alderaan? If so, that’s no moon?
Why wasn’t this voted as game of the year?
16 times the planetary impacts
Physics for that would of made the whole game a 10/10 alone.
This is the way the world ends

Reminds me of a game from a bit back called Planetary Annihilation - an RTS game where you could fight on all the planets in a solar system and ultimately construct giant drives to crash the smallest planets into whatever you wanted, with apocalyptic results.

Anyhow, in addition to the official maps, you could also play on player made or random maps - and every once in awhile you'd get a map where if the match lasted long enough the orbits of two planets accidentally aligned perfectly. So I remember a few games where I was having a knock out drag out fight on a two planet system, and then suddenly you realize - hey...that other planet seems to be getting really close. A split second later, the game is over, everybody dead, no more planets, no winners.
That’s because you unable to make a game that actually function. The best part about all of this is they are deflecting the criticism. If this is how they are treating The Elder Scrolls then we are screwed!!!

Thats the new Mod: play Starfield as a person playing Starfield on a cellphone viewing Starfield. Thanks Bethesda.
This would be awesome. A real doomsday scenario
That's how the moon was formed. Lmao
Welcome to Lamentis-1’s moon. :)
Hurry up and build a fucking outpost.
Wen forecast say 10% chance of thick fog
This happened to me a while back. It literally broke my game and I had to revert several saves back to fix
Lol nice. Hey is this game worth getting. I love space themed things and this looked fun.
You entered a simulation inside a simulation
I got a similar bug but with a moon
It's a feature
Btw you're on [this article ](https://www.jeuxvideo.com/news/1828298/ce-bug-impressionnant-de-starfield-fait-entrer-en-collision-2-planetes-et-personne-ne-s-attendait-a-ce-resultat.htm)
Super cool. Also you can hold down the screenshot button on your controller to take a last 30 seconds video clip. You can also adjust settings for that and make it longer.  

Then you can share videos without worrying about everyone commenting on your decor. 😜
I have nightmares of this happening really often, this video made me legit gasp. Kind of a silly reaction, but I haven’t been that scared by video game footage in a while! Would be cool as an intentional set piece somewhere instead of a weird glitch. I wonder how this even happened
I thought they were a graphic glitch from his tv
The camera is lower than their eyes so its probably not that bad
RTX on
That eould totally piss me off
Also r/tvtoohigh
All that next gen graphics and latest tv just to play it with those reflections🤦🏻🤦🏻
The camera is sitting on the desk and aiming up at the screen, chances are at Normal eye level those lights in the ceiling don't get noticed.
I think the camera sits at a way different angle than his eyes
I have a mild form of vertigo.

Just today I jumped into orbit around a planet and was this close and every time I looked at it I got dizzy. You could see the clouds moving at enormous speeds. I seriously had to face away from the planet to answer space grandma’s invitation.
eat shit spez you racist hypocrite
doesn't happen very often but it happens
It accidentally the planet

Is this dangerous?
The planet Went to the backrooms
Moon only survived because of cameraman.
Slay queen!!!
>roaming at the mouth

I'm trying to visualize that, but it's difficult.
That would frak up my aim so bad.
lol i thought that was a glitch until i read your comment
Roland Emmerich liked that.
I'm more disappointed that OP didn't pull out a minigun and recreate this scene: [https://youtu.be/0TDII5IkI3Y?si=oNzIJQd-yBWYQzbD&t=99](https://youtu.be/0TDII5IkI3Y?si=oNzIJQd-yBWYQzbD&t=99) (from Wandering Earth)
Lol, literally just finished watching Moonfall. What an awesome movie. The over the top love for Elon is sooooo cringe though.
Elite Dangerous sounds like an equally horrible and amazing game
Is this system still around? Do you still remeber the system name? That sounds awsome.
This happened last year, I was out in the black and couldn't make it back in time but apparently I'll have another chance next year.

https://youtu.be/5VZvBnOsNjc?si=FdwkCX0ujaY78QrF
That sounds fun, and terrifying.

I hate that I had to scroll this far down for someone to mention Chewie.
Sums up my experience with this game.
I mean, that's just a bug. Were you expecting a realistic planetary collision system?

Expectations for this game are truly the highest I have ever seen.
Just clipped through the skybox.
It's quite possibly the most interesting thing that's ever happened to anyone in this game.
It's Bethesda what else would you expect
Yes and this is one of the many things Bethesda straight up lied or misrepresented about this game.

They said, see those planets, they are actually there and orbit around each other.

Well we learned quickly that was not true and are just actually pictures
Couldn't of taken the time to type it out better
I bought a fancy-ass TV for movie watching, blackout curtains, surround sound, the whole 9 yards.

My wife insists on watching with the lights on, so all I see is the stupid reflections staring back at me.
I know, I have to play in a room completely devoid of light, otherwise, I'll go crazy!
This. This is the movie that highkey gave me a fear of such an unlikely scenario. lol
Scrolled too far to read this, makes me sad :(
No time for caution!
I figure they didn't expect this collision to happen much, and most game objects are hollow and not collidable unless there's a good reason to make them otherwise
Well it's a gas giant.
This is how the vast majority of games would work. Until the game register you as being on the surface of a planet (a specific game state triggered by specific actions), the planet is just a non-colliding sphere with a texture map. Then, then you switch game modes to a planetary surface, the surface is procedurally generated and rendered.

No Man's Sky actually does things a bit differently and generates the planet surface based purely on the player's proximity to it, so you do get hilarious scenarios where two planets are intersecting and you can jump from one to the other. But you can't play normally in any sense.
Why would they? It'd just be wasted processor cycles
\> So, is this game the usual bethesda bug mess where you play it- deal with the bugs/wait for a fan patch or is this actually rare?

It depends. Some people have had real issues, not been able to complete main missions, crashes etc.  Other haven't, I think I've had two crashes in 300hrs, and no mission breakers.  What you see on here is a population of nearly a million sharing bugs - in this case something that, judging by the comments, almost no one else has yet seen.
They nuked her…. They nuked her!
My thoughts too! The trackers alliance spacesuit, I was using Mk I forever and then I found this. Much better stats and looks sick.
Same lol
No they just put their Christmas lights up in November.
fr why are so many people acting like OP just duct taped their phone to their forehead for this lmao
I mean, that's not their eyes, that's where they put their phone real quick to capture this.  That's why the angle is so low. It's probably aiming up off a coffee table or something.
Wait a minute. This happens to me with stuff like this too. Is that what it is? Vertigo? 

Do you feel weird brain shit in elevators and on planes too?
Same. This game makes me dizzy sometimes but I still play it!
I noticed I started feeling an almost bouncing feeling in my brain when I was diagnosed with epilepsy 

Would you describe your condition as being like thisv
We play a game called Pulsar Lost Colony and I'm stuck in the pilots seat every time. I never experienced the vertigo in Starfield but for some reason need breaks every 5 minutes of flying in pulsar
Ginger is really good for that. My ex had it and she took it every day.
Thats a space station…
Might be a quantum moon?
Try harder 😏
No one else did
Yeah, it definitely has its good and bad points. Fun to watch, if you can ignore the super cringe parts. The whole car advertisement in the middle felt really out of place.
The sounds in Elite dangerous is indeed [horrifyingly](https://youtu.be/f-OTVKg2xI0?t=17)  [good](https://youtu.be/zB9UcaqG6zI)  
The hyperspace you travel trough is called witch-space for a good reason  


Also, playing this in VR is just amazing!
As a long time Elite Player, yes, yes it is. An amazing and horrible game.
One of the few games to give me sweaty palms, nothing will fill you with pure dread like jumping near a spinning pulsar or getting up close (relatively) to a black hole
It was great before the Odyssey DLC released, then they lost all the old terrain generation and replaced it with a new one that took 6 years of exploratory finds and interesting places that the community has found and turned them all to flat. Terrain generation is basically non-existent now, the entire games history of community finds have been wiped out, the new team has zero idea as to the history of the game, and absolutely everything is being pushed towards the first person shooter DLC that none of us wanted. I was there from the very beginning, and after many years the game has died for me, and so many others...

All this being said, this is also because I'm far more into galactic exploration than any of the other gameplay loops they have in it, and you might get a worthwhile's amount of enjoyment out of it so don't just take what I say at face value. 

I will give you a heads up though, while It's relatively short, the learning curve is incredibly steep, but definitely worth it.

O7
It was a great game until they completely abandoned consoles when they launched their last expansion
Moonshine must be talking about another moon because I assumed he was talking about [Mitterand Hollow](https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Mitterand_Hollow). It orbits an inhabited world every 86 seconds and is very much so still in the game as far as I know. It's one of the most popular destinations in colonized space in ED.
Sadly no
 It eventually got patched out
Oh. I think that's sword point?
Welp, time to go kill some Yuuzhan Vong
Cyberpunk 2077 has entered the chat

Due to how the game was marketed
>They said, see those planets, they are actually there and orbit around each other.  
>  
>Well we learned quickly that was not true and are just actually pictures

They ARE "pictures" (everything in a video game is pictures lol) but they 100% orbit around each other, and you CAN travel physically to/between them without using fast travel.  There is just zero point in actually doing so because getting to them doesn't allow you to land or otherwise interact, and you just clip through.  But the whole solar system and even the stars themselves are moving and modeled. When you are standing on any moon or planet you can watch the other bodies in the sky moving.

Here is a video about a boring ass flight from the orbit of Pluto to (and through) Pluto. Took 7 hour realistically: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3cHBEWN3xI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3cHBEWN3xI)

There is a mod that allows you to travel between planets. All it does it modifies the max speed so you can go insanely fast, so it isn't adding anything to the way solar systems are rendered or anything. Just your ability to travel within.  Modifying (increasing) speed is necessary because the base/vanilla speed of ships is actually insufficient to keep up with the speed the planets are orbiting, PLUS the actual distance things are apart from each other it'd take you days/weeks/months to travel.  But with a mod accelerating you to tens or hundreds of thousands of times faster than vanilla, you can make it and see the planets are really there. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtvOIBWFbt0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtvOIBWFbt0)

However, you "realize" that without the loading screens no ships or planet surface waypoints load in.

Honestly it's kind of insane that they modeled all of that (full solar systems orbiting) without the ability to land or actual-travel between (without a mod).  Your assumption that "they are just pictures" that don't actually orbit each other would actually make more sense in context of a game that 100% utilizes fast travel and loading screens.  I guess the orbital mechanics are just there to give us a good and accurate view while standing on a moon of the other planets/sun above?
What in gods name are you talking about? There actually are models of planets there orbiting each other. Literally what you just said isn't true.
>Couldn't of taken the time to type it out better

Sure *could of* taken the time to check what you're writing, though.
With the lights on, screw that
[deleted]
>  an unlikely scenario.

hey man, it hasn't happened in billions of years, that means we are due any day now
Good info, should've at least killed the player though
I've played Fallout 3 & 4 and Skyrim and the bug count and severity of bugs has been beyond any other game is why I ask. 

Like- I'm a big fan of scifi so the game interested me but not if the bugs I've seen are common. And for $70? Not a chance.
THAT'S THE TA Spacesuit!? DAMN son, might make me want to forego the >!Starborn!< suit for a while!
Majority of ~~people~~ Americans put them up the weekend after Thanksgiving.
Most people put there Christmas lights up the last week of November.
Thanksgiving is a Christmas holiday
Yes, it’s most prominent when I look up and have no horizontal reference, or can’t see the ground. My head starts spinning. I never get nauseous from it tho, so that’s nice. Just like my internal gyro starts wobbling. It’s not debilitating and one doc told me it’s like going weightless, you have to put yourself in the experience long enough for your brain to learn to compensate.

One time I went to NYC and took the tour of 30 Rock. On the observation deck I looked up without holding onto anything and immediately got dizzy and fell over. It doesn’t hurt, well except for the falling part, just disorienting for a second.

I actually did it several times with family members holding me so I wouldn’t fall, it was pretty entertaining for the few people around.
Vertigo is when you move your head in a certain direction and you suddenly feel like you’re doing zero gravity flips or something. It can happen when you’re looking at something in a game and your brain gets confused by the false horizon moving quickly also. Could be elevators and planes for you, hard to say.
Yep. Google Earth also freaks me the fuck out if I zoom out too far. I would make a terrible astronaut.
Some people are not able to integrate their visual field with their vestibular system well. Sometimes they have ocular disorders. Sometimes they don't and it's some type of breakdown in their central vestibular system. These people will get dizzy when the visual field does not correlate with the input from their peripheral vestibular and tactile system.
Get your ear crystals checked. It sounds insane but look it up.
It's a trap!
And then there's the moment when you realize (most) black holes are entirely toothless and start fucking around by flying your ship into the lens distortion effect.
The black holes in Elite for me were so underwhelming. Especially at SagA.
Why? Sounds like an amazing player experience
No idea, bugs usually evade logic. Maybe it is related to the dynamic orbits somehow affecting the skybox?
Because Starfield isn't as instanced as everybody thinks. 

Just like how it was shown that planetsry coordinates are static and the "randomly generated tiles" are connected, it has also been shown that your skybox isn't really a skybox. 

The game simulates your entire system. Every planet and moon spin and orbit accurately within your current system. There probably is a box for the distant stars but everything local is simulated.

I know everybody is laughing at Todd's 'that moon, you can go there" but I actually think it's not just a texture painted in the sky. There is a moon object that is rotating and orbiting accurately through the atmosphere
The Direct accurately describes the game to a T. People then just continue to make shit up that Bethesda has never mentioned.
I love how all OP said was that they were disappointed with something clearly immersion breaking and ofc some strawman comes out of the woodwork with the extreme “What, did you expect full planetary collision? Nowhere did Bethesda ever say they were implementing full planetary collision!”

Like it’s ok to be disappointed with a friggen planet disappearing from the sky. That would take me out of it too.
Mate the game was never marketed to have planetary collisions what the fuck.
If you're going to correct someone, you might want to also be correct.

It's "could have" - remember it as saying "I have done this" vs "I could have done this" and it makes sense.
Not. Helping. 

Although.. I am genuinely curious about the science behind this.. But honestly, I think I'll take the 'Ignorance is Bliss' route here.
Yo, chill. I gotta sleep on this planet.
I've also played FO3/4/Skyrim and Starfield is nowhere near as buggy. (for me, YMMV)
For Americans it's after Turkey Day, for us Europeans it's usually around Saint Nicholas Day (the 6th of December), and I think Aussies just use the start of the month, but it's weird for them because their Christmas break is also their summer break.

That said, I think there's plenty of variation among family groups, like I read a [YouGov survey](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/entertainment/survey-results/daily/2023/11/24/7093b/2) that suggests 17% of Brits put up decorations before December, while the majority (44%) are split evenly between the first vs. second week of December.

In any case, it seems odd that people are arguing over when to put tinsel and baubles up. Just enjoy the season, one and all :3
Thus is the way.
Within the first ten seconds after Thanksgiving, I sprinted at top speed to the garage and shot-putted the boxes of decor into the house. I’m unapologetically festive.
It's only because after Halloween, big box stores barf up Christmas crap all over the walls. Consumers get wide-eyed like puss in boots. 👀
Americans are wrong
[deleted]
That doesn't make sense
Yeah vertigo is no joke, I don't get it often but when I do it sticks around for days at 100% I'm talking continously spinning, eyes shifting side to side trying to focus, nausea and headache.  I can't do anything but take meds, lay in the bed and pray it passes soon.  Usually takes about 3 days to pass.  Last time I got it, doing decline bench presses.  Finished my set, got up and sat back down, then got sick.  Spent the next 3 days in bed.  I hate it, i assume its similar to being on a drug you never consented to taking and the drug has no positives or enjoyment effects, just the bad trip part.
Thankfully I dont have this also because super heights freak me out a little bit. We went to the Willis Tower in Chicago and did the glass cube over hang thing. I can look in it but when It came time to get in it I had to back into it and only for a minute. Also one time at work I was on a lift and had to fix the flag at the front of the building. Like all the way on top of a big box store and it was windy. I thought it would be cool to get a pic of the parking lot. As soon as I turned around "the oh shit" hit me and I had to turn back around and stare at the flag the whole time.
fyi you can actually do physical therapy for vertigo

source - my mom just did it and she said it seemed to have fixed hers at least temporarily
Vertigo is the perception of spinning; labeled differently depending on whether you feel the room spinning around you (objective vertigo) or if you feel as if you are spinning (subjective vertigo). 

It is a symptom, but not a cause. It can be caused by head movement (eg., benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) but not always. It is a symptom and its cause should be investigated.
I’ve got a bad feeling about this.
Couldn't tell you. But I can give you a video of something funny. Coriolis Station Noob Hammers

Some context here.

Some Corolis type stations (They literally look like d20s) are equipped with structures that I do not know what purpose they serve, but they look like giant hammers. All stations in the game rotate to generate artificial gravity, and these giant hammer structures are on the perfect plane to maximize it.

Now... A quick refresher or centripetal motion. If you put one point near the center, and the next point further out, the furthest point must move faster to stay aligned with the point near the center.

This means there's a looooot of energy on those noob hammers.

Soooo. What sometimes happened is players would go to a station without knowing they are equipped with noob hammers. And will drop out of Super Cruise (In System FTL, kinda like Pulse Drives from No Mans Sky) to dock at the station at just the right angle they were in line with these hammers path.

And the moment their ship decelates enough for them to control it... This shit happens

https://youtu.be/NNh9rsyC6bk?si=4BJC_bjnnf9p4MbM

And here's a second one.

In elite, you can increase your jump distance by flying into the jet cones of neutron stars and white dwarfs. They're incredibly beautiful to look at. But some are very..... Uuuuhm

See time stamp 1:22. If you want to see a "normal one" watch at the beginning 

https://youtu.be/KWTS9KrRxSI?si=-n9tI6h-RfVksnAs

A nother scary as fuck neutron star

https://youtu.be/HCBeHxscCEE?si=UKs9Idip4izGWdrA

And few commanders dare to take the jet cones of white dwarfs. Because they are... Particularly dangerous in how massive their exclusion zones are. An exclusion zone is how close you can get to a celestial object before you're forced out of super cruise due to gravitational forces.

https://youtu.be/YQj53QKli4k?si=Hq3t0jJgUxBvjPkw

And one last one.

This is a very interesting planet the community calls the world of death.

This planet orbits dangerously close to a neutron star. But what's more insane is that its path actually takes it through the jet cones.

https://youtu.be/4nxhxOANCj0?si=BnnXQs7VNQtYpbt_

If you're flying around in your ship, it'd kill you. But as long as you're landed you can survive.
That’s because they are all still waiting to find some piece of this game that pushes gaming forward or is novel in some way. It’s really only that within the games Bethesda has released and just barely.
Yeah, if you’re not gonna have the collision, make it so they don’t run into each other.
I think you missed the joke...
Cheers, I'll keep an eye out for a sale and grab it eventually.
In the Philippines, they put up Christmas decorations in \*September\*
No
At least you waited until after Thanksgiving.  I was seeing houses with lights up and trees in the window starting shortly after Halloween, so I applaud your restraint. 
I usually put my lights up the weekend after Thanksgiving just because I have plenty of time on the long weekend, and it's hopefully not way too cold outside yet (and it's only going to get colder.)  I usually wait until December before I get around to setting up the tree.
Stores near me started dropping christmas stuff in October.
boat upbeat rhythm innocent seemly bored uppity compare grandfather axiomatic

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*
How original...
You're just factually incorrect. Roughly 70% Americans who decorate put their lights up between Thanksgiving and Black Friday. 

Some even do it in October!
Sounds a lot like when I was in high school and smoked my friends weed. What I didn’t know was that his had wayyyyyyy more THC than I had smoked before and I was just panicking and spinning and unable to communicate for like three hours. I’m not trying to diminish your experience at all by being like ‘haha drugs’ I can’t even imagine having to go through that somewhat regularly and with no prior warning, I’m sorry you have to deal with it
Hey, it sounds like you might have BPPV, (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.) If so, you might want to learn the Home Epley maneuver! 

"BPPV is caused by a problem in your inner ear. Your semicircular canals are found inside your ear. They detect motion and send this information to your brain. The utricle is a nearby part of the ear. It contains calcium crystals (canaliths) that help it detect movement.

Sometimes these crystals detach from the utricle and end up inside the semicircular canals. When these crystals move inside the canals, they may send incorrect signals to your brain about your position. This can make you feel like the world is spinning. This is called vertigo."

"Dr. John Epley designed a series of movements to dislodge the crystals from the semicircular canals. These movements bring the crystals back to the utricle, where they belong. This treats the symptoms of vertigo."

https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/home-epley-maneuver#:~:text=The%20utricle%20is%20a%20nearby,your%20brain%20about%20your%20position
I had that a few years ago. Went to my useless primary care physician at the time and she just told me "It's self limiting." I'm like yeah your mind is self limiting too yet here we are. Well I didn't say that part out loud haha.

So I went online and did some research and found a Physical Therapist that treats vestibular disorders and after one treatment my vertigo was gone and never came back. Good riddance.
But they don't, it's a bug
Appears so! That's what I get for reading reddit right after waking up. I'll take the down votes in stride.
I mean I have to go through the time and effort to put them up it might as well be to enjoy them a bit longer.
First week of September. They replaced back to school stuff with some Christmas stuff. Then slowly grew it as they pushed out the Halloween. That's when they did it here.
Ladies and Gentlemen, this man is 248 years, 7 months, and 27 days old.
[deleted]
You went from "most people" to "70% Americans". You realize how ridiculous that sounds?
How self centered are you? Your country is not the world. Where I live nobody puts up Christmas decorations until the 8th of December.
Well, I'm an American, and I don't put mine up until right before Christmas. 😂 To each their own, though 🤷‍♂️
No diminishing at all, that's literally how it feels.   I probably should never try weed just in case it triggers an episode.   Dont want that problem anymore often than i need to. lol
Oh yes, I do that maneuver several times a day during an episode.  My doctor confirmed that the crytals in my ear did detach.  It takes a couple of days to get them put of wack, so to say.  The good news is, it only happens once every few years.
Why not put them up in mid-December and then leave them up until February because you can't be arsed to take them back down like everyone else?
its pretty standard to put decorations out after thanksgiving. Are you gate keeping holiday cheer lol Grinchassmfer
"most people in America ***that decorate***" so even fewer
70 % of Americans *who decorate*, which is reporteldy 84 %.

So it's something like what 60 % of Americans.
> How self centered are you?

They're just human, with a normal brain that doesn't take into account the entire world all the time.  I'd be willing to bet that you probably inadvertently do the exact same thing making statements like this when your brain is really only referring to your social group, your city, your country.  Stop being an ass.
It’s not just the US. Lots of Hispanic cultures start in early November.
Same here, hence the suggestion. It's a real bastard when it hits.
You're still taking them back down in February lol.  Work holidays in the US have trained us to just associate Christmas with the immediate end of Thanksgiving.
Eh, just leave it up all year. It’s what I did last year lol.
[deleted]
That is still most Americans. And that’s probably where they live. I don’t see the point in nitpicking what he said. It’s fine. 

I’m not American but non-Americans on Reddit have a nasty habit of shitting on Americans simply because they’re American. 

It’s funny a few times but I don’t think making fun of the guy for having Christmas lights 2 days before December starts is a good use of anyone’s time lol.
That doesn't change the fact that they said "most people" when only referring to people from the US
Hang on, theres … other people? I don’t believe you. Keeping my tree up all year long to spite you stranger. Yes that’ll show you
I'd wager the demographics of this particular reddit page lean heavily towards American though.
Dude has too much time lecturing about reddit being a global platform lol. Gotta be right though, right?
I'm gonna take a wild guess - some people take a piss out of Americans when the latter believe USA is the center of the universe.

In my country 60 % decorate their Christmas trees on 23rd. Another 25 % on 24th. I'd not confidently go and claim "most people" do it like this. Actually thinking about it, do Americans even have Christmas trees?
We don't all put our trees up in November. That statistic is speaking of the majority who participated in those polls.
Who cares?
Well they provided a source for a large population. Wheres your source proving most people in the world who celebrate Christmas don't put lights up in November?

Please add filters to the star map, like those on google maps.  It would be a huge QoL improvement to easily see where shipyards or settlements I've visited are.  It should not be necessary to consult a website to figure this out.
I would like to be able to rotate my 2x1 habs horizontally
Can we open doors in scanner mode? Also, can we take resources in scanner mode as we can see in scanner mode? :D
Can we make smuggling actually matter? Like, differing prices depending on where the contraband is, and a risk that matters instead of just flying straight to wolf system without the need for shielded cargo and jammers?

Edit: actually, let’s make ship fueling a thing too…
I’m honestly not asking for much. I’m going to lean on the exploring side of the game. Just give me some kind of journal to document the flora and fauna I kind. If Hogwarts Legacy, and Fallen Jedi can have one. A game about explorers should have one.
“New ways to travel” 100 bucks says it’s a fast travel menu.
I'm really excited for mod support, I've become a software developer since the last Bethesda release so now I can actually think of things to add into the game and do it myself.
I hope “new gameplay options” includes a survival mode with actual environmental effects. Survival mode turned FO4 into a great game for me and gave settlements a real purpose. Hopefully Starfield gets something similar, with outposts needed to reach farther corners of the system and crafting needed to have spacesuits capable of surviving on intense planets.

Edit: As some commented, the linked article specifies “new survival mechanics”. Hopefully this means expanding the environmental and spacesuit systems because the current system of how spacesuit resistances impact affliction rates is confusing. For example, it should be more understandable what thermal resistance value would be required to survive a given time on a very hot planet.
If you do survival lean away from save restrictions and lean more into immersion. Fuels for ships. Food buffs. Realistic debuffs from not meeting needs/varied diseases for planets.
Can we get classic looting back? I hate having to check my corpses to see if I looted them. Before it was so easy. If they are in their undies I looted them.
>our first story expansion

So that means we're getting at least 2?
"New ways to travel"  
I wish you were a little more specific with this actually means. This could be anything from a drivable rover on planets to just a drop down menu that lets us more easily fast travel to main cities without having to open the star chart.
“New ways to customize your ships” better be manual door and ladder placement. The fact that the game just places them wherever it wants makes building your dream ship essentially impossible.
Please give us a quest to give Cora books!!! And a bookshelf on the ship for her. ♥️🤞
"we'll also be expanding on ship customization with ship decorations, new ship building options, and more."

  
Here's hoping there is some interior decoration, I'd like it if the interiors also had colours that could match my exteriors, also you know, choosing where doors and ladders can go  


"These will allow you to easily customize carry capacity, cargo access distance, ship damage, vendor credits, how you suffer afflictions, new survival mechanics, and more."

well the players who aren't happy with the selling should be better now, also I do like choice of having more in depth difficulty options rather than just a basic one, suffering afflictions seems interesting to me cause I want to suffer afflictions from enemy fire if their weapon has bleeding effects then I should get an actual affliction, so I have to use correct stuff to remove it.

Modding of course, I've not go into modding myself, mainly just cause, updates can ruin them , and I guess I want to use now with the CK how far the mods will go, already the simple scripting is cool

Always like expansions that add more gear and places

The thing I'm hoping for is actually taking the random poi's that exists and add variations to them, so if you do run across the same one, it can still have a completely different feel
To go along with the exploration theme, how about a way to catalog systems, planets, locations, etc? A way to save them for quick and easy access. Maybe a way to add notes to the catalog.
“-New gameplay options to further adjust difficulty.”

Please be a survival mode with food/water/oxygen management and increased damage like Fallout 4.

And I’ll play this game forever.
> New ways to customize your ships  
  
Hopefully this includes being able to choose where doors and ladders get placed
If you all are amenable, one QOL improvement I would suggest is allowing us to take images we create in photo mode and apply them to the "Picture" item in the build menu.

We're already allowed to capture images, why not allow us to actually use them in game?

Thanks and Happy Holidays!
I wish there was a possibility to add gore, or at least bullet hole decals on bodies.
We need a vehicle for exploring planets. It's takes too long to get around and takes away from the experience
I liked the game, but it can be greatly improved. I am sure folls at Bethesda are working hard over this game, and I just wanted to add a few things that I personally feel can improve the experience greatly -

1) Perk trees need to be redesigned. Some trees are not worth the cost. Fast reloading should not take a 10 point investment. Crafting sights, spacesuits or weapons should not be hidden behind Perk trees, atleast the initial levels should be free.

2) Decorations should cost money, not resources. It worked in fallout because there was no functioning economy as per lore, but Starfield should not have this issue. Habs / power sources makes sense, decorations do not. Also better beds / chairs / TVs should not be locked 10 points behind a perk.

3) POI generation - every planet does not need to have 5 ships landing near you, or have some cryo / robotics lab. And also it would.be great if the interiors are randomised, instead of experiencing the same 3 layouts over and over. Some POI's which were rare made me appreciate them more just because they were rare.

4) A difficulty revamp. Story and medium are fine (albeit a bit too easy !), hard has way too many bullet sponges. I would prefer to fight a larger group of enemies than fighting 1 dude having 5 bars of health

5) Actual survival options, it is odd that suit resistances amount to nothing. More brutal worlds would make exploration a lot better.

6) Interplanetary flight / system jumping should be a lot smoother. We should be able to fly between planets of the same system (perhaps some sort of a cruise speed depending upon your reactor?). Loading screens in general could be reduced, no need to wait for airlocks and then encounter a loading screen.

7) Instead of a cutscene, let us experience the entry / exit from atmosphere when landing / leaving from a planet. We can already see it when playing a few missions or when we board a ship about to take off, and it looks cool to boost away from the surface into the sky.

8) A 40 FPS version for Series X. Please I beg you it would make this game play and feel 100x better just with VRR.
Are they ever going to fix the bugged skills?

Shield Systems and Rejuvenation are the ones I'm familiar with.

I mean, it's hard to play a build if the skills don't work as described, or at all.
Looking forward to more ship building customizations and bug fixes
Good to have a schedule, at least.
I am absolutely in love with the ship builder that you guys have come up with, I'd just like something to do with that ship other than take screenshots of it! I have to actively inconvenience myself in-game (deliberately run to the launch pad, board through hatch instead of straight-to-cockpit, manually take off and select destination through scanner - all instead of fast travel through menu) to have any reason to use it.

I'd also love if we could station crew members on our other ships, and send them on missions or assign them as personal escorts. Or even just display the ships at an outpost. Really just any reason to have more than 1 ship.

I like the ships.

spaceship!
I should be able to fast travel to my apartments/property.
So they don’t plan on fixing the game is what I am reading. Not really a priority
So curious what "new ways to travel" will be like. And yay for new ship parts! And pleeease include survival mode and fuel consumption as options for gameplay!

Edit: And I would love a way showcase different ships from your fleet at secondary landing pads at your outpost!
All this should have been in the base game, but go ahead...
The biggest ask I have if for less obvious cookie-cutter constructs. The game is obviously bigger than other Bethesda games but it does not feel that way at all because I've explored the same abandoned lab a dozen times, somehow having the same named people/corpses/skeletons within these and they are all in separate star systems. Really lame.
Take your paid mods and stick em where the sun dont shine.
Can I just get quest bug fixes so I can "talk" to Delgado and also Run the Red Mile. That'd be great.
Hopefully new ways to travel means land vehicles
Please add more ship exploration options. A lot of us enjoy ship building, but only having options to FT from space box to space box is not enough. I'm Not alone here. Otherwise I'm excited to see what you do in the future!
No one thought city maps should just be part of the game? We suppose to be celebrating this, feels more like enabling to me.
A six-week term is ridiculous because this is not an MMO and not a game that can be played continuously. I might as well just come a year later.
>Official mod support with the launch of Creations

I hope "Creations" stands for "Creation Kit", and not for something else.
Heeeellll yeah. I wish they were faster paced but 6 weeks isn’t too bad if they’re larger, meaningful updates. I’m eager for the maps, travel, and difficulty options :)
Please include minimizing limiting the repeating NPC sentences. Especially from the Crimson Fleet during the quest.  As well as between Cora and SAM. They are the entire reason I play with the sound off. Dusty.DUSTY.DUSSTYYYYYYYY
Wait wait wait…Sense Star Stuff was the most used power, not Personal Atmosphere?!
Took three months for man to add a map 😂
I wanna know who was the genius at bethesda to look at the current map status and say that's a great idea
Would have been nice to have city maps BEFORE I finished the entire game.
Please fix the recycler script bug in the Dynamic Form ID generation logic already.  
I'm not trying to be impatient, but it's been over 1 1/2 months since first reported and it's becoming detrimental for longtime players in their settled NG+ and modders alike.
Y’all have A LOT of work to do. Best of luck!
The POI system needs a revamp. Exact duplicates are too frequent to keep the experience believable. Ship landing is too frequent to make you feel alone. And some planets should be devoid of signs of human visitation so you can actually feel like you are the first person to visit.
Ah, the infamous "Release it broken, fix it later, reap the profits now" mentality of current "triple A" gaming studios.

Pass. Here's a better idea, Bethesda.

Take the money earned from Fallout 4, Skyrim, Starfield, and the suckers who still pay for Fallout 76 and provide an all expenses paid training session to every single developer to work with the Unreal Engine.

Let them explore, play, and build with an actual game engine that's suited for today's technology so they can finally rid themselves of the 30 year piece of shit the company refuses to stop working with.

Think you can do that before you fuck up another Elder Scrolls title?
Personally, I would just love to be able to abandon quests/activities that get added to my list just because some random NPC said something near me.
Slow ass updates and small ambitions. You really have fallen Bethesda.
Passion?!? 

"Meh" is about as positive as I can be for Starfield, in it's present state :(

It was shockingly disappointing to find: basically \~4 - 5 types of animals/plants (or less) on each planet I've seen so far, TINY cities, you can't fly your ship around planets (seriously?!?), droll insipid terribly boring NPCs (most of them anyway).  

It's 2023 - WHY do we still have NPCs that basically just randomly walk around, and maybe sit down once in a while.  JFC - give them jobs/lives/activities, things they do as groups both work and play, daily routines, etc.???!???  Even Skyrim's NPCs were less disappointing than the bulk of the ones in Stanfield.
How about trying to hire competent writers?
almost had me there...believing it would be an actual game update at the end of the year... nice "roadmap" for 2024...

 adding maps for cities and new ways to travel to the same repeating POIs over and over again.🙌🙌
4 months since release, 0 major updates. Not quite matching the "fallout standard," are we?
The biggest thing that could be done is more POI variation
It's nice that you're pushing these updates, but they should have been in the game at launch.

You also need to fix your horrible UI and not leave it up to the SkyUI mods.

You've had experience with both Skyrim and Fallout 4, so you cannot use the excuse of not knowing the community's opinions.
Please fix the Dynamic Form ID generation bug before you add more items into the game that require IDs thus speeding up the eventual crash and loss of ones save file.
Don’t we need more use for the ships before they become more customisable?
Hurray! Those are some much needed updates. I also love the game, but agree there are so many areas of opportunity.  This update has me excited!

Can you get rid of the load screens between the vendors? Whats up with those?
Hey all - [more details here](https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/37j5d4CbPfYlZqJKcVtGcY/starfield-end-of-the-year-update-2023)!

To clarify, this list is some of our plans for Starfield updates throughout 2024. We're not quite ready to share the specific changes included in February's major update, but you can expect that information closer to the update itself.
I'm really happy for anyone that is still enjoying the game. That said, this is nowhere near enough to bring me back. It will be 5 months since release by the time the Feb update happens. 

As a software dev I have absolutely no idea how such little progress has been made. Iterative development is the name of the game in video game development, any game dev will tell you the studios are obsessed with it. So how the fuck they've done this little in a hundred days is completely beyond comprehension. 

I've released and completed, more working alone on my own software projects than this entire studio have since release.

I don't really understand, unless the game has been dropped down the list of priorities due to poor reception.
Will you be fixing the bug on PC where ships don't open? I can't steal ships anymore because when they land they don't open the door. I can also board Starborn ships as part of the bug. Others have said I shouldn't even try Sam's companion quest because I won't be able to complete it while I have this bug.
Fantastic, I can’t wait!
Starfield was a massive disappointment and no patch can fix the fundamental gameplay loop problems that are at the heart of the game.

Bethesda will have to do much much better with Elder Scrolls 6.
New ways to travel better be some small vehicle to travel the surface with and not another loading screen
I wish there was the option to pick decor in your purchased homes like Skyrim had. The customization of the outpost style building is nice, but carrying enough resources to outfit the apartment is literally crushing my character. 

That and captains habs with a double bed- I’m married, my wife shouldn’t be stuck in a bunk bed
Hey, did you know that Rejuvenation levels 3/4 and every level of Rapid Reload don't actually do anything?

But sure let's add more difficulty levels and modes of travel.
Loved the game and can't wait for the update.
[deleted]
Hope everyone here has enough points in Reading Comprehension to understand they're not saying all these features are coming in that February update.
Too little too late. Played a lot and got bored. It really just felt lacking.
“Further mod support with the launch of creations.” I’ve been pretty certain for a while that paid mods for Starfield are going to launch at the same time they release the CK, with “Verified Creators” having gotten early access to the CK.
I've been waiting for more starfield content and was hoping to get some sooner but I'm glad we are finally getting some news
In the article, it mentions vendor credits being a new “difficulty” option. I really hope that means we can increase the amount they have so we don’t have to keep waiting for credits to refill to sell our loot at vendors.
What about a player exploration compendium or journal to record landmarks, planets , plants, animals, we’ve seen. Red Dead Redemption 2 had a really good system for this. Seems like a no brainer for Starfield.
Add commanding our companions too, it was even in Skyrim!
I'd personally like some clarification on whether they mean creations, as in.. the creation kit, or do they mean creations as in.. the creation club?

One of these things provides full modding support and opens a whole new universe of doors and possibilities.

The other is essentially a scam.
Proper maps finally thank God. These surface maps are TERRIBLE and easily my biggest gripe with the game
Im on a hiatus from the game until there is a terminal that lets me remotely manage resource production from distant but linked machines.

Like if Im funneling resources to a 'main base' and all my containers are starting to fill up with iron, I want to log into a terminal and start shutting down iron production on remote bases. Having to refer to my hand written notes on paper to figure out what planet is producing iron and then fly there to manually start shutting off machines - its not fun gameplay.

I also want to be able to earmark containers so they only store inbound items that I have approved so that I dont go off to do some quests and then come back to find my entire factory is again shut down because all the containers are full of iron or some other less utilized resource.
City maps is a great start but can we PLEASE have dungeon maps with a "fog of war" type thing to reduce back tracking when we're trying to clear/loot places? Also can we PLEASE have a codex that lists locations of visited planets/discovered resources (mineral+flora+fauna)
With the update every 6 weeks, does this mean that most mods will stop working every 6 weeks and need to be updated?
Okay but can you fix the bug that doesn’t let me access my save without crashing the game
u/BethesdaGameStudios_ BUT ARE YOU GUYS FIXING THE GHOST SHIPS PLEASE I BEG YOU LMAOO
The game doesn't need Creations for the official mod support. Skyrim did that for many years without it. You can be fairly sure that Creations will be in the first update before anything else in the list. Monetizing is priority like we have a nearly perfect product already.

And for those who compares the game with the launch of Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk was already a solid game at launch. Almost all of the problems was related to bugs and ai, they were solvable. The good story was still there. Even if Bethesda solves all of the optimization problems and add some QoL features in the future, the story and dialogues are overly simple, shallow. The company will not add more Starborn dialogue options, will not make dialogues more realistic, the NPCs will still looks like almost static statues. No hand movements while talking, no gestures. Face it Bethesda, these interactions are outdated. 

I am really happy I finished the game with this Xbox PC subscription thing. No need to pay the full price.
It's so fucking scary how they aren't saying ANYYTHHIINGG about how they're going to monetise the game or implement the mod store. They soft launched it in Skyrim **just** to determine the level of backlash that they might see, they're clearly scared as fuck because they know full well what they're going to drop is going to piss off the entirety of what's left of their fanbase.
I like that two of the aspects which are being included into this update are things which have been existing in games for years now. Morrowind which came out in 2002 has city maps and Oblivion which came out in 2006 has horses which are that games version of vehicles. It's amazing at just how bad Bethesda managed to drop the ball when it came to this game.
Cool. Though the only problem is that many people on this forum have already kind of "played the game through". So these features are coming kind of late.
Thanks for letting me know and have a good holiday. I hope the future updates will fully realize your vision for this game. Excited for mod support, but Creations have me seriously worried for modding compatibility. I would love the jump animation to stay on whatever perspective I choose instead of switching from first to third at random.
Awesome! I’m hoping this means mods for console? I can’t wait to see what direction Shattered Space takes us!
[deleted]
The game is ok, but it's missing something to be great. Stopped playing for now. Waiting for the update in February. Hope it's a survival mode, in system travel, fuel consumption, oxygen consumption and actually dangerous planets and a better and logical poi system. Thank you for your work!
This isn’t confirming the dlc for Feb is it, just that it’s in the works?
This is awesome news, thanks for the transparancy!

Really excited for the new story expansion and all these upcoming updates.

Official mod support with the creation kit is also going to be really cool. The potential for mods in this game is honestly insane — I’m hoping for a Star Wars planet mod among all the other cool stuff that will be modded into the game.

And keep it up, I’m really loving the game despite some of its flaws. I’m very glad to see you guys will keep on improving it!
The game should have been finished before you released it
Five months for a professional development team to implement city maps on a game that's going to be completely dead a couple weeks from now.

Starfield - and Bethesda - are fucked.

EDIT: And Jesus Bethesda, there's also really only one city that needs the fucking map.
Funny how people get excited over some vague updates and timelines
You can actually hear a pin drop with this announcement.

Because everyone has already uninstalled the game.
Can't believe you released a game without city maps (For the 5? cities in the game.) and thought it complete.

What a joke.
All i can say is people here are having high hopes for Bethesda . They took 2 months to add a simple FOV slider and DLSS. 

And some of bugs in original skyrim are still present in the Skyrim special edition after 10 yrs haha
Are you going to do anything that actually makes the game enjoyable? You copy/pasted every single damn asset possible and inevitably made the game a sterile idea. The same cave, mining facility, helium factory, etc should not be the same exact thing on every planet, let alone on the same planet. It is extremely lazy, there is much more wrong with the game but this is my biggest critique. Id also like to know if you were rushed to release Starfield because of Microsoft shareholders or have you just become lazy because of the silver spoon in your mouth & thought it was perfect as is? I really wanted to enjoy Starfield, on paper it seems like it could be a g.o.a.t RPG. All your updates don't seem to address much in fixing what's truly wrong with the game. Why did you underutilize the physics engine so much too? There's a lot under the hood from what I've heard from my friends that mod your games but it's barely been tapped by you the people that created it. I'm willing to wait a couple of years to see if you can actually attempt to make Starfield a good game, if not I'm gonna just boycott the shit out of es6 & ive been a fanboy since Morrowind and aware of bethesda since daggerfall. I'm aware that this comment is partially undirected to what this post is about but I've been waiting for an opportunity to say this to Bethesda and not a stranger on the Internet
Thanks for all of your hard work! Looking forward to the updates!
Is it just me, or does it sound like we're not getting actual mod support, but just the paid mod BS?
What a nothingburger.

So folks are literally begging for bug fixes to just be able to play the game, months after release.

Instead of a patch now or even any concrete commitment customers get…an announcement of an announcement.

With vague promises about a list of loosely-defined features “throughout the year”.

With releases “roughly” (so, definitely not) every six weeks - a month and a half. And starting now apparently.

And apparently, of the six major features Bethesda is willing to tease over the next year, city maps is #1.

Fucking clown shoes.
We really need 60fps on XBSX…
Thanks for the game, happy holidays!
*Six week* intervals for.. let’s face it—- mediocre improvements at best? 

**New ways to travel**—- presumably across the surface of those barren planets without anything on them.  It’s your fault though if you can’t find enjoyment on those lifeless rocks—- “real” planets are just as boring!

**City maps**—- in case you managed to get lost in the single-city block available in each “city”. 

**New ways to customize your ships!**—- there still won’t be any real reason to use them though, especially if you side with the Crimson Fleet.


**Official mod support**—- you’d figure this one would have been implemented from the very beginning to give the playerbase all of the tools to bolster their otherwise lackluster title. 


**Our first story expansion, Shattered Space**—— *there* it is! That’s the reason that everything will get dragged out, milked, and otherwise neglected; priority first and foremost at the behest of the shareholders is profit. Can’t maximize that if you’re busy spending valuable resources on old shit people have already been suckered into buying.


TLDR: Priority is obviously selling supplemental content and not rectifying the turd sandwich they’ve successfully marketed to the masses.
Hey Bethesda, love the game and it's my personal GOTY! Looking forward this!
Please investigate buggy outpost game play. Including crashes that increase around outpost game play.
I'd appreciate if the checks for atmospheric conditions were more strict.

I've caught NPCs, even followers frolicking suitless on airless moons.

If a NPC goes around unsuited on Mars, I expect the NPC to suffocate and other NPCs to freak out.
I just want to sort quests by location
A motorcycle, land speeder , jet pack that lets you travel instead of bunny hop. 
Or just a saddle to ride a fuckin land crab 🦀 🥳🥳🥳👌🫡
We need a codex please for our scans!  

Thanks to you guys for your work and support.  Happy holidays
Can someone get an intern to work on controller settings over there? Dead zone settings are mandatory for modern drift prone controllers and Starfield lacks this basic feature. It's already a console command on PC so it should just be a quick UI fix that could be done in an afternoon.
So excited! I love the game, but these updates will flesh the game out more. I can't wait for the first story expansion!
All I want is series x optimisation.
Can ya’ll just fix phased time sticking/crashing the game? I mean ya’ll fixed the money glitch almost immediately, but this one still exists? Can’t wait to play the new DLC and not being able to use the best power in the game!!! I’m also getting close to the hours required to corrupt my save. I’m so pumped!!
Another vote for ship blueprints & code sharing!
Can’t wait
Awesome, can't wait for the expansions. Hope your staff can get some r&r too, though.
Reading this kinda feels like Starfield is in early access… starting in 2 months to update necessary content… so 5-6 months after release. 

Feels like waiting for final cyberpunk all over again.
The pipedream I have for "new ways to travel" is either vehicle bay modules for our ships, or each landing bay having a different drivable vehicle (motorcycles for smaller ones, rovers for larger ones). Add in a shuttle bay or air options for the vehicle bays that unlock a shuttle for suborbital flight. Touch down in the predetermined landing zone for your main ship, and then take off in your 2-person shuttle to fly around. In my head, they would work a lot like the shuttles in Firefly. Add a scanner to that and all of a sudden it's useful for traveling to POIs, finding locations for outposts, joyrides, whatever. Let NPCs use their own, and now you've got dogfights above some enemy bases before you invade on ground level, or sneak in without raising the alarm so they don't launch their shuttles.
Hellll yeah I'm hype for this dlc! They added so much to Skyrim and FO4 over the years that the "complete" edition is like 2x the content of vanilla. I bet we're gonna get some awesome stuff.
Awesome! I would also love to be able to romance Lt. Toft at some point
Starborn Guardian ship customisation please 🙏
A 60FPS mode on console would be cool
I want more stuff for outpost and home decor. The current selection with full research completed is lacking.
Underwater exploration would be lovely
I think that it would be pretty cool to not only have outposts, but to start full-on cities on different planets, and try to encourage settlers in LIST to come and live. Like the Coe's in Akila.
Hell yah.  Read the actual linked website article. It reveals a lot more than I expected, like:

> For those of you who love ship building, we'll also be expanding on ship customization with ship decorations, new ship building options, and more.

Wow, decorations? Like internal customization?  Also more ship parts.  I'm stoked.  Maybe we'll finally get Trident parts and internals.

> We're also excited to be adding all new Gameplay options. With these new settings you'll be able to alter your gameplay to allow for an easier or more challenging experience that will expand beyond our normal "Difficulty" setting. These will allow you to easily customize carry capacity, cargo access distance, ship damage, vendor credits, how you suffer afflictions, new survival mechanics, and more.

Wow, custom difficulty sliders/options?  That's pretty huge.  And coming up 500 hours, I would love to challenge myself with some survival modes.  I'm stoked we're getting that so soon.  It took them forever to add this to Skyrim and Fallout 4.

Wait...customize vendor credits? Holy fuck.  I can't believe I passed over that.
What about POI variety
What's the status on your review gaslighting campaign?
Would have loved to have seen...bug fixes.  Oh well, too much to ask.
Updates every 6 weeks? Oh man, mods are gonna get outdated so fast
Hopefully the changes to the ship builder will fix the absolutely infuriating disappearing ship glitch
- Elimination of cookie cutter points of interests that you end up visiting over and over and over everywhere????? (If you are actually still playing the game)
Hi BGS,

I think myself and many members of the community are wondering what some of the challenges were in implementing things like City Maps at launch.

I understand the scope of Starfield is massive, but these are definitely QoL features that make a huge difference ein player enjoyment.

PS: can we use junk for crafting???
Hey good stuff Bethesda. but ah... can you stop updating Skyrim? thanks.
This is all great stuff. I won't criticize that at all. Bethesda have released a very solid game overall at launch. 

However, as someone who has beat the game and pretty thoroughly did most everything, I don't know why I would ever revisit Starfield. Maybe once all the DLC are out and when/if the modding community matures, it might be worth revisiting. But how long before that happens?

It wasn't like Elder Scrolls or Fallout where I felt like I wanted to get back in as soon as I was done with a playthrough, or start many new characters with different play styles. It's clear Starfield will never be that. I couldn't make myself do more than one NG+ in Starfield. Something is fundamentally wrong with the game that doesn't sound like any of these updates would address. It doesn't make it a bad game, but it also doesn't make me care about a few minor updates over a vague timeline.
Oh look Bethesda are adding more crap to the game instead of fixing it.
My Ship Builder wishlist:

1. Shareable design templates, with alternate components suggested if the ones in the template haven't been unlocked by the player
2. Save incomplete/WIP builds for later
3. Control over door & ladder placement, & ability to add stairways
4. Z-axis rotation of components in 90° steps
5. X, Y, and Z-axis rotation of Structural components
6. Cutaway view of Hab internals, and 1st-person walk-through mode
7. Ability to select all components on the same layer (for ship breakdowns by deck)
8. Tightened component collision calculations so those "glitched" builds are legit (e.g. the ones that have components "illegally" placed beneath the Stroud cockpit).
9. More Structural components, esp. angled bits.
10. More hallway/walkway connector habs.
11. Show all unlocked components in all Ship Builders, but mark manufacturer-specific ones as "Out of stock" or "Only available direct from manufacturer".
12. Double-height cargo hall habs, with stairways up to (situationally-generated?) walkways along the sides so upper-floor doorways can still connect.
13. Double-wide doorways
I would love to see some story dlc or faction dlc involving the trackers Alliance. Bounty hunter is my favorite style character to make, yet the faction isn't joinable like others. A big missed opportunity imo.
Would like to see some updates to stealth.  Sometimes it works fine, other times an NPC can see your character from 300 yards away, while you are invisible, crouched, not moving, not wearing heavy gear, behind cover, and maxed out on stealth.  Seems broken sometimes.
Can you please fix the game breaking bugs?  

Powers need to be gained

Temples need to register

Unable to land/find certain space stations

Can’t pick up artifact, or if you do, game doesn’t recognize after blasting away debris

Getting back to ship during attack of star born doesn’t activate properly

Building the artifact thing on the ship doesn’t register and isn’t an option.  

There are more, but fixing these would go a ways.
Wish I could get a refund.
A "search" function for the star map would do wonders. Also if I want to search a specific ore, I could search and find the planet it is located on.  Also a record of discovered planets and their discovered fauna and wildlife present on that specific planet , in that specific system. I'm talking about 1993 game features here...
Love your work, Bethesda. I've been a fan since Oblivion and I love Starfield. However, I do hope you continue to provide regular updates as promised.

- The expansion of game features is great, but there are still game-breaking bugs to address as well. I have a random "Locate X Trait in Y System" that won't clear even though I have 100% on that system. Also, my Operation Starseed is broken with "All Doors Inaccessible," so I can't continue the quest unless I side with a faction I do not care for on my current chBethesda!


- Rovers. We. Need. ROVERS. It's just too time-consuming running so much to POIs while mapping worlds. It gets very repetitive very fast. I know this may also mean expansions for the ships to carry the rovers, but yes we need rovers. 


- Why is LIST nowhere to be found outside of just a few measly side quests? You find an old installation and it's intricate and winding and has 20-40 Fleet/Spacer/Ecliptic. Every damn time. But you find a civilian outpost and maybe it has 2-4 people at most. So the majority of the galaxy is settled by criminals just using old facilities? Why couldn't LIST use these old military and science outposts to set up little colonies with 1 or 2 radiant quests? Why couldn't LISTers settle into these abandoned/deserted/forgotten facilities? Just seems like repeating POIs were wasted on enemy-infested death traps rather than random little communities among the stars. Would certainly help to make the galaxy seem less barren.


- Any way we could logos, flags, and decals for ships and outposts? Would love to use them to give each outpost a different theme, particularly in terms of the factions.


- Any way we could get a skill or function that lets us pickpocket equipped clothing? My good character hates the thought of luring guards around corners, then save scumming until the RNG drops the outfit once I kill the guard.


- Also, can we link together the non-resource containers? I pocket a lot of loot and would like my full containers to automatically fill the next available as my coffers increase.

- Melee weapon mods, please! Speaking of mods, the ability remove and transfer mods between weapons would be CLUTCH!


This game has a LOT of potential. I'm looking forward to see what comes next for it, and I hope you listen to player feedback to create an experience everyone can enjoy. Thanks, Betheada!
Bethesda have a screwed up sense of what an update and a patch is.


I am playing on xbox and I thought they hadn't even rolled out the touted PC version patch for xbox, because no fixes or patches have been noticeable to me, because they didn't 'fix' the main elements of my play-through that are badly broken.
I still have a months old star parcel package I can't deliver because the Neon Ship Services Technician is still a km or so beneath the waves.  I also still don't have a ship services tech at Cydonia.  So in a game with only 4 major settlements, 2 of them are functionally broken in terms of swapping or repairing ships.
 
My play-through also still has a broken ECS Constant, which is still parked in orbit around Porrima something because someone spouting Yiddish can't find a letter in a room with all of 10 objects in it.  I suppose a non-moving ECS would be easy to find, if that quest ever became playable.

There is still the laughable bug where if I have 10 ships and  board another that has foolishly landed near my piratical heart, the thing can take off as soon as I'm through the hatch and the Klaxon sounds.  I still go through the motions of killing the crew only to find I am stuck in space forever; doomed to die of hunger after a bout of cannibalism because I can't take over the ship due to the annoying 10 ship limit.

There is still the stupid broken phased time Starborn power that never ends, with the only fix being to quit the game entirely and restart it and reload from a save.

Ships are still broken in the sense cargo containers and weapons can twist out of alignment at odd angles and auto turrets just have a mindless sense of where they should be pointed when 'parked'.  Turrets are also messed up in the ship builder so they spawn at right angles to a ships centreline so one can be placed on a weapon mount because it's facing away from a nearby module, but the other in a pair can't be placed in the mirror position because it's stupid sideways alignment brings it into conflict with the same adjacent module, forcing you to find a non-symmetrical alternative mount point.

I still have to save the game and reload from the save every time I arrive at an outpost with crafting benches and want to use any of them because they are ‘blocked’.

What else?  Oh, yes, ships that refuse to land on a giant landing platform with ship builder at some outposts, and force you to hike, but are fine landing on the same thing at others, and often they’ll land on the smaller size pads, just to rub it in.

They haven’t patched the nonsense at Titan where the stupid land and spawn outside mechanic, which I hate!, has you spawn underneath your ship with no way to get out because crouch isn’t really a physical model crouch as it is in other games, just a shift of the camera position.

Updates and bug fixes should work on existing play-throughs and shouldn’t require starting the game from scratch.  This game is still buggier and more annoying than the first iteration of Cyberpunk.

Happy New Year, Bethesda.  Perhaps this will be the year you finally fix what I stupidly paid €80 for on pre-order.
I hope TES6 comes out finished on release
Check back in 5 years and this game might be complete. Or just wait for modders to do the jobs of overpaid studios in half the time.
How about starting with fixing the bugs instead?   Currently on my first XBox playthrough:

* Elevator to The Well in the spaceport elevator in New Atlantis doesn't work
* New Atlantis Tech is missing
* Runaway quest - door won't open to 3rd floor room
* Last 5 temple locations not available - Vladimir doesn't have any
* Tapping the grid - switches won't work
* Half the time I select a landing spot I end up landing someplace else.  Works when I select it again (from the surface) and fast travel

Suggestions to make things less annoying:

* Setting a custom waypoint that shows up on the hud
* Ability to favorite fast travel locations and quick select them
* Marking purchased homes on map
* Animations too long - like sitting, sleeping, traveling
* Unable to interact with just some things when in scanning mode
* Stop having ship power settings change on their own between locations or when you change ships
* Ability to claim a ship without having to fly it out.   You have a crew for a reason!
* When you change ships and change back you shouldn't have to go through the hassle of resetting the crew
* The ship registration is stupid expensive. 
* After a while money means nothing.   There is nothing to buy worth anything.  How about letting you purchase better items once you get to certain levels?   Get training in skills?
I’d really like to choose where the ladders go on my ship.  I hate building a ship completely symmetrically and then there are 6 ladders in random places… it’s driving me MAD
Yo can we get 60fps on xsx? Anyone that says it isnt possible is a donut
Looking forward to it! Unlike the rest of Reddit I loved the game and am excited for more. Great job and happy holidays!
For various reasons I wasn't able to enjoy the game as much as I would have liked, but I place my hope in the fact that Todd and his team will manage to make the game better, giving it the immersion that has made all the other Bethesda titles special.
Please for the love of god BGS, allow us to put an infinite chest on any ship we want. And for the love of god, allow us to customize the inside of the starborn ship (with maybe a later update to customize and make it look different since every starborn ship looks the same).
I hope that these “new ways to travel” includes less loading screens and more immersion.
They should allow us to upload outposts and they can comb thru, choose the better ones, and add them to the random generator or w/e however it works
The amount of updates you guys have released is pathetic compared to Baldurs Gate 3 who have been pushing major changes every other week since release and even added new endings for some characters because the fans wished for it.

What went wrong Bethesda, how can you have over 250 devs work on this game and all you release after launch is a fucking fov slider and a few fixes while the most glaring issues of this game haven't even been recognized and people who mention them are getting GASLIT into believing they are not problems but "are supposed to be fun"

What a bunch of clowns you are 🤡
Sounds good, keep up the good work!
Hey BGS, just wanted to say I've really enjoyed the game so far, it's been my most played game of 2023. I'm looking forward to the updates next year, keep up the good work.
I am the only one who is baffled by the fact that BGS is proud to announce that, 3 months after a realese they're adding CITY MAPS to the game. Like it's just so unreal to me. 

And on the side note, not like there is a lot of content in the cities that they need to mark on the map in the first place.
This game will still be trash in February 2024 and also still by the end of the year in Dec 2024. Needs a complete overhaul. By that time better games will also have DLC like BG3 and CP77 not to mention the new games dropping in 24. Mods will not save this game and niether will the modders. Skyrim was BGS peak and they will never be that studio again. Truth hurts and now they're trying to ruin Skyrim, a ten year old game with their stupid creation store.
Can’t wait!!!
Survival mode will fix the bullet sponginess of enemies.  If Fallout 4,  survival mode made it to where enemies took more damage but also did more damage.  It completely changed the combat for the better.   Grenades and mines would one tap you or enemies.  Super mutants with a combat rifle could one shot you if they hit you in the head. This will help a lot.
Thanks Bethesda! Your games have given me much joy throughout the years. Enjoy the holiday break with friends and family!
The "launch of Creations" worries me... If this implementation of Creation Club / Paid Mods requires updating the game executable every time the in-game shop is updated with whatever overpriced rubbish Bethesda / Micrososft plans to peddle, I'm done. I actually like Starfield and was looking forward to the game's future until Creation Club 3.0 dropped for Skyrim. Also, I really hope you're not planning on selling weapon skins.
Hey, just want to say that the game is great :)
The fact "city maps" is part of the announcement is so laughably bad. My God. In game maps!!! In 2023!? Oh Bethesda you spoil us!
Thanks for the update, excited to see what you can do with continued support of the game.
Merry Christmas to all at Bethesda Game Studios. Thank u for the awesome space rpg this year, I genuinely enjoyed exploring it. Looking forward to the improvements and dlc!
Happy Holidays!  Still loving this game! It is definitely made for explorers.
Love you
This is what “buying time” looks like.
How about revamping dungeons. They are currently one of the worst parts of the game and completely destroy any semblance of immersion. Bethesda dungeons have always been fun and unique. Now, we have the same exact location on hundreds of planets, with the same exact clutter and the same boring fights. Explain how I can be immersed when the moon of earth has the same exact cave as a planet that is many lightyear away?

Why create an endless gameloop that doesn't have any replay value? After getting to ng+, the only thing to look forward to is faction missions because they were actually good entertainment. After playing them once and knowing the story, they aren't very fun a second time, though. Temples could have been cool if they weren't all exactly the same thing. You could have made less and made them puzzle dungeons like Zelda or something.

 You guys dropped the ball big time on this game. I've been a fan since Morrowind. Starfield makes me not want to spend another dollar on a Bethesda product as long as I live.  I won't blindly buy another game or dlc until I see all of the reviews, which I've never done for Betheda games before out of confidence that the product would be worth it. 

The AI responses on reviews are also terrible decisions. Who thought that was a good idea? Why are you guys being so condescending to players who have trusted you for years? It's not your place to decide if people like your game or if it's a good game overall. This is for critics and fans to decide. No one cares how hard it is for you guys to make a game. Other devs have issues, too, but they put out a competent, connected, and well developed game. 

Clean your act up, Bethesda. A lot of people are disappointed in you right now. It's been getting worse and worse since Skyrim.
Thank you for making this game! It fills a void others games cant.
Feels like a bullet point list id give my boss after I slacked too long on a project and needed something to show for the time
No mention of a fix to procedurally generated stuff...
Bethesda out here excited to announce that it will only take a YEAR post launch for them to implement MAPS. 

Also bringing in the exciting option to paywall the mods that fix the glaring and obvious problems in their game. 

INNOVATION INDEED.
it's ridiculous that this short list of rather limited additions is what they want to roll out throughout the year, not by February, half a year post launch. what a disaster. Bethesda definitely made it onto the shit list this year.
Please finish the game. Microsoft owns you. Resources aren't an excuse at this point.
The game reviews are mostly negative and you're coming out with DLC?
Did you seriously not realise that everyone's first reaction would be to believe that you were talking about an "End of the Year" software update?
Wow great changes! You too happy holidays at Bethesda!!! You did an incredible job, and I'm grateful amazing games like Starfield exists!! Keep that hopeful outlook! It's that hope that is in all Bethesda games that I love! Here's to more adventures better than any of us can imagine!! I'm so happy for this year!!

My only feedback, please make Terrormorphs more lethal like Deathclaws! I love fighting them, but they are a bit slower and less quick to react and attack.
Baldur's Gate 3 came out  3 weeks earlier than Starfield.  Since that time the game has received 5 major patches and 14 hotfixes.  The last patch added more content to Act III.  Larian is about the same size as Bethesda.  Updates every six weeks starting in February is pathetic.
Please focus on expanding on the clearly unfinished mechanics, characters, quest-lines, and other aspects of the game and gameplay.

The worst part of this debacle is how disconnected they are from their previous titles that did certain things much better than Starfield does.

* swimming/water interaction
* companion interaction/control
* looting NPCs
* questline choices and the impact of those choices
* player agency to make ridiculous choices with consequences (kill key NPCs that may disrupt a questline)
* faction choices and interactions
* base building and management
* world-building and in-universe rules controlling what you see/where you see it and how/what type of interactions you can have with the world/NPCs
* dynamic environments
* replayability of the game (being able to experience new things, different story beats, and different outcomes for each questline)
* etc etc etc

Not to mention the disregard of previous criticisms and feedback from players of their previous titles. So much invaluable input and data they could have leveraged to make one of the best games ever.

And, their main excuse is linked to this statement:

>Emil Pagliarulo  
>  
>u/Dezinuh  
>  
>(9/15) See, I never knew this before, but if nothing else, video game development is a series of concessions and tough decisions. There's that perfect game you WANT to make... and then there's the game you CAN make. Sometimes, if the gods smile on you, those two are very close.

>(10/15) But in order to get there, in order to get it as close as possible to the vision, the team has to push itself harder and harder... often while dealing with devs being shuffled around (or leaving), looming deadlines, and creative decisions you wish you didn't have to make.

Rather than listen to the community and their customers, admit they fell short, and commit to continuing to work toward achieving the perfect game they wanted to make, they are whining, deflecting, and blaming the community and customers for being ignorant/stupid about the industry and game development.

Worst of all is how they seem to completely disregard that it doesn't matter what they set out to make if the experience is not enjoyable for the players. That's the only thing that matters: the players enjoy playing the game. You can't achieve that by ignoring the players or blaming the players.

As if other studios haven't/aren't serving as great examples of what Bethesda SHOULD be doing to overcome the negative feedback.  I know, everyone keeps pointing to Larian. But, for great reasons.

Follow Larian's example if you want to see an end to the negativity.

* Be great listeners
* Be open to criticism and feedback
* Be communicative and transparent about the shortcomings and what is happening to improve the game
* Don't blame the community or customers
* Don't be needlessly defensive
* Demonstrate you care through your actions and be as active as you can be in pushing updates and share news about what is happening behind the scenes

Larian is continuing to listen to their community and customers, despite winning numerous awards, including game of the year. They are constantly pushing updates and positively working to improve the game. They don't need to be doing shit at this point.

A few things that make the game feel unfinished, since I haven't played much after reaching about mid-game (120 hours) and getting frustrated

* Environment systems and their counters not properly working or having any meaningful impact (this includes spacesuit systems/traits, aid items, etc)
* Food item mechanics make no sense and have no meaningful impact in the game
* All your companions sharing the same opinions when commenting/engaging with you post key quests
* Different Habs are useless 
* No meaningful faction mechanics
   * No impact on the world or story--you can join them all without any differences or consequences or benefits...big and small.
   * small eg: I have earned a badge...I can't use it to influence any interaction
* You have brigs, jails, and non-lethal weapons and you can't take prisoners
* Extremely limited outpost system that looks like a beta test run of what Fallout 4 provided us
* Low impact or outright meaningless role-playing impact linked to your key traits picked during character creation
* You get a few interesting dialogue options from time to time but this almost never leads to a unique outcome. It's just another way to arrive at the same cookie-cutter conclusion you would arrive at without using that option.
* Extremely limited role-playing options regarding quest and dialogue outcomes
   * I can't think of any unique outcomes
   * You can kill
   * You can attack (subdue without killing...if you have the right weapon...which the game almost always treats as the same as killing)
   * You can persuade/intimidate but, each of these options often leads right back to the above due to the game being on rails and disregarding your own player agency--like the Hope mission.
   * I just played the mission where you steal an artifact. I didn't want to steal it. I didn't want to use violence. But, because I asked the dude for a tour and then talked with him at the artifact I was then locked into violence because the NPC would not walk away/back to his post.
   * There are almost no grey area options or unique options and outcomes (compared to other Bethesda games...not even making the BG3 comparison)
   * There are so many examples of this in the game.
   * There is no good reason to replay the game to try new builds, new playstyles, or experience new outcomes by choosing different questline paths
* POI generation system is garbage and repeats the same stuff in almost the same combination without any meaningful diversity to make them unique and exciting
* The procedural generation system is garbage
   * It doesn't have any meaningful rules set to avoid endless immersion-breaking outcomes
   * Why is there a campsite resembling one in Wyoming on a moon that is 400c?
   * Why are there no dynamic landscapes where you can land?
* There is no easy way to see a list of the planets you have or have not visited and the locations you have been/learned about (basic UI stuff)
* Water and swimming are worse than in Morrowind
* Melee mechanics are worse than Fallout 4 and there is an extremely limited pool of weapons
* Companion interaction is garbage
   * Why can't I command them? (Skyrim, Fallouts)
   * Why can't I set their tactics? (New Vegas)
   * Why can I marry them so easily?
   * Why are they all so horny for me without me doing anything to build up toward that?
   * Why is the wedding ceremony so weird and ignores the in-world context the game established between these characters?

What's next would be finishing the game. Polishing what they gave us.
hovercrafts, todd. give us hovercrafts.
Much too little, much too late but have a nice holiday.
Thanks for the update! I’m loving the game and really looking forward to seeing the changes coming down the pipe. Keep up the great work!
Fix all the broken perks/skills, before you do ANYTHING else.
Can we get rewrites? The writing is absolutely atrocious and is probably the biggest immersion breaker.
Those all sound like good improvements, but most sound like they should've been in the game from the start. Still happy though, I'm patient. Plenty of other games to play until we get some Starfield upgrades.
Looking forward to it!
I’m concerned about survival mode until the way your resistance meters wear down on harsh planets is tweaked a little. Spacesuits seem to wear down WAY too quickly imo. Could make survival on anything other than habitable planets a nightmare. Unless there’s vehicles coming…
Looking forward to the updates! I’ve been playing for a few weeks now and I’m completely hooked!
New ways to customize your ships is please but what I actually want is actual purpose to use the infirmary Hab and especially the BRIGG make them useable please I don’t usually play with mods I play vanilla but I’m thinking about it.
Add the mod where the camera is pulled back and not locked in during conversions. It's painful to play and makes the game feel wooden as is. Please. Also I hope you can do a Cyberpunk/ NMS revival
>every six weeks starting with our next major update in February

I am no genius but I would imagine this is kinda confirming a xbox developer direct in february or six weeks before that even, so they can present this update and hype the game up.
Looking forward to future patches. I love the game, but looking forward to fixes for some broken skills and quests.
Can’t wait for this
Please. For the love of god. 

Add land vehicles. Don’t go the cheap way out by infinite jetpack or some shit. Like others are speculating. 

Make this game the comeback story like Cyberpunk 2077 is.

Edit: Thank god for official mod support. Seriously, this is going to improve the game massively. Especially for Xbox. 

FYI Reddit, some modder has figured out how to remove the cutscenes per landing and implement seamless landings in first person, plus get out of the cockpit WHILE LANDING. No script extender.
Happy holidays!

I'd like a better/more involved weapon modding system, and maybe a weapon crafting system as well.  I'd also like simply more melee weapons.
Creation kit mod is what we wanted to expand Starfield for generations to come
New Year, new you guys. Looking forward to ***positive*** responses and updates from you BGS. Happy New Year!
lol you clowns complaining incessantly and they’re out here working. Touch grass
[deleted]
Please please make the gun customizations like Fallout 4. The gun attachment system could use some work.
Thank you guys so much for this info ! I have been loving Starfield!! Ive been playing on a high end PC and have had zero issues with the most gorgeous graphics ! Super excited for Shattered Space!
Holy shit, make sure to actually follow the link and read the details in the post. Survival mode confirmed among other things!
A feature update every six weeks seems super ambitious for what BGS normally delivers with post-launch support. I'm sure that they have institutional knowledge about how run a schedule like that from their time with Fallout 76, but I'm always skeptical of a single-player game being treated like a live service. I hope that their "ten-year plan" doesn't mean that some of their most talented developers are going to be wrapped up in supporting Starfield for a decade.
Dear God please add suborbital flight. That made No Man’s Sky incredible
Yeah, I’m hoping a favorites list of fast-travel to outposts or favorite planets is one of those “new ways to travel.”
I don't even get the point of homes. Like why would you want to visit your home? Is it just for people who enjoy crafting decorations? Now if there were quests involved, that were related to your home, or new conversation options with companions or neighbors, or if as you suggested you could fast travel between them, then it might be useful.
I'd actually like some sort of code system for this, not only so we can rebuild our own ships, but share the designs with others!
Oh yes...please do this!
The best idea I have seen on this sub
I feel like the ship you take to unity is what carries over.
I sit waiting for my .50 MI to count down 1 at a time from 10,165 so I can give Sarah 1. I'm pretty sure on Fallout 4, it counted by 100 when giving ammo to a companion. It takes a full minute to count down 1000 at one at I time. So 10 minutes for 10,000. Bethesda fix this. In real life, I would just hand over a couple of bullets to a companion, not count every bullet singularly.
Also, a real actual in-game option that lets you officially build ships from scratch instead of having to delete ships you already own.
They should have let us store ship pieces so we don't have to sell them every time we swap out pieces.
Also, being able to harvest gasses and liquids while in scanner mode.
Or a drop down list of your outposts, with a "travel here" button.
Or a drop down of your recently or frequently visited places.
And a search function.
I'd even settle for the system names being labelled and a map legend.
Just displaying all the star/system names all the time would be a significant step forward.
I want to be able to place the ladders.
I would like the builder to include anything beyond prefabs in general. Walls and floors. I'm extremely worried for mods being able to get anywhere close to the kinds of things you saw in Fo4 for building when there isn't even support for things that aren't pre-fabricated.
I'd love to see the option to rotate any hab. It's hard to choose whether to sacrifice the giant TV or pool table in the Nova Galactic Living Quarters 2x2.
That would require new models entirely though. The front and rear doors of a hab are not the same as the left and right ones.
we should be able to turn the gravity in our ships OFF, in case we want to jetpack thru our ships
Or have them add 1x2 habs, but either way, potato potato
Also, some XP rich missions are welcome, especially over level 100-150, it's really annoying and tiring farm XPs from adaptive frames and sort of xenocide.
You can take resources in scanner mode already
Radiant quests where npc asks you to get whatever contraband for a big extra pay and xp
But Marcel always awaits your return
This 100%. If I need Adhesive, I should be able to look up Adhesive, and see all the planets / flora / fauna that I've encountered with Adhesive, and mark a waypoint to that planet/landing spot so I can travel there and get some more.

Its like, why don't databases exist in this universe? Well, besides a completion %
This is my biggest request too! It would motivate me to go out into the world and scan the hell out of every thing. It would also add to the scientist exploring role playing aspect
Even No Man's Sky has a surveying journal that works OK.
Let's hope they mean creation kit in their post here. The way it's presented here, I think they mean creations as in.. creation club. Only Bethesda approved stuff, that you'd probably have to pay for.

Really hope they mean creation kit.
The bones for Survival mode are already in the game,  diseases, alimenets, fuel, tempurtures etc. Putting it back into the game will complelty change the gameplay loop and i cant wait.
Can you explain “survival mode” for BGS newbies like myself?
Survival mode really did turn FO4 from a meh experience to something fantastic to me. I enjoyed Starfield but the whole time i was thinking to myself, "man this game is going to be so good once Survival mode and mods are added."
Survival mode would be much appreciated. It got me hooked on FO4 again when it received survival mode.

* Having to analyze the atmosphere, toxins, and temperature before you leave your ship, and thus dawn the correct protective gear. would be a great system.
* Jump fuel needs to be something you can run out of. And once in system, if you run out, you have to stop off to buy some more via starbase, city, or find an outpost on a planet, or if you have the equipment, refine your own.
* Money is too easy to earn. Either make things more expensive or give us less cash for items sold. In less than 60 hours I had millions of credits burning a hole in my pocket.
Yes, I was only hooked on FO4 after survival mode and the dlcs
I really hope it comes with a way of playing in survival mode but making enemies and yourself not bullet sponges. Because FO4's survivial mode was sadly unplayable without mods for me due to the bullet sponge nature of enemies (tbh all beth games are this way for me, it's why I wait for mods). 

I love a dark grity experience, but find its ruined with RPG healthbar depleting combat.
The fuel thing baffled me at first.  I was like "This container says it holds more, but how am I filling it?"  You don't.
Suspension of disbelief - I just stripped that dead body of its spacesuit, yet ... it's still wearing a spacesuit.  How can it be in two places at once?
This! Definitely a step back in looting compared to prior games!
Or area looting like in FO76
Games gonna get ALOT of dlc and creation content imo, especially since starfield 2 is last on the roster now so this games what we get sci-fi wise from bgs for at least 8 years
I think with Starfield, there will be many ideas for DLC such as:
- DLC about robots (like Fo4 automatron)
- DLC about aliens (like alien isolation, deadspace ishimura, alien prometheus, the things, etc.)
- DLC about Predator (collab dlc)
dude!!!! varuun are coming!! i am so excited . i want that was i know is coming to begin . straight up firefly this game.
I wanna be excited for this, but it legit just might be more convenient fast travel to unexplored POIs
Right? This is the second time they've used that phrasing now, so they're being deliberately vague. I get that building hype is fun, but they risk creating some very lofty expectations. A little dangerous to risk people anticipating space buggies and hover bikes and then revealing something like a new boost pack variation.
[deleted]
They're going to be more specific about this when the feature is closer to release. I imagine they're still figuring out what they can feasibly ship and when. Rovers were doubtlessly prototyped at some point in development, but the delta between the existing work and something they could ship could be way, way larger than, say, a change to the jetpack that lets you fly around environments more easily, both of which would work towards the goal of making planetary traversal easier.
It could just be that you can do the griddy while walking.
Personally hoping that grav jumps are just a bit more immersive giving a feel of travel. Time to destination 5 hours, cool, organise inventory, eat, inane conversation with the crew and sleep.
Best I can do is another quick travel option
You can talk to the space dock dude and there is extra option where he will fast travel you to the space dock of your choosing.
I think it's suspicious. I think it sounds like "We know it's not gonna be what you want, but we also know you're unhappy with us right now, so we're gonna let your disappointment be a surprise."
That and changing the colors of the interiors would be nice.
Nope, paid DLC paints that glow in the dark. My money is riding on this :3
I library hab that is sound proof for her to sit in.
Fuel management for your ships would be awesome too. It’d give you good reason to have outposts scattered all over for refueling.
i also wouldn't mind amping the difficulty of ship maintenance, cause as exhilarating ship combat is, spamming the repair button doesn't add anything to the experience.

managing helium 3, fusion reactor health, remaining oxygen, etc.

i want to feel like space is a real threat, and that my ship could very well be my metal coffin.
“We're also excited to be adding all new Gameplay options. With these new settings you'll be able to alter your gameplay to allow for an easier or more challenging experience that will expand beyond our normal "Difficulty" setting. These will allow you to easily customize carry capacity, cargo access distance, ship damage, vendor credits, how you suffer afflictions, new survival mechanics, and more.”

[Source](https://bethesda.net/en/article/37j5d4CbPfYlZqJKcVtGcY/starfield-end-of-the-year-update-2023)
Fuel Management and Oxygen management would be great too
If you look at the bigger post they say more survival options & other things :)
Why is eating and drinking to live fun in a game for you? Honestly curious. I don't get this... At all.
This or sub-orbital flight so we can actually pick where we land. I know this is by far the least likely option but man it would make this game so much better.
A space-horse.
It would be nice to actually have things on the planets worth exploring as well. Not much point in a rover when it just takes you to the same copy paste lab you've seen a thousand times.
Yeah it’s a big reason I put the game down, I can play a game of Rocket League in the amount of time it takes to walk/run between two POIs in Starfield. After beating the game and practically entering the same universe again, I couldn’t find any value in continuing to play. Hoping the updates are enough of an overhaul that I’ll pick it back up. Just got Baldurs Gate 3 though and don’t anticipate wanting to play Starfield for quite a while.
I second this. The exploration sucks when you spend such a long time looking for POIs and scanning planets.. In Empyrion you can fly a vehicle ( hover craft, small vehicle or your large cruiser) around the planet and choose where you want to land in atmo. I was hoping for something like this for Starfield.

Between the lack of an exploration vehicle and the overall unnecessary grindy nature of the game, i've stop playing. May come back later on to check on updates.
Isn’t it funny? In a Bethesda game I would NEVER want a vehicle because exploring the world is the best part of their games but here we are desperately needing it.

You pick up a quest that says go to X. You start walking to X but the likelihood of you going straight to that place in a game like Skyrim or Fallout is very low. You’ll typically get distracted by a cave, some kind of NPC event or a POI along the way. In this game all I can do is hold the forward stick up and get there in 7 mins with nothing to do in between.

I don’t want vehicles man. I want actual interesting shit to explore in between. Otherwise just let me fast travel to where it wants me to go and let’s cut the middle man (a long ass walk which is basically a loading screens that point) out.
[deleted]
Think these are all very fair
100% to everything here especially the perk tree and decorations.
In general, I agree with these assertions. I really like the idea of someone with 300,000 credits being able to buy a chair without having to go to a different solar system to get fiber to build one themselves. It's also a real struggle to fiddle with perk points to balance between being functional in combat and being able to craft.

I would like to set forth a pedantic quibble. Interplanetary distances are still astoundingly vast. The moon is a 3 day journey for us irl. If we say 150 km/sec is an average top speed for a ship's in-system thrusters in the game, then it would take 43 minutes to get there. As annoying as a cut screen is every time, spending literal hours just pointing at a body and going towards it would be infinitely worse. And that's before you consider the velocity of the orbit of the destination in question.
Stuff like crafting and scanning shouldn't be perk related, literally just making part of the game worse.

The game is gonna need the most mods of any of their games that only change basic functionality to be less annoying.
As long at that *"new ship parts"* means that we get stairs and can choose where ladders appears, then I'm automatically satisfied by the update.

I don't care that in reality stairs are an inefficient use of space compared to ladders, if I can pay for the module, then I want it. [Besides, it's not like there aren't commercial and military ocean vessels that don't use stairs.](https://www.okieboat.com/Copyright%20images/37%20deck%201%20officer's%20quarters%202%201024%20C.jpg)
> So curious what "new ways to travel" will be like

A badly reskinned skyrim horse.
I have a feeling they're not even going to attempt changing the POI system. They haven't even hinted at it, or acknowledged that it's an issue. So we're stuck with a Bethesda game where exploration is the worst aspect. None of these updates or additions they list are going to fix the core issues. Even having a stupid land vehicle that everyone is salivating over is just going to make the world seem even smaller; you'll hit that invisible wall in 2 minutes on your way to your next copy paste area you've seen 50 times.
If you think Beth are giving up on their attempts to monetize the modding community, I have a bridge to sell you.  
Starfield is absolutely going to see them pushing harder than ever.
If you click the link it mentions creation kit is part of what they will be releasing as well.
It's basically the same thing Minecraft did with their marketplace. It's not great but easy to ignore since most mods aren't or can't be sold. Basically, it only really exists for console users or people who don't like using lots of mods.
Creations are basically paid mods.


Skyrim Special Edition just got them. :(
They should get rid of all this POI crap they have now and just place 4-5 unique buildings on like 20 planets and leave the rest empty. The chance to have the exact same building on different planets is just bad game design.
or at least be able to save their design??
What have you tried so far?  Piracy, anti-piracy, smuggling, cargo transport, passenger missions, player storage base and museum?

Can you cook drugs or food on them?  Haven’t tried, personally.
Or at least make them a JPG or clip instead of just a black screen. Wouldn’t mind elevator waiting screens if it just played a 3 second clip of the elevator ride. Wouldn’t mind the cutaway entering a doorway if it was actually pulling up a little clip of feet entering the doorway.
Is that a year's worth of updates?
No bugfixes until February wtf?! My character is still turning his head around when landing after running and jumping…
Might want to call this an "announcement" saying "update" makes it sound like you are patching the game before the end of the year.
I'm begging you, please pass on the request to enable keyboard and mouse support for Xbox as an accessibility option.  That has literally been my only complaint with the game since launch.
It’s mind blowing, isn’t it? Especially when you compare Beth to their contemporaries. It’s almost like they have zero desire to attempt to fix their mistakes. Especially considering they were sitting there arguing with armchair reviewers on Steam.
Even if they just extended the warp animation to include the loading. That would make it all one continuous animation of lose control, wind up, warp out, warp in, and take control, and would give the PERCEIVED sense of instantaneous travel without any loading screens. 

But yeah. Being able to do something like NMS’s pulse drives to travel to any neighboring system in 30 seconds, where we can drop out of Pulse and shoot some rocks or find a Starborn ship or something, instead of just a cut to black would be perfect.
I agree with you, and I am not trying to beat a dead horse or bash the game, but do I genuinely wonder why certain design decisions were made that seem to actively inhibit immersion. 

Like when docking with a station while flying in first person - why not just initiate the docking sequence without changing perspective? Why the odd black-and-white animation, every time? Same with takeoff and landing. Even absent seamless atmospheric player-controlled takeoff and landing (like NMS), I think the unbroken consistent perspective would do a lot for immersion. Another one I've seen mentioned a lot is grav jumping - the screen fades to white, then black loading screen, then fade from white... surely we all see why this is silly, and what could be done to fix it. 

I wonder if the reasoning for these decisions was technical, or from a deign philosophy standpoint.
Feb is probably just city maps
>Cyberpunk was already a solid game at launch

No it wasn't.
I’m fairly certain they’ve specifically confirmed Xbox mods before, yes.
I think these are fairly reasonable asks!

Some people are asking for complete rewrites which is completely unserious.

However, expanding quests by making less NPCs essential is relatively more realistic outside of additional voice acting being a hurdle.

I personally think the crimson fleet should be killable from the jump in the sysdef questline. Let me go in there and start blasting and tell sysdef I handled it myself instead of being forced through the entire quest chain
Can we get rid of all the back and forth messenger quests? Like all of them?
Correct, but Bethesda releases the first dlc around 6 months after the initial launch so prob around feb March we can expect a release date
That’s the state that Beth is in now.
Doubt we’re going to get that.
I heard Larian had three or four major patches for BG 3 plus a slew of hotfixes and the game came out 3 weeks prior to Starfield. The studios are about the same size, to boot. 

Starfield just got its last update in November. Like…..what are yall doing?
Yeah, basically taking a page out of ea's book at this point. Giving us a solid foundation but half a game, slowly selling us the rest. I'm glad I just tried Starfield on gamepass cause I'm def not all in on it's current gameplay and the direction paid content is heading... This coming from an elder scrolls super fan.

Elden Ring gave me the bang for it's buck on a full priced game. But I'm going to have to wait for a super sale and a fair amount of updates before I pick up this game again.
lol. At least they’re putting maps in there. Nobody has to mod it in.
There won't be a fix for that because it is a fundamentally flawed system imo. They would have to massively overhaul how the procedural generation worked and I just don't think it is going to happen.
I don’t understand how the focus is on developing dlc when the player base is as minuscule as it is right now. Do they really think players are happy to pay up and return after they stopped playing because they found the base game lacking? I don’t see that happening. Not without major free changes to the base game itself.
Agreed.
That would require effort
Shattered Space trailer for sure. And possibly the team discussing the changes to the game.
Visting your home and building and cecorating your home is mostly a roleplayin thing in BGS games. It is there to roleplay you having a place to sleep or put things on the wall.
Share codes I love this idea!
Idk if Creations has like a Free section as well... but this could be something pretty fun to integrate into it! Upload your ship to the Creations site and then people can download.

&#x200B;

This would also help being more traffic to creations!
A system similar to Fora horizon where you can browse other people’s designs/ tunes would be epic for starfield.
I'd also like an option to view the ship from the inside as I'm building it so I can see where all the doors and ladders are.
Share codes or build IDs would be great. An integrated online gallery would be badass too, especially if they made an integrated online photo gallery, where you can also see other peoples ships and pictures and save them to your own gallery
Yep this worked well in AC6. Was disappointed to see it absent here
I was kind of expecting something like this around launch. Should def be a feature.
This has been posted since day 1.. it's literally ridiculous you can't.
There’s a mod that makes anything equipped on your person carried through. I feel like the ship should also go with. It should be limited but not like a total wipe.
This guy gets it. Your ship carries over and everything on it.
If you're on Xbox the left/right bumper counts them down/up faster
Are you serious? You can actually harvest those? You mean I’ve been playing this game for a month, walking by those, and I could’ve been collecting them? I thought you had to build an outpost and collector to do that.
[deleted]
My god the ladder placement is infuriating. I tried to make a ship where the side ramp airlock connects to an infirmary for role play (making most of the habs actually have a use would be good too if Bethesda are looking for more updates). Instead the game decided the best path was to ladder up into a mess hall then ladder down into the infirmary.

Tbh I wish they had options other than ladders. We shouldn't have to use one specific ship part to get ramps.
I assume this is for outposts and not ships? For ships modders have already put together some remarkable things with the limited tools that let have. Highly recommend checking out derretechs ship mods if you're curious.
On the other hand some of us hate decorating and would love more prefabs. I would love prefab outpost habs with furniture and other things already placed. I would also love to be able to pay someone to decorate the houses I buy like I could in Skyrim.
This, and also scaling xp, at 214 those missions that give 150 are worthless
It doesn't work for liquids and gases.
How? So, for example, I approach to the Argon vent, how can I harvest the Argon in scanner mode?
I was shocked that there's no data kept on the items that you scan. I don't even bother with outposts because I'm not going to write down a list of every planet and their resources. This game should come with a notebook and pencil.
This and city maps are all I really need to make this game go from really good to amazing
Creations only modding tools would harm their game and even their reputation to a point of no return on a degree that no one would be stupid enough to want.
How are you going to create the mods without creation kit lol? Can’t use xedit for compex mods, only simple model swaps and things like that.
Yep!  The first thing I thought when I saw the different environmental conditions and the random little outposts with HE-3 (or the HE-3 at the end of dungeons) was that it was meant for a Survival mode, but they weren't quite done with it yet.
Fuel is going to be the only interesting resource challenge, but maybe not even that

Food and water are plentiful and cheap. Quest rewards can give tons of credits, which gets you lots of cargo space on your ship, which allows you to carry a ton of that around. I think the first quest reward from constellation is like 8,000 credits which can buy a lot of food/water and a ship module with a bed really early into the game, so you'll be set for hours of basic surviving just after that. 

Jemison itself has water/fauna/flora which will let you craft food/water too. If they still let you buy resources to start a basic He-3 outpost, Jemison's moon has that. Load up on fuel tanks, or put the He3 in cargo if they let you move it directly from cargo to the fuel tanks. Then you can go quite far in the Frontier even before upgrading it.

If they add vehicles like people want, then ailments and temperatures will be an afterthought because you won't be exposed much except when going from your vehicle to inside the POI. Making all 5 of the ailment cures is also pretty easy, and those are light (and cheap).

Survival is going to be pretty hard to get right considering we're in a high tech civilization with unlimited resources.
Eating and drinking become a requirement. Disease became a thing in Fallout and will probably become a bigger hurdle in a game like Starfield that sorta has it already. Need to sleep to save your game. Enemies get huge buffs to damage output as well.
Survival Mode is amazing. In both FO and Skyrim it makes you appreciate every little thing.

It forces you to methodically go through the world instead of rushing from point to point. Useless ingredients like Salt in Skyrim become the lifeblood of making it through and out of a dungeon (salt lets you cook meals, and meals matter and give substantial boosts that can make all the difference).

In Fallout, you’ll be scraping everything you see, but it’s a risk/reward of over encumbrance.

My hope for Starfield is they put back in the need for Helium-3 to fly out of a solar system. It would make outposts not just useful but essential. Not to mention all the afflictions would matter more, food would have a purpose, etc.
People have explained it well below, but for perspective - since they added it to Fallout, it's the only mode I play.

It is harder, and I'm the type who usually plays games on normal. But it's not about that, it's about making the world feel more real and involved. Settlements suddenly became vital, as was knowing where the closest bed was. Food and water you find all over the world suddenly matters. I suspect it will go a long way towards making your ship feel a bit more important as well, and not like just a fast travel station.
a mode where you have to survive in the world. hunger bars and whatnot.
In simple terms you need to eat, sleep, and stay hydrated (FO) or be mindful of your temperature (Skyrim). Theres also restrictions around fast travel, healing serious injuries, and zero-mass items like ammo now have mass.
It basically makes it to where your character has to eat sleep and drink. Saving can only be done at beds and normally the damage values are reworked to make the difficulty a lil higher
You need to eat, sleep, drink water, etc. more penalties for things like over encumbrance. More environmental effects from things like radiation or extreme cold. Makes the game slower, more methodical, more strategic, more punishing
With additional survival elements involved, the money situation would probably fix itself.  You’d need ships with more cargo, or an armory with Mannequins so you can store extra suits for specific environments and buy aid items to counteract all of the status ailments and food and drink.  All of that would cost significantly more money.
Absolutely. Personally, my ideal hardcore experience when it comes to combat is to make it highly deadly for everyone. Make it so that I can drop enemies with 1-2 well placed hits... but also make it so that enemies can drop me in 1-2 hits as well. Make me have to be cautious and careful about how I approach combat. Make me choose my battles. Make armor ratings actually meaningful. Anything but bullet sponges.
Or the opposite where you kill someone in a spacesuit but neither suit, helmet or pack is in the loot list...
Schrodinger's schlong
I think they wanted to avoid the "how can I use a broken space suit" threads.
this game is gonna be basically played by nobody in 6 months.  it's not deep or complex or branching enough to really merit multiple playthroughs.  i honestly couldn't even be bothered to finish the main quest line when i had the ending spoiled, sounded boring as shit.  they'd have to overhaul the game top to bottom to get me to play through it again, and i bought the constellation edition...  large modders are noping out before the creation kit even comes out.
They have an entire skin system and barely used it, so I'm betting they'll spam the creation shop with skins when it releases like they did Fallout 4.
There is zero chance we're going to encounter sentient alien life.
That's exactly what I'm expecting so I don't get my hopes up.
I wish I hadn't read that. Didn't even think of it being the probable update. They'll get memed to the stars if they do that
Nah, it's going to be a jetpack most likely, where you will be able to boost in the horizontal axis as well. I would be extremely surprised (and insanely happy) if they managed to implement a rover or a hover vehicle, but I'm not optimistic.
It better be full space travel planet to planet.
I think not being more specific is so they DON’T create expectations.
I’m guessing it is rovers and is a big gameplay aspect of one of the DLCs so there not trying to spoil it

I wish they had kept the fuel mechanic in the game. Some quests and POIs end with a whole bunch of free fuel that clearly was supposed to be a big part of the completion reward, but without a ship fuel mechanic it's just...meh. not going to bother over-encumbering myself for *that.*
The game was supposed to have fuel management, at the end of a lot of areas you notice that there’s a shit ton of Helium 3, if they add this back in I feel like the game would get a whole new feel. Should’ve released with this feature imo
Getting a space tow because you ran out of fuel would draw me back into playing again
I’d like the idea of having to manually fix ship systems, kinda like repairing in DRG but idk if Bethesda could implement it in a way that’s smooth and not tedious
Because this game has a lot of immersive systems that aren’t interacted with. There is a whole chef profession and skill that has 0 purpose, but if you needed to eat and drink it’s now a system that can be interacted with and add another element of game.

Without all these systems the game is just fast travel to planet, run/jetpack to poi.


Vs eating, fueling, cooking/ creating medicine and modding suits for certain planets
Inter-system flight is probably possible and would help a lot. Suborbital flight is probably impossible unfortunately.
Yeah, I think the environments are still rendered in cells which have to be loaded separately like their other games, so I doubt this will be possible in any way. Just using a jetpack to go high shows you why this wouldn't work haha
With armour!
This. Getting faster to boredom isn't really the solution.
they should develop the Outpost system further and create a POI generation engine that can have macro and micro variation, then plop them down based on logical factors of the environment.
That's a very fair pedantic quibble, but we're talking sci-fi here. It should be simple enough to retcon in a third mode of travel between the extremes of the thrusters and the grav drive. They could call it something sciencey sounding like Quantum Acceleration Drive or whatever and just make us travel super fast over large distances.

The in-system travel in Elite: Dangerous did this with their Frame Shift Drive, and you dropped to thrusters for combat or when you arrived at your destination.
Hell there’s stairs in other ships in the game, we should totally get some too

I would take a guess that was a big selling point to investors. I think it could go very, very wrong for a few reasons. Primarily the contentious nature of the game itself for many people already while trying to push paid mods is a recipe for disaster if they don't do it right. (If there is a right way to do it, either way I'm on PC, ill pay for a nexus account but I'm probably never buying creations)
To clarify, “creations” is what Bethesda is calling the Bethesda.net mods platform going forward, creation club and mods tab rolled together both free and paid, so saying “creations is coming to Starfield” still means regular free mods. 

They also renamed the paid part to “the verified creator program”, authors name their prices.
You can do any crafting you want to, including making Aurora. Unfortunately, it’s very hard to make money as space Heisenberg as the purchase price for chamsmbass oil is so high and the fish can’t be farmed.
I really hate the inability to store a million things in one box. Skyrim and Fallout had this part correct.
Speaking of drugs, in my latest new game I just hired a crew mate out of Neon who now supplies me with drugs every once in a while.
Yes
Please, please, urgently address this (save-)game-breaking bug: 

[formid bug](https://www.reddit.com/r/starfieldmods/comments/17uy7ux/possible_save_breaking_bug_with_dynamic_form_id/)
I literally thought we were getting an update and was hyped. Oh well, guess I'll wait for creations
[deleted]
Pulse would be within the system. But on that note, even if they don't add a faster way to get around the solar system, I really want them to put more POIs in space as well as enemies. Sometimes I just want to pick a direction and fly and run into things (like previous games albeit more random), but as enemies, derelict spaceships and space stations, etc. don't spawn, there isn't much of a point. Also, give us more radiant events as I have seen the same one's way too many times and am disappointed in how there's no new dialogue options for any of them the second time. 

  
Thing is, when you go to a different planet or moon, it obviously shows your ship go there in real-time at normal speeds, so I wonder why time doesn't advance?
They also need to keep the warp animations in the current camera view, it’s immersion breaking getting kicked to 3rd person. Warp drive me in first person! The animation is already there and it’s quite good
There has to be some kind of hindrance to doing interplanetary this way.  There’s no way BGS devs, who intelligent, talented, and huge gamers themselves thought it was an okay thing to do. They probably toiled over it for a while and tried. 

I work in software development (although not a dev myself) and I can say that some new features have some pretty wonky workarounds on the backend, and you can tell as much if you know what to look for on the front end.

I can only imagine how much more challenging that gets with a huge game like starfield.

I think someone here said in FO they could only make cars work by attaching it to an NPCs head and burying them underground. Classic example of compromise and having to work within boundaries to achieve something.
> why not just initiate the docking sequence without changing perspective? Why the odd black-and-white animation, every time?

I think this one is because it warps you to the "correct" spot for docking so if it stayed in first-person you'd have this really jarring perspective change as your ship snaps up to 500m away and with whatever rotation depending on where your docker is located.
Right. At the speed they’re going to release updates.
Whoever at Bethesda decided to release the game in this state needs to leave the company. There's literally no other way around it. How the fuck do you even chart a way forward here? This is fucking nightmarishly catastrophic.
The reality is the Game Pass will lead to more of this. Game Pass is cannibalizing game sales. Why would someone pay $70 for a new game release that they can play for a mere $12 on Game Pass? Games with high budgets are not sustainable on Game Pass, so we'll be seeing more minimum viable products and ongoing ("micro") transactions from Xbox studios. 

If you want high quality games, like Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3, then buy the games. Larian commented on this recently, explaining why BG3 would not be on Game Pass. If you want more poor quality releases (basically, live services incognito) and more microtransactions, then keep that Game Pass sub.
*bethesda disliked that*
Even then, in Fallout 4 you role-play you building this settlement for all your companions and the settlers, it gives you a reason to build something
Make it 102 characters, case sensitive, symbols inclusive, and not copy pastable.
Idk why but I read this comment in Timmy’s voice from the WKUK grapist skit “grapist I love it!”
>Idk if Creations has like a Free section as well

It does. In Skyrim, Creations was just the union between the old Creation Club and the old [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Mods tab that was used primarily by console players.
Hot Wheels Unleashed and Forza have this, you can design your own car paint job and upload it so others could make a copy.
now that's the way to use Creations!
i'd settle for that, if we can't get the ability to choose where those doors/ladders actually are!
Also worked well in Animal Crossing.

Thanks, I honestly didn't know that.
I assumed we’d get a vehicle, but you might be right.
Let me assign a companion to the medbay, the buy meds and heals from them. Let me assign someone to an armory and let me buy guns and ammo from them. (Let me manufacture ammo at my outposts.) Let me assign people to Battlestations to make my ship's weapons more effective. 

Let me use non-lethal weapons to stun enemies, then transfer them to my ship's brig. Bounty missions should be dead or alive. Give me a space cop mission board where you have to bring them in alive, or you go to jail.
Yes, outposts. They switched to Subnautica style building instead of Fo4.
I didn't even bring in decorating, I'm just talking about the basic ability to create a physical space that isn't one of five preset circles. Compare it to No Man's Sky building where the prefabs are at least modular.
I must play the game slow af. I think I have 150 hours and I’m not even 50 yet, 48 to be exact. I think the 150xp for missions is dog shit. In theory you’d need to complete 28 of these to rank up. It’s that plus genocide just feels so grindy.
It doesn't work for the gas vents and seeps but for everything else as far as I know.
Given how poor the game is, I wouldn't be shocked if they do that at this point.
It was rather that it was first designed with what will be survival mode but then they took it out and released as a generic easy mode, check Howard’s interviews about how ailments were going to work and how fuel/running out of fuel was going to work.
So basically Far Cry 2. I look forward to my hourly malaria pills.
Thank you. Love the sounds of it.
So now I'll need MORE adhesive for this... great lol. I'm all for them doing some optional gameplay changes like this and their modular difficulty. Would love to see a robust set of optional modes that can be combined, as long as it is meaningful and well thought out changes. Survival for the PC, helium fuel for the ship, a no-HUD mode with better atmospheric hints (I play on low volume after kids go to sleep, die a lot because its hard to tell when dying if no sound...)
I think they could find a happy medium for H3... if people really hated the busywork of mining for it. Just make you have to buy a refueling license from NPC ports or build your own refueling depot on a planet to increase your range.
Right, it works especially well for Fallout because it reinforces the best parts of the game - the need to explore the world and pay attention to your surroundings. And of course, loot everything that isn't nailed down.
This is what I would like. A reason to build outposts that aren’t just for iron and aluminum mining. If I knew I could explore more of the world in my ATV or hovercraft because I have an outpost that has food and water on it, that planet would be fully explored opposed to other planets that I can only explore to the extent that my mass, water and food carrying abilities along with weapons allows.
Mass 200 / 300 

Ammo now has mass

Mass 54763 / 300
Don't forget eliminating fast travel in FO4.  You could still fast travel in NV survival mode but the time needed to travel that distance counted against your hunger and thirst, so if you start location hopping and not paying attention you could die fast travelling.
Yea I basically play all my SP games like this (the ones that cannot have it by default I use mods for) and it's great, Cyberpunk especially is just perfect all round with these tweaks. I love RPGs for their quests and worlds but the combat is ruined by this shit for me, thankfully they tend to be heavily modded games but why can they not just realise people like the options.
What's the point of getting better weapons or skills or perks then? What's the point of leveling up? Go play call of duty if you want that game play.

Kill off the whole "enemies level with you" concept. It's a cheap way to get away from making more content or obstacles.
Just tell yourself you did too much damage to the spacesuit whist making holes in the guys inside the spacesuit
Schlongdinger
I mean honestly at that point people should just be questioning every Bethesda game that doesn’t have any type of durability to the items. 

Yeah that armour from the guy you just warhammered in Skyrim probably isn’t the best anymore. Yeah that armour from the raider you shot so much they literally turned into bloody bits is literally nonexistent anymore.
Yeah, that seems like a premise for an entire sequel
I’m getting my hopes up by coming up with the most outrageous and unlikely scenarios, then when it doesn’t happen I’ll huff and puff about it on YouTube and make like $3 in ad money.
Even Skyrim had horses.
That's just not how the internet works though
And sexier.
Same with the helium depot poi's. Dozen of helium units for grabs and nowhere to put it
I do wonder if the survival elements the pulled would have led to a more interesting game loop. 

Like if you had to find fuel it would take so much longer to get everywhere and would force more exploration to find resources.
me who gets excited early game for that free he 3 so that i can supply my multi system cargo links
If you go all-in on gastronomy and nutrition food works as well as drugs for a lot of things.
Yeah I wandered straight in one direction to see how far POIs load in and at about 4km distance to the ship, the game tells you to turn around.
>With armour!  


^^^*sold ^^^separately.
But as Bethesda/Zenimax is (and always has been)a privately owned company now owned by Microsoft the only way to invest would be to buy M$ shares, which has a whole host of other far more important reasons for investors to be concerned with. It is true though that investors would be keen on investing in Beth if it offered an IPO. In the meantime Beth is of course trying to make a profit but the pressure is not direct. There is room for M$ to carry Beth as an artistic endeavour as much as a money-making proposition.
I'd be fine with that if their implementation wasn't fucking awful. Steam workshop was better at release and its drastically better than Bethesda's solution now.
I didn't make 1,500 Aurora for the money. I did it to send a message to Bayu.
Maybe it's the way I play but I have not had a problem with money in the game. And I really don't do anything special. I just loot and sell what I get. But it seems like everyone else has a hard time getting those credits.
Man...I don't know what your doing, but  it is SOOO easy to make money.

My favorite was

1.  building a very small, light, fast gunship with a class C reactor (for the shields and weapons) and the class A engines that allow you go to 180 speed. 
2. Then build an outpost somewhere in Serpentis
3. Takeoff from your outpost
4. Most likely there will be some Va'Ruun in orbit, kill all but the best ship 
5. Board it, kill everyone, loot it and then take it over
6. Land at you outpost, sell it
7. Switch back to your gun ship
8. Rinse and repeat.

I loved doing that. I got REAL good at space battles. My favorite is coming out of a jump right  into the middle of a big battle between the UC and spacers or Crimson fleet. 

I choose which is the best ship that I want in the end, then I kill ALL of them, saving the best for last to board it.

I mean..space battles to me are like a squirrel to a dog.  No matter what mission I'm on, I'll take the time to fight those battles and make some credits from selling a ship. Then again, I have ADHD in real life so there might be some underlying reasons I'm so easily distracted by shiny space battles.
I’ve already been collecting Chasmbass oil from the fish on Neon. Are you saying they don’t respawn or something?
I knew a guy who tripped on a chasmbass and broke his ankle during a coffee run for Ryujin, rough times
That's fair, you're probably right. I'd be okay with sacrificing an extra second or two to let them automatically position my ship in real time, without changing perspective. I think Star Wars Galaxies: JTL did docking this way. To me, the immersion is worth the tradeoff - maybe make it a menu option to appease both parties.

Why 102 characters? I'm really trying to dial in becoming an over-the-web armchair software programmer, as that was my last year's new year's resolution, so any information is welcome, I'm really running out of time!
A WKUK reference…. “I love it!”

I feel like that was in the original game plan. The specialized habs were to parallel settlement stores in FO4 so you could assign people to them and they'd work just like you're describing for general goods (storage bay), health items and healing (medbay), food items (mess hall), and weapons/ammo (armory). 

That would also make having a crew of 8 make more sense, so 4 could be dedicated ship crew and 4 to man the "stores."

There might have also been the idea that you don't get the benefit of ship weapons specialists unless you have a battle station hab, engine/drive specialists require an engineering bay, etc. 

That seems like the most likely explanation as to why those specialized habs exist; they were designed for gameplay elements that got "pruned" in the rush to market. Maybe they'll get built out in an update down the road.
The medic and weapon vendor would be nice as well as being able to craft ammo. All of that was already in fallout 4 so it’s not some monumental new thing. I also find outposts to be pretty much useless except for one as a primary base. Settlements in fallout 4 are more useful and I was really excited that they seemed to be expanding on them with outposts but after setting up a bunch of outposts with cargo links it all just ended up being kind of pointless. And then of course once you start ng+ it’s all gone anyway.
I enjoy what we have currently for outposts but I hope they expand on it. All of the Civilian outpost POIs have such interesting HAB buildings that I would love to be able to use, and they have internal walls and doors which would make the outpost building so much better
Or credits
Everyone hated the Malaria pills at the time, but looking back from Far Cry 6, those fucking pills changed the tone of FC2 drastically.
You’re welcome. Also as an addendum, I think the sleep to save your game also came with the added detriment that if you didn’t sleep in a safe location or your bed was on the ground you could pick up diseases from that too.
It’s called being prepared, okay?
FO4 survival mode really makes automatic weapons suck more than they usually do.

I mean, just look around this thread. If you like coming up with absurd speculation then speculating that that speculative hypothetical won't come to pass so that you can be pre-emptively mad; you're in good company here.

I definitely think so.

I think I read somewhere on this sub that Bethesda pulled these things because they were afraid it would make the game progression too slow, but I can't help but feel there would have been other ways to mitigate that, like increasing material drop rates or something.
It varies too. Depending on which direction you go and where in the cell your ship landed, it can be as little as ~1km. As far as I've seen/heard you land in a random place within the cell, not dead center. For example during the Rangers Quest to take out the base, I landed in 3 different spots all within that cell.
I’ve got plenty, but for my pirate playthrough, I was disappointed that this wasn’t an option. 

I think there is an issue with credits in that the start of the game makes you feel poor and there’s a sudden transition to being rich with nothing to buy.
The destroy spacer/pirate fleet missions are a gold mine.  Each usually are carrying a few thousand credits, plus you get the mission bonus.  Even better is if you come across the broken down courier ship.  Those missions I think are worth 16k a pop.

They’re making a joke lol, the “not copy-pastable” gives it away. They’re basically saying “make it long, impossible to copy/paste, and difficult to type.” The joke is that that would be a terrible implementation. 

I’m not sure if they’re making a reference or not, but it’s not a serious suggestion to read into.
Really? I feel most of the marketing for this game was reasonably tempered and the 'fans' made it out to be the next coming of Jesus Christ.
Quite possible, but they could’ve just been for looks.  Either way, that’s a cool idea!  I’ll bet even if it doesn’t get implemented by the studio, someone will figure it out with a mod.
Works for credits, it's just that the UI for them vanishes if you're in scanner mode

It's all over the place lol
Ah, FC2's malaria mechanic was something else. It made every mission feel like a race against time. I heard people talk about realism and immersion, but that was on another level of stressing me out in a good way. Love it or hate it, it added an unpredictable element that few games have tried to replicate. Could be interesting to see Starfield take on that challenge with different hazards depending on the planet you're visiting.
FC2 is from an era where games didn't care about you seeing all the content or even having fun if it meant it could deliver an overarching experience. People hated it because it's actively trying to be unfun. I understand why the industry moved away from it but part of me wishes more games had the balls to carry that sort of legacy nowadays.
Far Cry 2 is still one of my favorite games. I ran the campaign 3-4 times and continue to revisit it every now and then. I hated the malaria mechanic but damn if I didn't appreciate it's effect on gameplay.
True. You COULD sleep on a cardboard mat on the ground, but it wouldn't give you the full "well rested" bonus, and you could get diseases. 

A true bed, in a safe location, would give you a well rested bonus. 

Avoid sleep long enough and your character gets sick. Helps with a day/night cycle, for sure.
Something might need to be riveted or railroad spiked!
Schroding-a-ling
Neon as a whole was... Quite the disappointment, to me. Part of this is that I had never looked at the promotional material for it (Assuming there was some, anyway), so I'd been picturing something like Night City or Zaun.

But yeah, that lounge was something else. I know Bethesda doesn't like to make things too M-rated, but really with those outfits?
I heard that play testers didn’t like it so they changed it to be more casual. Makes me wonder if play testers just don’t want the play testing to be longer. Would have been so much better.
On a pirate playthru right now, honestly the "lower ship registration fee" mod saved the run for me. Before I would make 4-6k off of 3 stolen ships. Now I'm making 30k+
I never remember being poor, one of my first wtf moments was how I got so many credits so fast.
It's a little extreme, but a Bethesda type of thing to do, then modders will add a copy paste feature
It is however exactly the sort of thing BGS would do without a shred of irony
That's not better
Yeah I kinda liked the malaria mechanic. It added a terribly inconvenient X factor to the game where sometimes it would flare up during a mission and you had to figure out if you had time to finish the task or if you had to leave to get more meds then come back. Not pausing the game when you looked at the map was another good tension builder.. even the weapon limitations for each slot and having to chose your load out was something you really had to give serious thought to. FC2 was a really unforgiving game that felt very rewarding once you actually got good at it.
Far Cry 2 felt such like a survival game. I loved the weapon deterioration and the jamming system. It made firefights more extreme.
I'll never forget driving one night into a town, being met by a 4 car troop and getting pinned down. I go to load my revolver and all of a sudden I start coughing up blood, couldn't see straight, had to bunker down while they got closer. I think I set a fire in the shack I was in and snuck out the back window and fled into the woods. Fuck I loved this game.

Built-in, non-optional survival mechanics would have completely killed this game for far more gamers than the number who would have appreciated it. The sort of gamers who would want to play that way might come back if it's added as a later optional mode, but the average gamer who just wants to have fun would never, ever come back if those elements were only made optional later.

Because the mode was optional, and absolutely HAD to be optional, it was an easy decision to cut it to focus on core, non-optional systems in time for release. This is really easy to understand.
And the guns get dirty over use and time and would jam
I miss those times when Ubisoft was still making good games...
It’s easy to understand why they did it— my point is it makes the game worse. Obviously that’s subjective, so either people will agree or disagree. That should be pretty easy to understand too.
And if you didn’t maintain them, they would end up catastrophically malfunctioning and just falling apart in your hands. Happened to a desert eagle that came from one of my companions that I wasn’t able to save.
I forgot about companions dying. Man that was so good. I remember being in a huge fire fight with my favorite companion. Loads of enemies, fire spreading everywhere. My companion went down near the end. I ran over to him and he was too far gone, so the game let you use all of your morphine syrettes to ease their passing while they mumble and cry. As he died your character just kinda let's him down to the ground. Then a fucking achievement pops up "Goodnight Sweet Prince". I was hit hard by that one. Was not expecting them to die nor for it to be so dramatic. Top tier gaming memory for me.
What about GTA VI?
What about 100+
Well, seeing that Red Dead 2 had 94 story missions. It might be more or less but around the same number.
Two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6, a number 7, two number 45s = 130 missions
I'd rather have quality > quantity. I dont want every second mission to drive here->shoot->come back->mission passed.
Well I'm actually a rockstar employee and I can confirm GTA VI will have at least more than 1 mission 👍
I prefer side missions TBH. I can do it, or I can skip it. That's my favorite stuff
Hopefully at least 150 missions. 

All I want is a story as compelling as RDR2.
80-85, that’s about the length of RDR 2 without the epilogue and should be well enough to tell Jason and Lucia‘s story.

Quality over quantity
Nice.
How many main story missions did RDR2 have? That many
I hope it has atleast 80 or more. Gtav felt too quick, I got through it in just a few nights.
What about 420 to go along with 5s 69
Don’t care about the amount, just make them quality
I don't care that much about how many missions there are. The quality and length of the missions is way more important.
i do feel GTA 5 was too short and loved how long SA was. some missions could’ve been trimmed, but i feel all of the strands of missions added to the story and made sense
I say after 50 missions the progression of the game needs to allow most things to be unlocked and enough cash to kinda buy and do whatever. Hopefully there’s some good ways to get cash without having to finish the story then do a stock manipulation. Kinda like how gta v has so much more to setup and work on than offline.
It would be nice for this trend to stop. On the other hand I want quality missions over a bunch of pointless missions.
GTAV had a low mission count but a lot of them were long missions with multiple stages compared to relatively straightforward missions from some of the others. Like, you often go to multiple locations, different stages, and you're flipping to different characters.

GTAV's heists, for example, are sometimes as long as what would count as two to three missions from the others. It's to the point on a couple where I think the missions were a bit bloated.

I personally think GTAIV struck the best balance between lots of missions and those missions being quality encounters. Actually, I think IV did a lot better on a content to quality ratio in general. Hanging out with friends felt like an actual mechanic as opposed to a tacked on feature.

That said, there are still a lot of missions even in IV that amounted to "drive ten minutes, shoot one guy, done."
To this day, San Andreas was their most advantageous game. It had so much going on, and a bunch of the details/mechanics didn't make it into the next 2 games. 6 is looking like the next big jump.
The gta vice city statistic is wrong. There are only 38 story missions. The rest of the 86 are part of the side content. If you count the businesses you have 61. same goes for GTA 3.  51 story missions and the rest is side content.
Shit I better hope it increases. I want it to be more than san andreas. I mean V was a W but it has low story missions. No offense to V anyways I like the story. The missions are long and it has a lot of side missions. Better hope VI will have more story and side missions than san andreas.
CJ do keep it 100 doe
Wow! San Andreas had 100 missions? I don’t remember them at all
Count all the optional stuff for older games but not for V lol. There's only 38 missions in VC's storyline.
8 missions
Oh also, how interesting that Vice City has 86 missions while being set in ‘86
40 missions but designed to be more open so you can have multiple ways of approaching the objective
What also hurt with V is that along with that low mission count, a decent number of them were simple tasks such as parking a getaway car somewhere before a heist. 

On the flip side, GTA IV had a high volume of missions, but they often lacked creativity. That game, especially being the next release after San Andreas, often felt more like a tech demo at times than it did a fully fleshed out GTA game. 

Don't get me wrong IV and V were still good games, I just feel neither were better than San Andreas was, especially relative to when they came out. I am hoping that VI can get the series back to the quality that was there with San Andreas with an interesting map, a long story with many unique and fun missions. 

RDR2 shows Rockstar still can produce at a higher quality than anyone else, so I expect VI's story to be high tier. My biggest worries with it are the length of the story and the freedom in the gameplay. It's no secret that GTA V and RDR2 were significantly more linearly structured in their missions that the older GTA titles were, and that's been a negative in my eyes.
Bro any gta v mission is better than any San Andreas mission.. rather have less but good quality ones instead of go to a. Pizza shop steal a gun and get a haircut..
GTA V ~ Nice
With the map being so big, I imagine we are going to get a lot of missions. 

I also hope there are a bunch of side missions. 

I don't know if they will call them Strangers and Freaks again, but seeing as how it is a parody of Florida, they might call them Leonida Man missions.
GTA 3 is misleading. The 77 includes all optional missions. There is only like 50 missions required to reach the conclusion.
Haha funny number
San Andreas was such an awesome, unique game
Its not counting side missions on gta5. It would have the most
Hmm
I can't believe 5 had so little missions.
I want 100+ quality missions
Gta 3 feels eternal
I just hope GTA6 will have a long story. If we waited over a decade for only 50-60 missions then it's going to be disappointing.
I'm replaying GTA V story mode and I can't help but feel like things happen way too fast idk
I just bought and started 5 about a month ago. Couldn't play Trevor and had to uninstall.
I think I remember hearing when they first mentioned story mode that it would be the longest story mode to date and I REALLY hope that’s accurate. I was a little underwhelmed by how short GTAV’s story mode is.
GTA V and GTA SA do a really good job at missions. GTA SA has quality and quantity but missions are short. GTA V has less quantity but absolutely creative and long quality missions.
What matters is that they are cool heists and not boring as fuck
GTA 5 might’ve not had the most missions but what it got was different characters arcs and the missions were way bigger. Unlike GTA SA where you had to drive for 10 minutes to take some selfie for the triads
69 count doesn't include strangers and freaks which have all the same components of a mission without the cinematics. 🥸
I’d say about 84 main missions. Funny enough, adding all of the missions numbers from those game gives 420
[deleted]
At least Vs missions were fun and long
Yeah but them missions in GTA 5 were fuckin incredible
Yo wtf? This is real?
Fuck…. gta v felt like a drag and it had the least amount of missions
I'm hoping GTA 6 has 200+ missions.  


Maybe it's a little overdoing it and drawn out? I don't know but I want as much GTA 6 content as possible and as long as the missions and storyline is interesting without making it feel like main missions are side missions added to make the game feel longer, then I'm all for 200+ missions.
Less than gta 5 🥺🥺
Didn’t they say it will have 300 hours worth of content?
The reason why I don't like gta 4 as much as other people is because alot of missions are not related to the main plot and most of them are go there shoot this come back
Missions in GTA 3 be like: Drive misty to the strip club! (4 blocks away.)

(2 seconds later...)

Mission passed! $5000
2
42
Damn SA felt so much shorter than iv
is this counting Strangers and Freaks/Side Missions??
prob like 84.
considering the map will be massive with several cities i’m assuming they’ll make the most out of it. 90~ missions
How many in red dead? Then I’ll guess. 

VI will be more aligned with red dead than any of these games imo
They write it in the trailer they say why 69 when you can be 109
About tree fiddy
Was 69 on purpose???
I have a feeling they deliberately made SA 100 exact missions. Someone said the other day “San Andreas starts off with 10% story, then goes to 80% filler, then back to the last 10% story” and that has really made me reconsider how I view SA 😂😂
I expect at least 25h of gameplay for main story
Id take 70 shorter ones over like 20 excruciating long ones because you can do other shit in between
I'm really hoping they have it be condensed from rdr2. It was WAY TOO long in my opinion. Have a bunch of side content for those who want to get hundreds of hours worth of story content. GTA 5 had a pretty good length. Maybe an hour or 2 longer than that. But please be shorter than red dead.
I’m going to go low-brow and point out the 69 missions for GTA V - nice.
I hope to god it’s not that long. I love RDR 2 and GTA IV but I want better variety in missions instead of just shootouts
Yeah but with San Andreas I did the first 14 missions in less than an hour. With 5 I did the first 5 in an hour.
Nice
Could be ever increasing and changing through updates.
Vice city doesn’t seem right. Is that counting side missions? I remember the story being pretty short.
61-67
It’s to my understanding that it’s gonna be around the same as IV/Vice City maybe a little more
My guess is 82
My guess is 82
its going to havr 420 because its the other funny number
AI says that GTA VI will likely have 62 missions based on the pattern
Quantity+ Quality please.
Tbf GTA 4 and 5 both have a range of missions which I prefer especially with gta 4 but I still enjoy San Andreas becuase the story is good and the missions are short even if there are 100
12
![gif](giphy|p6eCHsXxFdAI0)
Id say having at least 70 story missions would be a good balance. And to keep with the Bonnie & Clyde theme, have a 3rd of that number dedicated to heists. 

Then have like 30 side missions to flesh out Leonida a bit more outside of theain campaign.
well it says why 69 when you can 919 in an ad on the plane remember? could be a hint
That was the problem with gta 5. Story is too short, even if it technically isn’t it feels like it because the missions are diluted across 3 characters and they aren’t incredibly connected
I think 80-90 missions is a good spot, but it also depends on how in-depth the game world itself is. GTA IV is the perfect length for me because Liberty City is such an incredible city. Say what you want about the size of it, but every inch of that map is absolutely packed with things to see and do. That in return, makes actually doing the missions themselves more engaging.

V's missions (for the most part) were consistently all good-great, and they did a good job of "trimming off the mission fat." But sometimes that fat adds more flavor, and I think a quick filler mission here or there adds another layer of depth that V didn't keep. Sure, there are the Strangers & Freaks missions, which function exactly the same AS the story missions, so if you look at it that way, that means GTA V technically has 127 "story missions."

San Andreas had the most potential to do what IV did before it did, but SA almost has the exact opposite problem: too much fat. There's so many missions in between all of the standout ones that are just annoying- especially in the mid game. You can really feel the mission design "cutting room floor" changes, and as iconic as the countryside is, driving to Angel Pine from San Fierro sucks. Every. Time. You could cut quite a few missions in this game and honestly as much as I adore it, it'd be better for it.

IV's missions, while still sharing a lot of fat, worked so much better for it because you were never NOT engaged with Liberty City. The world of that game was the true star, not Niko (much love for my boy though dw) and the more basic missions could benefit from just how finely crafted that city is.
Always Quality over Quantity
69 seems like a good enough number to keep intact
The thing is that a lot of missions in the earlier games (SA and VC are the biggest offenders), a lot of the missions are basically the same if you remove the cutscenes. Drive here, shoot people, you win. GTA5 was way more innovative and had way more creativity in the mission design. I can’t think of a single GTA5 mission I didn’t like.
One... hundred MILLION HAHAHAA
Vice City didn't have that many missions, right?
100 will be fine!
GTA IV had way too many missions.
112
if its long and interesting which it seems like it is im down
At least one
Depends on if you count Strangers and Freaks or not (5's 69 missions does not -- there are 58 of those).
75, but the game gon’ be like 100+ hours long
So I wasn't crazy when I felt GTAV felt way too short. I knew the 3 protagonist had a bit to do with it, but this confirms it wasn't just that.
dude i just want to drive with my tuned car to the stip club and see it jiggle
84
77 missions in GTA 3? I swear there were fewer
All I want is a cameo from either Trevor Franklin or Michael. Maybe Trevor delivers a drug shipment in a plane or something. They got lost mc into 5, so idk. Maybe we see lazlow again
I don't want a lot of missions that are just "drive there, kill this guy, drive someplace else..." I want exciting missions with a nice story. If good missions means not a lot of missions then so be it.

That said, I would like a lot of side missions to do, separate from the main story
50ish. They want this to be an online game.
Better have 100
I think 78
Need to beat gta iv again this time on PC :-)
My new logic in general for GTA is; 
How much/big/many? 
-Yes. 
Because they should assume that the game has to stand for a decade or more, without sacrificing too much quality of course. With this logic, I would say 120 or more, but I wouldn't necessarily bet on that to be the case.
lucia
GTA III had 51 story missions

and GTA VC had 38 story missions 

from where did you got these numbers dude
Hopefully its packed with missions and shit to do it would be a shame if it was super short like that saints row reboot
a lot of people complained that RDR2 was a bit of a slog to get through which leaves me pessimistic. i think around 60 but tons of side content/strangers&freaks for those that want it hopefully
Possibly using procedural generation for new missions, so the answer is unlimited!
Around 80 I'd say
Probably between 120 - 150 missions
The next logical number would be 420.
Yah lots of devs did this. Less and less pve story content. Pvp is trash gaming. Sad to see the heart of gaming shrink.
The average reduction in missions vs the number of games is 39/6, and divided, the average amount of missions downsized is 6.5, so it's likely GTA6 has between 59 and 64 missions, factoring in the fluctuations in mission deficiencies from prior game.
420 seems like the obvious choice
Anything above 70 with great quality in content uniqueness, complexity, depth and weight and length. A great game doesn’t scream I have more it calmly says, I have enough.
what terrible order is this
34. I read an interview  years ago, where take two ceo ,said that future gta games will be smaller in scope. Smaller campaign ,with more emphasis on online, with episodic content over time.
I hope it’s more than 60 missions, however the cynical part of me thinks it’s gonna be around GTA 5’s length while they focus the rest on Online.
Oh man
V’s missions were chunky af at times. Even doing the menial tasks for heists. So the lower number served it well
numbers don't matter. I'd rather have 10 really awesome  well written fun missions than 100 boring and repetitive missions.
85+ missions, less strict when it comes to mission failing
I'd say 42.
Well some of the missions are quite a lot bigger than last year?!

I DON’T CARE HOW BIG THEY ARE!
Probably 130 or something
What about read dead 2?
It keeps decreasing overtime Holeh.
Quality over quantity. I’d rather 50 great well thought out missions vs 100 generic drive to point A shot x enemies then drive to point B
39.....
My dreams confirmed it to me. 113 main story missions and 21 side missions
50 QUALITY missions please and thank you.
Now do the count without filler
I feel its more important if we see it in a matter of hours length of the main story instead of total count of missions that is useless
250
I'm hoping something around 80 as a minimum
420
Damn wtf was GTA V really only 69?
Probably like 30 single player, and then 30 you have to do on GTA Online 2.
Nice
420
My number is on 80
GTA V was a shitshow when it comes to gameplay design. Too many of the missions were just "drive here, watch cutscene" or "drive here and play interactive QTE". Not enough missions with actual driving and shooting.
Personally, I’d rather have a low number of high quality missions, that a high number of mediocre ones.
I want a quality story. I don’t care about how many missions there will be. I just want the missions to be interesting, and I just hope it won’t drag on for too long.
Im going to come back here in 2025, and see who was right
Rdr2 took me a few months to beat I want GTA 6 to be similar or even longer than rdr2
This list is inconsistent
More than 80 for sure
Gta 6 needs to have the most missions
San Andreas is the longest GTA game and they've been shrinking the main story missions so I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being 50 or less. There was a rumor that GTA 6 could be shorter than the rest of the GTAs
I remember when leaks came out that there was only 69 "missions" in GTA5, people were losing their minds. Claiming it was only going to take 10 hours to beat the game etc.
10 replays of these 69 missions for 10 years now
Gonna guess 80-100 for gta 6.  But I think this game could have an infinite number of side missions, similar to GTA v online.  

Now there are leaks pointing towards property owning, drug dealing, gang wars, cop wars, and gun running. I think this will be one of those games where, even after the story,  we still have missions to complete. Rockstar mastered that formula in online, why not bring it to single player?
I'm saying around 100.
At least 4
Red Dead 2 had 94 story missions, so 6 will probably have more than 5 had
200
RDR2 has 107 missions, I'm pretty sure, around that area so GTAVI wouldn't surprise me if it were like that too
Online is where it’s at
I have played every GTA since the first one back in 96. GTA 4 was the right length for me. SA was a touch too long and 5 was too short. 5 had some epic missions and some criminal filler. VC was pretty compelling story wise and never felt a drag to me, also perfect length. 

I would love a great story but also I want the online component to be workable solo. Let us hire NPC’s if more than one ‘player’ is needed for heists.
Why 69 when you can 919
A small chunk of San Andreas missions were just filler. I'm talking about the *really tedious* missions such as Snail Trail or the one where you reconnaissance photos with Cesar and then he ditches you in Angel Pine instead of San Fierro.
I KNEW IT! I just finished V yesterday and despite it's a great game and has a great map and a lot of side story missions, it felt clearly shorter than San Andreas. I didn't expect it to be even shorter than III!
10/5*25+2+(24*2)
Rdr2 had 94 story missions. I’m guessing a good 100 story missions+ other 50 random stories and encounters..but if I’m being honest I’d like more like 100-200 random encounters or even more
Gta 5 had 69 missions but shit like 'buy a mask' and 'buy overalls' counted as a mission each.
GTA III character looks the coolest
That 69 is pretty misleading, there's nearly as many strangers and freaks missions and they're not all super basic. There's also more story missions that are alternate approaches to heists.

Also GTA 4 officially has 94 story missions, at least according to in-game. Though 6 of them are probably just cutscenes
54 missions, with more variability
GTA SA really peak for having that many missions yet never feeling like it’s dragging on. In fact, I always thought they could actually drag out each city even more.
420 since gta 5 has 69
amount!=quality
4
the higher the quality the game, the less missions (so far)
Is this only counting main storyline missions? If so you have to factor in how quick some of the missions were to complete from gta 3-sa. Even though gta v had less missions I felt each mission was longer and more engaging when it came to telling the story. Other than that in my opinion I think 6 will prob have anywhere from 65-85 main missions to progress the story then obviously a bunch of side missions and random encounter missions you can do.
Make the mission structure like cyberpunk and Ill be happy
I pick gta4 an gta 5 an now gta6  all 3 r my favorites
What if it's only got 1 and it's roguelike with permadeath and it last 15 hours?
I think 90 is the sweet spot. They can even divide them into theatrical acts. Missions 1 to 30 as Act I (Beginning), Missions 31 to to 60 as Act II (Middle) and Missions 61 to 90 as Act III (End). That way, Missions 30, 60 and 89/90 can serve as big action set pieces to cap off each act.
From 3 to 4 it goes up by 11 so probably going to be more
Does GTA IV count DLC (Gay Tony, etc.)
420
That game still not done
69 -> 420
I would rather quality over quantity.
I actually replayed GTA 5 like 2 weeks ago and it took me like 3 or 4 days to finish to the story mode so I honestly thought that was kinda short. I personally prefer game lengths similar to RDR 2. I'm replaying RDR 2 rn and it's been like 5 days and I'm only in Chapter 5 ( Mostly Bc I love doing the side content). So hopefully GTA VI has more story missions as RDR 2 but if not it should definitely have much much MUCH more side content
I bet 50 missions, maybe they'll be really long or something idk
We should be playing new missions for years to come after release
how about vcs?
San Andreas felt like it was infinitively replayable
I'm betting 69 again
I hope we GTA 700,000,000 to tide us over for GTA7
San Andreas was unholy levels of long. My disk got scratched twice to the point of not being able to play. They should make if the same again. Then again can RDR2 levels be matched. It really is still the pinnacle of gaming.
1, the tutorial and at the end the guy mugs you and kicks you out of the car saying Good luck.
100, but halfway through, you hit a pay wall.
They made a black guy work harder than the rest 😅😂🤣
Heh, 69.
This doesn’t factor in the length of the missions, so it’s kinda misleading
Surely they can increase the size the map 5 times in a row and it NOT go down in mission count for a 5th time. SUUUURELY.
Does San Andreas actually have 100 story missions? That’s the only one here I (unfortunately) didn’t get too far into.
Yall acting like quantity over quality, id prefer 69 missions that left an impact on me over 100 missions that feel the same
what does gta 5 have including the online stuff and dlc?
Judging by the trend, less
Nice
69
Wait, GTA Vice City had 86 missions? That's cool
GTA 4 and VC were the sweet spot for me.

San Andreas is my favourite in the series, but that game is almost **too** big to replay even just once every couple of years or so
Honestly even i felt GTA 5 was just a lil short of saying it doesnt overstay its welcome.
VC may have that many but you can get to th ending by just doing like a third, i believe most starting in second island are optional and are not required for the finale.
 At least a good 158
San Andreas is my favorite.
66
Most logical would be around 80-90, but if the missions are bigger than ever, id say Max. 75 missions
gta v nice
I think RDR2 had about 100+ missions including some side missions. As long as there's quality instead of quantity - fluff, I don't mind the ~~body~~ count.
coaie abia a aparut primul trailer si voi deja vreti numar de misiuni sunteti terminati
About 20 a year in total until gta 7 comes out (: Id hope for
Damn 5 had the least? Weird
It will only have one mission with Lucia and the guy robbing a gas station, then you meet Lamar and get introduced to GTA Online and get plastic surgery to make your character
But the GTA V missions are significantly longer and better.
Honestly hope for 100 missions or more, we've waited a long time
Considering it'll have 2 protagonists, I'd expect around 80-100 missions and they'd be longer on average than gta 5 missions
GTA VI bout to have 50 missions
50
These aren’t in order so nr descending like it shows
Its getting lesser anyway i wud say 50
I will give it 20 missions and the rest behind a pay wall
I'm sure around 70 missions and also alot of side missions
Ig 919 missions because Rockstar told us  🛩️"why 69 when you can 919"
Wow gta5 seemed longer than 69 mission?
420
If you add all those numbers up it’s 420
I’m sure it’ll be much less than 100. All the focus will probably be on GTA online since that’s the real money maker
guys do anyone know how I can play GTA San Andreas in my Xbox ? I want to play the original version but isn't available in the Microsoft store
and gta v still feels too long
They did 69. Now they gotta do 420.
That’s like comparing the 100 free games of an old computer magazine to 50 Nintendo triple a games 
Never compare quantity with quality
I hope it’s more but I can’t see them doing a large number of missions and not have the story feel like it’s being dragged out
Also mission length and complexity should be considered.
69… good… very good…
I think it would be a Moye Moye
I hope the story is more interactive like if you shoot that cop it will have a impact on the story like a area be more guarded or a area have no cops because of a funeral
Considering all the speculations around how big the map's gonna be, I don't think mission numbers with two digits gonna cut it.

If the game size is 2-3 times large as it is expected to be, Any number with 3 digits is highly plausible so I'm definitely expecting 100+ story missions!
Helicopter mission ☠️☠️☠️
Vice city did NOT have 86 missions
🤍
I want the story to have more twists and turns like a series
420?
3 hour long story mode and GTA online is a monthly subscription
2
SA IS KING TIL FURTHER NOTICE!!!!
Why 69 when u can 919..
919 missions conformed
Shvifty five.
nice
I’m thinking around 100 not including side missions
This doesn't seem right, but I never counted. Shocked  GTA V is at the bottom tho
I'm thinking somewhere between 100 - 110
Tbh I felt like GTA SA didn’t really have that many missions that felt unnecessary, but I also doubt that GTAVI will have that many side stories (I’d like to be proven wrong).  That being said, I love playing story mode.  I really hope we can get around 90
20
I heard a rlly big map so like 420
Nice
Probably around 86-95 if I had to take a guess
Probably somewhere between 94 and 69. Seems the most logical
I think Red Dead Redemption 2 had 107 missions
That doesn’t make any sense. GTA V had 69 missions, so RDR2 should more or less be around the same number. Each game is its own separate experience, and number of missions has no correlation with previous games.
85
RDR2 had 108 story missions.
As long as it’s a fun journey. As much as I love RDR 2, I can’t play through 2 epilogues again.
Not everything has to revolve around rdr2 you know. GTA is a different series.
Yeah in this case these games are already at a point of it being too much more isn’t better just how well those ones are made that they do have.
We shall see. I predict 102

!RemindMe March 18, 2025
And a large soda = a compelling epilogue.
55 burgers 55 shakes
A number 6 WITH EXTRA DIP.
one with cheese
Where is the extra dip
Do people realize he was ordering for the whole car? Cuz he lists off the things the others just told him and also says his order.
I thought he was just adding up the number of times you just had to follow the dam train cj
There should be a drive thru atp
That would be quite interesting
Forgot the other number 6 with extra dip
You forgot a number 6 with extra dip
I'd like a few of those small missions. Like stealing a car and bringing it safely to a garage or something.
San Andreas had a great balance of both imo:

It had the most missions of any GTA, but each one felt unique and well-written
That is exactly what GTAIV was. I really want some diversity in the missions this time
Well San Andrea's had the most and that game was great quality imo! Long af too lol
Quality including challenging? GTA V was missing any aspect of challenging gameplay.
This is what made gta 4 really repetitive for me compared to the other ones
This.

I want missions just having to fight your way out of crazy situations and once that's done...

Mission passed.

I ain't a delivery man.
GTA SA had both Quality and Quantity. All I want from GTA VI is a good lore, the stories are the only thing that makes every GTA game great.
I don't want many "drive to the other side of the map" missions.
What if you have a quantity with quality?
That's like every mission in gta online atm
For 10 years of waiting and 1 and a half year, I'd rather have both.
Ah so you don't like gtao?
Maybe you are looking to another game
I agree with you but the problem is that 5 doesn't have quality🤣
I prefer that 100x over doing fucking yoga🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
GTA 5 had neither, GTA 4 had both
GTA V was story mission wise neither quality nor quantity
still good in gta5, red dead 2 missions felt too slow tho with the horses, driving a car is atleast fun
In GTA6, it's rumored you'll have to ride a horse to your destination talking to your fellow gang members until you can level up to a bike or car.
Gta 3 be like:
I agree. I hope the story is dynamic as well and different players can make difference decisions with different outcomes. A smooth dynamic story with multiple angles and characters and things happening simultaneously. Should be like a playable movie or series lol.
you don’t want the shooter driving game to be about shooting and driving?
Unfortunately you have to consider the genre. This is absolutely going to be a majority of the missions in GRAND THEFT AUTO lol
Highly doubt it
i'm rockstar...i can confirm that you'r fired
Hi, Rockstar here. I too can confirm that GTA VI will have less than 9000 mission!
Rockstar ceo here. Can confirmed you are fired and arrest order has been issued for leaking company secrets.
You're setting the bar way too high man
You’re going to jail
😐
You’d love the new Harry Potter game then. It’s like Grand Theft Broomstick lol
Yes to side missions. Gang turf wars, ambulance, whatever. 


That being said, I’m greedy. I’d also love like 150 storyline missions. I’m sure that’s hard to do, but part of me thinks they stick to around 70-90 due to research showing people drop off. I want more, I loooove lengthy games (when they’re good)
Shit take 🗑️👆🏾
All I want is 60 hours campaign like rdr2, with a lot sides and encounters
All i ask for is the map to be littered with creepy locations just like in RDR2. Manbearpig, vampire cave, serial killer’s cellar, etc. Those were so unsettling but fun to find
People will crucify me for this but the GTA 5 story is better than RDR2. Just because RDR2 has more emotional moments doesn’t make it a better story
150 is way too many
Nice
94 story missions and 15 “honor missions” so around 109 total depending on your choices and honor level
42069 missions for GTA 7
If you add all the missions in the image up, they equal 420
Technically the campaign is one mission? So one mission that takes me 80 to complete would be good with me.
Hope Cash actually has actual uses in singleplayer unlike RDR2 and Gta5
true, but gta 4 also felt longer because when you failed a mission you had to do it from the start
V missions kinda dragged a lot (checkpoints kinda enabled them to do that), but IV had the perfect length and balance for sure.
Eh, I always felt like vanilla GTA IV didn't have enough variety compared to other GTAs when it came to main missions. Most of em were "regular" shootouts or chases with little gameplay originality. It got much better with the DLCs though.
I hope so!
That was back when I still tried to 100% games in Moms basement with the boys. Some of the side missions in SA were ridiculously hard for some people. Looking at you, RC plane and dried pool bike challenge....

The RC plane was super easy for me, but I had to trade a friend for the bike challenge, he had no problem with it.

Also I don't think the RDR2 challenges are counted in mission totals.
"Relative to release" never understood this point when comparing the games. Measuring the games by their cultural impact or impact to the gaming industry is a quality that can only be done once. Once that notorious reputation is gained the best you can do is maintain it. You can't gain a reputation the product already has.
Remembers yoga
Thing is GTA 5 for now has the biggest map in the series but the missions were so little even GTA 4 had more missions but the map was way smaller than San Andreas.
Quick google search shows to complete GTA SA is around 30 hours and 31 hours for GTA 5. 

Haven’t played GTA SA in a while but I’m guessing a lot of those missions must have been rather short
a lot of the mission in gta sa is really short, like 2-3 minutes
Almost all of them were over 20 minutes that's why
I mean what do you want to do when you play if playing the game feels like a drag?
A lot of San Andreas missions were relatively short
No
San Andreas had a lot of quality for 100 and V had a short feeling with only 69. 

I think we need 80 missions or so with VI.
around 80 will be good
more than 1 less than 200 100%
> 69

Nice. 

(In all seriousness, it'll probably be somewhere in between. Rockstar wants to surpass V, yes, but wants to do so with more advanced tech than what was present in RDR2. 81 missions would feel about right.)
my money is around 120 simply based on the fact of how long they been working on it and how big this game will be. optimistic tho i know
Probably 77
That was a long epilogue. So much so that I haven't actually finished it
Is that a liter of cola, Farva?
This guy's trying to start a pay-it-forward chain!
Keep it 55th st
I'M DOIN' SOMETHING!!!
I don't think many people realize this. Smoke's order is everything after the "Number 6 with extra dip". Even though he still ordered a lot for himself, the two number 9s were for CJ and Ryder and the number 6 with extra dip was for Sweet.
Since the other people say what they'll have, I just assumed that Smoke was killing time for the Ballas to show up
Oh I hated that mission. But this made me LoL
so every gta ever
Yeah but just few.
maybe introducing some radiant quests could be a good way to handle this? Almost GTA Online style
They should actually just do like Cyberpunk and have those smaller theft missions you can do without actually being story mission
I would love like **A BUNCH** of small menial missions spread about.

A lot of people complained about Mafia III being repetitive. And it was, a lot of the missions were the exact same, just in different places with the slightest variations, if any. But I loved the game because there was so much to do, even if it was all the same in the end.
Why? You can do that whenever you want without it being a mission. I hate those filler missions personally.
I want more police, fire truck, and ambulance side missions that give perks when completed.
GTA's signature missions.
Except “all you had to do was follow the damn train CJ!”
Beginning was a bit slow for me tho
That’s until you get to the fucking plane missions. Spent several hours both on the toy one and the actual training ones.
I didn't play much of IV because the PC port is dogshit and I couldn't even run it on a decent computer a decade later, but I probably got only 7 missions in and noticed how similarly they all were all designed. Drive to location, shoot up enemies, drive back and/or escape. It's not like the game has any diversity in approach either like stealth so it becomes dull quickly. However, including a bunch of gameplay pillars is something that kind of started happening after that era. The Ubisoft approach of open worlds where you're pretty much given a sandbox mission area and you choose to approach mostly began circa 2010 and kept opening up more and more afterwards. Now we're probably overexposed to that style of gameplay as well. I loved doing it in AC Origins and was sick of it by the time Odyssey came out. It's like comparing Uncharted 1 gameplay to Uncharted 4. They're designed quite differently in the way enemies behave and how detection works. Rockstar never really stopped doing overly scripted missions, but we've seen how capable they are at actually doing the sandbox stuff in-game. RDR2 has a bunch of open world encounters and activities that respond to your choices and actions and I feel like they've gone underappreciated with how interesting they are. Everybody focuses on the missions, but the open world has a bunch of non-linear gameplay opportunities. I would compare them slightly to the Gigs in Cyberpunk 2077 where most players probably don't know there's multiple ways to complete most of them, they just don't spell it out on the objective bar and take experimenting.
Obviously a personal preference, but GTA is not really a game I play to be challenged, so personally I don't mind the slant towards easier gameplay.

In my mind, there's plenty of FPS games out there if people want a challenging experience. When I die in GTA I want it to be because I did something stupid like fly off a cliff doing 120 on a motorcycle, rather than being sniped by some super good NPCs.

I acknowledge this could also just be me getting older, with worse reaction time and less time to grind at video games 😂
Yeah the most challenging mission was the Trevor dock mission. Cause it's so boring I couldn't finish it for a while
I really agree, San Andreas had some challenge to some of the missions which makes you appreciate the story more while not being way too hard
Turn off aim assist if you want more of a challenge. Rockstar doesn't really include difficulty options, so you pretty much have to handicap yourself if you're a skilled gamer since it's a game made for a wide audience.
Yes and it's a shame because the storyline and protagonist is great
Anytime paleto bay is mentioned I get ptsd. It’s so fucking far, and it’s hard af to get there in a fast car without crashing and setting off the cops unless you’re Franklin.
Unrealistic expectations
Yea it was a fun story don’t get me wrong, but not really captivating in any way for me. I don’t remember most of the missions.
Red dead had missions with some good narratives associated with them, the blizzard section, train heist, manor, Tahiti, etc
Thank you for that observation
No my dad works at rockstar and says what this guy is saying is true.
Yeah, I mean; *why would it?* you know?
Hi, God here. GTA VI will come out.
so it’s not over 9,000? 😞
Except with atrociously repetitive combat
>Gang turf wars, ambulance

That’s not a side mission, that’s just an activity.

I want side stories, like the various stranger storylines in rdr2
One of the flaws of GTA 5 (imo) was the rather low mission count. It had 3 protagonists to juggle but only 69 missions, and it really showed. We barely knew anything about the Chinese dude that was Trevor’s main antagonist and kidnapped Michael. A lot of the tension between Mike and Trevor due to Brad had to be resolved when they hung out with each other after the story completion. The story just felt rushed at times.
Explain
Noice
420 main, 69 side missions
I absolutely agree with that. GTAIV also had some brutal missions and the cops were harder to shake in LC, as memory serves.
Yeah, since the trailer I've been rewatching a lot of GTAV content on youtube. I'm kind of floored being reminded by how long some of them go on for where not much happens. Like, that mission where Trevor, Franklin, and Lamar drive up to Paleto Bay or Trevor drives into Los Santos. Those missions were long af.

Death Wish itself is pretty damn close to an hour.
Lost was not very varied. Almost every mission ends with a shootout or running from the cops. Ballad on the other hand I will agree was pretty varied, one of the best DLC ever put out imo even though a lot of the side content in Ballad is kind of pointless.

As for GTAIV itself, I do agree a lot of the shootouts and car chases are pretty generic. However, I do think that a lot of the missions were creative. Almost any assassination mission has some unique bit to it. The use of the internet and the phone mechanics were a lot of what IV was built around and they used them. I mean, there's at least three missions where you use the internet to set up hits through calls or email that I can remember off the top of my head.

The missions with multiple outcomes from choices about who to spare and kill, there's a lot there.

So, while I would argue vanilla IV didn't lack mission variety, I would say you're right that the gunfights and chase scenarios do lack originality. I think that's more a set piece limitation though. IV was the most grounded and properly started the HD universe stuff so it was kind of rare to get bombastic set pieces like the bank heist.

That's something I'd give V over IV easily. The shootout scenarios always felt unique.
RC Plane was Vice City, wasn't it?
That's not what I meant.

I am not talking about cultural impact. I am talking about the actual quality of the game itself. The graphics, the gameplay, the depth of features, etc. For example, GTA V clearly is the better looking game compared to GTA 3, it's clearly got a bigger world, more guns, and so on. However, GTA 3 was revolutionary for its time because it was doing things that had not been done before. 

GTA Vice City built off of that. GTA San Andreas took it even further.

GTA V didn't really hit that same level. Sure, GTA Online has turned out to be a smashing hit and could potentially be described as revolutionary for gaming, but GTA V's single player was clearly not. 

Relative to the other games that were released in or around 2013, GTA V did not surpass them like GTA 3, VC, or SA did in 2001, 2002, and 2004. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a more modern example. It's graphics, story, animation quality, attention to detail, etc. are all considered top notch still after nearly half a decade. It did things that modern releases are still not matching. That simply was not the case with GTA V. I know you can't discount GTA Online, but when you focus solely on the single player side of GTA V, the depth of the game, the attention to detail, none of it was pushing the industry forward as much as the other GTA games were or like RDR2 did.
Yoga is legit very memorable mission.
Michael falling from sky after taking drugs is one of the best moments in the game.
Yoga was great. I don’t understand what people want with it…
True. But to only have 100 missions when the map is so massive would be such a waste of a massive map. Like others have said, I hope there are lots of missions close by rather than having to drive so far in every mission for the sake of padding the play time.
I didn’t finish the story mode until this year cuz the pace is so slow especially compared to online where there are much quicker ways to get around
Why not more than 100?
Do you work at Rockstar? I absolutely think you’re right in this and no one can convince me otherwise
Not the entire comment in perentheses 🥲
Please don't spit in it 😂
😂😂
I was about to correct this, but it's actually 100% true...

Though if my memory serves me correctly, don't they start berating him for basically being a fat c**t through mission dialogue? As shit gets heated?

If that's the case, the smoke bloke had to've stolen someone's nuggies. You don't do that to a bro.
Still, he got 2 number 45’s, one of em with cheese, and a large soda. I mean, that’s still a shitton.
What about the number 9 large? Was that for Smoke?
Nah. They were telling him so he should tell the restaurant.
As a kid that mission made me smash a ps2 controller. Beating it on ps5 version flawlessly first try as an adult made my child self proud lmao
Exactly
I'd love radiant quests. Bring back stealing a taxi (or even signing up to be an uber driver), stealing an ambulance or stealing a cop car and doing radiant quests from inside.
I hope we don’t get what you want
How is an iconic line not well-written? /s
i’d like a numba 9, a numba 9 large, a numba 6 with extra dip, 2 numba 45s, and a large soda
wait for the rc helicopter
 Cj is literally coming back from liberty city ofc it’s gonna start slow he’s getting back into the life
The over-done shoot and drive away missions makes me appreciate the older titles like San Andreas, as it was filled with interesting and different gameplay missions. I couldn’t guess what I was going to do next when I played through San Andreas for the first time which made it my favorite GTA. I think GTA VI will definitely include more open world encounters, similar to V, but probably way better and make it like the trailer where it’s just random shit happening in Florida lmao
Nah you’re correct. GTA 5 plays out like a film, and it’s on purpose. Easily the most transferable semi complex game you can have anyone play. It has multiple mechanics that may overwhelm new people, but still keeps it simple enough for beginners to understand. This is why they struck gold!
you correct OG
Yeah dude GTA is a game where you're the greatest driving racing hitman criminal mobster gangbanging warlord. Let me be that guy.
I also remember that mission being longer but when i recently replayed it was so short
Or those towing missions for Shaniqua
[deleted]
Hi, Satan here. GTA VI will have big tits.
Fair. The spell system wasn’t great
I honestly feel like there was supposed to be a mission where you break Brad out of prison but they made him die instead so that they wouldn't have to make it. Otherwise, the prison serves literally no purpose in the storyline.
The story of RDR2 has already been done countless times. Career criminal redeems themselves by helping people. GTA 5 is way more unique. Bad guys stay bad guys and end up paying the price for it in the end. I’m not saying that that hasn’t been done before (Breaking Bad), but it certainly isn’t as common as the reformed criminal story. Be 100% honest when you answer this question: If nobody died in RDR2, would you still say it has a good story? Think about that for a moment
there were police snipers in GTA IV, I don't recall those being a thing in V
Oh yeah, Assassination missions as well as Police missions were great, probably among the best side content of the entire series (hoping they bring these back in 6). 
I was only referring to the main story. They definitely went for a more grounded approach compared to the craziness of SA, but because of this, I just feel like missions were less memorable as a result.
Vice City had a helicopter not the planes in SA
It was a long time ago, you're probably right. I thought it was in San fermo.
San andreas also had RC missions
GTA 5 did achieve success like no other single player game ever did. Remember the game was for PS3/xbox360 hardware from 2004.
ya just replayed it yd, i forgot it was the one that ends with you flying over the city tripping out, and your family leaves you that mission. its a good one
In that case scoutibg the port (I like that mission but My point is that some missions in gta v are quite simple like in gta sa
Man I’m the opposite I guess lol. I loved the story but online got dull pretty quick for me. Granted I stopped playing shortly after those heists came out so maybe a lot more cool stuff came out since.
Once it gets past 80 there's an increasing chance some parts will start to feel like a drag.
they can't because adhd low attention span modern gamers will start losing interest after mission 69
You want another Yoga mission... I don't.
…does that look like spit to you?
You need Grand Theft Auto in Grand Theft Auto, to be fair.
I meant side/extra missions. Definitely shouldn't be main missions needed for game completion.

I just want there to be A LOT to do outside the main storyline. Like Trevor's bounty hunter missions, etc.
True lol leave that for the online but story mode shouldn’t be a grind
I fucking love that mission.

“Mission Objective: Go to the Drive Thru”
Tonya
I mean you could just skip the mission by failing it intentionally a bunch of times. That's what I do every time I replay the game.
also makes sense with the prison break in online
What makes you feel that way? The story (more specifically the conflict between Michael and Trevor) would be drastically different if he had lived so personally I can't see that being the case.
The first heists update was suppose to launch shortly after online did, it got massively held back. The PS3 leak stuff even has mission files for Pacific Standard and the banks interior was/is accessible in single player which isn't normal for online content. As far as I know as a bit of further proof, none of the heist buildings had to be modified when the update came, and it's the only post-launch trevor content (implying that his voice was already recorded seeing as steve doesn't seem to want to reprise him)

So basically what i'm trying to write is that the prison likely always existed for the heist. 

There are other locations like that too, the radar dishes where the some of the  doomsday heist takes place for example was originally a teaser for story dlc on 360/ps3 versions. They removed the teaser for xb1/ps4
Motherfucker what do you think the name “red dead REDEMPTION” means?
Unless the story is rlly rlly rlly good
By what standard?
didn't happen to San Andreas tho.
You just gotta learn how to breathe properly.
your lungs... they work, yes?
I dont understand the yoga hate😭
Or the shipping yard. Or casing the jewelry store or the town bank. I don't care how many missions just don't make them into chores.
Did someone say… yoga?
Ah fuck it
[deleted]
Dang, I'm racist
The only time I ever tried to play Online was that mission. I tried 3-4x and every time some rando would eff it up or leave so I had to start over. I want to play online bc there is more content but don’t feel like dealing with that shit again.
I also loved all of San Andreas. The franchise itself  has been a blast since the edgy top down days. Lol
Nearly the entire game was filler
What gta you talking about? RP servers are meant to roleplay and there was none of that in gtav story
I just tried online again last night,  and they recently added solo invite only servers where you can Plat nearly every online mission. Almost feels like that single player DLC we were supposed to get
@ The_letter_ you mean the entirety of VC 🤔 that game was a train wreck from start to finish 🗑
If you have absolutely nothing in online play a couple hours with me and you will be running an empire like I am
At least it served a purpose
The ONLY purpose it served ? Was making it's sequal VCS which happens to be alot BETTER than the original 


🗑


You tried tho 👍
How Were the Producers not arrested for this?
Just.....eeew.
Nothing sexier than  *checks notes*  “The innocent scent of a clean cuddly baby…”

Different times. ["Have you got a nickle?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDxDYIQL6Nc)
This was the era of rock stars fucking 14 year old groupies and are still free men today.
Watching older stuff is always a trip, it's amazing how crazy even things like cartoons in the 90s were.

Sometimes I think the world's too sensitive and cancel-happy but then I see this and am like yeah this is bad lol.
I remember these commercials. It was cringy even then. It didn't help that the bottles were penis shaped too.
Yeah in any age I'm freaking out about someone describing a "soft, cuddly baby that grew up to be sexy"
Different time. You're viewing it through a contemporary lens, so certain things which were acceptable then appear creepy now.

[Here's a clip from a Clint Eastwood movie where he kisses a 12 year old girl on the lips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZflfSxYontU)

Don Draper was having a weird year, I guess.
Is that Kristen Wiig?

What are you, the taliban?
At Christmas . . . .
This is the line that got me. Wtf were they thinking, writing this?
Lol!
The version of this show hosted by Dave Attell in 2008 didn’t stray too far. I remember an episode with comedian Jim Norton. There was a girl who came out and was doing some martial arts with a polearm. Jim’s response was “I’d love to see what you can do with a dildo.” Everyone instantly was like “Jim, No! She’s 17!” Norton’s response was “Oops… I’d REALLY love to see what you can do with a dildo.”
Anyone else hear Matthew McConaughey in the audience?
That was honestly pretty disappointing lol. Like was that supposed to be impressive or something?
😲🫣 !
Cigarette adverts from back in the day always crack me up.

Talking about how great they taste and how smooth they are most of the time.

I smoke, and even I’m thinking “they taste like shit and they’re as smooth as a badgers arse” ha ha.
Watching old episodes of Looney Tunes where Elmer Fudd will shoot beloved characters in the face point blank with a shotgun is pretty jarring.
A difrent time indeed, In Indiana Jones, there is this conversation:

Marion: I learned to hate you in the last ten years!
Indiana: I never meant to hurt you.
Marion: I was a child. I was in love. it was wrong and you knew it!

At the time of the movies filming the actress that plays Marion was 30, but the novelization just states that she was 15 when their affair began. There is a transcript of the raiders of the lost arch story meetings. Its just brainstorming so not everything made it to the film, but here is where they talk about their relationship:

Lawrence Kasdan: I like it if they already had a relationship at one point. Because then you don’t have to build it.

George Lucas: I was thinking that this old guy could have been his mentor. He could have known this little girl when she was just a kid. Had an affair with her when she was eleven.

Kasdan: And he was forty-two.

Lucas: He hasn’t seen her in twelve years. Now she’s twenty-two. It’s a real strange relationship.

Spielberg: She had better be older than twenty-two.

Lucas: He’s thirty-five, and he knew her ten years ago when he was twenty-five and she was only twelve.

Lucas: It would be amusing to make her slightly young at the time.

Spielberg: And promiscuous. She came onto him.

Lucas: Fifteen is right on the edge. I know it’s an outrageous idea, but it is interesting. Once she’s sixteen or seventeen it’s not interesting anymore. But if she was fifteen and he was twenty-five and they actually had an affair the last time they met. And she was madly in love with him and he...

Spielberg: She has pictures of him.

If you want to read more there is a Polygon article named "Indiana Jones was an abusive creep (but he was almost much worse)" which is where I got the information.
Dirty Harry indeed.
That is not ok
Bruh how tf is that allowed on YouTube, feel like I'm gonna be on a list now just for opening that
Jesus H
What the fuck
omg she quit acting she was so horrified by this. you can see the trauma on her face.
I mean, in the context of the movie, this was like the 1860s or there abouts.  So in that time period, this isn't that outlandish.  
Yip
Yup. I was a bit shocked, to tell you the truth.
For what, the woman is like 30. Redditors always try to act like everything is some pedo shit just so you can make a comment “distancing” yourself from it. Often times, just like this, it’s literally only in your own head.
Ummm promoting pedos isn’t something you agree or disagree with it like a politician. It’s simply sick.
Did you have the sound off? The narrator is saying that the more you resemble an actual innocent child, the sexier you are.   “Innocence is sexier than you think”
“The innocent scent of a cuddly clean baby”
“So innocent, it’s the sexiest fragrance around”
That entire line could be a post here in and of itself
It was a different time. Here read up on pretty baby. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Baby_(1978_film)?wprov=sfti1
It’s like AI from the future wrote it
> This is the line that got me. Wtf were they thinking, writing this?

FYI 'Baby' is used as term of sexual endearment towards people who are not infants.
Dude whatever happens to Attell? I loved that dude
Jim on O&A was the best quick witted little creep, I miss O&A.
If memory serves, the show runners would see what they could sneak past the censors.


On paper it just said something along the lines of "girls eat popsicles" but we get this blatantly sexual scene on primetime tv.
You're questioning George Lucas?

George "They're siblings" Lucas

George "Incest is best" Lucas
Why on Earth did George think that would be amusing? What's funny about that? I haven't been so confused by his sense of humor since Jar Jar Binks.
So disturbing wow.
George really has some ick factor. It's what makes episode 1 so weird, but at least then it's with having Natalie Portman be too old for Jake Lloyd.
Coincidentally, I’m in the hospital (good reason) and this just started on the Paramount network. I read this moments before they leave for Tibet.
Neither was pretty much everything they did to Brooke Shields when she was young. At 12 she played a child prostitute in the movie Pretty Baby and had to kiss a grown man. She also posed nude at 10 years old and those photos ended up in a Playboy owned magazine called Sugar and Spice. So disturbing.
no duh. but that’s why we have the social progression of today.
I've heard this same argument where I live in the south for why slavery was ok. Different time therefore nothing was wrong with it. It always struck me like a shitty devil's advocate kinda argument.
watch it with the volume on. It's fucking gross.
Did you watch the video on mute?

Language isn't your first language is it?
The smell of innocence. ... that. No generation should find this Sexy. That is all.
He’s still out there. He had a special on Netflix in march called Hot cross buns.
I saw him do standup in a bar about a decade ago. Had the entire room laughing in tears.
Lol definitely. I miss O&A too. I don’t mind Jim and Sam but it just doesn’t hit the same.
> Why on Earth did George think that would be amusing?

He thought it would make money.

And he was right.
It's not really a moral argument, in that it's just that it's a statement that it wasn't something people are conscious of at the time and judging the morality of the time using today's lens is a moot point. Nobody agrees that it would be ok today because it was ok in the past. Like we can judge the history of imperialism in history all we want but we can't change it. I'm grateful that we are now becoming more conscious of the morality of everything.
I agree.
It caused controversy back then too, but controversy was perhaps a bit less polarizing than everything seems to be made to be today.
Less because of that and more in spite of that.
The thing is, that argument is rubbish.

People *did* know chattel slavery was wrong in the early US. Jefferson (among many others) wrote a *lot* about how horrible and reprehensible it was.

He just chose to keep doing it so he could be rich, comfortable, and have a 14 year old girl to fuck.

There were also many abolitionists long before that.
>It's not really a moral argument, in that it's just that it's a statement that it wasn't something people are conscious of at the time and judging the morality of the time using today's lens is a moot point.

The enslaved weren't people, I guess. Their opinion on the morality of it didn't matter.
People were absolutely against owning other people in the same time that people owned slaves. They even had a war over it. 

It doesn’t take more than a monkey brain to understand you’re human, they’re human, and you treat them worse than cattle. They simply prioritized their own gain over their humanity. This wasn’t a groundbreaking idea.

From their favorite book, about 2,000 years before they became “morally conscious”, “slaves were to be treated fairly, receive their just wages, were not to work during the sabbath, and not to be treated harshly or severely harmed” 

The information was there. They were aware. They ignored it.
We can't change it but if we can't say it was wrong then why shouldn't we continue doing it? We are supposed to learn from the mistakes of the past, but if we can't even think they were mistakes then there is nothing to learn from.
Nobody is saying there weren't people against this stuff back then lmao. It's about what the average views on these things were. A lot more people were okay with slavery back when slavery was a thing, than there are now. The same goes for this topic.


Like it or not, kids used to get married in their teens and even pre-teens, to adults, not very long ago in our history... And the views seeing that as "okay" or more "it is what it is" take time to fade out. Generations to die and new generations to take over and move the bar higher.
>it wasn’t something people are conscious of at the time

I’m responding to someone who said what you claim nobody is saying. You can’t say that slaveowners weren’t aware what they were doing was inhumane, let alone against the advisement of their god.
>I’m responding to someone who said what you claim nobody is saying

No you're not. You're taking "people" to mean "literally everyone", when they would clearly be talking about "in general".


>You can’t say that slaveowners weren’t aware what they were doing was inhumane.

That's the thing, many did not think it was inhumane, because they'd convinced themselves these slaves were sub-human. If not human, then not inhumane.



>let alone against the advisement of their god

What? Religion was one of the major tools used to ***justify*** slavery... The Bible is full of talks about owning slaves as a normal thing, because it was when the Bible was written. And lines were cherry picked and interpreted to try and argue for why Africans weren't human. Same way the texts are interpreted how people want them to this day to justify all kinds of things including homophobia, and ignoring the parts that are cumbersome to their own lives.


Which makes it all the more tragic that the black community has so strongly adopted Christianity, a tool used to help enslave them.
The biggest issue is truly the writing.
Title says it all. 

I can forgive how useless ships are or how repetitive the environments are if there’s interesting story and characters. But my god, the writing is bad.

I’ve been playing Tale of Two Wastelands recently (shout out!) and the jump from Fallout 3 to New Vegas is so apparent because of this.  Bethesda sucks at writing. 

Literally every dialogue choice in Starfield boils down to “vanilla good” or “obnoxiously chaotic evil” or “idiot.” 

NPCs are basically the same. All of them are boring  caricatures of played out archetypes done better in other games.

I could go on and on, but I truly believe so many of this game’s issues would be more forgivable if Bethesda hired even moderately talented creative writing undergrads instead of the middle school students they clearly outsource their writing to.
Obnoxiously chaotic evil is the best way to describe the crimson fleet. Maybe moronically chaotic evil is better.
Dialogue is useless is Starfield.

Every choice is the same 99% of the time.  It's the illusion of choice, and at that rate, I would have rather they just did voiced dialogue and chose for me.
This has been noticeable since at least Fallout 4. Your dialogue choices are:

1. Normal human answer

2. Sarcastic

3. Edgelord

4. Dumb
IMHO, it’s because of the lack of any branching paths to quests. All dialogue options, by design, need to lead to the same end result. As such, you can’t really have true “choices”- Bethesda dialogue just serves to move you to the next compass dongle.
Like everyone is just the stereotype they represent with no heart. Crimson Fleet pirates are the most cookie cutter surface level pirates. Why are they pirates? Money! Chaos! Even the smart leader is an idiot. 

Every faction treats you like you aren’t single-handedly carrying their entire initiative and instead like you’re wasting their time. Until you inevitably pull off whatever it was they wanted, then they’re like “oh… yeah you’re actually pretty awesome, *we will never call on you for anything ever again*”

I could also go on and on. The writing is a bit problem with Starfield. I wanted it to be a riveting and incredible tale like RDR/2 or BG3, or W3, or any good game known for its immersive story telling. 

Instead we got instant grits.
It’s written like there is a morality system but there isn’t.
Or what happens after you select something. 

Mayor: what?! you don’t have dirt on me…do you?

Me: I do but I’ll just save it for now. 

Mayor: I knew you had nothing. 

God I hope I can do something at some point to the Mayor…
Mr. “Design Docs are bad” is going to be the death of the company.
Imagine me, playing Rogue Trader, and trying to get back into starfield.

It's impossible. I don't know how theyve done it but Bethesda writing sucks.
[removed]
The writing is awful, the characters are an inch deep, and the quest-lines are unimaginative and inconsequential, for the most part.

This is the first game I bought new, at full price, and on release day since 2016 or so.  Resubscribing to Game Pass started to make more and more sense the more time I spent in Starfield.
Watch your back man

I heard Emil has a big ass sword
It’s one of the bigger issues of this game tbh. Also the writing is incredibly tame. Nobody apparently says fuck or any curse word in these games and I don’t know, compare it to a cyberpunk and it’s crazy. Compare neon just itself to night city in cyberpunk. The writing is just terrible when you really sit and think about it.
Yes, it's been a massive weakness in all of their games, it just gets harder to excuse as other games continue to elevate their writing while Bethesda is still making chosen one stories and may as well be retelling biblical parables with how black and white they write sub narratives. 

Their characters and dialogue are one dimensional, childish, and absolutely lack nuance. Someone is either a saint or a Saturday morning cartoon villain and the game is very intentional when it bashes you over the head with how they've already decided you should feel about certain characters I.E. quests like Juno's Gambit. 

The interesting part is that there are comments claiming there is good writing here which always makes me wonder about their frame of reference or if it's a matter of a 14 year old who has not been exposed to varied content.
Yeah, its not that the writing isn't "gritty" enough and that not enough people are saying fuck or not enough are depressed, its just bad. You can have positive stories with good writing, this just isn't one of them.
I’ve been surprised that the primary complaints have been bland combat, repetitive POIs, empty world, etc. (all legitimate complaints) when for me personally the terrible writing is the thing that really killed the game.

There are soooo many examples. I thought of compiling all of it in to a video, but that would require me to spend way too much time playing the game.

It’s really noticeable with the crimson fleet and the gang in neon quest lines. I don’t think that Bethesda has a very diverse team or inclusive culture, because it’s pretty clear that these writers have no idea what the real world criminal underworld is like. Nobody at that company was raised in the sketchier parts of society.

The neon gang one is… almost offensive? There’s a lot about how corrupt and abusive the police are, and the writers were actually getting close to something their audience can connect and relate to.

But then they COMPLETELY fuck it up with the lame shit ending of that questline. They become fucking cops!?!? Just horrible, awful writing. They should be ashamed to release this slop.
It’s sad because the UC quest lines are fun, but man the Freestar Collective was such a massive waste of time. You do basically nothing, and this is supposed to be the biggest other major faction in the game?
Emil strikes again
The Ranger questline is a particularly egregious example, in my opinion. Your character's tone switches to that of a gruff fellow better placed in a Western, which is not necessarily bad given the nature of the Freestar Collective. However, it contrasts with the other dialogue. I would have liked to have seen Bethesda provide more dialogue options across the board.
The game coming out in close proximity to Baldurs Gate 3 and Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty really just helped to shine a light on Starfield’s flaws. I know people hate when these games are compared because of how different they are but both Cyberpunk PL and BG3 showed just how good writing and RPG questing can be. I’m playing through BG3 and the difference in dialogue is night and day. The freedoms to go about my quests and actually roleplay as a character. I’m not railroaded into being generic corny good guy or generic corny bad guy. 

There is a lot that I think Starfield can add and fix with updates, which is great news for Bethesda and Starfield fans, but unless they get better writers involved then any DLC will suffer from the same poor writing that the main game did
It's a Bethesda game, so I didn't expect the writing to be stellar. Most other Bethesda games I barely paid attention to the writing or dialogue, I was looking in corners and poking at the walls while people talked at or around me.   


There is nothing else to do in this game besides the quests themselves, so the writing is far far more obvious. You won't just happen into a cave with unique, dynamic, environmental story-telling. It is the same cave you saw on six other planets. It is the same cryo lab you encountered five times before.   


The only thing that has care and craft put into it is the writing - and there are not many craftsmen at Bethesda, it seems
Isn't the writing an issue in a lot of bethesda games? I remember in Skyrim that the main mission was not interesting, the world was interesting.

I guess that since in Starfield the world or the exploration isn't that good the other flaws are more easy to see.
Yeah, it’s so interesting considering Bethesda was flexing the amount of dialogue being recorded for this game was like double Fallout 4 or something like that.  Amount≠Quality haha
I don't even understand why I was given a free starship to  begin with.
The dialogue writing is so jarringly bad that several times I've not been able to choose a response because it doesn't follow the thread of the conversation in a remotely natural way.
Very well said.  I never played any game that made me hate main characters like Starfield does, they are all so corny, cringe, blend, annoying and boring. It is first game I would actually like to play evil as a main playtrough and just kill everyone because they are so bad. But I cant kill anyone because they are all essential....
Makes me wonder if this limited and cringe dialogue is leftover from how they started with the intent to have another voiced protagonist or if they just got so used to it and thought it was a good idea after Fallout 4 and just did the same thing again.

I bet my life on the latter.
Nothing showcases this better than the persuasion dialog.
'I wasn't really paying attention' would be my answer to all dialogue. It's too long and boring and I've just skipped the majority of it all. 

The only NPC's I have listened to are Vasco and Andrea. The rest are annoying
Yeah its sad to see I'm very scared for tes 6 cause tbh I love tes so much and starfield has made me so worried for its future and if it will be good. I hope Bethesda learns a lot from this game and I hope they realized this game was not as good as it should have been. It defo needs a cyberpunk type overhaul to make this game a lot better. I will say one good thing about this game and that'd the modding potential. Very good modding potential.
most dialogue choices don't make a difference in the outcome. my character got no character development
I want to add something no one is talking about, and is the fact we become Starborns, after 10 ng+ we become walking weapons of mass destruction, i literally feel as powerful as the Hunter is, maybe i am him in some kinda way, but everyone is always treating me like i am weak or some shit, and i can't use my powers to literally make things easier, just a dialog option that most of the time doesn't make any difference or sense, i should get at least new options in all dialogs and get new ways to finish quests.

Or at least people should be afraid of a guy using a super futuristic black space suit, or at least people should make comments about my powers and how terrifying is to battle with someone that is literally a fucking speedster with gravity powers.

But no, we get some comments that are redundant, annoying and repetitive from your companions, i can't even talk about it with anyone.

Me being Starborn is useless, i can make ships that are faster and do more damage than the Starborn ship, i can make better space suits or even just find that the black starborn suit.

But honestly the most annoying thing about any Bethesda game is the disrespect, i use one of the most advanced space suits, i have super powers and i have big fucking guns, I killed a lot of people to get them, and i deserve to be feared and respect for the amount of corpses i leave behind everywhere i go.

The worst part is that the Hunter doesn't recognize you as the same or make any comment about the last starborn suit, so the ng+ 10 feels empty and boring.

Also i can't be evil, because or i am evil or i have friends, Vasco my beloved Brazilian named robot is my only friend because he doesn't judge me.
"Literally every dialogue choice in Starfield boils down to “vanilla good” or “obnoxiously chaotic evil” or “idiot.”"

and insult to injury here is that it doesn't even matter which you pick.  The outcome in these cases is often times the same.  Sure, their responses to each comment will be slightly different, but the actual real end results of the conversation string is the typically the same with no variance that matters.  So even when it appears that you have “vanilla good” or “obnoxiously chaotic evil” or “idiot” choices to pick from...you don't.  The only option really have is the one they are forcing you to take to the next quest.
Y’all remember Morrowind and it’s branching dialogue trees that felt meaningful. 

Pepperidge farm remembers.
It’s clear Beth spent all their funding on propping up a messy No Man’s Sky clone and then using the leftover cash to write a mediocre story around it.
lmao event the writing is bad. Good god Elder Scrolls is going to be unplayable.
The writing is inadequate.  Bethesda has lagged behind video game writing compared to its peers and starfield is riddled by poor premises.

The main quest is simply awful.  Like 2001 space Odyssey without the benefit of the writers and audience being on weed or lsd.  Simply bad.

The faction quests are also weak.  With GTA and RDR2 some of the most beloved video game franchise, and the youngs in the streets protesting over police brutality, the writers chose to make the factions...Space Cops?  

Yikes!  Even Ubisoft opts for Greek pirates, vikings, and revolutionaries.

However, I believe many if not most of the critics are some of starfield's biggest fans.  They self-identity by complaining about the "emptiness" of the game.  The game is filled with not only empty calorie procedural stuff but the handcrafted content.  Mods and dlc will help, and I suggest people look at the empty procedural stuff more as a blank canvas then a design flaw.  The flaw was perhaps making it too accessible at this early stage.

So some notes:

1) Mods may help.  One suggestion is modding the existing content to give the people what they want.  Privateer for the factions (tweaking the resale value of ships) and better pirates (big credit drops by raiding human settlements and boarding guarded treasure ships) are obvious.

2) Expansions should base themselves more on grittier parts of human history.  Colonial period, wars, expansions, conquests, etc.  Think how powerful it was meeting neo-romans in fallout:Las Vegas.  There are plenty of more interesting things to bring from earth rather than just sanitized American history.  All additional factions should be awful and admirable - like our Tech bros or Imperial Rome (with its grand roads and architecture).

3) Better end game and loot cycle.  You make an impossibly large  game and don't do the endless loot grind/reskin adversaries?  Why?  Cosmetic reskinning and numbers go up is super cheap.

4) Some end game content should be exceptionally hard, and maybe even have roguelike elements with the challenge.  Nothing keeps engagement like a massive difficulty spike at the end with awesome rewards.  Gatcha games make massive amounts of money off of this principal of game design.

5) More building content.  Fallout 4, sims, and city builders show some people will spend an insane amount of time building cool stuff.  Better yet, let them design awesome cities and submit them to Bethesda for public voting, to receive a nominal prize, a work for hire copyright contract, and automatic update to be shared with the broader community to fill in the emptiness.  Hand crafting cities and dungeons too expensive?  Cool!  Award people next to nothing to work for free.
also why the fuck is every conversation devoid of any realistic human emotion or mannerism. 


In Cyberpunk, participating in dialogue is engaging because the characters move around and do actions while talking, faces are really descriptive, and scenes feel like they are directed like a movie.


In star-field, everyone looks you in the eyes and stands completely still while talking to you.
What, you didn't start laughing hysterically at "*No, I'm an elevator person now. I build my kingdom here!"*?  
You're just not playing the game right. Start laughing and it'll feel like you're playing a completely different game!  
The astronauts weren't bored when they joked on the moon!
Yeah this game honestly was a huge let down. It was enjoyable for a bit but far from previous Bethesda titles
Bethesda has always been lacking on the writing. They typically make games more focused on exploring and living in the world while the story is generic and forgettable. Their worlds have always been more memorable than the characters or plot. The problem this time is that they flubbed the exploration piece.

We see the opposite with New Vegas. That's a game you play for the story, not the exploration. The story, characters, and dialogue are great. The exploration is boring as hell in my opinion.

Now that Obsidian and Bethesda are under the same Microsoft umbrella, we really need a game that has Bethesda going back to their roots and focusing entirely on their old school world design while having Obsidian handle the dialogue and story.
Holy shit! I was playing Tale of Two Wastelands and I felt the same. The quality of the writing is night and day. Don’t get me wrong, Fallout 3 is a great game but still.
I like when someone told me to perform stealth, non lethal mission while I went guns blazing and only "repercussion" was slightly angry first response after reporting back. 2nd one was like nothing happened. Peak AAA game.
Stop! You gamers might understand what "good" writing is or "meaningful" role-playing choices are, but you don't understand what it takes to develop a game!

Writing and development are the same thing, though! Which means all the hard work they did is really difficult for you to understand; therefore, you can't talk about the dialogue or quests or the writing in general! 

Making games is really tough, but we keep it simple, stupid! Don't you like a quest with yet another twist--making the good guy the bad guy--after killing twenty of the same enemies like the last quest? It's simple! But it's also *very* complicated, so you couldn't possibly understand how difficult it is to make a game!
after all the critique against the writing it would be mindblowing if bethesda didn't fire their whole writing department
I’m not trying to pile onto the shit heap that is Starfield reviews but, genuinely, this game has the worst writing i’ve ever experienced in ANY role-playing game i’ve ever played. (And I’ve played more than id like to admit)
BRO SAME. I literally started a Tale of Two Wastelands to remind myself that Bethesda can actually give a shit, lmao. And yes I know NV isn't Bethesda but the game design is definitely Bethesda style. I know the writing in NV is better as well, but even Fallout 3 is miles better than what we got with Starfield.
Just re-watch Avatar then the writing doesn’t seem so bad.
During my playtrought, at some point I start to Google "Is Starfield dialogue all the same" "Is Starfield dialogue bad", I wanted to see what was the sentiment. Most people didn't bother with it at the time. But yeah, its sterile, made for kids. Played Cyberpunk and Phantom Liberty, my mind was refreshed!
I love Bethesda games, but the stuff they have put out for the last few years sucks ass compared to the quality of other games brought out in the last 4 or 5 years gow gow ragnarok all 3 spiderman games tlou
Seirko bg3 these are just some, for example, and a few off them are from 2018 yet are far better than Starfield, which came out in 2023 there really isn't an excuse hell even mass effect from the Ealry 2000s is still somehow more engaging and better written
We have gone from "wow it's out" to "it's bad" to "it's great/it sucks" to this specific issue is the issue.

The whole game is bad. Graphics don't make a game. Good story, controls, and gameplay make a game.
oof. the passive voice in the second option.
You're gonna make me want to play through New Vegas again so I can recover from the Starfield writing.

&#x200B;

Alright I'll do it.
I don't think the third one is "idiot".  I think it's geared more toward people who have been through Unity four or five times and don't care much anymore about the prattle and plot.
Not white knighting by any means (Starfield made me sad) but this is par for the BGS course. 

The last genuinely good writing I can remember in a BGS game was the Dark Brotherhood in Oblivion. I cannot remember a single plot line from Skyrim because it was so utterly beige. In making it so the player can live out their fantasies however they like, they make it almost impossible to have narrative tension and stories with stakes. Every important dialogue has to have a "nice" variant, a "mean" variant, a "medium" variant, all of which have to deliver roughly the same player satisfaction outcome otherwise the formula breaks. 

That is a *terrible* constraint to put on writing. The player must be able to play as whoever they like and the player can never be allowed to lose. 

Dialogues, as a result, stop being dialogues. They're effectively quest checks that mark time as you move from one quest stage to the next.

It doesn't help that Bethesda for the most part don't make use of environmental storytelling, including dynamic environments (ie environments that change as story content requires), to deliver story information. So dialogues end up an awkward combination of info dumps that some other studios would deliver by showing the information in the world, and essentially pointless player participation just to get from one line to the next.

There's also the problem that with made up worlds, seen in all of BGS's games, it's very, very easy to invent the world on-the-fly as the plot requires it, rather than inventing solid ground rules FIRST that the stories must fit into. See most obviously Arena, for Bethesda, in which the entire universe of Tamriel etc feels like it was made up on the back of a napkin to provide plot filler, but even things like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, in which the ground rules were not properly elaborated between the Hobbit and Fellowship (the Hobbit then got retconned), but even within LOTR itself things shift to deliver a pretty abysmal deus ex machina at the end. When the rules of the game are not fixed, you end up with pretty crappy story shortcuts that feel cheap and unearned. 

This has never been fatal before because BGS deliver by giving players myriad things they can do in any way they like. I think Starfield has just made apparent the inherent limitations for writing of the Bethesda formula because the open world gameplay aspect of things feels abnormally flat.
It's like running in a 3 intelligence/3 charisma build but, like, AAALLLLL the time
Yea I think they really are trying to aim for a target demographic that simply isn't me.

It's kind of strange because some of the actual themes are pretty deep but the actual dialogue is something akin to 3rd grade reading level.

Very weird.
Biggest issue is the scope of the game far exceeding what the team at Bethesda can pull off and all they have are shaky foundations.
I stopped giving a fuck about the story after the first 30 minutes; you meet a major companion (Barrett) and after knowing you for all of five minutes he just gives you his ship... like, wtf lol...
BGS writing has always been bad. Skyrim had horrible writing, so had Fallout 3+4. 

The problem Starfield has is that is still has horrible writing AND they killed the only thing BGS Games ever had going for them - EXPLORATION!

Yes, Skyrim had terrible writing but that didn't matter if you stumble into a Cave in Skyrim and find a huge underground Cave with lots of crazy loot.
Agreed, I noticed it almost immediately. Bethesda games have always had this problem though, the scripts they give to the voice actors must make them cringe when they are recording their lines.
"My one job is to guard this item and I will be summarily executed if anything were to happen to it"

"Can I have the item?"

"OK, just don't tell anyone"
I thought starfield was alright, then I played Baldurs Gate 3 and realized how poorly written the game is . You are spot on friend .
It’s like they used Ai
You guys are crazy, the writing is the best it has possibly ever been on a Bethesda game all things taken into account. 

If this game os bad writing for you and that aspect of a video game matters to you that much, you might just stop completely care about anything Bethesda do, because i guarantee you Elder scrolls 6 will not be better than that in this department.
They should have let ChatGPT write the story. It probably would have been better.
Especially the completely random Persuasion dialogs.
These make zero sense. No follow up lines or lines that are connected to the person or scenario. Its crazy
I agree it isn't the greatest Bethesda has done. If you read any of the in game books then you'll be generally disappointed too.

Edit: If i was to do a mod, i would do one that adds in full public domain literature/poetry and actual honest to God good stories/books since books and related stuff are the easiest to do with the creation engine.
That being said, perhaps the limits mean you can't put an entire book in there. You got joke books that all the baddies love, sure. That's probably one of the good writing points.
Poetry is few and far between. I haven't found any notable ones. Poetry. The most short form of short forms.  So, you're stuck with a summary. Yet even the non classical stories they did write for the game are lackluster. Makes me think they didn't consider people would read them. I typically haven't in past Bethesda games but im making a point to read them at least once and... I found summary... except... summary. Short form. C'mon, Bethesda, you haven't heard of flash fiction?
Yet, you will have people defending that this is how Bethesda does it, that it is their signature, there is a charm behind all this.

Sorry no, they are defending mediocrity. If they settle for this low quality product, then their opinions have 0 value to me.
The most dogshit dialog was in the last Raijin story mission

Ur killing people, stealing and destroying their lifes


And then the dialog almost forces you to worry about the jobs...
And they made it really obvious that Bethesda wants you to choose the safe jobs option


Rpg....
What’s the route forward? Sterilizing your writing in the name of widening your possible audience to its absolute maximum can’t be sustainable right? If they were really just going for a younger demographic they did not communicate that clearly at all (Im pretty sure this isn’t the case but it’s a possible explanation). 

DLCs and re-releases go out the window when your player base falls off of a cliff within a couple months of release. The long term success they saw with Skyrim (which isn’t even much better writing wise, showing how little they need to do improve) just isn’t gonna happen with their current Mormon-adjacent approach. 

Obviously they are making profit to some degree, but having a sustainable player base has just got to more lucrative right? 

Totally agree with the position that no mods or updates can fix bad writing. Nothing is going to change the god awful dialogue of their NPCs. This puts them in a situation where they have no shot of getting players back. 

I’ll be honest at this point I’m not all that invested in the success or failure of BGS, buts it’s extremely interesting to talk about the how any why the quality of their writing is getting worse.
I've spent the last four months playing BG3 and Phantom Liberty.  I feel like it would be painful to sit through this kind of writing after that.  Bethesda has the same dev resources as Larian or CDPR - they don't really have an excuse here.
I really am curious if they are paying professional writers because the writing in all of their games is just so fucking unbelievably bad.

Their games have always had bad writing aside from the fallout series. But holy shit Starfield is so so so incredibly bad and bland. It's like eating flour straight from the bag.

Fallout 3, NV, and 4 stand out with the incredibly charming comically violent nuclear red scare 50s gee howdy retro future vibe really carrying the game.

I'm replaying FO4 and it does literally everything drastically better than Starfield aside from graphics.

Starfield is the single most disappointing gaming experience of my life. I cannot believe that a company whos most beloved trait by far is their huge open for exploring worlds made a disjointed game full of small boring environments separated by a million loading screens. It's just idiotic.

After years, this is the fucking new Bethesda game and we won't have another for years. 

This is what they went with.

Non stop fast travelling, a comically poorly written story, empty planets with copy pasted POI's, and the worst settlement/city designs of any Bethesda games to date.

Why are entire the cities of Starfield smaller than neighborhoods of Boston in FO4?

Has there been a more lazily designed/written mission than the red mile in any other Bethesda game?

Thank God they spent years working on procedurally generating the most boring settings possibly imaginable.

 How in the hell do you go from fallout to this?

Every time I try to play Starfield I end up paused in  some boring fucking dreadfully dialogue googling "Starfield is incredibly boring" to make sure I'm not crazy.

No man's sky is a much better game than Starfield.
No, I’m elevator person now. I build my kingdom here
I started choosing lines like the 'I wasn't paying attention' one because was so boring I literally wasn't paying attention. Sometimes I feel like the game is self aware and makes self depreciating jokes about how bad it is.
The clunky writing is tied with the wooden voice acting IMO.
I think the biggest issue is the awful combat. Fallout without the VATS but somehow even more clunky feeling.

Then there’s the horribly designed overwhelming menus and the fact that I have to warp everywhere. 

But yeah, the combat is definitely the lowest point of the game for me. Playing cyberpunk and then playing this game is like going back 20 years in time in terms of innovation and game design.
Bethesda has always been terrible at writing. It’s why their biggest story success was environmental storytelling. Once they start using words, things go down hill.

For example, the idea of a ghoul being trapped in a refrigerator for decades is cool. But when you say that ghoul is from the pre-war era, things start falling about because ghoul-ification has always been described as a slow process.

Bethesda really sucks at original ideas. It’s why they always beat a good idea to death when they get lucky. For example, Fallout 4 building, which they carried over into every subsequent game. Or how about super mutants, which had to be retconned not only into DC, but West Virginia too?

If you’re an TES nerd, then you’ll see how the games were just an abomination of many different fantasy tropes mashed together. Cryodil in particular with their unicorns, Minotaurs, lions, and other random creatures.
Writing is the best it’s been since Morrowind (by BGS standards).  Cherry picking specific times where the writing is meh does not change this fact. 

Please proceed with the usual downvotes.
For me it’s the writing, the facial animations/graphics, most of the voice acting and the lack of a local map
this is most bethesda games, choices mean next to nothing, at least after skyrim. Every dialogue option is just the same result, no matter if you tell the person to die in a fire, or tell them you love them and their cause.
Never got the whole “Bethesda sucks at writing” thing. Also apparently ships are useless? When are y’all gonna stop taking these people seriously??
One again I have to wonder why this is a surprise to people. Bethesda have ALWAYS been bad at writing, always.
The writing in Starfield felt very amateur to me. Or like a first draft that never saw an editor or second reader.
I had -43 downvotes saying the writing was garbage when it first came out. Now this is a post on its own with over 700 upvotes. I officially dislike the Starfield community just as much as this crap game.

Starfield sucks. Keep downvoting.
You guys actually read that shit?
crazy the writting is great in this game, you are mad about the dialogue choices which we had less in skyrim and fallout 4 and 3 with way worse writing.
The whole game feels like it was written by chat GPT
I prefer sci-fi over cyberpunk generally, but the difference between the writing in that game and the kinds of storylines you get to pursue compared to this one makes Starfield very difficult to play.
“Literally every dialogue choice in Starfield boils down to “vanilla good” or “obnoxiously chaotic evil” or “idiot.”

This is dialogue in every Bethesda game from the Todd Howard era—seriously, Oblivion, Fallout 3, Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, and Starfield all have formatted dialogue, and it becomes very noticeable once you catch on.
"Your" biggest issue...
That's being delusional. The direction is also a big fucking problem.
Some of you are toxic and sad and obsessed.
We’re witnessing the 1st batch of games entirely made by diversity hirings,for movies just take a look at Disney/Marvel.

When checking boxes matter most than skill and creativity.
[deleted]
I read a lot and write short stories so I feel like I know something about writing but to be honest… I don’t really know anything 

My biggest gripe with CP76 for example is the writing. I think it’s god awful- truly terrible dialogue and the characters have ridiculous motivations. I don’t get it at all and yet people praise it. 

People shit on Starfields writing and I get why, but it truly doesn’t feel any worse than other blockbuster games that I’ve played. I’m loving the hell out of Frontiers of Pandora for example and some of that is incredibly poorly written too.

Edit: I want to add that curse words and being “edgy” does not make for “good” writing. I found a lot of Fallout New Vegas, a game I love, to be atrocious writing for this very reason.
You should check out visual novels. They seem right up your alley. If this dialogue option is so offensive to you that it hinders your enjoyment of the game, that's a you problem. Normal people find it completely harmless.
Have you played fallout or Skyrim? This is pretty typical dialogue in those
God forbid one extremely simple question doesn’t have 13 different responses, can you guys at least try to criticize the game in good faith? This shit is embarassing
Nope - this sends Bethesda the message that they can fix this game with text edits. Hell no. We need rovers or hovercraft and larger variation in destinations as a higher priority.
they obviously did not try in the slightest and yet bethesdrones will still defend this steaming pile of dog shit game.
I swear people don't understand what writing is.... Some cheesy lines aside, dialog is not "writing". Writing is crafting an engaging story where the characters go through arcs and experience situations that motivate them to act during the climax, which is often paralleled and foreshadowed by the aforementioned arcs. Starfield does this in droves. It might have some cheesy lines like I said, and you might want some more nuanced dialog options, but it's frankly just silly to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Also, those dialog options aren't meant to be what you're saying word for word, you're free to head-canon say anything you want. The dialog options are there to make it pretty clear how an NPC is going to react so you can make their response make sense for your character. This is why everybody wants silent protagonists from Bethesda, or at least so I thought.
“3rd grader..who is chaotic evil.”
The way other factions talk about them and their deeds, they sound like Hitlers more evil cousin.

When you join them they’re basically kinda mean boy scouts
I really noticed how awfully bad the writing was at that crimson fleet Quest where you steal that prize or whatever. I was super excited, thinking it was going to be a great cool heist or whatever. The coffer chick is like "omg this is the safest safe in the galaxy, we have sooo many protections!". Great, right? 

Well, you go to the owner of the prize and ask "Hey, what's the password of the safe where you stored a super valuable treasure?". She happily replies "Oh, it's XYZ. Don't share it though please!"

**WHAT**

**THE**

**FUCK???**

I was so fucking shocked/horrified/disappointed at whatever the fuck I just read I closed the game to complete the quest later. What the actual hell Bethesda?? Who greenlit this shit lmfao
I liked how even though I'm a certified badass that is stamped by the big man himself and have brought home millions of creds for the fleet randos will mouth off to me. 

If I punch them in the face for it they pull on me, and if I pop him for that then the entire station pulls on me.
But they aren't even evil. They don't even seem the least bit intimidating. Like it was written by folks who think Sarcasm = Badass. The Ecliptic mercs would actually make better pirates than this Disney crew of misfits.
I came to Starfield off BG3, so when I got assigned undercover to CF I made sure I interspersed a lot of random shit doing random things and even swapped ships before turning quests into Sysdef. All so to stop CF tailing me.

I need not have worried apparently.
Moronic Evil,

Chaotic evil would still get shit done. Wouldn't be coherent or sensible, but it would be done. Wouldn't need to rely on the obviously planted double agent to get shit for em.

Ecliptic would have been the better infiltrate and find out storyline.

SPACERS are just reskinned fleet. Why even have them? Just to fill out some space?  ( Hah )

I like the game, yes,  will I defend poor design choices and shit writing from wannabe Disneyfication of a studio that used to let us play basketball with the skulls of our foes? No
Never have I enjoyed mowing down named characters as much as the final showdown on the Key because they were so insufferable. Except for Jess, but she made her choice when she shot at me. And I spared the money laundering guy. Just wish I could have killed Naeva.
The crimson fleet are a bunch of morons with the cliche “what are you looking at type” meanwhile they’re leader is a bumbling idiot who acts like a teenager about kryx with a black stereotype women who speaks like “Awww naw, no you didn’t” … Crimson fleet are pathetic
I really wanted to do that going in. Betray Vangaurd, become leader of Crimson, murder Ikande, new ruler of space.

Didn’t happen. They didn’t even let me kill Ikande. They didn’t even let me attack him.
I don't care what you describe me as so long as I get my cut.
"Edgy Disney Pirates"
The head of writing said "everybody just skips through that bullshit, why bother?" And then made sure it was a self-fulfulling prophecy by having everything written so fucking half-assed that you just mash your way through it because the writing sucks and the choices don't matter.
Remember the meme where they compared how graphics are getting better and better and dialogue worse and worse to the point of smiley face / sad face?

Well, these are the options now: 😊 / 😠 / 🥴
The illusion of choice was groundbreaking in 2005. Now it doesn't cut it. Either the story is on rails or we need choices with real consequences.

The writing in cyberpunk and bg3 technologically groundbreaking. It's just hard work. What they did in starfield with writing comes off as cheap and lazy to me in this era of gaming.
Voiced dialog can actually be done to a very satisfactory level (Think Cyberpunk or the Witcher) but Bethesda is either too cheap or too lazy to give you good writing *and* a voiced protagonist.
>I would have rather they just did voiced dialogue

Fallout 4 fans in shambles
I remember people complaining about most options just meaning “yes” in Fallout 4, but at least we had a voiced character and the dialogue was fun in that game. I remember reading a review that said the dialogue in Starfield was made lazily, not to offend anyone, and to be safe for a pre-k classroom.
The game sucks
what a weird take, there is a lot more actual choice in Starfield than in probably any other Bethesda game outside of Fallout 3.
At least in this game they wrote out what the character actually says, and you're not left trying to figure out what a dialogue prompt will actually mean

"Help, super mutants kidnapped my brother!"

*I select "Help".*

"How the hell am I supposed to help?"
1. Agree friendly
2. Agree neutrally 
3. Agree rudely
4. Ask for more info

It's worse than Fallout 4. At least the companions were more diversified. In Starfield it's basically

1. The choice deemed correct because it matches the worldview and moral compass of the writers. All your companions will like this choice.

2. The wrong choice. All your companions will dislike this, except for maybe Andreja.
Exactly and most times it truely doesnt matter if you are a dick or not. Especially in the far habour dlc i noticed it since i teamed up with the brother hood.

There is no room for nuance. Its either you praise their asses or your against them fully. No single room for discussion.
I mentioned wanting this in another bgs sub (tesvi) and there exists people who believe a triple A studio can’t do this because bgs games are more action than rpg
If that is the case I wonder why they didn’t drop the rpg tag to make an action adventure. It is a new IP, it didn’t have to be an rpg just because bgs made rpgs in the past.
True, this is why most of my conversations I just click through the first option without even reading it. It makes no difference. 

However, games Like Rogue Trader have conversations that all end the same despite choice but the way the NPC will respond to you at least gives you the illusion that your choice matters, not in an impactful game changing way but it lets you talk like the character you want to be and the other person will respond accordingly. This at least makes even pointless options *feel* good. 

Starfield felt like I was a completely different person based on whose faction quest I was doing. With the pirates I had "moody I'm a badass" options (even though they were more cheesy than badass) but never again in the entirety of the game do I ever get to have that "personality" ever again. 

Take that same problem, copy and paste it across all faction dialogs then add the fact that non-fiction dialogs leave you with none of those personalities. 

The writers fucked up on very fundamental rpg elements.
Even if they gave us choices the writing is still 6th grade level. It wouldn't change a damn thing.
Thank god you mentioned this; loathe that as a design principle
Even when a character tells you that "we need to do whatever it takes" and even when the options you have *literally include the ability to attack*...

The game can and will say "no, that's not what you're supposed to do" and prevent you from doing it.
even quests that function like this in fallout new vegas are so much better written. like three card bounty, you can express so much character in the mostly linear conversations with major dhatri, and there's side questions and tidbits of information you can learn from other characters around the camp that you can then ask him about. this guy that's only really around for one quest feels like a real fleshed out human because he ties into the other characters around him and has a past beyond what he's currently doing and a personality beyond the clothes he wears or his archetype.
This is my problem with so many RPGs today. If your decisions don’t lead to different outcomes then why even put decisions in there? Just make it a linear story with cutscenes for major NPC conversations instead of dialogue options.
Also none of the major factions seems to have any dynamic between them, no power struggle no conflict. There are no quests that indicate any background story about border disputes, no major complaints that pirates fucking shit up. So when I decide to help one faction over another there isn't a moral choice since no one is talking about anything.

In FO NV it was clear where each faction stands and it was clear helping a faction over another will negatively effect others.  in Starfield there was absolutely none of that.
You can still have dialogue be compelling without it offering real branching paths. Look at how well the writers at CDPR have done it - the Witcher games and Cyberpunk don’t really have branching paths either, there are just isolated consequences for certain key dialogue choices that appear in very isolated scenes hours later, probably more so with Witcher than Cyberpunk, but the writing still feels real. The dialogue feels like…well…dialogue. Every conversation in Starfield, however, ends up feeling everyone in that universe is somewhere on the autism spectrum.
This was my major issue with FO4 as well. I know Skyrim wasn’t amazing but it still had some options
Not to mention, the game activity disincentivizes being a space pirate.

It's a serious waste of time and money. Not being able to progress the main story without paying off your massive bounty, while stolen ships net you peanuts in profit. There is no "evil" path in the game, and it punishes you for not playing the way Bethesda wants you to.
It's Saturday morning cartoon villainy.

Yes, I know I'm 3 months late
And then the game constantly scolds you for morality!
If that's Cydonia, you just have to give the evidence to UC security. There's a guy at the back who will take it and soon after the mayor will be gone, and a "temp" replacement will be there in his place.
Not being able to kill him and the corpos at the beach resort was unforgivable.
It's been a while since I've played but I remember there was a quest in the game that asked you to either buy or steal some really fancy alcohol and the location of the drink was in the mayor's office. 

There is literally no way to "steal" the alcohol without the mayor seeing you, unless you gimmick the game and move the alcohol without touching it. You can't block his vision, you can't get his attention to something else, you can't even break into his office late at night because he's always there like every other NPC because they have no life cycle like in previous games.

That shit is what made me stop playing. Such a lack in creativity.
[ horny ] how about you and I settle this matter in my private quarters.
I feel like Microsoft should just hand over the IP to Obsidian, seeing they own both now.
I am a avid hater of turn based combat and love FPS games or third person shooters, but despite all that I am playing baldurs gate or rogue trader way more and havent touched starfield, because those games writing is so good, and starfields is so boring. the best combat in the world couldnt make up for the rest of the game.
Rogue Trader is the first RPG I've played where lawful evil (or even chaotic) has its own perks and doesn't turn you into a caricature. KOTOR was pretty close, but it locked you out of some content.

I'm a Chaos worshipper and I wanna PLAY as one. Rogue Trader is the first WH40K game where I truly can.
Yes I'm playing Rogue Trader right now, most of the dialogues you choose are matters and have consequences, and I love it.
What? You don't like doing fetch quests for every single mission? Who doesn't love running across the map a dozen times to deliver messages that could've just been an email? Such a fun and engaging system...
I'm enjoying Starfield, but holy shit, I'd have been pissed if I paid $60 or whatever for it.
Put a pen in his hand and he turns into a teenager.
This. It’s like when a film franchise gets too big they make sure none of it is offensive to anyone and it becomes terribly boring. If you go back and play earlier fallout games and elder scrolls you’ll see risk and freedom in the writing.
Cyberpunk felt so dystopian. Every time I walked through the streets I just thought "fuck, I would hate to live in a world like this." And I thought about how it's all somewhat based in reality, how maybe in some far off future Night City could be what becomes of us.

There's nothing in Starfield like that.
A civilian said "oh shit" once when I shot him in the face lol
Writing was weak in all their games but in Starfield it reached a whole new levels of bad. And it is also something they cant patch to make better.
Really I'm pretty sure I hear the occasional fuck or ass,but yeah I get it,it definitely makes them feel less human.
I can count on one hand the number of times I saw "fuck" used... and one of them was on a coffee cup that said something like "never apologize for being a powerful fucking woman".

...that made me groan just writing it out.
Maybe I just never left my edgy teenager phase, but I absolutely *ADORE* all of the profanity and cussing in Cyberpunk. They really managed to make it feel genuine and in-character.
Curse words does not equal to good writing. Rogue trader doesn't have any curse words either and it's 700x better than starfield and cyberpunk
I finally bought Cyberpunk and started playing it yesterday. Just wow, what an insane difference in the writing and worldbuilding. It was day and night.
To be frank, I think the writing in Cyberpunk was god awful. I just wrapped it up last month and I was constantly either cringing or rolling my eyes. 

Terrible dialogue + V never actually says the dialogue option you pick. 

Good game but bad RPG with some bad writing.

Which is kind of my summation of Starfield: good game but bad writing and not an RPG

Edit: yeah yeah I’m definitely being too hard on CP77… but like, so many of those character missed for me. I lowkey don’t like Jackie at all for example.
Starfield really does feel like one of those Faith Based Movies at times
[removed]
I'd say Morrowind is the exception to that; maybe Daggerfall too but I haven't played it. As they crafted a genuinely good story that worked within their constraints of not wanting to limit player freedom while also providing the appropriate stakes to keep the story engaging. It only floundered at the last second and I've heard that was more due to crunch than anything else.

Problem is that the writers that made it work in Morrowind have long since left the company. And those who remained have seen that they can get away with more and more mediocrity since Oblivion.
It's almost like obsidian had all their writing/RPG talent
High altitude, meta-level analysis of the narrative is that it's pretty good and engaging. The story is layered with meaning and likes to touch on deeply existential questions.

However, when the  writing is viewed at the street level, among its characters and locations, it's quite amateurish and on-the-nose. It's still fun for me, but it treats itself like a joke far too often.
Avatar: The Last Airbender looks and sounds like a Saturday morning cartoon and it is still one of the best written stories out there.

It's not about the grit, you're right.
The ending to that gang quest line was hilarious to me. There are no consequences, no weight to your decisions. Everything always works out fine.
The main quest 'All That Money Can Buy' is where the game really lost me. Where you set up a deal with an artifact seller, then you break into his house, attempt to mug him and then later your followers get mad at you for not turning \*him\* in to the corrupt Neon police on behalf of the people who just tried to kill you.
The strikers quest pissed me off so bad I never played it after the first time. It feels like they’re building for a choice to either make the gang absolute menaces or help build them into something that supports Ebbside & builds the community but they just kick you out & turn them into the cops they’ve expressly stated they dislike, like wtf???
[deleted]
I mean you can tell they just don't get it when you look at that lame fucking "club" in neon. You are 100% correct.
It was by far the one I was most excited to join. I’ve been underwhelmed by Bethesda faction quest lines before, but FC is the one that has been the biggest letdown by a mile
You didn't enjoy having a big climactic battle with Ron Hope who folded like a cardboard box? Then everyone complains about how doomed everyone is without him, but nothing ever actually happens.
I wouldn't know. The Red Mile was bugged for me.
The argument in the past has always been "oh, you can't expect the same quality writing and quests in a game this large", but then The Witcher 3 came out and showed you really can have top quality writing and cinematics in an open-world RPG.

Ten years later, Bethesda doesn't have any excuses anymore.
TBH exploration has absolutely floored me. Until now, I never would have thought it possible to have a universe that simultaneously felt so empty and so cramped at the same time, but so far I haven't found anyone who feels quite the same way. 

The POIs are the issue. Ships are constantly landing and taking off at all times from every unexplored iceball with nothing but some iron on it. Every inch of every moon or planet in the back end of nowhere is covered in robotics facilities, labs, and so on, complete with inhabitants(if not always the ones who built it). And yet, you step one foot beyond the POIs and there's....nothing? All these spots all over the planet, at least one every couple of miles, and there's just NO INFRASTRUCTURE despite what all these places would have needed.
It wasn’t the best story but it was good. Nothing fantasic nothing terrible the rest pumped it up enough to make that go unnoticed and you can enjoy the game. Fallout 4 has a very nice story and the map is amazing not at skyrim levels but every time i replay it i lose myself in exploration. Starfield has… nothing. The companions are nice, not a masterpiece level but they are a solid 7. The rest sucks. Story is not terrible but they managed to get worse than skyrim and guess what no exploration so… yeah. Dialogues are what the post says except a few occasion the ship is horrible u never really get to drive it and there is a loading every 7-10 minutes. So you need double free time to play it.
This so much. It's like that spongebob episode with the burger making competition.
Haha, at some point I've also decided to go full evil in a desperate try to make the game more interesting. I went on a killing spree in Akila, just to find out that unnamed security guards were tagged as essential and could not be killed. But even after shooting all non-essential NPCs I could _still_ continue the faction quest.

Even in Fallout 3, which is an 15 year old game, you could kill important NPCs such as Collin Moriaty, because the game gave you options like hacking a terminal, finding notes in locked containers, on corpses etc. — I don't even expect BG3 levels of quality, but ffs can't they even copy things that worked well from their own games?
Oh God, and even Andrea is kind of obnoxious. I don't know if it's the voice actress or the direction she was given, but the delivery of a lot of her lines is jarring, to say the least. She sounds weirdly confused in the dialogues I've heard from her, and she never seems to deviate from that weirdly monotone, static line delivery.
The *Cyberpunk 2077* overhaul didn't change writing, voice acting, art direction, assets, or music. It mainly improved the skill/perk progression and loot systems, nerfed netrunning, and perhaps key, added a dash/air dash mechanic that makes combat a faster and more fluid experience. Primarily mechanical issues, while the art and quest design teams were working on the DLC.

As I understand, much greater changes would be required to similarly overhaul *Starfield*, and writing / rerecording dialogue probably wouldn't be among them. Many more major POI and a system for preventing repeats of any major POI in any given universe. Perhaps player discovery of content through in-system traversal and scanning.  Eliminating/shortening loading screens wherever possible. More options for non-combat resolution of quests, including persuasion and stealth. Viable combat alternatives to gunplay. At least one new companion with at best a neutral morality. And lots of flavor enhancers like open drug use or thugs in corners of Neon. 

I don't think the writing can be fixed, its part of the preproduction skeleton the rest of the game hangs on. And that poses huge problems for any future installments, as unlike ES or FO, I haven't seen any discussions where players came to love or hate the factions. One could argue about the merits of the Nord rebellion, Imperium, or Brotherhood of Steel, but the most I see about the UC Vanguard or Freestar Rangers amount to shrugs.
Only if modders are interested. I'm not particularly inspired to mod it, and I know other modders who've publicly and privately said they're not either. There'll be a mod scene for sure (well, there already is) but I don't think it'll be as big as Skyrim's or Fallout 4's, and that's a shame.
And yet mod authors are saying it is more awkward to mod than other Beth games. And they are turning more off by attempting to introduce paid mods yet again.
There was more consequential, lore-rich writing in Morrowind than in every Bethesda game since, combined. Ken Rolston was a god among us unworthy video game folks. I hope Pepperidge Farm remembers Ken too.
Morrowind had some of Bethesda's best storytelling, but it was all in the lore of the game - the storied history of the different Dumner tribes, their complex relationships with the Imperials, the history of Red Mountain and the Blight, etc. 

Starfield tells us there was a big war to explain why the factions don't get along and why we can't pilot Mechs.
That’s been how Bethesda make dialogues for a long time. Zero animations.
I had a blast with Fallout 3 and it held up way more than I thought it would, but man, New Vegas is on a different level.
And they had 11+ years to do it… kind of shameful, really…
Fallout 3 is MUCH better. It’s still pretty basic (But e.g. there was ZERO imagination behind the Broken Steel DLC. Absolutely none. Idk why anyone feels like that was quality expansion content at all) but at least there are characters that are memorable. There is not a single NPC or companion in Starfield I will remember a year or two from now
Imagine writing a plot so boring and lacking in replayability so much that you had the awareness to add such a dialogue option
Well, go ahead and cherry pick the good stuff then and share it.

I'll wait.
The lack of a local map is fatal for this game. On top of all the other problems, it’s a chore to navigate. I really tried to like this game, and I think I enjoyed my play through, but in hindsight, it really isn’t a good game, especially for what was promised.
That doesn’t merit a free pass to continue the same flaws. Games like New Vegas and Outerworlds have shown how you can have moderately better writing at least in a RPG with a similar dialogue system. And both games have (to me) clearly better story telling and world building. And that’s not me being an Obsidian fanboy. They aren’t perfect either. But definitely better.
Well, you said it yourself…you said it when the game first came out. Not everyone has a chance to  play at that point and probably wanted to believe you were a hater and it wasn’t actually that bad. Then they played and realized the horrible truth.
Did you look at the screenshot? Haha. Your character is basically responding to your boss’s question about a crime scene with, “I was too busy slaughtering the perps to note any clues or even basic details”? Or, “duhh, I was supposed to do what boss? Sorry, I wasn’t paying attention!”

None of that is realistic
Sounds like you definitely don’t know much about writing
“Normal” people think this game is bad
Fallout 3 was a bit better imo but that was in large part due to the overall tone of the game, which was a bit more tongue-and-cheek. But nothing a flaw in previous games doesn’t grant future games some kind of pass to continue that flaw
I have a new word for you.  


sam·ple  
/ˈsamp(ə)l/  
noun  
a small part or quantity intended to show what the whole is like.  
"investigations involved analyzing samples of handwriting"
> This shit is embarrassing. 

Cover your mirror then.  He's not wrong, the writing is bad.
Muahaha screw your dummy and your mother now go collect this stuff for us muahaha
That's an insult to the chaotic evil third graders. I've seen better plans put together by 1st graders.
Calvin but with worse schemes and less fun games
Joffrey: They say Stannis never smiles...I'll give him a red smile.
School year bullies larping as space pirates
Written by people who have never left the safe confines of their WASP suburbs or even seen one VICE documentary.

The whole game lacked teeth.
I think its the fact that tons, millions, bought Starfield, that's the worst part.

The fact its the 7th best selling game this year, is the worst part. It basically says gamers are willing to award studios for making half-assed games (yeah there's worse games too out there).

Like yeah, plenty of people in this sub actually like the game. But man, this game doesn't meet expectations for MOST people. But Bethesda, I mean I don't know how anyone has faith in this company after Oblivion, as Skyrim needed a shit ton of mods to really bring that game to completion (remember how the entire underworld was empty). 

Bethesda basically sees they can get away with doing the bare minimum here, and still make a good amount of money. It's good business but it BLOWS for gaming as a whole. If BG3 raised the bar, Starfield lowered it back down.
They're like 14 year olds who think they're badass because they listen to metal and scowl a bit. Their bar even has some metal song playing, to reinforce that feeling.
LOL mean boy scouts... Not even close, they don't even come close to bully status 🫢
When reaching Barrett I had a critical persuasion success so the conversation, summarised was:

"You like this hostage, let him go."

"Absolutely not, he is a hostage, I need cash or something"

"C'mon, let him go"

"No way. My men would never accept that."

"You're coming around to my point of view"

"Ok, I will let him go."

I then casually wandered around in front of these pirates whose friends I had been massacring outside, looted all their stuff in front of their faces, and left.
Yep I had the same reaction, that was shockingly bad. I felt like “wait… what…? Did I just accidentally skip like an hour of story? Did I cheat?”
Agreed. I played the crimson fleet quest line and realised just how dull it all is. “Hey, I took down your entire base - killed all your workers and double crossed you” for the crimson leader (an apparent badass) to tell me he hates me. What the fuck? Bethesda suck so hard. Since 76 they’ve been going down hill.
That was also the final straw for me for when the game went from okay to garbage. It really did get set up like it was going to be a cool mission. Instead, you run back and forth across the ship a dozen times for no fucking reason, pull some ridiculous shit out of your ass, have the mentioned nonsensical convo to get the prize, and then just bugger off like nothing happened.

That mission is the perfect example of everything wrong with the game. Bad writing. Boring, uninspired mission structures (every mission is just running back and forth). Zero consequences for any action you take.
[deleted]
Yeah, the blatant lack of respect despite you being apparently the only reason for the Fleet to survive makes that first scene of the two pirates arguing on your first arrival to the Key utterly ridiculous
I liked how Matthis told me he was going to hunt me after getting kicked out so I shot him in the face…and nothing happened. Not even a reaction from him or anyone. Like, I’m in a pirate base and this murderous pirate says he’s gonna kill me. Why can’t I just kill him. Took me out of it.
Or just little things like when you walk around in New Atlantia wearing UC armor and doing UC stuff, and the other UC officers are like: "We're watching you, citizen!" Wtf, we work together!
The House Va’ruun would’ve been great main antagonist as well due to their advanced tech and gear. 

The Crimson fleet seems like common meth addicts with space suits.
Very much this, I am convinced that the people game companies hire to write basically have always had conversations online, and don’t have a good grasp on how people communicate in real life.  This was a big problem in another big space exploration game ME:A.
Worried? You can literally join the fleet as The Mantis, the pirate-hunting space Batman, and they don’t think anything of it
> SPACERS are just reskinned fleet. Why even have them? 

Spacers are exactly what Skyrim's non-faction bandits are. They are unaligned fodder for you to beat the shit out of and loot without having to figure out some dodgy faction-related questions in doing so.

For example, you can be a "bandit" as a member of the Thieves Guild, but the bandits you come across like so much dungeon herpes are never consequential. There is no reason to not kill them, they are always hostile and unreasonable and not part of any quests.

Spacers are the same. The most generic of bad guys to beat up, given a Reavers-from-Firefly ripoff story and dropped in your path. The very most interesting thing that can happen with Spacers is the result of The Mantis mission, but that gets old fast.

I really kinda hate this practice in games, particularly supposedly immersive and story-rich RPGs. It's a pretty common sin. Bandits rarely ever just "bandits" in real life. They are typically little gangs that walk in the shadow of larger criminal outfits. For once I would really like to see random hostiles handled this way. Instead of finding a random group of nobody Spacers inhabiting an abandoned station, they could be a procedurally-generated Spacer Gang with a name. A microfaction. Take it a step further and give then faction relations and the ability to expand. It would be awesome to see a novel faction arise and become a force to reckon with in your game world.
Jess should've definitely hid and had a side mission after.. She was the only actual character that wasn't a cartoon on the whole fleet.
Then they brag about having the most lines of dialogue of any bethesda game
> everybody just skips through

Ugh, that's a reprehensible thing for a writer to say, but disgusting as it is, I also want to point some of the blame at "let's play-ers" and other gaming "content creators."

Because a team of writers is adapting their style or allocating their resources based on what they see those jaded burnt-out youtubers do when they play, then no wonder they come to a conclusion so far out of touch.

People who actually still enjoy gaming don't skip through the dialogue ffs. When I find myself so burnt out that I start skipping stuff like that, I stop gaming for a while because it's no longer enjoyable.

But since a gaming youtuber can't take a break without losing their income, they just keep drudging through, giving a terrible impression of what it is to play a game.
Which really sucks, cause usually I do exactly that. Then for this game I told myself that I would read all the dialogue, I wouldn't just speed through everything so I would know what was going on. Then got all this shit, and ended up feeling like I could have just rushed through everything, wouldn't have missed anything important, and still would have known what all was going on.
Meanwhile, I just replayed The Hunt side quest in Cyberpunk 2077, and even at its most depraved moments, I couldn't bring myself to skip a single line of dialogue. I'm pretty astounded that Bethesda's lead writer would say this. Is that the same guy who was complaining that gamers don't understand game development on twitter?
Man sounds like he asked one or two people what they thought of rpg games dialogue and writing and based their response on all his future endeavors.
Damn, that's exactly what I do...I thought I was just being impatient.
>The illusion of choice was groundbreaking in 2005.

How so?

RPGs already had excellent variable dialogue options in the late 90s (think Fallout 1&2 and Planescape Torment). Hell, Vampire Bloodlines came out two years before Oblivion. Deus Ex came out in 2000.

Starfield's writing and false choices would not gave been groundbreaking or impressive back then. Bethesda has always been bad at this.
But Kreia, Meetra Surik never needed a voced protagonist. They could just start from the ground: getting a better writer. The whole point of not having a voiced protagonist is the possibility of mods creating new scenarios. 

But hey, the non player Starborn is voiced in a universe.
So they didn't give us nor a good writing or a voiced protagonist.
I mean they cheaped out on voice actors again, what do you expect from them. It felt like I'm hearing the same Orc weapons salesman back from Imperial City all over again, but making funny and vague european accents this time.
Many dialogue options in Cyberpunk mirror the complaints people have about Starfield. You might get one extra line of reply from the NPC, but that's it. It's one of the biggest complaints about that game that I guess people are forgetting about.
A voiced protagonist is just so much better. Cyberpunk showed it was possible and should be the bench mark for future rpgs.
Such as?

Almost all the dialogue trees are linear.
Lmaooo takes me back to Mass Effect days when you had to choose between vaguely worded options sometimes
Options. That equal the same response. I'm sure no one will notice said Emil Paliaruo.
Fallout 4 was a *massive* step forwards when it came to companions, I only wish it wasn’t accompanied by a massive step *back* in terms of player choice and dialogue. 

Just! Keep! Lines! Unvoiced! It worked absolutely fine before, and all that extra effort and game file space can go to useful shit now!
Its just that they dun wnna do it.

Their design philosophy is that players should be able to do everything in one playthrough.

Which is lame, but whatever, it's their game.
Which is funny because of the fact they dress their games up as RPGs. Also funny because the Mass Effect trilogy exists.
It feels like they changed their mind about what kind of game to make partway through.
The dialogue wasn't based on the character, it was based on the quest, and presumably different quest writers.

This is part of why it feels so incoherent.
>However, games Like Rogue Trader have conversations that all end the same despite choice

I disagree there. Rogue Trader has a bunch of quests that all end the same way, but there's also heaps of opportunities to haul off your party members for execution and permanently disable their quests.

There's also lots of smaller consequences throughout the game - be it reputation points, commerce points, or random events that happen depending on your choices. Your alignment also sometimes unlocks entirely new ways to complete quests.

It's not *vastly* different, but at least your character choices matter.
Talking about Walter? Man controls the whole negotiation and steers it to paying no matter what dialog options are taken
Fallout New Vegas is Obsidian, only published by Bethesda. Obsidian also did Pillars of Eternity 1 / 2 and probably still had veterans who did KOTOR 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, or even earlier titles when they were Black Isle Studios such as Planescape and Icewind Dale. 

Lots of RPG developing experience there, which definitely helped make FNV as popular as it was.
It’d be something if being a pirate meant you go a lot of good stuff at the risk of getting caught, but it’s not balanced at all.
Yeah, let's not pretend to be a role playing game if I can't, you know, role play?
What, you don't want to unleash a barely-tested bioweapon on the universe?
Well that’s kinda cool. But there’s no other way to blackmail him? I’ll have to give it a go at some point. Thanks!
Is there any advantage to withholding the blackmail. The entire reason I haven't gone tor UC guy is because I want some leverage or a favor from the governor of Cydonia. 

Honestly, I doubt there is. But it would have been cool if you could've used that blackmail to help you in a quest. 

Like if you went to the mayor and made his delete Perceval's debt to the TA. Or anything really
That the board of supervisors/corpo management at Paradiso are the ones considered "essential" while the average guard and worker on that planet isn't is some dark comedy...

Or would be, if it was intentional.
Wait which mayor was at the beach?
I was talking about the Mars city Mayor. That guy was just the CEO douchebag.
I know, what possible reason could they have for making them essential?? Like the quest isn't a main story quest, just have the player fail or write a different outcome if you slaughter the board and all the security.
 Fuck, keep them as essential until AFTER the quest so the player doesn't miss any content (the worst possible thing according to Bethesda)
There's always Chameleon.
Manipulation skill (on him).  
Chameleon on armor.  
Void Form starborn power.  


...there are ways.
obsidian wouldn't make any sense anymore, honestly
I recommend Tyranny made by Obsidian. That game felt so amazing to play as a bad guy. Its didn’t feel cartoony at all.
Pathfinder Wrath from the same studio also treats evil characters the same way. You can still be a rambling, blood-thirsty idiot; but overall you're also able to be a smart and even pragmatic sort of evil character. To the point that the most beloved character from that game is a Lawful Evil crusader, who often is the most intelligent man in the room and the story acknowledges it. Even my good characters adore that one, because while he's Lawful Evil the story never paints him as a gibbering moron. He's a ruthless pragmatist who expects perfection.
I really like how playing as a good character can actually have negative consequences, you don't see that very often
Bonus: loading screens at every step
It's astounding how Starfield is actually more boring than an average mid 2010s MMO.

Hell, it's even more boring than Bethesda's own MMOs- Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 76 (well this one is just MO)
Many quests are a "fetch quest" of sorts.

I'd say the entire Witcher 3 main story is a fetch quest, you are fetching an entire person. Yet what happens during that quest, the motives, the characters, the nuances, makes it great. Fetch a person turns into a reunion of old friends, a mystery, conflicting interests, moral dilemmas, geopolitics, tragic deaths and romances.

Mass Effect has fetch quests, except you go into this planet that's being mind controlled through spores by an alien plant that creates clones and has space zombies, which was harbored and kept secret by a big R&D corporation, to retrieve a person who has information for an important objective, where you make a bunch of decisions about the people who live there, the company and further the main plot.

BG3's last act is essentially two fetch quests to retrieve items for a device, yet you go against vying powers of a major city and uncover all these plots and horrors therein.

What sucks about the "fetch quest" in a game like Starfield is you'll have this serious mystical item you need to retrieve for a certain person, and you literally just fly from A to B, have two lines of dialogue and maybe a small basic encounter with arbitrary enemies like space bandits, and then return item to A. No world building, no character development, no interesting plot advancement, no interesting choices. You spend more time traveling from A to B to A than anything else. This happens in both the main story and the side quests.
The 'Heart of Mars' mission is emblematic of everything this games suffers with. It's nothing but going into a cave to mine a piece of ore then returning to Cydonia, but there's literally so much dialogue about this quest you can talk about it with NPCs more than 20x longer than it takes to actually do the quest! It baffles me, and makes me think that something went very wrong on the quest-design end that the dialogue writers were not suffering from. There are a lot of quests with excessive amounts of dialogue that don't reflect how little you actually have to do.
More like 5 year old child
Safe is the word to use here. That became Ubisofts trademark for popular franchises, yet Starfield somehow manages to be multiple rungs bellow even Ubisoft's stories in their big titles.
Hell, Kirkbride legit wrote a fantasic concept for the Elderscrolls as the beginnings for a sci-fi story back when he was still one of the writers for Morrowind. I think theimperiallibrary still has it somewhere buried in their archives. It makes me sad to see how far the writing has fallen since then.
It's telling when the most iconic character in the game was lifted straight from Oblivion.
I want to sever the ties of fate and fuck up my game. Why stop me from doing that? So odd that Morrowind was 1,000 steps forward but Starfield is 10,000,000 steps back.
Cd projekt red has really nailed it. As much of a mess that game was when it released, with 2.0 and phantom liberty coming out a month after starfield, I played through phantom liberty and I was like yo what the fuck was starfield. There’s just levels to it. Cyberpunk isn’t perfect but cd projekt has pretty good writers and the characters are actually pretty good. The themes and writing go hand and hand, and that goes back to Witcher. It’s like they took the torch bethesda once had and just ran with it while bethesda stayed prehistoric. I’m not even trying to shit on bethesda, love their games, and I enjoyed starfield. I just realized how mediocre it was. I lack so much confidence in them for the next elder scrolls unless they commit to UE5 and replace some of the teams and writers there. They need it bad. They need talent and a vision because they have been doing the same shit for so many years
I like how the entire feel of Starfield is hopeful so I’m fine with the regular dialogue, but it doesn’t feel like how the world communicates in real life. I was hoping for edgy dialogue when you’re in that Cyberpunk planet (sorry I stopped playing after reaching 70 hours, I forgot the name of the planet)
I personally just like when games and art stays true to what real life would actually be like. I know there is a place for cozy type games where its all sunshine and rainbows but thats not life. Some people even say Cyberpunk is just too depressing where as I feel like yeah its depressing because that future and world is fucking depressing. Thats the whole point of that world.
This is correct. I was just saying, certain themes don't feel real. Like neon city is supposed to be this lawless dystopian hell. The kind of people you meet there wouldn't talk the way they talk or act how they act but its like writing for a fucking E for everyone video game. The writing in general just isn't good and I honestly think the characters were pretty trash too. I enjoyed starfield but i really soured on it as time went by after. Its just so dated in every single way, it's like i played a remastered game from 2008 or some shit.
Nah but neon not leaning heavily into sex and drugs and just implying it make it objectively poorly implemented.
Genuinely curious what you think an actual rpg is? I have seen a few of your comments and I do disagree with them, but I am interested.
You're definitely in the minority with that opinion. When Cyberpunk released and had its issues, the one thing people praised was the writing. The characters feel like real people and they all have their own unique personalities and desires and motivations. The overall story is simplistic but it's incredibly well done. Night City feels like a city. 

Compare that to Starfield, and it's like comparing Shakespeare to Dr. Seuss. One has depth and layers and actually makes you think, and the other one is fun for children.
This is an incredibly hot take.

Cyberpunk is hailed for having excellent and immersive writing above all else.
I think cyberpunk writing was okay, nothing special but nothing to get mad about.

It conveys a certain vibe and does so very well through environmental storytelling.
I loved the questline with the autonomous cars developing their own personalities, it was fun to experience.
I can't entirely remember the main quest but i love the message it conveys - you get dealt certain cards and you gotta deal with them.
It's believable enough to not be completely immersion breaking because the core concept is relatable. 


Starfield however is so goody-goody that none of it makes sense.
Roughest place in the universe is tamer than the tame sections in cyberpunk.
>V never actually says the dialogue option you pick

So does Sole Survivor from Fallout 4, and Connor, Kara, and Marcus from Detroit Become Human. Guess that's just how it is with game dialogue choises with voice / animated actions goes these days.
See, I felt they handled Matteo terribly. He's kind of an idiot who lives on blind faith and wears that **stupid** hat. Just because someone's religious or a priest or whatever doesn't mean they've lost their brains.
It’s Veggie Tales: In Space!
Great example.
The lack of consequences is my core problem with the game.  How can I simultaneously be a member of three different major factions with no consequences?  Why not have my choices carry weight?  If I chose to join the Crimson Fleet, make me an outlaw with the other factions.  The only time I've ever faced any ramifications is when I go to the Key, and that's simply because I've got such a huge bounty on my head that I get instantly attacked and can't progress in my quest there.
There is one consequence, being that the Crimson Fleet pirates are no longer hostile to you, taking away one of only three different versions of bad guy you can fight (spacer, pirate, eliptic) making the game more boring.
Oh for sure, that part baffled me. 

Sarah Disliked my compassion, and she was dead to me too. When the option came to pick who was gonna die, she was #1 on my list. Really dropped my enthusiasm for the game.
I think they lost me on that one, but maybe further? 

I got on this guy's ship to get an artifact and the only way to get it is to kill him and all his people. No haggling. No favors. No deals. Not stealth stealing it after I sleep with him or something. Nope, just mass murder a whole ship of people.
Yep.  Saving grace would've been cool mechanics and a world to explore.  Starfield doesn't have either
100%. It’s even worse when you consider that you have a very good Ranger motif to think about with the NCR Rangers from New Vegas, but even Bethesda themselves wrote a better version of the Collective with the damn Minutemen! Not like the Minutemen are this insanely deep faction, but even they feel way more interesting than whatever the Collective is supposed to be. They were perhaps the most generic thing Bethesda could have churned out. 

Here’s an NPC that’s a cool descendent of the founder! No, he doesn’t really care for them anymore, and no, he won’t really give you an interesting history lesson! Oh and no, it won’t add any interesting dimension to their faction. It’s maddening.
> Until now, I never would have thought it possible to have a universe that simultaneously felt so empty and so cramped at the same time, but so far I haven't found anyone who feels quite the same way. 

I think that's how most people feel about Starfield they just can't express it eloquently.
That definitely felt like an intentional direction for the character.

She’s supposed to sound stilted and frequently awkward in her dialogue. She’s in the group, but feels outside of the group, and is just an introverted, often hypocritical, judgmental little weirdo who loves Snake Jesus very much.

I don’t like much of it, but it feels very intentional and directed.
And gets mad all the time about anything. I already have a wife irl.
This is exactly the problem. Starfield's issues are the result of poor fundamental design choices that effectively necessitate building a new game from the ground up. It will not benefit from a 2.0 treatment anywhere near how well Cyberpunk did.

Shattered Space has *some* possibility of improving things, since it's an expansion added on top of the game with it's own writing and recorded dialogue and is an opportunity to create new game systems that actually interact with each other. This is the best case scenario.  
The far more likely scenario is that Shattered Space will just be more of the same bad writing, bad dialogue, and insulting quests. I genuinely don't look at Bethesda as a serious studio after this game, so I don't have a lot of faith they'll magically do it right with a DLC.
It won’t be nearly as active, not by a long shot. Skyrim and FO4 will both have a more active modding scene than starfield will ever come close to.
It is a shame. I hope Bethesda really gets their shit together for tes 6. I'd die if tes 6 ended up being trash.
For reasons that are entirely unrelated to this dialogue option.
Yes then fallout 4 is where they went here 4 choices which are really 2.
dog my comment was literally about how the sample was not representative, for people who complain about writing so often you have absolutely no reading comprehension
Delgado after I searched the key for evidence:

What took you so long?!

Mate, I was gathering evidence to snitch you out to sysdef in your own house. Time is the least of your worries.
Hell naw Calvin is both way smarter and way funnier than the entire crimson fleet combined. Thats insulting to Calvin
Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes?
"Bro, this is some of the heaviest, darkest shit you'll ever hear."

*proceeds to play Disturbed*
I think that may be Bethesdas target audience. Might be deliberate. There's a lot of people who say they got into their first Bethesda game in their early to mid teens. And also same people saying the magic wore off with layer games.

Gamers grow up but Bethesda have regressed?
Yeah the persuasion system is Oblivion levels of bad. They lack any impact or coherence whatsoever. On the goddamn final mission where you're facing a multidimensional power maniac multidimensional entity you can just be "heyyy buddy can I have that artifact? Pleasepleasepleaaaaseee?" "Oh, I know I hunted you across the galaxy, but sure! Have fun!"

Honestly they should've just made branching dialogues and never implemented this system, but that requires work..... :/ Hurts me so much cuz I was such a Bethesda fan, but this is just not it
I felt very much like Naruto or any other shonen anime protagonist with that speech check. 

"Im your ememy! Give me what i want!"

"But are you? We could be friends!"

"What? No! ...ok, sure lets friends now"
I managed to persuade the boss holding Barrett hostage, then turned around and killed them all anyway.
Yeah being able to convince the Hunter, who's only characterized as being power hungry and a killer, not to fight you for the artifacts was wild. I do the persuasion because it's faster but I hate that I can persuade him not to fight me. It goes against his entire character.
They've been going downhill since Oblivion. Morrowind was Bethesda at its peak. Everything after that was downhill.

Everyone loves Skyrim, but that shit was kinda weak. A decent game, sure, but weak. Fallout 4 was trash, I still haven't completed the MQ. Any time I go back to it, I end up spending more time in mod quests.
Man....I love F4 but that game's plot does not resist analysis. It falls apart at the slightest of scrutinies
Man there's so much running back and forth from system to system just to complete faction quests it's insane. And it's not even really going to new places that often. You are back and forth in areas you likely explored (I did a ton of wandering and exploring before actually getting into the quests).

I wanted so so much to love the game. But they made it hard even for a Bethesda apologist like myself.
That's how I felt. Those constant loading screens, the unclear logic of the plot and the nonsensical dialogue. I thought the Crimson Fleet quests were some of the better thought out ones overall, but that quest was maddening in every respect. Some dev wanted a cruise ship and didn't bother to write a coherent plot for it.
Absolutely. In Baldurs gate, there are heaps of choices that matter to the outcome, or how characters perceive you. Here it’s just a nothing burger of consequence that doesn’t even extend beyond the character or place or even that one quest, as if they’ve forgotten all about it.
telling the chief of security to give me his keycard because if he didn't I wouldn't leave him alone and having him give it to me to make me go away was not slightly realistic lol

this game is written by stupid people
Fallout 4 had the same problem when you became head of the minutemen and Garvey would just treat you like an errand boy. Bethesda just can't fucking write for shit
Or becoming the head of the disciples to get bought out by Neon security and not have Neon security missions as a crooked cop or at least have connections in Neon security
Not to mention "the only way out of the fleet is death" being thrown in your face non-stop, and then they kick Mathis out in good health, and you run into that idiot on the cruise liner, and of course there's the dude on the eye. Clearly death isn't the only way out of the fleet. In fact, it's got to be the least common way out of the fleet, by my count.

It's thinly veiled threats, just like "oh no, don't go to the *well*." and "stay out of lower Akila, or else". etc etc. Give us the consequences you promise, damnit.
Same thing with paradiso, my background is a neon street rat who hates corpos. Why can't I get a trait option to kill him and the board members and let The colonists just land and take over the place. But no my only option was to work for these scomp munchers and kill the colonists and destroy their ship or just buy them a grav drive. What kinda roll playing choices is that?
?? when i did that the whole KEY turned against me.
Man he said that shit to me and legit took my gun out and shot him. The whole ship started shooting me, that really killed my buzz :c
The Starborn were the main antagonists, and Constellation the main protagonists (it's actually a really specific pairing in terms of how you write antagonists and protagonists), but the writers apparently forgot that five minutes in and they never actually confronted each other \*on the differences that made them different\*.

Constellation are supposed to do the classic hero story of seeking out treasure (information) and bringing it back to their people. But they don't do that (except in a post-game clip). The Starborn seek power at any cost and to hell with other people (even the dropouts are hedonists), but somehow they became the default faction to join at the end, so you can't actually oppose them.

It's not even a narrative train wreck, it's like falling out of a plane without a parachute.
That's the fallout raiders in a nutshell, But with pipe weaponry and pool cues instead of space suits.
Yeah i got major low tier motorcycle club vibes lol
I walked in on one playthrough flying the Star Eagle and wearing a UC Vanguard Captain outfit and armor after slaughtering a dozen outposts of fleet members and completing dozens of anti-fleet board missions. They never batted an eyelash.

But, I also went in the first time expecting that I needed to hide who I was, and I roleplayed right into that bs.
Like I said before I like the game, however, a big problem I have is BGS handling this after their smaller studios having had made bangers like Prey, Deathloop, Tokyo Ghostwire, red...... No not that one, But yeah you get what I mean. All the raw talent they could draw from for their storytelling. And they stick with I-wish-for-people-to-compare-me-to-George RR..... 


You know what I'ma stop. The writing in Starfield has been a biiig picking point for cause ffs man I hear rumors that you are Starborn. I heard the constellation called someone to unity was it true? I USED TO BE AN ADVENTURER LIKE YOU ( actual line in Starfield btw from the sec either UC or Neon.)



Goddamn Disney Space Pirates. Might as well have Johnny Depp VA Delgado ffs



At least redfall was original, it wasn't good mind you but anyway.
My local food stores brag about how cheap their nasty wooden chicken meats are.
I really want to know where they are.
Never thought of it that way.  That’s a good point.  Ppl who play games for a living must deal with burnout all the time, but they can’t just stop.  I always end up taking long breaks between games.  Even if I thoroughly enjoyed a game, it takes an emotional toll immersing yourself into a brand new world, then closing and exiting that world for good.  It’s like a part of your soul stays with that plane of existence.

Witcher 3 and Divinity OS 2 in particular took a while to recover from.

Didn’t have too much trouble moving on from FO4 or Witcher 1/2 or DOS 1 though.
>But since a gaming youtuber can't take a break without losing their income, they just keep drudging through, giving a terrible impression of what it is to play a game.

Also, a lot of YouTube content on Bethesda RPGs is challenge runs and the like, where they (and the audience) have played through the game countless times before. Skipping the dialogue in that instance is sort of expected, since it's not the point of that particular playthrough. 

Additionally, playing the game in a Let's Play is going to necessarily be different from how someone plays on their own, even if they're not rushing, because no audience wants to watch you spend 15 minutes tweaking your inventory, then another 20 minutes just reading in-game books and logs, then another 10 minutes puttering around your ship as you put back up the decorations that the game crammed into a random box the last time you minorly tweaked your ship, or...

I sincerely hope the writers don't look at YouTube as representative of how players play their game, because it's pretty obviously not, but then again, they *do* seem to assume that their players are idiots, so...
Fallout 3 wasn't released in an age where the creators considered online content or streamers. It still had some terrible writing
I think there are some people who treat every game like a looter-shooter. I have seen people on the sub talk about skipping the dialogue to get back to shooting.

Mind you I've also seen someone say they skip the dialogue because it's bad and it doesn't have any consequences (and they didn't the first time), so there you go.
Nah we still enjoy gaming we just play other games
Hate to say it, but while I'm not at all burnt out from games, I do skip a lot of Starfield dialog because of the very thing we're discussing here, and brings me pain.
And Oblivion didn’t really have much real “choice”. Compared to the games you’ve listed it was approximately 0 meaningful choice in any of the quests
2005 was when they started playing, everything was groundbreaking to them
Didn’t say they had to, I just said it’s possible and Bethesda lacks the dedication to do it right. 🤷‍♂️
Imo a voiced protagonist takes *REALLY* good writing to pull off in an RPG game that’s supposed to have multiple choices for quests, something Bethesda isn’t as good at as they used to be. With the bad writing it just makes it more cringy than it already is.
Yeah, but the NPCs in Cyberpunk are memorable, deep, real characters. Their dialog says a lot more than the dialog in Starfield. It’s like the player actually *knows* the characters in Cyberpunk.  The characters in Starfield all feel like strangers, even the companions.
Yeah I had to quick save before every single dialogue because I never knew what my character was about to say. How stupid this is.
> Their design philosophy is that players should be able to do everything in one playthrough.

Which is funny because FO4 kicks you out of a decent chunk of content depending on when and how you pick certain quests and objectives. They've done this before, no reason they couldn't do it now.
That's a huge problem with this game, though. It's literally built and tailor made to encourage multiple playthroughs, and how they do it is quite impressive. One of my biggest problems was crossing the Unity and realizing that there wasn't a single thing I wanted to do again. Almost no choices I really wanted to change. They just couldn't embrace the main point of the story and their philosphy of the whole game. I don't feel like it would have lost a thing if it never had NG+.
And with NG+ they were given a clever way to still allow that be while also having restrictions.. just they didn’t take advantage of such…. At all lol
>Their design philosophy is that players should be able to do everything in one playthrough.

That's fine, but if that's the case I'd rather they just hand me a character rather than let me design my own and tell me I get to choose what it's like. You can make much more natural conversations that way, and voice the protagonist to boot.
Don’t forget “keep it simple, stupid”
"Gamers are idiots and we will treat them as such".

- BGS probably

Interacting with the story content of the game made me feel like an idiot, like my time was being wasted with pointless padding.

It's great that starfield has the most recorded dialogue of any BGS games but if that means listening to an npc jabber on about meaningless garbage for minutes on end in the same static shot of them idk, im gonna lose it.
Honestly, it feels they never made up their mind in the first place.
This is why they need to use game design documents that lays out things like how you should pick the tone for your dialog. The fact that Emil P doesn’t like to use design documents is insulting. I’ve almost never seen someone less suited for their current position. 

The whole game seems like it was made with each individual dev just doing their own thing without any thought of how it meshes together with the other parts of the game.
Ya well said.
So then we agree. I think you're misunderstanding. 

It's my fault for it being clear enough. I'm saying that Rogue Trader has some conversations that will end the same way regardless of dialog option... but I'm using those ones as an example to show that even those *feel* different because your dialog options will **at least** affect how the NPC replies. Letting the player talk the way they want to, where starfield does not. 

I was not trying to say that Rogue Trader doesn't have impactful choices, far from it. Sorry for the confusion.

To add to your point. My crime lord character and my Noble character had wildly different experiences throughout the first chapter because of the different dialog options (skill checks passed) they had available to them. 

My Noble talked his way through a lot of conflict whereas my crime lord shot his way through most of it.
Yep.

When a *main story* mission fumbles giving you basic choices like that? I really wonder what the writers of that mission were thinking - were they rushed? Was it a late addition? Did it just slip through the cracks in terms of polishing and editing?

Did they actually think it was good?

Brings to mind a main quest in Skyrim, where you have to infiltrate the Thalmor meeting thing, and there are both a variety of ways to do it *and* a variety of wails to fail at it and having the situation turn to violence (while still letting you progress the story).

Whereas this one makes a big deal out of presenting you with options, yet cuts you off from making them...

Until later, that is, with one of the most hilariously tone deaf options I saw in my playtime, *mostly because of the reactions from your companions*, lol.

Your ship gets impounded, and you have to deal with the corpo who did that, and  you're given a choice of what to do with the guy if you parlay with the corpo guy.

The guy who has been living under the thumb of the corpo world on Neon, struggling to make ends meet, whose personal correspondence suggests he was about to be laid off anyway, and was grabbing an opportunity that could get him out...and letting the guy go free afterward instead of putting him in jail legitimately gets disapproval from your companions.

It's like someone had the basic idea of doing a mission that would have you dealing with the corpo world and shady deals and hard-pressed average workers and greed and corporate exploitation and other things that would fit right into a cyberpunk dystopia on a water planet...

And then produced the most milquetoast version of that narrative possible, where if you want the approval of your oh so good team of friends from Constellation, you have to agree that putting the guy who was about to get fired in jail for stealing from the corporation (stealing the *very* item you showed up to buy in the first place!) is the correct course of action.

Hot damn that mission is a mess.
always choose armored giraffe parrot (that somehow still needs babysitting every time it encounters the exact thing it was brought back from extinction to eat)
that one pissed me off when I heard about it, to me thats the less good one, but okay two grey choices, no ones great ones bad.  And the person that would be against the 'good' choices still bitches about it.
I think you have the opportunity to black mail him at some point immediately during the quest but if you don’t take it right then it goes away.
You have to have some of the dialogue related skills. Diplomacy or maybe manipulation, can't remember, and you have to do a couple specific things during the quest, but you can blackmail him for a bunch of extra credits. 

Still not that exciting.
Yeah, the blackmail option should be there. It's not very rewarding, though. He just gives you some money and takes the evidence.
I think he'll just give you money. It could be that you could use it for some other quest, but nothing I'm aware of.
The paradiso board that should've been exterminated rather than bowed down to.
In what world is Regill the most beloved character of WoR?
I actually started playing fo76 AFTER starfield and it is simply astounding to see the difference and how much is lacking from starfield in terms of game design. Even the damn outfits are miles better, and it’s supposed to be post apocalyptic… Plus there are real maps that actually help you navigate places that aren’t just shallow POIs!
You're absolutely right. When I'm just boomeranging back and forth from A to B to A to C to A to D and then the huge problem is just magically solved now, I don't consider that engaging gameplay. Busy work isn't fun. It's just stupid filler that BGS uses to stretch out their game and try to trick people into thinking there's actual content in there.
EXACTLY!  

One of the things that games of this magnitude need is *politics*.  Starfield has the people and the power, but it completely leaves politics out of the mix, and this absence makes the game feel lifeless. 

Everyone in Witcher 3 had an angle.  Same thing with a lot of the Fallout games, Skyrim, etc. whether or not fetch quests populated it or not.

There isn’t much reason to pay attention to what’s going on in Starfield.
Imagine modern Bethesda trying to make Paradise falls…
you had to me until 'commit to UE5' because that is not the solution at all.
I would argue that Bethesda never really carried the writing torch. Even in the times of Morrowind, you also had Bioware, Black Isle, Obsidian and other studios which were on par when it came to storytelling. 

What always made BGS stand out (to me at least) was the sandbox and the feeling of a living world. It literally felt like you were dropped into a world where you could do anything, and be anyone. 

Starfield is completely devoid of this feeling.
Yessss. I played CP after starfield and I was like DAMN THIS GAME IS PHENOMENAL WHY DID I SPEND SO MUCH MONEY AND TIME ON STARFIELD
God forbid you ever choose a sarcastic or intimidating dialogue choice when you have a Constellation companion.
The depressing vibes are like the whole point. When Johnny Silverhand says something like “This entire city is fucked in every possible way” you can just look around the city and it’ll prove him right.

All the NPCs in Starfield are like “Oh no, we had a big war! And now we’re at peace, but just barely! Oh, but the only sentient threat to anyone is space pirates. But we’re super, DUPER sad about the war! Oh, DID I MENTION WE HAD A FUCKING WAR?!”  And then there’s pretty much nothing that makes me believe a war took place literally fucking anywhere.
Neon city is how you can tell the game was written by HR committee and old geezer out of touch with reality approved.  The whole zone is just so bland.  The quests are so tame.
I've said this before and I'm gonna say it again because I'm proud of coming up with the analogy (i can't help it)

The game is like a microwave where they cheaped out on radiation shielding.
The more you use it, the more damage you take.
Eh neon supposed to like Aria's omega from mass effect yet they made it another generic city.
Baldurgates 3 and divinity 2 is a good start for a real rpg game.
BG3 for one!!

Edit: for the record I don’t think not being a true RPG makes for a bad game… my favorite game of all time is Fallout 4 lol
Haha I'm glad I'm not the only one that saw his hat and rolled my eyes laughing. His whiny fidgety demeanor was just the coup de grace. 

He could have had a very interesting point and felt like a meaningful part of Constellation but he was just a complete waste since he never serves any purpose.
The entire subject of religion, despite their claim to have had a Jesuit student work on it, reads like it was written by a casual atheist. It was insultingly oversimplified, the "atheist" religion's whole platform was "well, like religion, but not," and the supposedly religious faction was agnostic and run by a man who >!got bored of being a godling!< and had apparently taken a first year philosophy course and got a B-.

And what they did to poor Matteo, man.
Yep.  Just look at fallout new vegas dlc honest hearts.  They have two completely opposed religious leaders.  One is all firery vengeance but probably a bit too brutal.  The other is too pacifist.  They both feel real.
Bad comparison. Veggie Tales was way ahead of its time and, though it was religious in subject matter, its moral lessons and story telling transcended religion and were very well written and produced.
Bruh. I was doing the little missions for the vendor on Mars getting shit for him while I was allies with the Fleet, had like 2 in a row that sent me to places where they were at it was so boring. That was like the main reason for that dude to send you a place to get loot and xp. I know it made sense sort of but it was still dumb.
On a similar note, I couldn't help but laugh anytime Andreja brought up how guilty she felt that she killed that one guy in self-defense when you first meet her, and then we'd immediately go and kill an entire ship or base full of people right after she asks if I judge her for her actions. Not to mention the HUNDREDS of other people I'd killed during the game. But, yeah, let's carry on about that one guy. 

And, to top it all off, at the end of her character mission she asks you to murder a man in cold blood! It's just idiotic writing.
I think you're absolutely right. Much less the actress and more likely the direction and writing from Bethesda. This led to, in my opinion, a very lackluster portrayal of the emotionally isolated, black sheep  character trope.
The thing about Shattered Space is it's being made by the same team that made the core game, so it's extremely unlikely to substantially improve.  The problems with this game as far as one can see from the outside aren't born from a lack of time or budget, but a lack of talent.  The same leadership is still there to make the same bad design decisions and write the same timid story.  They've shown no signs of owning their mistakes; instead they've attempted to gaslight players into believing they aren't bored, or that somehow a game taking a lot of hard work means that criticism should be disregarded.  
Will Shen isn't even there to give them another Far Harbor.
That would be the end of their company, and that's what has me holding onto hope. They have enough good will to survive a bad Starfield. But if they ruin TES it's all over. The Starfield backlash will look tame by comparison and they have to know that.
"NoBoDy lEaVeS tHe FlEeT!"
Yeah Spaceman Spiff would never stoop so low
No, John Calvin from Calvinism.
Oh wa ah ah ah
I don't think it's the system's fault for that - the basic idea of "get a score of x or higher to succeed at persuasion, these dialog choices give y to the score automatically, these dialog choices give z to the score but are chancy" is fine. It's the writing of the prompts, the lack of appropriate consequences, and everything around the persuasion system that sucks.

Using social engineering to get someone to divulge a password is good and proper, but you need to make it actually make sense in the context of the world. The persuasion minigame itself can do that, but you need to write everything as if the characters aren't idiots and have some sort of consistency in order to work. Having the dialog be:

* Tell me the password.
* No, that would be stupid.
* Tell me the password please.
* Ok, but don't tell anyone

Or similar is... bad. Having the dialog be:

* Hi, I'm tech support for <company that built the safe>. We discovered a vulnerability with the safe and need to correct it. Can you tell me the password to authenticate your identity?
* You don't look like the normal tech support guy. What happened to him?
* Well, I shouldn't tell you this - but he ran off to join the Spacers. That's why we are re-auditing your account, making sure everything's OK.
* Oh, well, shit. Here's the password.

This would work better than what was described above.

(To be clear, I haven't played Starfield in months and I never did the Crimson Fleet quests so maybe the context of that particular conversation doesn't work for this, but the basic idea still applies)
I miss the guards going from 0 to 100 and then back to 0 in oblivion. *ITS ALL OVER LAW BREAKER!!!!!  OH MY MIstake it's all good, l8r queen!* As he heelies away from you.
Oblivion at least had charm even though it was janky. Starfield is just bland.
Bethesda needs to look at BG3 to see persuasion done well.
Post-Morrowind Bethesda is all dumbed-down bullshit because Xbox player base/sales became more important, leaving intelligent, patient gamers stuck in 1994 waiting everlong for a proper sequel.
I took the pill right after my first hours of playthrough or something like that, I had the whole "Parents" perk.  
While chatting with Noel she asked me where my parents were if I recall correctly ... they were ... right behind her, staring at me. 

That was comedy gold.  
She literally saw them 30seconds before.

I lost hope on anything beyond that, if even MAJOR characters aren't aware of themselves at the first moments of any playthrough.
BG3 benefits from having companions with actually complex personalities and consistent morals. Like Shadowheart worships an 'evil' God but respects helping people, but also respects shrewdness and cautiousness. All the companions in Starfield are just big ole goody two shoes
It's hilarious that the sims settlements guys make you feel more in charge in fallout 4
Tbf it’s a little hard to talk to a dead guy about how he left the fleet.

Doesn’t excuse a lack of environmental story telling mind you.
Not to mention how Vlad is former Crimson Fleet, and he talks it up like nobody ever leaves, but then the lady at Eleos isn't even trying to hide who and where she is, and in your first conversation with you she's like "Oh yeah, I used to be Crimson Fleet, now I'm Rehab Granny!"
I was in the Last Nova, maybe that made it safe?  Sarah was with me and I got a snide comment from her about "what are you doing" but that was it.
And even when you do decide to oppose them and end up fighting them both, nothing is different in the end.  You still step through the unity become starborn and boom, reset. That big choice you made had zero impact in the end.  You might as well just pick one so you only have one of them to fight.
Tbh I just mow down the Starborn in most cases before they even get a chance to shoot me. 

When I was playing, it was super easy to kill them since I had a lot of perks into weapon mods and space suit modifications. 

They should’ve just had us do an all out war against Ecliptic or Va’ruun at some huge open space station since much of the side quest seems to be that already. 

I really wish they made outpost building more immersive with a small about of settlers than can come to the base and perform different tasks. 

That alone would’ve made me come back and mess around with the game more. The only reason I stopped playing is because I didn’t see the point in many of the activities I was doing. 

It’s like how it was stated before, yeah I could do a good handful of things but none of them really was necessary or impacted the game world (to my liking).
starfield truly is the d b cooper of game narratives
Chunks?
[Oh gee, they're probably in the game folders my good sir!]
  
[I personally strangled every last line of dialogue.]
  
\> [duhh... i unno!]
FO4 definitely had some better writing at least to engender stronger emotions than Starfield. I remember in my first playthrough when I found Shawn, I mininuked us both and then started a new character.
i feel you, but i just started replaying FO3 and the writing is far better than FO4 or Starfield. At least the characters have personality, and there are *some* interesting dialogue choices for the player. Not sure what happened at Bethesda. NV will always be king though; i can’t even imagine what Obsidian could’ve done if given more resources and realistic time constraints.
In fact it had the same writer as Starfield. Same with Fallout 4. Emil Pagliarulo was lead on all of them.
Definitely depends on what you are trying to get out of it and how much time you have to play the game. A game with a great story but with gameplay that makes you feel like you are in an interactive movie with small todbits of action between cutscenes gets kind of tedious for me. DA:I and CP2077 make me feel this kind of way.
I'm sure each creator's situation is unique, so I can't generalize any of this, but an example of what I mean can be seen in some of the really big gaming youtubers (tens of millions of subs). I used to watch their videos and be able to sense some true excitement coming from them.

Now a bunch of them are in their 30's or 40's, and that excitement for each new game is totally gone. If anything, they're even better at *pretending* to be excited (AKA acting), but you can tell they just don't care about whatever they're playing. And yeah, they'll skip dialogue, cutscenes, and any other plot element that doesn't involve direct game mechanics.

When they see some scenario set up for them in a game, they categorize it easily into some bucket of well-known tropes, saying "oh, ok, one of these." And of course they do - they've played so many games they can't help but see the patterns. Yet, by doing this, some spark of actual enjoyment gets lost.

They can still make good content, don't get me wrong. I just think they serve as a poor representation of the gaming public.
>They've done this before, no reason they couldn't do it now.

There's a lot bgs used to do and doesn't anymore. Their history has pretty much been making games bigger and shallower with each iteration.
Same with Morrowind, albeit on a smaller scale.

Even when quests weren't mutually exclusive, there were still meaningful requirements behind the quests. Your dumb orc barbarian couldn't advance in the Mages Guild without actually spending a ton of resources studying magic - unlike, say, Skyrim, where you could become archmage while only knowing one or two spells.
This is my issue with NG+ In Starfield being a canon thing. I cannot think of a character that would be willing to go through the Unity who was not pursuing raw power at the expense of the entire universe.

Okay, there's one scenario: If something went catastrophically wrong during the playthrough. The issue is that you can reload and the writing is so shit that you can see the bad outcomes from a mile off. If there even IS a bad outcome, since Starfield is positively allergic to allowing the player to fail at anything or otherwise diverge from a very narrow path. That's always been true in their games, but NG+ really brings it into clear focus.

Also, NG+, by virtue of being the same character, means that you're gonna be playing the game in the same way again since you can't respec. It is, always, more mechanically interesting to play a new character because (since there aren't any story choices to make) the only meaningful impact you can have is mechanical via your perk progression. And the perk points come really fast in the early game.
Dont give them any ideas. If Fallout 4's protags weren't railroaded enough, imagine if they had full reign on the main characters. Lol please dear God, no.
No design documents? Are you serious? Oh boy, that explains a lot.
What’s a design document?
Yeah, I agreed with everything you said. Skyrim not being gods gospel in quest design, still made it seem like you were an active participant in the quest. Thalmor embassy quest i think you're talking about.

I don't know what the point was of doing all the ground work, of vetting the area, purchasing security etc, if Walter is just going to railroad me into paying this man because it's so important he live and we cause no violence, only to choose prison or death for  him later. They had to shoehorn the negotiation so they could present a "moral" dilemma later in their quest. Fake moral dilemma because you work with a group of saints who are all lawful good.
Just one of the many quests that made me not do a NG+ and moved on to Cyberpunk
That’s actually the point I was making haha. Someone replied to my post not long ago saying you can turn him into the UC security or something but that wasn’t the exploiting I was hoping for.
Oh yeah, that was my first reaction. I figured there would be some consequence to it... but no. It's not even an option. Like really? Someone wrote that bit and figured no player would want to facilitate a hostile takeover? 

Pretty typical experience in this game though, tbh.
Remember how the Paarthurnax choices were bullshit in Skyrim? I am looking forward to the Mod that lets you make it clear that you will murder the holy shit out of the Board and anyone else who argues with you about how the situation is going to be handled. Or the ability to interrupt the conversation by shooting one of them dead and asking how they like the choices you offer them?
Based on my observations of people talking about the game. Regill invariably ends up on top of the pack in pretty much every discussion I've seen of the game across multiple subreddits.

Perhaps I should have clarified 'in my experience'. Your mileage may however vary.
the engine doesn't solve nearly everything but its obvious the creation engine has run its course, unless they have a whole bunch of shitty animators and they literally need to just clean house and get new and improved talent
You are right, its not like their writing was ever really top notch but it was serviceable. i just feel in starfield its probably at the laziest level of writing possible.

&#x200B;

Like a lot of people have pointed out, I think the procedural generation really hurt them. People want the handcrafted stuff from Bethesda. Add the millions of loading screens and it really breaks any sort of immersion you could have. It's disjointed completely
In the war, we had awesome mech war robots and swarms of deadly alien xenoweapons! Too bad you'll only meet half a dozen of these aliens vs the thousand of human grunts you'll have to mow down. And never see a functioning mech, because you know it makes sense to ban a tank on legs when we have space warships with huge cannons and missiles.

*sigh* what could have been...
at least the club is popping. oh wait....
I’ll be getting to BG3 soon, looking forward to it!
BG3 is a seriously great game. I wish your character would actually say the lines you choose too tho.
Gun customization and méchas were the one made fallout 4 tolerable.
Apparently the hats are from astronauts' suits, it's the skull cap like in [this picture.](https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss054e022341/iss054e022341~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1280&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint) Like there's more to religions than "we believe in a vaguely-Christian God but we're a new religion and we're going to all start wearing these funny hats because our new religion is set in space."

It doesn't make sense.
>reads like it was written by a casual atheist

Absolutely. Matteo reads as a caricature of a religious person written by said atheist.

It doesn't even make sense that Earth religions would have died out. Honestly if humans have been out there settling the galaxy and still haven't found any life that's equivalent to humanity, while finding loads of animals and plants? I think it would only encourage Abrahamic believers. Man was made in the image of God and there's still no one else like that in the known universe, seems like that situation would support their beliefs.

I guess the devs were in a tough spot though. They'd draw criticism if they used existing religions, and they couldn't leave religion out because questions of religious belief belong in a story like the one they wrote.
The guy that sends you on the quest to go check on her is very concerned when he sends you out about her well-being and how she’s always getting into trouble. 

You get there, rescue her, and she asks you not to tell the dude that she was in danger. I say “sure, I gotchu”

She becomes my companion, I go back to the dude’s space station with her. Not only does he not even notice that she is there with me… he DOESNT EVEN ASK IF SHES OKAY OR WHAT HAPPENED.
I had to remind myself she’s a smuggler, not a thief, or robber. They could’ve forefronted her moral motivations more, but her intro of taking life and feeling guilty, or judged for it…that’s bad for any character in games like this.

We’re literally gonna take on dozens, if not hundreds of foes. It’s an immersion breaker.

**I still like her character**
But, I miss some earlier companions in BGS’ catalogue by comparison.
This is why I don't have much hope. Shattered Space is extremely likely, if not guaranteed to be more of the same.  
  
But you said it right there, and you're 100% correct. The problem is very simple, and it's that Bethesda just doesn't have very talented people working for them any more. I'm not trying to be overly harsh or insulting, but at the end of the day that's the core reason we got what we got, and that's the core reason they've been progressively getting worse as the years go by.
Yea for sure. In my opinion all the tes games have been really good to. But it just feels like they are getting lazy or something is going on. Fallout 4 to me wasn't the best. Then there was fallout 76 which wasn't great. Now starfield. Just seems like thing have been going down hill for awhile now. But if they can pull off a amazing tes 6 that's what is important now and hopefully they see that too.
*Hides Vladimir*
Spaceman spiff would never be so goddamn boring
Yeah, gets confusing. Fun fact, one of those two was named after the other.
Damned if I do, damned if I don't.
They need to hire you. You’d do well. Take this here token of my appreciation since awards don’t exist anymore. 🥇
[deleted]
Totally agreed. But they dont even write it out in Starfield, much of the time. It goes like this:

* tell me the password
* no that would be stupid
* see it my way?
* no
* im sure we can work something out
* no
* you're starting to come around
* yes, here is the password

Like, they dont even write out specific dialog for specific events half the time?! They just use generic, recycled BS that is supposed to make it seem like you're negotiating without actually writing any of the dialogue out based on the context of the situation, like you said. Disappointing af, imo
Monkey Island 2 has a better persuasion mechanic than Starfield. Pretty, pretty please with a cherry on top, with sprinkles.
Also, Oblivion came out nearly 2 decades ago. It should be fucking janky. Starfield has no excuse.
Shit, they need to look at their own past work in Fallout to see persuasion that was at least passable, less so with 4 but Far Harbor was great. If Starfield is making Fallout 4's base dialogue system look good, we have a serious problem. Some say Microsoft forced them to delay for quality, some say the opposite, I haven't looked into it, but it seems like someone allowed unedited rough drafts to reach shelves.
I love BG3, it's my game of the year, but I very much disagree. A D20 dice roll with modifiers isn't exactly groundbreaking. It's been around since CRPGs have been around, and there's a reason it hasn't really spread outside of the genre.

Not to mention, it's really frustrating to just have a flat 5% chance to fail, no matter what, unless you have advantage.
So being able to persuade a guard to let you go after you burned their friend alive is good persuasion ?
That parents perk is worth it. They keep showing up randomly, even showed up in the club in Neon.
One of the perks i took was being raised in one of the churches and i honestly have zero idea what impact, if any, it had on my playthrough.
And they're all in lockstep in regards to major quest decisions.
e.g. they all prefer the microbe to the Aceles and want the Lazarus plant wiped out.

Admittedly, though, I _was_ able to get Sam to see things from my perspective.

Sarah actually said the thing, IIRC: "Trust the science."
I still enjoy Fallout 4 for at least the eye catching world, but damn it sounds like they even fucked that up in Starfield. They really are a decade behind in terms of game development
it seems Andreja really wants to divorce, each time i do something she starts yapping. so much for being a spy from an "evil" fraction.
And if you walk away the game as much as tells you that you made the wrong decision by telling you to come back later. And the MQ just pauses.
Settlements kept me playing Fallout 4.
Make sure you get some extra sauce!
I don’t watch any let’s play people or whatever and I wasn’t responding to that. I was responding to you saying “People who actually still enjoy gaming don’t skip through the dialogue”.
Agreed, for everything after Daggerfall. That was the one the time they took a step up. Everything after that has been "simpler" or "more accessible".

Though Morrowind's world building did take the series a step up out of generic fantasy, everything else about it was degraded.
Isn’t it technically possible to do it with 0 spells, just shouts? 

Either way, it’s ridiculous that the requirement for being the god damn arch made is knowing the 3 most basic fire/cold/lightning spells, one of which you start with and another is in the tutorial dungeon
Yes. He's very proud of that fact. He's also very proud of ignoring all criticism.
When you work on a project with hundreds of people you use something called design documents to coordinate basic characteristics of your final product. 

Design documents in games cover basic things like setting, genre, and tone to more advanced things like how different systems should interact with each other. This way large departments and teams working on different parts of the game don’t work in a vacuum. This allows them to mesh together and not seem like two random things bolted together. 

Emil P said it is too much work to constantly update design documents during game development. Which is horrifying since they are a necessity for any project with hundreds of team members. Eschewing them is hubris and incompetence.
"Oh, you want me to murder everyone on a colony ship who have been on the way here for 200 years? Nah, I think this resort is under new management."

"Hey ECS Constant, I've secured your planet... and it comes with a great turn-key business to make modern day credits!"
There's a point in the game where a dialogue option is explicitly "I'm gonna kill you and shoot my way out of here" and you're surrounded by like five named, essential NPCs. It's a fucking joke lmao. You can't kill the NPCs the game just gave you the option of killing...like I almost thought it was a bug at first
No, while your comment in general is overall agreeable, please refrain from shouting engine switch without understanding anything about game development and what such a choice would entail.

The creation engine has many advantages that make it suitable for a game like this, which would be monumental to move to a different engine.

I think CE is fine, but Starfield really would have needed emil not being involved at all.

Refusing to have a central design document is so strongly reflected in this game.
I like settlement building too ngl
That's a great point lol. So many missions were set up like there would be some big issue to resolve or lasting consequences. And they all just fizzle out to nothing. 

The mission with the humans in the colony ship, for example. The captain is like "There's absolutely no way we're leaving. We had a claim on this planet first and nothing is gonna change our minds." So I go talk to the board members and they're like "Fuck those people. This is our planet. Give em a jump drive." And then I don't even have to talk to the captain again! It just becomes another fucking fetch quest and the captain is suddenly completely fine with abandoning the planet.

It's like the mission statement for the game was to ensure that every main and side mission somehow becomes a fetch quest. We can't possibly just have a dramatic story evolve with difficult choices and moral dilemmas. Nope. Just go get me something and that'll solve the problem.
I think the bigger evidence is the captain following you on the lock (forgot his name) he kicks out if you snotch him. Technically wasnt "in" already, but with such an "noone leaves alive" i would suspect everyone not fit for the fleet but applying getting gutted and their stuff seized.
I think Spiff created the Terrormorphs with his Transmogrifier.
How about they look at the non-Bethesda Fallouts? lol. 1, 2, and NV
I meant for writing and how to use persuasion within a narrative, not the mechanics of it.
The options you have for persuasion in BG3 actually make sense, they were written by professionals that cared deeply for the characters, their motivations, and their personalities. Contrast that with Starfield where the writers clearly didn't give a rats ass about anything more than allowing the player a way to succeed in every situation, regardless of its ridiculousness, with the least amount of effort from them as possible.

It's not at all about the probabilities of success, or how they are determined, and for fucks sake, if it was about that the Starfield mechanism is the most hamfisted nonsense I've ever seen, it's not as if they were onto something great mechanically and just failed at the writing, if they had just done a D20 system it certainly wouldn't have been worse. The problem is that they failed utterly in every category.
Eh, depending on your difficulty level you can mitigate that 5% with inspiration. At the lowest difficulty it's more like 1 in 32 million.
It's not about the underlying system, it's about how the persuasion dialogues are written
I need more context than that. It depends what is said, how it is said, etc.

Also, some games make it purposely humorous.
That was my favorite Park to use, it pairs perfectly with the UC perk. 

So I kind of wish that if you picked the lone Star collective your parents home should have been at akiva city.
I did serpent's embrace perk and any time there is a quest involving Va'ruun I get an extra dialogue option. Once I encountered hostile Va'ruun ships and it gave me the option to recite a prayer thing over comm and they left us alone. I am guessing its similar for the others.
Especially when it came to the whole using a pathogen that would have been tailored to the thing that turns into a terramorph, even though there's a 1% chance the disease could end up jumping to humans.
Yep. FO4 world was interesting to explore.  Starfield doesn't even have that.
Sarah, Sam, and Vasco are my only companions so far.  I haven't really played any of the story to get anyone else.  I usually play without them too but I wanted the cheevo for maxing one out.
Yeah same here just something to mess around with and highly customizable. They did this before idk why they cut so many corners. 

Who wants a small outpost with only like 3 people and robots?? lol come on man.
Oh I see - yeah, we were already in agreement then. Playing a different game would qualify as taking a break from some game you're burned out on.

Although I think sometimes that can lead to just flipping through games quickly without being invested in them, because that's happened to me before, but that's maybe a minor detail.
Appreciate the info, that does seem like an incredibly stupid thing to not do lmao. The entire game reeks of a lack of consensus regarding the basic theme of the story. It’s a game with absolutely nothing to say about anything writing wise
Yep. Obvious. You (I'm assuming not a paid writer) just wrote a better scenario on a Reddit thread. There needs to be a hostile takeover at Bethesda.
The ship building in this game was really cool. Everything else, pretty prehistoric and done bad. Never said changing engines would fix everything and understand the creation engine allows for their system involving items and how complex that can get. They just need a better team. It’s great they all have worked together for many many years but they need to get real here. The industry is way ahead of them at this point. They are stuck in a whole different time.
I mostly do battle Royale with settlement building.
The stupidest thing is (besides the inability to feed lead to the board) that there's no option to persuade both sides to just allow the colonists to share and settle at the other side of the planet. It's a planet. It's HUGE, we're not talking about sharing a town or even a province sized area like Skyrim. Heck, if the Constant had just landed on the other side of the planet, I doubt the board would've even noticed. I'm sure pirates and other undesirables do it all the time even on planets controlled by UC/FSC.
I laughed at how stupid that quest was. Either I get punished or I have to punish these people. I chose to punish the people since there were no consequences, lol.
Wild guess: Like survival, DLC/paid content.

I mean, I hope they didn't decide to just not have complex settlements ever.
That quest had so much potential. Just spitballing off my head:

\-Kill the colonists

\-relocate colonists

\-enslave colonists

\-kill the corporation

\-blackmail the CEO

\-police action attempted slavery

\-legalese with the old claim

\-settle the colonists and run their trade and supply through the corporation

\-halfsies on the planet (seriously, this one bugged me in real time doing the quest. its an entire planet, just how fast are either of these groups planning on growing? they'll have like 200 years or more to work things out properly)
Oh the engine is most definitely not up to expectable standard, especially with them calling it CE2, but I'm not gonna pretend i know better than the devs and make an absolute statement on whether it's better to update CE2 or switch engines entirely, the devs accustomed to the source are the ones who could make an informed decision on this. 

The problem is that they didn't work *together* on the game. 
They all worked on different parts of the game in seperate teams and the result is an incoherent product.
Thanks Emil for refusing to have a central design document.

I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this but i don't care:

After closing the game for good and deciding I'm done with the bullshit i went on YouTube to see some other perspectives.

A guy named PatricianTV made an 8 hour long analysis and after watching it (across multiple days) i understood why the game is the way it is.
I disagree with him on some points, i have some points to add, but overall it's such a well collected essay that BGS should take to heart.

I truly hope BGS learns from this after failing twice in a row and goes back to making the kind of games that caused us to fall in love with them in the first place.

The way they used to craft a believable but funky world was always something special, it's entirely missing now.
This really feels so dumb throughout the game - all this talk about humanity settling new planets and systems, and for what? Even New Atlantis is a village compared to most cities on Earth. Abandoned outposts and mining rigs every few miles on a planet's surface, but no other notable infrastructure. Advances in every aspect of technology, but seemingly no need to house people. Is everyone a megamillionaire traveling the stars, or just sterile?

Both the resort board and the colonists act like oblivious hoarders - if the Constant colonised, say, on the opposite beach of the lake and established resource gathering, wouldn't they benefit from the resort bringing in trade and people? Similarly the board could hire new staff and get agriculture delivered by the local colonists instead of hiring and importing across the stars. And if it'd be more cheap to do that instead, why want the entire planet for themselves in the first place?
Yeah we gotta see what these DLCs and updates are like. They said they are fixing traveling in the game but they would have to overhaul everything.

The issues are so deep..
My 2 cents as some with a decade of experience managing and advising on software projects:

An engine switch is a monumental change, especially for an organisation which has spent over a decade building the tooling around it. 

There would need to be a very serious cause for such a decision. From my experience there are only few that could justify it:

* licensing costs
   * E.g. if parts of the engine are not developed in-house. I doubt that would be the case for CE
* legal
   * Again, not a concern for CE
* evaporating experience pool
   * As in people with experience with the tech are becoming difficult to find. Again- unlikely to be a concern.
* suitability for future projects
   * If the stack is completely unsuitable for future projects, we could consider replacing it.
   * However, this raises the question of why that project is being taken on?

The main problems I see with Starfield, seem to stem from design, more so than any technical limitations. I think Starfield could have been made to look and feel more like Cyberpunk- at the end of the day it's just a case of scripting, animations and some better writing.

But it wasn't designed to be that way. It was designed to be easily made with the existing pipelines BGS already has, and to be easily marketable.
I mean yeah, you can't have a group of teams just work on one thing and then throw it all together. Maybe thats why it feels it has the less soul out of any bethesda game, excluding 76 because I just don't even count that game anymore. It's maddening. Like I said, I enjoyed Starfield but this team needs a fire lit underneath them. 76 got put out and was absolute trash. I know it has a community and people like it now but lets not forget the release and overall what its there for which is money. They spent years also just throwing skyrim masters everywhere hence the memes. Then we get Starfield and its just extremely underwhelming and I just don't know if they will ever recapture the magic that was Skyrim.
[deleted]
They can’t even put vehicles in the game.  Load screens everywhere.  And you think there aren’t technical limitations?
The people that like 76 are the same kind of people that like fortnite.
Very low standards and not much going on in the noggin
I keep forgetting that dumpster fire exists.
Dude your logic skipped some data. 

I've played the game and noticed the design language being all over the place and quests existing in their own little void. 
Even the different UI's have different design languages. 

Then i found out there was no central design document and simply put 2+2 together, it's pretty damn clear what happened here. 

It's an informed conclusion and allows me to make a statement, just like determining that i don't know enough about CE to certainly say whether continued development or switching to a different engine is the better choice.
Introduced my Mom to Starfield's Outposts, she came up with this.
My Mom doesn't play videogames, but expressed some interest at being able to build a house and outpost, especially on a beach. 

Upon finding a suitable place, I built the two habs at her requested spot, and pretty much gave her the reins as far as decoration. Had to tactically aquire (steal) a lot of misc items, and she needed a lot of assistance, but this was the end result! She is very proud of it.

Just wanted to share, and it's cool to think I'll have a save that I can go back to and remember time spent fondly with family.

Look after your loved ones, folks.

The centered bed is a bold choice, but I love it!
Your mom needs to design my base. Get her a twitch and she can watch and tell people where to put shit.
Holy crap, that’s spectacular!
Which planet?

And it should be mentioned you can launder your items at Trade Authority, they'd no longer appear as stolen
Very tasteful modern styling
I don't even know how to put inventory items on tables and shit
Go mom!
That bedroom is stunning
I really want a multiplayer mode so I can build our own house with my mates… pretty like Minecraft lol
Can I hire her to work on my outposts? That looks awesome
My mom thinks Starfield is a movie, based on only seeing the trailer.
Post this in /r/NoSodiumStarfield.

/r/Starfield is dedicated to hating the game.
Some people just have a gift for it. She did a great job!
Let her know there is still work to be done and more to build! I want to see the kitchen next personally.
Very tastefully decorated. Shout out to your mom.
Your Mom is very talented with fine sense of interior design. I'm extremely impressed and she has every right to be very proud.

Have you introduced her to the ship builder yet? I'm curious what she coms up with, tag me if she decides ship design is something interesting.
Your mom just said in a universal language that i am pretty lame at outpost decoration, damm she's an artist, pretty great job.
Your mom is going to love The Sims
I think as gamers sometimes we lose the wonder of what is possible now.  

To give someone an ability to build an environment and create a meaningful "home" that hasn't been focused on "finishing" games can remind us that sandbox-style games have a ton to offer that a lot of us miss.

The equivalent of real-world stopping to smell the roses.
Nice, looks like your lights don't work either. Can't stand the lighting at my outpost. I have to use my headlamp all the time.
Wow I am seriously blown away
Very dope. Keep us informed as to how her first adventure into space and other celestial bodies and experiences goes!
That is awesome. 

Also outposts need better lighting. You shouldn’t need a flashlight in your own home.
Very well done.
This is wholesome af and I love it ♥️
Your mother done great work 👍🏻
This is awesome. Go mom!
Very nice.
Amazing! Mine are literally just stacks of crates and workstations.
I would kill five people to be able to live there.
* clap clap clap * x 1000
Man, if she isn't in home design already, she should be!
Legit awesome story, thanks for sharing!
Bruh, I have my teenage daughter design all my hab areas. It's an amazing bonding experience.  Otherwise, she'd be playing sims, and I'd be starting my 3rd 100 hr character...
Mom has exquisite taste.  I personally loved the wall shelf bar, that was a nice touch 👌🍸
Awesome. However, I'm gonna have to take points off for no Space Frog™ posters.  Have your mom talk to the little girl in the residential zone of Cyndonia on Mars.
Looks amazing! She got mad talent
That's beautiful.
Infadools mom ..... got it ...going on!
Your mom needs to make a ‘starfield interior design’ business. I hate the base decorating controls in starfield vs decorating/building in NMS
Years of watching HGTV, over 200 hours in a single universe, tons of outposts, and I still can’t decorate as good as your mom. Who is this woman?
I bet your mom is HAWT!
thats the best ad for the game
That is hilariously awesome.
I really have not scratched the surface of this video game in the least bit. This video just proves it.. great job place looks beautiful
Ha! Looks like I built on the same spot -- on that shore (forget the planet at the moment).

Very nice.

Does your mom free-lance -- I need a decorator...?
Your mom set up a great outpost.
That’s beautiful, mate. Your mum is really good at base building.
Now I gotta find where in the galaxy I made my outpost, that is mostly easy with the icons on the starmap
 You should show her The Sims, she might really like it
You have a cool AF Mom!
That’s a dope ass outpost.
Absolutely lovely. This is the sort of thing I always set out to do but I get too frustrated.
Your mom is a queen 👸🏽
she has excellent taste!
Inside, lights on, sun still up,  and still have to use a flashlight to see the walls.
Ok, so it's not just me who has to turn on a flashlight in order to see a wall in a well lit room.
Very well done
Part of why I don't bother with player housing like this it's torture that I can't actually go and live there for real. I want to experience these environments so badly, to feel and smell them. I want to hang out and get cozy watching the alien sunset, and a game will just never quite fill the void.
Interior designers do be having a field day with games like this.
Your mom is incredibly talented. I can rock out an incredible Deimos battle cruiser in ship builder, no problem, but decorating my New Atlantis apartment or organizing an outpost is beyond my comprehension. Tell her that I said her setup is an inspiration.
Dang it, I’ve been playing this game since it came out and I still haven’t found a coastline spot like this for an outpost, haha.  I check every world people mention in their posts and no luck.  The outpost looks awesome, still!
This is fantastic! She picked a great spot with a view like that. 🌊
Your mom has some good interior designing taste
You can put beds and other nonsense in the habs? Man I need to start building outposts 😂
This is amazing. I hate how people try to make you hate the game... Im in 100 hours and it's one of my favorite games.
How long did it take?
Now that is one sexy outpost
Wow—is that listed on AirBNB? SIGN ME UP! Actually, scratch that—I’m moving in!

I guess it would be SpaceBNB.
Starfield is the new Animal Crossing, confirmed
My mum is the same. I introduced her to Minecraft back when I was a teenager and she’s been playing it ever since. She builds absolutely amazing builds that just belittle anything I’ve ever done
Are outposts stable now? I don't want to build and populate my dream home if it's going to bug out later.
amazing :)
I’ve been searching for a suitable “tropical” island for the last 4 hours. Just finding water on most of these planets has been rough but finding a coastline that is also filled with palm trees or a tropical aesthetic has been a nightmare. I’ve switched to fully scanning planets now since I basically 100% scanned the biomes closest to the coasts on like 10 planets lol. But this is awesome man, this is exactly how I pictured my view form my bedroom too. She nailed it.
Tell your mom she’s got good tastes in design. I like it. I’m also impressed because placing and manipulating objects in this game isn’t easy and is a real pain in the ass.
That's not a good job. That's an EXCELLENT JOB! Woowweee!
Nah she snapped the paintings & the books & cups
My mom died 5 years ago today.
She did well... is she single?
I very much feel that Stanfield plays very well with the elderly. Like I'm not even kidding most people who truly enjoy it seem to be 50 or above
I don't understand how anyone has the patience to organize inventory items in their outpost.
I’ve been commenting on multiple posts about how we need a Starfield Marketplace, and this is why. I would pay you (or your mom)  somewhere in the range of 350,000 credits for this abode. Willing to negotiate
That's so cool!
Great outpost. The indoor lighting system sure doesn’t do this game any justice huh.
I wanna fuck there
I like how the star's reflection on the water implies that it's low on the horizon, but then there's no star.
....this is why we let women decorate the house and not men.
I bet this would look more awesome without the ugly yellow filters in Starfield
i hate the lighting in starfield. it SUCKS
How do you add furniture into the outpost? Lol

I built an outpost but am confused about decorating. Lol

I could probably google but I want to hear from the expert.
Small vibes from the movie Oblivion. Very clean
I wish I was creative like that. My outposts are so bare bones, even in fallout 4 😆
Holy heck that is awesome, your mom has great taste, i would let her design a house for me any day!
Very nice, but how in the heck do you have those little items on those shelves?!?
Can she do my house?
I love her style. Your mom has a great sense for interior design. Looking forward to her future builds.
TIL someone’s mom who doesn’t game is better than me at outpost building fml
Damn mom really out did herself
This man definitely picked the Kid Stuff trait
That’s one of the best outposts and beach views I’ve seen in this sub, your Mom really has an eye for it!
It's so beautiful.
Your mum is a fantastic interior designer 👌
I need to get my mother designing my outpost for me as well
Your Mom should certainly be proud!
Bro playing starfield with his mom like it's the Sims. Did this game have any memorable moments??
I want your mom
So, basically your mom founded the next Paradiso.
I’d live here.
This is amazing! Can your mom come decorate my outposts like that? 🤪
You should find her more games that let you build stuff, creator games are very fun but also can be such a great way to make creative/artistic stuff
Uhhh... your mom should consider taking some courses on game level design. Serious talent there.
Your mother has really great taste! I’d do pretty much the same thing if I had an outpost right on the beach. We should do a twitch run by Mums or Dads (or both) where we tell players where to place their furniture, or where to get the best items and do a “best outpost design” of the week by a player. Best twitch stream ever!
Looks amazing! She definitely has talent. :) What world did you build on?
does your mom accept commissions for outpost layout jobs?

this is really beautiful and looks lived in.
Can I borrow your mom as a decorator to do mine? I have 0 taste
never underestimate a power of organization from a mom
Go mom!
Super chic… your mom has a good eye and it’s super cool she was interested to join in.
Your mom has good feng shui.
I think your mom is a house flipper
I still don’t know how to put stuff on shelves
Starfield Interior Designer.
oh it's beautiful!!
That's cozy af
Does she work in interior design, holy hell!?
How do you get that kind of bed?  All my bed options are singles and no where as nice as that bed.
Wait how did you get the rug under the coffee table in the first room? I won’t let me place rugs under things (on Xbox). Looks very nice btw, the location & view is 10/10
Nice. Does she play  SIMs?
Is your mom an interior designer? Because this is beautiful!
I want to visit your Mom's house.
Stunning outpost.

Need to get the window washers in though!
Does your ma want to reno my gaff?
Tell your mom she did a great job, and that I can pay good credsticks if she’s looking for a job, my outpost is not far from Jemison, I can arrange transportation. I wish I could show a luxurious ship but it’s still not available ffs.
I guess you won't be crossing over anytime soon?
The outpost is nice, but did you look at this post's URL link?
I love this game but I know for sure I will never have the patience to do even one of these rooms!
Kudos to your mom for doing it. Mine hasn't touched a video game console since the old sega where she was the only one to being able to finish a game out of all of us.
Can your Mom build me a base, please
What planet?
"nobody help me in this outpost!"
How do you move items that can be picked up?
How do you place items so neatly on the desks and tables?
I don't get it. Moms who don't even necessarily play video games end up creating the best places. I gave my mom a switch with animal crossing and without ever playing a video game made the coziest island I've ever seen.
Too bad Medow couldn't park like that
Welcome to Tralfamadore, Mr. Pilgrim.
How do you make those „all glass“ habs?
Yo can I hire ur mom lmao
Is that Eridani II?
this is pulled straight from a sci-fi movie scene layout from an older movie. Its a romance scene which makes sense.
Mom’s gonna mom
As a mom who loves building outposts, I highly enjoy this :)
She insisted not to have it up against a wall lol. In the end though, I agree with her choice
I'm more fixated on the table at the foot of the bed.



I'd be knocking that shit down in the middle of the night as I fidget with the blankets.
I did the same thing. When you're up that high no-one can see in.
This has a lot of YouTube money potential right here.
That's the secret - it's not OP's mum
Thank you, I'd say she did a pretty good job.
Syrma IV. And that's alright, they were going straight back to the outpost anyways
Somehow, the word "launder" appearing in this discussion about mom, home and decorating had me picturing OP's mom doing laundry in-game, just for a split second. Couldn't help but smile.
Drop them anywhere on the floor, enter outpost mode and pick them up. Alternatively you can just hold the pick up button until the float like in skyrim
If ur on PC hold "E". If ur on console, hold whatever the "action" button is.

U can also rotate the items on x,y,z axis by holding "shift". Dont know what the cosole version of that is tho. 

U can also pick up and drag bodies around.
That would wholesome
I wouldn't mind a NMS-ish multiplayer mode. Not completely the same if they did it right, I could see something similar working.
Creation club could allow players to share their house through the donload of a cell. Basically, since outposts are built in cells on the planet, nothing stops your from uploade it as a separate unique "mod".

The same should be done with Ship builds.

This way, Creation club could skyrocket into the Sun.
If only there was a multiplayer space sandbox where you could build, fight, and explore with your friends.
Was thinking my living room, but same sentiment. She has a great eye.
I think the hate is slowly vanishing from this sub, it's much better than it used to be.
That is actually in progress! More of a cafe, actually
Thanks, and I certainly will!
Yes lol.
I'm sorry for your loss
It is definitely an exercise in patience.
You have to do some outpost research to get the nice stuff.
BY AZURA BY AZURA BY AZURA!
Definitely keeping this save, lot of sentimental value
My wife told me one time that the richer you are, the further your furniture is from the walls lol
This is the actual Bread and Butter of the game once creation kit hits its going to be a great sim
Funny, I seem to remember clearly that your mom liked it up against the wall.. Well well...
Yes... wouldn't want no banging against the wall. I wouldn't ask your mum why she made that choice...
is that like a tall person thing? I'm 5'4 and every bed I've ever slept in has fit me comfortably.
You'd think that, but I have yet to actually knock anything over irl.
This! This comment here…. Agree, agree and agree!
Shut up and take my credits!
It’s not an Outpost. It’s an OutHome.
Surely
Does your mom know they're stolen lol? She'd probably make you buy new stuff
Haha same. But I also wanted to imply OP should launder their own stuff, instead of making mom do it lol
[deleted]
Obviously Terraria /s
Is there an obvious choice? I’m asking earnestly.
[deleted]
I meant like what are the actual controls to decorate?

I'd imagine I go inside into the outpost, in the room where I would put the furniture.

But how do I add the furniture?

The only way I've seen to be able to edit the outpost is go outside and go up to the thing and press the button to edit.

Not sure I could reach it from inside. Anyway, I'm certain this is something really dumb I'm doing or maybe I'm just not seeing the option yet because I need more research.
“You ain’t rich if your couch touches the wall”
I have heard this from rich people who's furniture was far away from the wall
That's just non mafia lies, always have your back to a wall!
360 glass walls add to this effect
if thats the case my shi is INSIDE da mf wall
Wait this actually tracks I think from Watching Selling Sunset and Selling OC on Netflix lol
I'm 6'3 and I would knock everything off that table at night with my blanket. On top of that half of my feet are hanging off the edge when I sleep on my stomach (that's actually pretty comfy as long as it isn't freezing), so that hard and cold table there would annoy the hell out of me quickly.

"Sunken" beds with a hard rim around them are a nightmare for me, as well as bunk beds in hostels (worst offender so far had me touching the top and bottom boards at the same time and laying on my stomach was impossible)... Or that one Italian pension where half my lower leg was hanging out while my head was banging against the wall (I dunno where they even managed to get "normal" beds that short).
Glad you didn't say outhouse....
Lol she is aware, it's safe to say I enjoy the piracy more than her
I actually imagined a little scene like when a grown kid comes home for the weekend, except in this case it's more like, "So, now you've done Unity and you're extra powerful, but you can't wash that spacer blood out of your own clothes?"
My only issue in build mode is placing things on shelves or side by side. I can easily do that now I've figured out how to rotate stuff by selecting it to carry.
Huh, TIL.
Wherever I place things in build mode they sink halfway into whatever furniture is under them -_-
But half the time if I place them in regular mode they fall through into furniture after a few visits
Nah, Starbound! /S
No man's sky.
Empyrion.

Space Engineers.

Dual Universe.
Yeah this lol

I thought it was funny that the sun was blasting into the room, even if it was setting, and OP still needed to turn on a flashlight to see things
How dare you criticize starfield? Wishing things were better? What a cesspool this place is.
I don't think that's sodium. Smallish, but legit issue. I'm constantly surprised at how dark and shadowed everything looks in my glass hand at mid day.
Yeah, you have to interact with the outpost beacon to get to the furniture menu. Lots of back and forth
Aw fuck I’m double poor
My mother had to sit facing the entryway of any restauraunt we were ever in. I managed to pick up on this habit.
Same, I hit my heels on the footboard of my bed constantly.  if you are 6'3 or taller you have to sleep at a 45 degree even on a king size.  I sleep on my side to mostly tuck and try not to slam my head or feet into things at night.  Thats difficult when your natural sleep paralysis doesnt always work 100%...
OutHome is where the OutHouse is.
"🙄🙄🙄 all the guys at Red Mile have stains mom, GEEZ"
[deleted]
[deleted]
You don't have to run to the beacon every time, just activate your scanner anywhere within the bounds of your outpost then press "R" to enter outpost mode, then "tab" to enter build mode.
What does it say about me that my bed touches three walls at once?
Idk why, but I read that in my head with an ozzy accent, and it really gives it that 😚🤌 muah that it needed
Mine does that in both modes. I do get a kick out of seeing my coffee cups only handle up 😅
Hah yeah that’s definitely true. Some areas are just really dark for no reason
I'm on xbox, no keyboard, I'll try the scanner in the building and see if I see some option. Thank you
It says you sleep in a cupboard.
It says your sheets are a pain to change.
Also on Xbox, this would be a glorious feature
Under the stairs
Just wrap yourself in the sheets instead of your bed. Easy.
Who has money for sheets?
Ur a wizard harry
In New York
You're doing too much, just cut a hole into the mattress and shimmy inside.
We use towels around here
I'm a wot?
Next to the laundry machine
Brianbtoe is the thirstiest 47 year old Tiktok Dad in the United States
Man. Look at him.
Can I sue you for showing me that? I want to try.
[How do you do fellow kids?](https://tenor.com/bD4oM.gif)
Holy shit, that entire channel is pure concentrated cringe.
I can't stand this fucker.
Fucking mall grabber
He must hate the fact that one of all the many things higher than his subscriber count is his hairline
I have a second tik tok account and that FYP is just full of stuff just like this. It's so sad how pathetic and simp-y they look. Stuff like....." Nobody wants to date me bc I'm 43 and own my own house, have no debt and I'm a police officer". Or " I'm ready to send those 'good morning' texts". 

I like to comment on the videos" wait a second I know you, your wife is friends with my wife!". 

They get BIG MAD and it amuses me greatly.
This seems like ragebait and OP is advertising his social media
Yeah, I'm not clicking on that and polluting my YT algo.
Of course he mall grabs his board too. What a dork
Goddamn it, now my YT algorithm will be fucked up.  I know multiple dudes like this and they’re the kind of people who creep on 19 year olds in bars then get banned for being creepers.  Nothing cringier than a middle aged thirsty dude creeping out folks.   Ugh.  
Gunnertvlive did a great YouTube on him lol he's so God damn cringy.
What’s sad is that he’s actually quite attractive and could probably easily find a partner if he weren’t such a dweeb for the whole world to see.
Who the fuck is this?
Post "Ain't that the #truth #vibes #facts #brianbtoe":

"My grandmother always said 'a coochie isn't shaped like a wallet for no reason' 💀"
He's live right this very moment and it's so, so, so cringe
Yeah, this is definitely going to be deleted from my watch history. I don't need the algorithm going anywhere near this.
Also, his humour is just… not it.

Keep in his mind he’s divorced and then he makes jokes about killing his wife. Hilarious /s

https://m.youtube.com/shorts/7nFxCh-vGTw 
OP why you calling yourself out like that, broseph?
Just wait till the Millennials are all in their 40s lol
Bro you're gen X. you're stuck in a generation that's just desperately trying to avoid adopting a boomer mentality.
Honestly it’s the same level of content that MrBeast puts out. Whatever gets views is what gets published
[deleted]
This is somehow the least cringe reel of his.
Seizure inducing video.
Jesus
Damn with the mall grab and everything
I think we could get a class action going
Right? I wasn't even thinking I was going to be giving BeetleToe a view. FU OP.
Can I serve the summons?
I want in
Right? I wasn't even thinking I was going to be giving BeetleToe a view. Come on OP.
Class action
Some ain’t bad. They ain’t good, but they ain’t bad.
[deleted]
Beat me to it.
KO right here

Damn
I made the mistake of checking his insta, it's legit. It's horrible
Unless this guy is just really in character for views, I believe he’s legitimately cringe. I’ve seen his Instagram for awhile now because my friends repost him ironically. I wanted to just upload a video but I was unable to due to the restrictions on this subreddit. This is not me nor do I believe it is ragebait.
Where is that video?
I looked him up and apparently he did prison time
Why do people think this is me? It’s cringe af
We aren't cringe. We're authentic. 

(throws up in my mouth)
Hardly. We don't really wanna adopt boomer or millennial mentalities. We're doing alright the way we are.
Damn dude I'm a millennial who looks up to my Gen x brother and friends for just being able to do their own thing unapologetically.

That and being able to call shit out immediately and unapologetically. 

Don't lump them in with boomers.
I don’t watch Mr beast but doesn’t he do more like expensive “stunts” or games on YouTube? This guy just reads a corny quote and applies it to himself in a thirsty desperate 47 year old way
It's you, isn't it?
Getting paperwork ready. BRB
I have also suffered detriment.
No
Honestly might be some of the best cringe I’ve seen in awhile. That shit shook me to the core lol.
https://youtu.be/Pj2hrpi_luY?si=g8e7cnCKmoUuIat2
For strangling his wife
I’d say we’re OUTentic.
Those type of stuff is how MrBeast got started. 

His first videos were of him literally just sitting in front of a camera and counting out loud. He did whatever he could to get views no matter how low effort or ridiculous it was.
Totally, dog
No I just only know him from Instagram but this subreddit doesn’t allow Instagram links. He uploads there more frequently and it’s good cringe
Idk what the comment above you said, but I couldn't agree more.
I'm gonna defend Mr Beast here and say at least he had some unique video concepts. He knew how to become EXTREMELY viral. 

You can't compare that to this clown who just has corny ass quotes pasted on the screen while trying too hard to look cool? Or something? That's not even trying to become viral he's just trying to impress teenage girls, gross.
He said to checkout the guys other social media lol. Idk why it was deleted, he was advocating more cringe content. I was  kinda joking but also I won't check it out
Art by Patrick Brown
Source: www.patrickbrownart.com
Patrick is a veteran and a legend of GTA artworks. Seeing his work for gta 6 feels unreal
![gif](giphy|P8mXVA3KMqVgc)
praise the heavens for actual manmade art being posted on this sub
Imagine if all of them did a job together how crazy it would get.
Man I love that guy, I been fallowing him for years. He always makes the best gta fanarts
Jason is fucking RIPPED.
This brings back memories to before 5 came out and he made the artwork with all the past protagonists in the apartment with Michael. We didn’t know of Franklin and Trevor’s existence. Wild how time flies.
Trevor's enjoying Vice City, that's nice
Great to see his art again. Wish he'd do one with all other protagonists as well like he did for GTA 5.
I dont know Y. But i can feel this image.
The details are incredible
Is that my boy Claude in the cop car?
this is fucking fire
This is cool as shit
Ya boy Jason's been TRENing hard. Dude could probably bench the car he's in.
Lol Niko can’t even use parachutes
I'm convinced that if they ever met, Trevor would hit on Jason
Mr. Raspberry Jam livin' his best life.
So refreshing to see real artwork and not disgusting AI slop
No way Chop is still alive by the time GTA VI takes place lol. Fantastic art tho
Why is Trevor so ripped? Hot daddy
FINALLY NON-AI ART
This art is obviously fantastic, but I just can't suspend my disbelief that Michael, Franklin, and Chop allowed Trevor to be the designated driver.
I can’t download it, how do I get it high quality?
holy shit this is incredible
That teddy bear looks surprisingly...unused
Dope
The Return of The goat!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Franklin looks more like Lincoln Clay
So we got Lucia, Jason, Trevor, Micheal, Franklin, and Nikko
Where CJ
Where is Tommyyyy 😭
Come onnn
This is Vice Cityyy

Still cool artwork tho. Patrick never fails to deliver.
I know only the trailer is out but if they ever make a movie about gta 6 Ryan Reynolds needs to play Jason
This looks great but it reminds me of a Fortnite loading screen
Niko looks the coolest here
We need the other protagonists too!
This is Luis erasure.
It's so easy to appreciate the soulful nature of art made by a real human. Gg
Finally, been waiting on his artwork. His artwork got me through gta 5 wait back in high school.
ironic knowing niko doesnt ever use a parachute
This dude's a legend. Finally,some pure art on this sub
New saints row looks lit
This is awesome. Jason and Lucia here remind me of Archer and Lana from Archer. In fact, the whole thing reminds me of Archer.
Gta lv vs gta 5
I really liked that crossover. Patrick's art is so great.
Why does Franklin look like Lincoln Clay from Mafia 3 lol
What CJ
This is going to be iconic in a few years!
Lookin’ ain’t a crime 👁️👁️
Is that a Cluckin Bell box between the cars?
Can't wait for that gameplay trailer!😤
I thought Niko couldn't use parachutes
Well damn this looks like a poster
Long time that I don't check on Patrick Brown creations! Wow!
 ̶M̶a̶r̶i̶o̶GTA kart
Is Claude driving the cop car or is that t-1000?
This looks really good 👍🏾
Where’s Johnny and Luis?
Trevor is fucking psyched and Michael somehow looks younger than Franklin 

A true masterpiece
Was Patrick Brown the guy who did that living room art with all the protagonists (up to that point)?

I haven't seen that image in years nor could I have told you the name of that piece's artist, but somehow seeing his name brought it back subliminally because of how cool the image was.
UAZ as Trevor's car?
Masterpiece
After this I can say only one thing

Fuck A.I.
finally some shit that’s not AI
That shit is actually tuff you deserve an award for this and for adding the OG gang and niko
That is really sick
Looks incredible. Thats all I need to say
Brown Patrick? 💦🌝 
Brown Patrick? 💦🌝
I love how Niko belic is in the top right
FINALLY!! I've been waiting for this dude to drop one for VI
Now the HD saga is complete!
The prodigal son returns !!
Dooooope!
Niko flying in the air 😭🤣
Sickkkk
No CJ 🙄
Where's Luis
New fornite season collab just dropped
Surprised this ain't been removed, I've seen too much about the mods here lol
Team trevor
Why the GTA 5 crew driving a [Russian UAZ truck](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/25/fa/4b/25fa4bad544dcb76ce26608eee5f8dc4.png)?
FAKE FAKE FAKE !!!!
Is this the same dude that drew the protags in the apartment??? Man it's so iconic
Razor da Blazer in the background
Get in loser, we're going to go blow ourselves up in a freak gas fighting accident.
That’s why real artwork will always be necessary.. because it’s much more appreciated.
It's so refreshing to see actual artistic intent in the art.
and you can instantly tell the difference, there's so much attention to every part of it, the composition is actually dynamic

legit great
Praise the lord!

![gif](giphy|doUu2ByZDbPYQ|downsized)
It’s also good to see good art being posted on here. Ai fucking sucks
yeah i talked to the mods and their excuse for AI art being okay is “some of its good tho”
Rare to see nowadays

that would smell marvel all over the place

Fuckoff Shredded Brick Shithouse
jason?? did you see giga chad-franklin over there. he looks like a GQ model banged a chip n dale dancer.
That's the way to keep Lucia around.
Shit look at Michael's 50-something yr old ass sitting in the seat looking like he's been taking The Rock's steroids.
I remember that artwork. There is even a video talking about that one and that it was talking about the fact that it confirmed that it isn't Tommy since Tommy is also in the artwork and it doesn't make any sense for him to be in two places at once.

I think this was also before Rockstar came out saying the 3D universe and HD universes are different GTA universes.
Trevor would be right at home in Florida
Trevor's teddy bear seems suspiciously unviolated though, this might be an impostor
Thanks! Yep for sure, it's happening! I have already drawn it up, all protagonists hanging out on Vice Beach, having so much fun with it! Cheers!
He said that he is making a new one with all the protagonists
The adrenaline peak and the thrill of the action
Looks like the T-1000 to me
Speed?
That reminded me that Luis and Johnny are nowhere to be seen
He is still alive by the time Franklin’s GTA Online story is set (which is 2022-2023 I think? Someone can correct me), but he’s old as fuck. If 6 is set in 2024/2025, he could still be alive, but still old as fuck. 
About the same ab THEE mr raspberry jam lmao
I can see why but this guy has been making this kind of GTA artworks before Battle Royales were even a thing.
I thought the same thing
Yeah I was getting massive archer vibes from this too! Love it
Difference between human's creation and nature/God's creation. 

Self made art will always be unique.
He's not an HD protagonist. The real question is where are Luis, Huang, and Johnny's ghost?
![gif](giphy|srTYyZ1BjBtGU|downsized)
Noooo!

(btw I really wonder if Epic Games executives had tried or keep trying to negotiate with Rockstar to release GTA skins lol)
He said in his insta post that he is making a new one with every protagonist
Yep, that's the legend himself.
That guy? Damnnn, can't believe he's still doing this.
what?
which is why the whole "afraid for ai" thing doesn't make sense. At some point, human-made art will even be more valuable than it is today because of its authenticity. Artists just have to prove it with a time-lapse video lol.
I could have someone make an AI piece in the style of this guy and post it claiming it's his and everyone would believe it until said guy came forward and set the record straight. Hell you could be gushing over AI right now!
I do not necessarily intend to insult the artist, but in my view, there seems to be an artificial or a streamlined Disney kind of hollow feeling to it.
Could just make it a dream sequence/acid trip type thing to keep it out of canon. Would be a hell of a DLC lol.
"Look, this is gonna be one big Grand Theft Auto..." "You in?" *action trailer music with Title Sequence*
Trevor may have been born in Canada, but he is a Florida man in spirit through and through
Man, it's really nice seeing you here. Besides being always your fan since the first GTA arts, you also helped me learning with Photoshop tutorials. You are the MVP. This piece was goddamn great and can't wait for the next one you've been cooking.

Cheers.
Nice!
yup
Dont think Johnny would do well in close vicinity to Trevor
Well Johnny is resting and Luis is running the nightclubs
>human-made art will even be more valuable than it is today because of its authenticity

Kinda hard to determine value when it's impossible to gauge authenticity. People are right to be worried about AI. Hell, you've probably seen artwork _today_ that you thought was real when it wasn't. You guys can say "human art will always be better than AI art" all you want but eventually you just won't be able to tell the difference. The average person isn't gonna watch a time-lapse video to make sure what they just saw was real.
The problems are that 1) there isn't really an easy way to tell nor detect AI art consistently especially since the only thing mfs wanna do with it is make it even *harder* to deduce, 2) not very comforting if corpos and stuff aren't going to want to pay for valuable human art and instead spew AI slop everywhere in the interest of their bottom line, and 3) it's been possible to fake shit like WIPs and timelapses with AI since like two years ago.
I’d love that. Something just super over the top and ridiculous that doesn’t take itself seriously at all.
That means a lot! Thanks for checking out my work, I really appreciate it, there's more to come!
Even as a ghost?
We're not talking about the average person though or the average graphical/logo  artist, the logo/ graphical assignment type of jobs will definitely largely die off. I just think there's gonna be a huge difference in perception, at which point, talented humans will see demand and price for their art increase. An art or museum lover/ enthusiast *will* go through the little trouble it takes to find/ verify human artists.
It’s not that hard to figure if anyone is using AI, if the person just comes outta nowhere with amazing art with no background, there’s a huge chance that he’s using AI.. most artists have a learning curve you can see.. just like a great producer or whatever art form has a history
I think there's enough grounds for pessimism as it is, I'm not even denying that. But I'm sure they'll figure out a way to have authentic verification, this might be as simple as an intermediary website where artists can get verified. Also, I'm sure new laws will be implemented that have some sort of a.i. watermark. Only a few tech nerds will circumvent that, the majority of internet users will just use one of the established voice/image/video generators, which will be tagged as ai.  

It's just an educated guess: if there's all kinds of a.i. crap, people will value authenticity a lot more.
Cool. You're welcome, man. I even had tweeted a few weeks ago saying that I was hoping you were cooking a GTA art even though I didn't know you were indeed. And now knowing that we will have at least two, anyway that's pretty cool. And thanks the internet too lol. Cheers.
The Art's God level bro, 
Also make make one copy of it for mobile screen also, so i can use it as a wallpaper.
We are talking about those people. That’s the big issue.

Notable artists are already distinguished from the rest and art collectors go through absurd amounts of trouble to find and restore those artists’ pieces. No one is concerned about Picasso or Van Gogh being wiped away by AI because their significant contributions have already been made, and anyone who makes a similar contribution in the future will be cherished as well. 

Unfortunately, of those once-in-a-generation kind of artists, there is about one in each generation. The 98% of other artists whose profession is art are concerned and have every right to be because their entire livelihoods are at risk.
Bethesda doesn't understand Celcius
I am not getting frostbite inside a *full spacesuit* at -10°C. Neither is Barret freezing to death. Shit, here I am, walking around my neighbourhood in jeans, t-shirt, runners, and a jacket at -10°C for an hour without frostbite or hypothermia. 

Is there some insane, suit-penetrating wind on the atmosphere-free moon that I'm not aware of? (It's also *really* hard to lose heat without a medium.)

-10 is not that cold.
-10 without clothes? Yes.
-10 in a medium like water? Absolutely.

*WE ARE WEARING SPACESUITS!*
It's more that Bethesda doesn't understand space suits. We also get lung damage in our space suit if we go near toxic gas clouds.
The whole environmental damage system needs to be overhauled.
Sarah keeps telling me we will die of heat at 30°C and freeze to death at 20°C, I love her but damn those are some high temperature standards
You get hypothermia and frostbite at -10ºC, but you're totally fine at -200ºC.

🤷🏻‍♂️
Yeah...I guess what kinda kills it for me is that they didn't even commit to the hazards.

Like, Ok, I have hypothermia.  Now what?

Oh, it's not going to kill me?  Ok.

Severe lung damage?  Going to cough a bit?  Ok.

What's even the point of including them if they're not realistic and they have no tangible consequences?

I get it, Todd said they removed things that "weren't fun" but...why did this survive?  It adds nothing and it does little.
Starfield tries so hard to have a realistic/hard sci-fi feel, seemingly avoiding too much fantasy in the pursuit of "NASA Punk".

And then the game mechanics make zero fucking sense from a scientific standpoint. Just be a fucking fantasy game or don't. This is a game defined by shitty compromises.
I have stuff in my closet that would handle closer to -40 C for hours without an issue. An actual space suit should be able to handle -100 to -200 range at least for a good while.  Cold isnt that difficult to deal with.  Heat, on the other hand, is much more difficult.
I’ve thought about the inconsistencies of environmental damage and I think I have sort of figured it out.

When the original system was built, it was likely “No Man Sky”-ish, where the rules changed based on environment.

I “think” in the original system you’d need a sealed space suit for each type of space environment, and then a lighter suit you wore on Earth-like planets that was not sealed.

If your suit protection got depleted, or you went near hazards wearing a light suit (non sealed), you could get hazard injuries, with elements you collected used to recharge the sealed suit. 

My guess is in the original design, if you ran out of protection in sealed environments you died very quickly. Playtesting they decided (for us) to make the system much less hostile to players, but the framework they left in place makes no sense from an immersion perspective.
As a Canadian, we don't even stop wearing shorts until -10°...
While we’re on the bad sci-fi elements train, how about the way the ships don’t have momentum ANYTHING like how ships should move in space. Turn off the the thrusters -> immediately come to a stop. Turn thrusters all the way up -> quickly hit a top speed. 

So much of this game is like sci-fi for people who have no interest in sci-fi.
The science in this game is all over the place…

For example, if I am in a breathable atmosphere how am I accumulating enough CO2 to asphyxiate myself while running without a helmet on? Am I somehow breathing so much that I am deoxygenating the atmosphere? If that’s the case why aren’t entire towns full of people dropping like flys when I run by?
Bethesda doesn't understand temperature, period.  Just the other day, Sarah was complaining about the cold ON THE SURFACE OF MERCURY. She then spent time wandering around the surface of PLUTO in her normal clothes!
Yeah I agree. Spacesuit damage in general is one of the biggest bullshit things I really dislike about this game. I can't explore a single planet without getting lung cancer or burns by the time I get back to my spaceship.   


It's like... Why? I have a fucking space suit on, why am I getting so many illnesses? I've played a lot of Bethesda games and I think I've gotten more illnesses in Starfield alone than every single Bethesda game combined. I honestly stopped going to the doctor too because I can be arsed to constantly cure my character.
I find it stranger how food and drink items, plastic packaged stuff, liquid chemicals, civilian grade plastic items, paper... survive 270°C. That is the full blast setting on a residential oven. This would pyrolize paper, melt any non-specialist plastics (kapton and some other engineering plastics would be just fine at that. a red harvest bread wrapper, certainly not), and turn any container of water based liquid or liquefied gas that hasn't burst yet into a nasty explosion hazard, and make any civilian electronic item very delicate to handle due to parts only clinging on to solder by surface tension. Anything with a battery or chemical capacitors ... see liquid containers.
Need a mod to fix this function of the game. 

Really what they should have done is at least had some sort of space suit health bar that when is depleted means you need to repair your suit or you lose O2 and can get environmental damage until repaired or dead.
Someone years ago said they liked Fahrenheit because 0 is really cold and 100 is really hot. In Celsius 0 is still really cold but at 100 you’re dead. 😂
According to Bethesda, everybody in Canada dies every winter. I go for groceries in worse weather than Bethesda thinks is unsurvivable in a spacesuit. As a teenager, I worked at 7-11 and I pumped gas in -54 degree Celcius weather with the wind chill.
I'm from Texas anything below 5c and I'm wearing a sweater and a winter  coat and a hat.

I'm sure I'd be fine in a goddamned spacesuit though.
I agree the -10 I'm dying was insane. Especially with a certain end main quest and certain end Vanguard quest. 
"Here's a large area you will need to spend lots of time in this -10; good luck not taking more damage from frickin frostbite than the enemies..."

I understand like, it's a video game so it doesn't need to make sense and Beth. just wanted us to have to think about what/where we are doing. But like, if you're going to make a frozen mission at least make it -50 or something more believable...
Sarah told me that ice was starting to fuck with her gear. It’s 22c bro it’s warm as shit
no, no, see, you've got it all wrong, Bethesda games aren't based on *our* reality and any resemblance is by pure coincidence.
Companions will randomly start screaming about freezing to death when we've transitioned through an airlock into another ship. I frequently have non-Constellation followers warn me about making sure we have our spacesuits on when transitioning into interior spaces, on New Atlantis.

So, you know, it's confusing for everyone in-universe too.
Lol I own a sleeping bag that's rated for -10.  Maybe I should make a clothing mod where you can wear the bag. I can't do detailed modelling but a big rectangle might be doable if forgiving some clipping where you hold the weapon. Better than space suit apparently!
As an Aussie, I didn't even realise it was meant to be in Celsius...
They said somewhere that kind of survival like damage system got ditched along the way. As did so many other game mechanics and that's how you develop something this big that does not even make it to the game a game of the year nomination.
Given that there are open tents, beds and food and drink lying around in extreme temp, no or low atmosphere planets, this is the least of Bethesda's concerns but you're right OP.
I have to admit that Bethesda should have had a chemist or at least a environmental engineer take a gander at it to do some basic fact checking.

Hell, I'm civil engineering undergrad and even I find my self kinda bemused by both real basic structural choices and the apparent lack of any kind of chemical knowledge.

Mind, I'm not demanding that every facet of the game needs to be perfect but, the space suits, environmental temperature, and inner gas geysers needs to be reevaluated for common sense.
Its designed by chegg engineers they wouldn't know the difference.
Surface of some moon +600°c. gets steam burn in same shit
They don’t understand what projectiles would do to space suits and helmets either. 

*snipes baddy. Headshot! 

“Oh sweet. New helmet. I’m sure it’s in tip top shape! I’m sure I’ll be fine wearing this on Pluto”
A whole lot of ideas are half done 

- Gas environments
- Temps
- Radiation exposure 
- Incoming storm exposure…
- Food
- Water 
- Medical in general 
- Trade 
- Fuel/ship range
- Ship repairs.. what is point of all the internal doors if 
   nothing changes with damage 
- Settlements 

Enemy guards just wandering around in stuff that my suit alarms are screaming about

Temperatures that will melt metals and my plastic suit connections are just fine 

The core structures are all half done.. here’s to hoping Starfield 2.0 delivers on them

That said, still enjoying the game a ton… but you can tell SO many things are half done.  The good news is it all functions most of the time, the bad news is all the bells and whistles are disconnected for now
If you think that’s bad, try blasting a bunch of enemies full of holes splattering their blood everywhere and you get a beautiful new spacesuit completely intact. 😅
It's what peeves me about many games... It makes sense since most of the game companies come from California where they think 50 degrees is cold and long shirts are required at that temp... Meanwhile I'm up at the borders of canada in central USA, and even at 0 degree F, which is like -17 Celsius in summer long sleeve shirt and pants doing just fine. (Though chilly if there is a light wind. Jacket if it's windy), but I'm not getting frost bite.
I find the>! buried temple thing where you fight all the starborns!< is the worst planet for getting debuffs. fall 1 inch, thats a sprain, climb down steps, your legs are shattered, hypothermia every 15 seconds. Become a full ice block in 30 etc.

&#x200B;

I use more of the cure items on that planet than anywhere else during the entire get the artifacts thing
It's not just Celsius they don't understand.  I also hate that they use mass for your carrying capacity.  Apparently pre-release they used weight, which makes way more sense.  So at some point they intentionally changed it to be nonsense
If -10 resulted in frostbite and hypothermia as fast as in starfield I think most of the population on earth would be dead.  Including all of canada, -10 is a nice day in the winter across most of the country and we do not have thermal protection space suits.  They act like -10 is actually -100.  I barbeque outside with just a long sleeve shirt at -10 and I still have all my fingers and toes.  In starfield I get off my ship and immediately get a frost bite at -10 and that just isn't possible even naked as the day I was born.
The whole horrible basic science in the game is actually quite insulting. They don't seem to understand temperatures, chemistry, and even - a problem in a space game - how simple orbital mechanics work. Spoilers for ECS Constant below  


>!So the ECS Constant is supposed to be a huge generation ship (let's ignore the fact that it's too small for that), hanging out in orbit over Paradiso. Paradiso complains that it's a problem for tourism and they have to ROUTE FLIGHTS IN AND OUT OF THE RESORT VIA THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET TO AVOID TOURISTS SEEING THE ECS CONSTANT. WHAT? The ship would not be in a geostationary orbit, it would be going around and around the planet, not always on the same side. That's not how space works. And as big as such a ship would be, it would still be tiny compared to the size of the planet and you wouldn't need to go that far around a SPHERE to avoid anyone being able to spot it from a distance... And since we're at it: I was so excited when I realized it was a 200 years old ship I was about to walk through. Get to the bridge... And it has the exact same tech as the rest of the game world. EXACT SAME COMPUTERS. Running the same operating system. Same loot. Same random objects. So. Incredibly. Lazy. I felt so insulted. As insulted as I was that they decided to include Earth and... Well. We all know how insulting visiting Earth in Starfield is, from the people who brought us Fallout, no less.!<
The more you look, the more gibberish you find.
And you don’t understand how to spell Celsius apparently lol
It gets even weirder than that. I've been on multiple moons/planets shere the scanner said the temperature was -212, and I was completely fine. No frostbite or it building up over time. But on planets that barely dip below 0 degrees Celsius I get a beeping warning and frostbite. Like wtf
*laughs in Frostpunk*
In 300 years, NASA has developed a space suit that resolve this
The problem with that was they had a whole different plan for the environmental stuff and were going to make it rather important. So you'd have to have a spacesuit with really good cold resistance or heat resistance or whatever in order to effectively walk around on different planets. They realized somewhere along the way that the system was way too difficult and it wasn't working out well so they nerfed the crap out of it and left some of it active, but it needs attention in its current state. I expect they're going to be doing some tweaks to that in the future.
I found it hilarious, when I visited an building near my outpost on Andraphon (zero atmosphere!), the environment got foggy and it started to rain. ;D
My thing is, other than ship battles, can you even die in game?? 🤣 i've tanked so much dmg and just used the hundreds of med packs over stacked from all the vendors...its nuts
You can tell this is Bethesda's first space game.
Europeans are just built different 😎
I ONLY get frostbite in the lower neg temps. For some reason, if I am in like -200, I’m all good. If I stop moving for 2 seconds in -25, I get double frostbite and hypothermia immediately.
gotta love it when a game is set in the future and full of advanced technology but absolutely fails at elementary level science.
Spacesuits keep the user from freezing to death in space, they have coils of pipes that pump warm water threw them to keep the body warm,  concentrated air is filtered into the helmet via the oxygen tank on the astronauts back too.

So Starfield doesn't know about Space Suits at all. If they had watched... For Man Kind lol
And Personal Atmosphere does nothing for temperature. Or for filtering out ambient gases. Or for anything but turning your body's CO2 disposal system up to 11.
You mean the same spacesuit that protects you on a planet with no atmosphere, but can't protect you from dust and lung damage on a planet with some atmosphere.
Depends on the region you're in where I live 20 degree's is winter.
Anything resembling something even approaching the real thing would be tedious for anyone but the nerdiest of nerds.

First of all, a pressure suit is a giant, human shaped bladder that’s inflated to 3.5-4 PSI. It is extremely tiring to work in because the suit is constantly fighting you if you want to adopt any position other than the ´rest’ posture. It’s also very bulky and offer limited mobility in the hip joint and the shoulders. So walking naturally is out of the question. Also, the gloves won’t give you any good dexterity. So out goes the gunplay and much of the aerobatics. And forget about sneaking. Remember the inflated bladder thing we talked about ? Well if you bend your knees, the suit will pop you right back up. 

Second, the thermal control would be easier to achieve. You just insulate against the outside conditions and just have to deal with the internal environmental conditions. Luckily, we have a steady source of heat inside the suit. A working, breathing human will output something like a 1000 btu/ hour. Just have to supplement this if it’s too cold/ get rid of excess heat. Here we’re assuming we do not run into material failure caused by extreme heat/cold conditions.

Past mobility restriction, the single most problematic hazard for the low atmosphere world would be……..dust. When you think about it, this dust is the result of countless impact, big and small, that crushed the rocks over eons. It’s called regolith. It’s very fine grained and sharp as it has not been eroded by water or wind. It’s like sandblast on steroids. It’s get’s everywhere and will eventually abrade everything that come in contact with it. Add to that fact that this dust will not react like it does on good ole earth. Because there is no atmosphere, no fluid get between the particles to loosen them up. It’s very cohesive and will seize any tight fitting parts if given half a chance. Those firearms would cease functioning as soon as they got any dust on them. The suits wouldn’t fare much better. Seals, joints and latches would be trashed in very short order. The Apollo’s PGA were thoroughly trashed after three 8 hours EVA.

And let’s not even talk about the obvious. A bullet ripping through the suit would probably be fatal even if it didn’t hit your body. At least you would just go to sleep without realizing you’ll die. An EMP frying your suit’s electrical systems would also f*** your day up big time. 

While I don’t agree with everything BGS did with the suits, anything close to RL, while probably providing a sense of danger, would hardly be conducive to the type of fast paced, gun blazing gameplay they were aiming for.
feb. in ontario. jeans and a hoodie can last a few hours no problem.
Yup. I live in Canada and I walk to work in windchills of lower than - 20C in regular pants and a winter jacket. In a spacesuit I'd be sweating, not freezing.
Spacesuit? I wear undies and personal atmosphere on all planets. It's just more exciting
-10 without proper clothes not deadly too.. if you don't take much time outside. There are people in world actually living in nearly -40 in northern pole.
Oh I absolutely hate the environmental system. Your suit is useless. When I land on a planet that -200⁰C I have no problems, but I go to londinion and I am getting frostbite and hypothermia every few minutes. No sense at fucking all
My favorite is when I get lung damage from a sandstorm on Mars or a warning popping up saying “Extreme conditions: Snow”. These must be the shittiest space suits ever made.
I love when it says it's 11º and it starts raining, and the thing is beeping at me and I can't stay outside for more than a minute or two. Because it's 11º and raining. A halfway-decent jacket would cover that, *and I'm wearing a friggin' spacesuit.*
Just for that you get a anniversary edition .
I love how you get frostbite in -10c but don't cure the frostbite or give heat stroke at 589c.
Right? I can go to a planet that's -200 and be fine, then go to start a new playthrough on the last planet for the final mission, which is -10, and then I'll get frostbite?? Like make up your mind lol
I get the spacesuit theory, 100% accurate. But I’ve grown up and lived in a warm climate all my life. -10 is cold af for most people and you can definitely get frostbite from it after a little while
I been to places minus 20 its chill, literally.
I find this thread particularly humorous lol
C'mon. Since when science matter to Starfield. Or Betheada lol
We can cross Solar systems but can’t figure out space suits for common temperatures on earth
It's a damp cold.
Well this post and it's comments have really shown me how little I know about....like science in general lol
Idk man.  I'm from the tropics. If I walk around in flips n baggies in -10c ill be dead before the hour is up.
I'm not sure anyone understands "Celcius".
It took me way to long to realize I agreed with you, that minus 10 is not that cold.
Unplayable!!!
I managed to get frostbite on a planet with a temperature of 39⁰C because there was a dust storm. I think heat stroke would be far more likely!
Bethesda doesn't give a shit about true scientific accuracy* ftfy
Celsius, I did her.  (Andrew Dice Clay anyone)
If space suits worked like real life one bullet hole would be game over. Not the best gameplay.
 It's all about the atmospheric density. -200C in a vacuum is no big deal. -200C in a liquid would freeze you solid and I doubt if any spacesuit would save you from that.

 That said yeah, -10C isn't going to do bumpkiss, especially when you're in a spacesuit designed for harsh conditions.

 But eh... suspension of disbelief and all that.
Maybe there's something about no atmosphere or the vacuum of space that we don't understand. Maybe it's more then just the temperature number value.
Don't forget the planets that are below 0C but not frozen at all, and snowy planets in the 10-20C range, even at roughly earth pressure.
Bethesda is the one copying the homework of The Expanse without understanding.
Wouldnt the atmospheric pressure be an important factor, and -10°C at earth atmospheric take less energy to heat up vs. a 10 Bar atmosphere?  So maybe the planets you’re walking on are huge?
Was it a thick atmosphere planet? According to bing, "a denser atmosphere can make it feel colder, because it increases the rate of heat loss from your body by conduction and convection. This is why windy days feel colder than calm days, even if the temperature is the same." LoL
So, fun fact. The moon, you know, the one that real people have landed on, ranges in temperature from over 120 °C (250 °F) during the day all the way to around -155 °C (-250 °F) during the night. Hot enough to boil water (granted, it would be boiling at almost any temperature above freezing without an atmosphere) during the day and cold enough to freeze it during the night,

The Spacesuits of the Apollo mission astronauts were built to isolate from that whilst also providing artifical atmospheric pressure AND protecting against potential impacts from micrometeors. 

&#x200B;

You couldn't move anywhere as easily in them as you can in Starfield, and they were much more of a hassle to actually put on, but once you wear one, you're as protected from outer space as you can be.
also the fact that the enemies can walk around and not get any status effects
Still looking for that pipe....

Pipe is life ;-)
maybe you using spacesuit with -10% thermal?

haha, jk

fuck bethesda
They’re totally lazy, look at the MPC‘s in their dialogues they offered. They have like five different things they say it’s pathetic.
I gotta say, I never pay attention to the temperature because Celsius is just gobbledygook for me. Like I’m all for Metric over American Standard (base ten yes please) but Farenheight makes way more fucking sense to me. Zero is very cold, a hundred is very hot, it’s perfectly logical. You’re saying -10 is comfortable and to me, if -10 is comfortable on a scale, that scale sucks. Sorry if my rant went way off topic.
As a Canadian -10C is a joke.
Don't try to argue realism with The Todd.

Realism in space he determined from the moon landings. It was boring but the Astronauts still had things to do. I'm also sure he make suit decisions from re-runs of Six Million Dollar Man. 

The fact the same gauge applies when you are in say Atlantis as in space should be all we need to know. 

Considering that till someone sent him a box of pins with a note to weigh them his team thought a single pin weighed a pound inf Fallout 76.

And in fallout power armor is a sealed system yet you can get waterborne diseases while in a set. 

&#x200B;

So Todd, "For you, fifty thousand years of Human evolution was something that happened to other people, wasn't it?"
-10° C(14° F) isnt cold enough for frostbite to set in anyway.
They're American. Course they don't understand Celsius
Or maybe they don’t know how to release a game that’s ready.
We can dock vertical in our ship with gravity and enter a star yard perpendicular to us with gravity and you're worried about frostbite at -10 Celsius 🤣🤣🤣 here in Canada we're still warring shorts
I think there is something to the system but yeah like you said it doesn't make sense. In theory there is some temperature that would overwhelm the suits ability to keep you warm... there are some environments and gases the could gradually compromise  suit... but it happens way too easily and isn't as catastrophic as it would be once it does. I'd love to see someone tackle a mod to make this work more the way it should.
considering how many Canadian food things are in the game, and the fact they have studios in Canada, you'd think they get Celcius
They don't even have phones in the suits, you have to go back to confirm you passed a message along for a quest.
What the fuck. There's probably someone I respect that paid full price for this.
It’s not even consistent. I can’t remember what world I was on but it was some insane temperature like -119 C (honestly could’ve been a glitch in hindsight) and I didn’t get a single environmental alert or anything.
At least it isn’t Icarus. The planet you are on doesn’t have a breathable atmosphere so you always have to wear an environment suit at all times, but walk into a damp cave and you can get pneumonia.
Unless it's -10kelvin
It’s cracking me up how all the people from tropical places are insisting that they will DIE from -10 degrees Celsius. Like, that’s pretty cold. If you’re out for hours and hours in the wrong clothes, you could get frostbite maybe. If you’re wearing proper clothes, you’ll be fine. I used to spend hours sledding as a kid. I’d get hot under my clothes and end up in a light coat and a scarf. It was right around 14 - 20 degrees Fahrenheit- super close to what we are talking about here. 

But A SPACESUIT??? A spacesuit should be fine! There’s not even any skin exposed to wind?
YES! Im so glad im not the only one annoyed by this! Literally took my dogs for a walk in -10c yesterday, wearing a thick hoodie, beanie, jeans and boots. I was out maybe 20minutes and kept thinking ”if this would be Starfield, i’d be dead or badly injured lol” ….yeah.
Based on the fact that the temperatures displayed in the game never change, no matter where you are on a planet, I suspect they're an average for the entire globe. It's a really useless and nonsensical thing to inform you about, though. Like, from orbit, sure, but you only see that number after you've landed.
I think it is the average temperature then it would make some what of sense. So if you are on the poles it could be a lot colder then 10°C
Bethesda is American, of course they didn’t know what Celsius is.
I was wearing winter boots and underwear and taking a dog out to the bathroom in the middle of winter when it was around -15 C outside. No excuse why a spacesuit with love story systems can't handle that with amazing ease
Bethesda doesn’t understand game design
I get it, it’s not hard sci fi, they just wanted the veneer of it. But this isn’t veneer; it’s not even atom-thick.
The whole elements (both weather and ELEMENTS) interactions are super frustrating.
Thank You!

As a Canadian I was super offended by this.  Oh, it's below 0C and I get Frostbite even though I am running running around at vO2 max, while wearing a Space Suit!  I have camped in a tent in colder weather.

Oh, it's a -200 planet, and I stopped moving for 5 minutes, sure, then ya, okay, My dick just froze off, don't tell Andreja.
do you ever see the temperature change? like when the sun rises it should become much hotter (depending on the planet) and in a storm the temperature should also change but i never saw it change so i have to assume its the average temperature on this planet and well if the average temperature os -10 it could in reality well be -100...
Not me being in the South Pole on a planet with -18 °C and the equator on the same planet is also -18 °C.
Such a stupid game. Last night I had to get the archive from two factions. The mission was literally to walk into a building, talk to someone, get given an archive. Walk to someone else and shoot a few robots and get given an archive. The Varun building was odd.
Then take them both to a really cool room with people behind locked doors. And they say thanks and you have to leave and go back to talk to someone else.
Nothing in this game makes me go wow.
Everything is so dead.
It is NOT a local temperature that is displayed on your HUD.

It's an average planet's temperature, so if you land on the pole the environment will be different than expected.

In this case an icon on your HUD will inform you of extreme conditions.
Survival mechanics here are... wel... inexistent.
Game is mid, what do you expect lol
Oh so this game is even more stupid than I thought
I’m more amused by the “primordial” fauna consisting of 12-foot tall quadripeds on a moon with no atmosphere.
Xbox user here, mods will never come fast enough, the game has potential but needs an overhaul from people who understand of game design, and that people are not bethesda . That to make the game at full we needs modder however is sad by itself .
As a person who lives in a tropical country, I thought this was accurate 😂. Here we cry at +10°C.
I've seen this complaint and I agree about the spacesuits, but -10 sure feels cold to me.
Clearly it's being measured in Kelvin.
\-10 is friggin' cold ...  especially when it 'feels like -10c' I'm not going outside in a mere t-shirt and jeans.

Not all of us are used to cold temperatures like that, but at the same time I'd say a space suit that can't handle that isn't exactly a space suit in my book.

&#x200B;

oh ... I had Barret walk outside without a spacesuit while claiming it was freezing his butt off.  
I was like : "you should be wearing that spacesuit I gave you ..."
The biggest fail in my opinion is that Bethesda doesn’t understand VENUS… our CLOSEST neighbor in space. You can not go there. It doesn’t matter how advanced you are technologically. Nearly everything melts - that includes electronics. There’s actually design concepts for rovers on Venus which would be clockwork rovers; no electronics can survive, so they’d be purely mechanical, maybe even wind driven. Imagine sending pictures up pixel by pixel using a flashing mirror like a Boy Scout. THAT’S Venus. You can’t land there and hang out. You can’t radiate heat away when you’re in heat. Honestly, anything above the “wet bulb” temperature is leaning on impossible to survive in without some kind of exothermal radiator solution like in-ground radiant cooling, or beaming heat away with frickin laser beams. 

They don’t know anything about actual space lore. Space is a terrifying, inhospitable place. It’s truly evil beyond comprehension. But Starfield’s Venus? “Hey there’s some space pirates no more than 4 km from here who are threatening my space farm. Can you go either kill them or chat with them so they stop? Ok I’ll wait here.”
But can they spell it better than you?
The whole environmental hazard system is just beyond stupid and unlogical.
-10 would kill me, outright.
I live in a mediterranean country, give me 40° and I'm fine, give me "-anything" and I'll crawl in a ball of frozen tears
Starfield is a fantasy game cosplaying sci-fi
Last winter here, it was -10 C most mornings and I was still driving to work in a coat and gloves. I'd be perfectly comfortable in an insulated space suit. And by the way, it would HAVE to be insulated in order to be a space suit. Space isn't exactly a cosy 20c
-10C is fucking freezing even with clothes what are you talking about??
I live in Finland, and in “10 it’s comfortable. Air is fresh and especially if there’s snow and snowfall, it’s lovely to go outside.

In terms of Starfield. Clothing, settler comfort wear is quite enough. Actually almost any clothing is enough.

In “20, bwrrwe insulated coat is needed if you plan to hang outside.

In “30, a good multi layer clothing ia required and you need to breath through nose. No miuthbreayhers in that weather.

Nothing so far has required a spacesuit which all are equipped with circulated liquid system and closed atmosphere to maintain comfortable climate inside the suit.

Starfield weather injuries are not correct. They should not happen nor should toxic gas get inside suit unless their molecular structure is something new to us.

Injuries from hot air wenting from below ground in very cold planets I can accept. Maybe it’s because suit can’t adapt to that sudden change in temperature and corrosive gases in other hand can breach suits protection so that is ok too.
I was getting frostbite on a planet at 64 Deg.
Maybe it means -10c inside the spacesuit?
Maybe it's meant to be - 10 Kelvin...

...
Argon, the true king. 👑
Mind you, I was running around on -120 moons and didn't get frostbite once while I was farming the 500 inorganic resource achievement.
such silly game logic. todd needs to hire better people. it's like the devs need to be babysat and have their hands held while at work
There's no avoiding the issue that Starfield is a science fiction game created by people who didn't bother to do basically any research. As well as this silliness, there is the sleeping/waiting mechanic that makes you choose the number of local hours you want to rest for and then converts that into UTC hours. Which makes absolutely no sense. A local hour could easily last days or months on some of these planets and humans, being from Earth and all, will always want to sleep for 7-10 UTC hours.
I haven't verified this myself and didn't watch the whole video I'm getting this from but they don't understand how guns work as well.
The other thing is being susceptible to solar radiation while NG+ and giving off enough solar radiation that Tuala comments on it...
Saying Bethesda doesn’t understand celsius while spelling celsius wrong. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Pretty sure argon is present in the earth's atmosphere, you breathe it in every day! It's like 0.1% of the air you breathe
its us fault not bethesda cmon
That's my main problem with Starfield, the space hazards are none existen or poorly designed.

The space exploration setting let's you do a bunch of interesting stuff in terms of design, like lava planets, asteroids falling down so you have to get cover, heavy snow of desert storms....but here you don't even have to worry about oxygen...so lame
It's like in Project Zomboid. Freezing to death in -5C while running around in layers of clothing carrying a sledgehammer.
Dude, your spacesuit has been riddled with hundreds of bullet holes and still somehow manages to keep you alive. The only thing without extra holes is probably your helmet.

Also, I agree with you :)
Has anyone tried only wearing the helmet but not the suit?
-10 its pretty hot from a Canadian perspective 😂😂
Right I'm from Boston and you see morons walking around in shorts all the time in -10 celcius
I'll bet the modding community will have this fixed before Bethesda
Bethesda:  Ebony is a metal, corundum is a metal, corundum plus iron equals steel?  THAT Bethesda?
You walk for an hour on - 10 with jeans t-shirt and a jacket? What?
maybe I just a big puss but I'd freeze my ass off in Germany when I do this at - 10
You are thinking about what is happening in bethesda game. You are breaking the safety protocol. That's not how you supposed to interact with it.
Spacesuits which we picked up off dead people. we forgot to repair the laser holes. OOPS.
No man's sky is simply much better than this lazy attempt of a game.
Obviously it's -10⁰ Kelvin

/s
At least they can spell it.
Is this really something to complain about? Chill out
Lung damage inside a suit during a sand storm always gets me.
Why not wear the broken do not use helmet? Immersion restored!
When I was in Costa Rica, I was on the coast and it was averaging 33C. In the Capitol, San José, it was 26C. Everyone was walking around like it was winter. So I get it... I think?
I put the game down until a later date with 20 hrs in but I remember my.first mission om Kreet with that blonde from Constellation, she was literally running around the surface of the moon without a suit while I was reminded to put mine on by the oxygen gauge loool was odd to me thought ah was an alien
I think it's more an issue of game balance. Whether you think they're successful or not is another issue, but they do lots of things that aren't scientifically realistic for the sake of making it a game.
Since the last patch I'm getting frostbite everywhere I go. Even on the surface of temperate planets in tropical forrests. 
I put a skill point into chemistry just to be able to produce the half dozen or so heal pastes and injectors I need for every planetary excursion
Don't forget getting frostbite in your space suit on a planet with NO AIR

WHERE IS THE HEAT GOING, TODD? ARE THERE HEAT PUMPS IN MY BOOTS?

Oh, or how about this? There's a questline where you help a group of LIST settlers run Spacers out of their system. The game describes all of these settlers as farmers, but NONE OF THEM LIVE ON THE 2 TEMPERATE PLANETS IN THEIR SYSTEM! The guy who contacts you lives on an "Inferno" planet entirely covered in scalding hot jagged rocks.

Then again, LIST settlers may all be idiots because a while back I helped some random colonists who had been living in a hut made of shipping containers for 2 generations deal with pirates who had moved into the lavishly furnished, fully climate controlled, abandoned science base one mile away.
I do think it's extreme to get frostbite at -10c° in a suit that's supposed to be protective. Without a suit though that is literally freezing. People have died from being exposed to that for too long.
It's almost as if the game that culminates in a multi-dimensional shift across universes isn't actually intended to be a pure simulation of life in space.


Who'd have thought.
And we can somehow walk around Venus without being crushed to death by the insane atmospheric pressure there.
Bethesda doesn't understand a lot of things... there are lots of silly designs that are either from a position of ignorance or willful stupidity / laziness.
imo, Bethesda as a developer is fearful of risk and consequence for players.

their biggest fear is players encountering adversity. this is seen in their writing - players are often put in the position of a *faultless, do-gooder* etc. it's seen in their gameplay - essential NPCs, players can become leader of anything regardless of actions etc. and it's seen in their mechanics - meaningless environmental challenges. even their worlds 

their RPGs are really bland, and have about as much edge as a balloon 😂
I was on a planet that claimed it had one plant and 2 animals, and said they were primordial life forms, so I was expecting small bugs, I land on the planet, it's -200 celcuis, I scan the plant, it reproduces by flowering, I find the animals, they are indeed bugs only one is much larger then me and the other is medium dog size, also there's no oxygen on this planet, one of my points of interest led to me to a dead forest of trees to scan a meteorite, the plant I scanned and the dead trees were not the same thing.
I don't know where you're from, but for me -10C definitely isn't "just wear a jacket" weather.
You need to play the game for at least 200 hours before the spacesuit becomes fun and protects against hypothermia
[deleted]
Don't get me started on "toxic gas" while I am wearing a vacuum rated suit.
On a planet where it said the temp was 410 degrees Celsius and there was solid lead (melts at 375 c) and mercury which would have been vapor...
I was just thinking about how Zelda Breath of the Wild understands temperature extremes better than Bethesda. Which I know is like comparing a Victoria Secret model to Mama June. But we got like 1 mission where we had to overcome the environmental challenges… it just seems like a waste. We could have had temperature ratings on space suits or ballistic ratings. 

I love how hydration isn’t a factor either. We need H3 for our settlements but not for our own ship. 

You know what would be dope is if we got marooned on planets for having too much weight to make it to orbit or if we budgeted for fuel, water, O2, etc but found a stowaway.
You don't understand fiction
My question is…

How in hades do you wear a shirt and pants over a bulky spacesuit?
There's also the poison gas that affects you in a spacesuit. No wonder you can't spacewalk with these janky-ass leaky spacesuits
I have done workouts outside with shorts and no shirt in temperatures around that. Not for long, but still longer than it takes for my character in a spacesuit to get frostbite.
So immersive!
This is one of the more egregious immersion breakers for me. Severe weather at -10c is not worse for me than -180 with no weather whatsoever. The biggest offender so far seems to be the Vanguard quest on Londinion. I'm hit with afflictions every couple of minutes for the entire quest. It's ridiculous.
I got frost damage and frostbite at -1 degrees Celsius. After that I was on a moon with an atmosphere and -50 degrees and nothing happened 🤷🏼‍♂️🙈😂
They’re really computer/coding/ graphics nerds not scientists guys lol
Yeah the way spacesuits work is totally bizarre. It'd make more sense if we were in normal clothes with maybe just a breath mask on. But in a space suit? 90% of the atmospheric stuff shouldn't bother us.
Bethesda apparently doesn't even understand what made exploration in Bethesda games good. I think expecting a little care in the design of environmental hazards is way out of their league.
Yeah, that is weird. 

But not the fact that you’re carrying 5 rifles 5 pistols, 1500 lbs of resources. 18  spacesuits, 27 helmets. 250lbs of medication and fly a ship that can jump million of lightyear 50 x a day.

….But the cold thing’s weird.
Same thing but at minus ONE. I got frost bite, I don't remember which planet or mission, but I check my scanner and it's -1? I fully know what -1 feels like, frostbite in a space suit is just dumb
Yeah these space suits are amazing - armored and highly bullet resistant - which is fine for gameplay - but so underdeveloped on every other front.  Like I can see limits on O2 and radiation protection being a thing, but yeah problems with mild temperatures?  Toxic gasses getting into your breathing supply?  Building up Co2 to dangerous levels when exerting oneself slightly?

Just usual Bethesda underthinking and under-developing I guess, but it makes it seem like they're really not that interested in space, because they haven't thought about the kinds of problems you would actually encounter, you know, in space.

Which is funny because of how moony eyed Starfield wants to be about the majesty of space or something....
.  
.   .... ....... ... ..!.  ......... .!...                        .                                                                                                                                                 . .            .                                                                              ..
List of things Bethesda doesn't understand:

...  
17645. this.  
...
I don't care about temperature, I'm just so fucking tired of getting a toxic effect the instant I go anywhere near a gas vent. Sometimes I can stand in it enough to actually get the resources, and sometimes it's literally instantaneous when I'm just using my boost pack a few feet from one.

And don't get me started on water. On most planets with creatures in the ocean that I had to scan, the water was toxic or freezing, and would start to kill me if I touched it. So, I'm forced to skirt the coast and use my boost pack for brief jumps over the water. Then, to top it all off, I almost died getting an artifact from its cave, because I was fighting the guardian and didn't fucking realize I was standing toe-deep in a puddle and it was taking away all my health.
They are Americans, they are not very smart.
No reason to beef up your enviromental resistances, goijg to get wrecked anyways so just bring meds.
Lmaooo almost like the didn't do any significant research and just slapped a temp gauge in the corner because "space game". Fuck this game.
I was somewhere the other day and it was +28 yet somehow the planet looked like Hoth and I'm taking front damage.
Yup. Also that -10 is the planets temperature, not the place your actually at. We have literally no way of knowing WHAT the temperature is ANYWHERE on a planet. Because our dumb watchs only gives us the 'global temp'. For earth that's like 14.7c or something.

Sure as shit isn't 58f here in the summer I tell you hhwhat. Well, except sometimes it is, at night, depending on how lucky or unlocky of a summer we're having.

No idea why the hell they don't show us local temp. You would think that would be more useful information then the overall temp of the planet as a whole.

Curious how Bethesda thinks the shields on ships work honestly. Light passes through it unless it's a weapon, then it damages shields super good somehow. EMP, a cloud of electric-whatever bypasses it completely? I feel like that shit should be reversed but I haven't seen an in-game explanation in how their shields work.
They don’t understand landing and taking off from planets so they had to put loading screens in place because it was too confusing for them
American Devs
"Working as intended"
I legit walk around in Reykjavík at -15°C while wearing a shirt sometimes and I have yet to catch Hypothermia or Frostbite.  


It IS annoying especially considering the Spacesuits....now if they let me walk on a planet at -100°C okay it at least makes sense on a gameplay level but they really need to "lower the bar" on when it is too cold for our character.
TODD WAS IN THE CHESS CLUB!
You can also remove your helmet in a vacuum.  Yes you will eventually die but that should not even be an option.  Mass produced products usually have built in protections for the most stupid because lawyers.
Ha they labeled fahrenheit temps as celsius lmao. -10 fahrenheit would be cold as fuck.
At -10°C to -29°C it IS possible to get frostbite so dont say its not. Howerer you are also right, the space suits should protect you from that freezing temperature. Also it is quite dumb for you to be walking around in -10°C in just jeans and a T-shirt and a jacket, the relatively low chance of getting frostbite at that temperature was researched by humans wearing propper clothing for that temperature.
You think Bethesda ever gave a shit about details?
Would the atmosphere make a difference?
I love a huge plume of argon doing corrosive damage to me. ARGON
I swear I can hear the beeping of suit protection depleted in my dreams at this point
And none from disturbing beryllium, lead or antimony compounds with a smoking industrial laser.
Yeah that doesn't make sense to me. I'm in an airtight suit...
Yeah that one really confused me at first.  I'm in a space suit, in a near-vacuum, and I get lung damage?  I mean, that's just plain stupid and world breaking.
Or from dust storms
I'd like to lump in that they don't understand use of projectile weapons inside pressurised vessels, like habs & ships... melee in space should be a life skill
This space suit issue is a good complaint.  In 1969 when humans first walked on the moon in a space suit, were they randomly getting hypothermia?  No, did this game forget to program correctly that we have a space suit on?
That and the difference between inorganic and organic molecules. Those two bother me a lot. Like was it so hard to know that the “iron family of inorganics” shouldn’t contain ALKANES???

Was there seriously not a single person who worked in this thing who took freshman level chemistry?
It doesn't really explain this from a realistic standpoint, but the game actually mentions this early on. Lin explains that some gas is so toxic it will "kill you in your suit" or something along those lines. Pretty ridiculous if your suit is airtight enough to be pressurized, but the game is at least following its own rules.
The suits also seem to recharge protection like a capacitor as well as o2...

Just think if the space suits were more realistic the o2 meter would be a timer you could be away from a o2 source sure explain the looooong run time as rebreather/air scrubber tech is just that good. You would be un affected by air quality while worn you would need to replace or repair the suit. Every bullet...
I feel like the reasoning is that the suit actively filters oxygen for the user, thus why we don't need to take it off. When we sprint, we inhale more oxygen than the suit can handle and produce too much co2 for it to expunge. When we encounter a dangerous gas in concentration, it overloads the filter and gets into the suit.

If you don't like that explanation, then just assume space magic
It's even funnier knowing that Bethesda apparently nerfed environmental damage hard shortly before going gold.
Maybe they should make it so that when you pass toxic gas or substances your suits get “tainted” or “contaminated” and you have to clean it or get a new one otherwise people get upset about you basically walking around like a dirty musky miner.
That one actually makes sense, but only literal hellholes like Venus.

The spacesuits will have protection that will deteriorate over time. The problem? By the time you get "lung damage", it will already be working overtime, and in 30 seconds you'd be dead forever. 30 after that, you'd just be a smudge, crushed under 92 atm and lead melting temperatures.
putting aside the fact that I'm even able to operate on a planet with such drastic gravity, why am I not able to carry more weight/mass on planets with low gravity? why can I not carry less weight on planets with gravity significantly higher than 1.0? Why is my SPACESHIP'S carry capacity based on mass and weight? I'd get it if it was for landing and taking off from planets, but cargo crates don't add more thrust, if anything they only add MORE weight, and it doesn't work in space either. I'd also get it if they meant a more general "this is how much physical space your item takes up" idea, but then a weight plate shouldn't take up 40x more space than a dinner tray
I had a random encounter with a person who had isolated herself due to some sort of contageon. She just up and left town to die on her own.

* It was pneumonia.
 * We know what that is now, why would it be a mystery in the future
* I treated her with a med pack via dialog iirc
 * med packs do not resolve pneumonia in game
* I caught pneumonia from her (which is how I knew it wasn't a mystery illness)
 * I could not treat myself with a med pack, I had to use the appropriate aid item
 * WE WERE BOTH IN SPACE SUITS

But the most bizarre part of the random encounter is:

* I was on THE MOON. Earth's Moon. In a space suit
* In a cave, because the moon has those apparently
* There are no towns she left from to hide in this cave to die
* That's a lot of effort involved to suit up, just to go into a cave and wait to die.

I assume this was a carry-over random encounter that would fit with Elder Scrolls or Fallout. Hell, it would probably fit in Neon or the Well -- no caves in either, but lots of poor who might not be able to afford treatment. And atmosphere. But *THE MOON?*
Also let me cure an ailment from the status screen! I assume I use the scanner to identify the issue, so it should also pop up with "do you want to use an injector for your lung damage?" Or some other option for quick healing without scrolling through an item list
*removed

If it’s vestigial and serves no purpose, just cut it and reintroduce it if they actually come through with a survival mode. It’s currently a feature that is a buggy nuisance and makes no sense.
If we’re in a suit in an environment that needs one, make us start hemorrhaging oxygen if we get shot until we apply a patch kit.

If we’re *not* in a suit, *then* we can start taking damage from gas vents.
It's the Bethesda motto: "(Modders) will fix it in post."
Beeing british myself i can confirm we would be killed by 30c heat we just arnt built for it 🤣🤣🤣
Right? I mean, I wouldn't want to be in a suit at 30°C. I easily get heat exhaustion, but my 24th Century Hero with magic powers should be pretty OK at that temp.
Yeah, but it’s a dry -200 C
And at -273ºC you're 0K
Cold in a vacuum is quite meaningless. Getting rid of heat is much more of a problem.
Actually what matters more is the atmosphere. Freezing rain at -10 C would cool you much faster than -200 C on a moon with no atmosphere. Because without an atmosphere, there is no convection for heat transfer. Heat rejection from spacesuits on the moon was actually a challenge.
This is explained in lore because the spacesuits are in fact lined with a futuristic material called Boron Solfide (B₂S₃). 😏
Coughing will actually break you out of stealth and broadcast your current location to nearby hostile forces
Just another half baked feature, like most of the game
I played the game for 10-15 hours and didn't even really realize these things were happening until i read about it here and other places.
It’s a fantasy game cosplaying sci-fi. Fallout was the same, only the apocalyptic theme made things like lack of vehicles make sense.
I hate -40. We usually hit one or two days a year. I have issues breathing after about -25. But... you know... space suit!
Maybe that’s why apparel got resistances?
That makes a lot of sense. There's still some remnants of this in the suit stats. And it would make spacesuit mods more appealing, outside of adding to carry weight or whatever. 

Some of the current spacesuits - like Shocktroop, Bounty Hunter, Ecliptic - look more like your idea of unsealed "light suits". And, even some apparel outfits - Security Guard, UCSEC, First Soldier, some of the UC Navy and pirate outfits - would all fit that bill as being an "unsealed" armor too. Little to no environmental protection, but should have good armor ratings.

Because then you have some spacesuits that are, aesthetically, absolutely not for combat. But meant to sealed and used as a proper spacesuit. Like Deepcore & Deimos, Deep Recon, Explorer, Constellation, and Trucker suits. 

And then there's a few that look like something in the middle, like a sealed combat spacesuit. With okayish armor and environmental resistances. UC marine suits, Pirate suits, Deep Seeker, Varuun, Navigator and Tracker's Alliance suits, in my mind.
Hell, if you tuck one of those chemical glove warmers behind your sack, you’re good till minus 15 in shorts.
As a Minnesotan I feel like we'd just make comments like, "It's getting a little chilly" and then go back to our normal procedure. But hypothermia? People are out here surfing on Lake Superior in like -17° C and they think -10°C is going to kill me? Come on, man.
If read a certain way, it sounds like you wild things just run around naked at -11°

I'd believe it.
Yeah. No drift. Yet rocks have drift.
I just assume it's a flight assist thing.
>Turn off the the thrusters -> immediately come to a stop

If you have braking thrusters on your ship you'll see them activate when it slows down, like when ending a boost. Logically one wouldn't brake the ship, just enjoy the speed, but eh it's combat balance as speed affects enemy accuracy
Also, I hate that there‘s sound in space. Okay, in first person I get it. I mean it doesn’t make sense to hear things outside of your shuttle but okay. but it kinda kills it for me when there‘s sound when I am flying in third person.
Yeah, it's a weird way to limit running.
Mercury's coldest temperatures are lower than Pluto's hottest, FWIW. 

Temperatures don't behave how you'd expect on bodies without atmospheres.

Now I need those 10,000 vacuum tape I ignored earlier
That's exactly what I mean. It's annoying, as a Canadian knowing I just took out the trash in my crocs at -15 while my character is dying.
Right? They literally have built in thermal regulation!
Gotcha! I think Todd Howard is just a projection.
I can forgive a lot, especially if it's attached to an obscure field, but *temperature* and *weight* are things we all live with every day!
I don't think you need to be a chemist or engineer to understand that space suit = not breathing the shit outside the suit. The company that let's *that* logic fall through the cracks is beyond help. They looked at a picture of a man floating in the vacuum of space, sealed inside of an airtight suit to keep him alive, and said "but what if the air was spicy?". And not a single motherfucker raised there hand and said "Are you an idiot?" That is some "your scuba tank and rig don't let you breathe underwater" levels of dumbass. Bethesda tried their hand at making their own IP and created a space sci-fi setting that spits in the face of every space/sci-fi that plays it. It ls worse than Cyberpunk was. Because even though cyberpunk launched like shit, and was full of bugs, atleast the fucking *writing* made sense. Cyberpunk was fixed with patches because the issues were technical. Starfield can't be fixed with patches because the problems are fundamental to the DNA of the game. They couldn't decide on what gameplay should look like, and clearly don't give two shits about gameplay mechanics making sense or *even being explained properly.*

I was a gifted student in school. And I eventually just stopped trying and got by on the fact that everyone remembered me getting good test scores once upon a time. So take it from me when I say that Starfield is the pile of shit essay they wrote at the last minute just to say they did it, and they are banking on your remembering them as a good company and ignoring all the glaring flaws. They've gotten lazy, the games they make are shit, the only reason Starfield hasn't been completely dragged through the mud is because it came from Bethesda. I'm not afraid to say that Bethesda has been slipping since Fallout 4, and the success or failure of Starfield will be what decides if Bethesda tries to make good content again, or just turns into a content mill of generic action and payed-roleplay bullshit like Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, or Far Cry. Keep in mind this is the company that made a Fallout MMO *without NPCs.* They just don't give a fuck anymore.
Yes. I absolutely want to loot a space suit I just plugged full of holes.

"This is fine"
Its not just these things, going back to fallout 3 and skyrim and fallout 4, so many key features seem to be nonexistent in starfield or completely undercooked.
I know...🤣🤣🤣
But Bethesda is in Maryland.
Honestly, none of it makes sense when there's no volume and a planet's gravity doesn't change the mass you carry. 200Kg at 1g is only 50kg at 0.25g I should be able to carry 4x as much (or whatever my base capacity is).

A cargo link thing so you can move material to your ship is 200kg max. Like it can hold 2 people in spacesuits, and that's it. A base storage box holds 70kg.
-10 is skiing, and sledding weather.
Fair enough. By the time I caught it, I couldn't edit it.
As I understand it, the enviro system is horribly convoluted and unintuitive. There’s a base ambient condition determined by the atmosphere and temperature of the planet (toxic, corrosive, extreme ambient cold, solar radiation, etc) which just determines your vulnerability to “acute” conditions like acid rain, freezing rain, scorching rain, etc. Basically, the temperature and atmosphere of the planet determines how quickly you get afflictions from transient weather conditions that come and go. You’re perfectly fine to walk around on a freezing planet forever until it starts to rain, for example. Which is a stupid system.
I get about 2 days of -40. The poles see like -75 and even without a helmet they go outside and don't get instant frostbite.
Ah yes, the famously lethal INERT GAS…
Argon is hilarious to me. I often go through it just to test it. :D

Also, I don't think that argon would come from a big pile of poo... H2S or CH4 maybe.
It's like they wanted to be scientific, but they didn't bother even consulting a scientist.
There is more argon in Earth's atmosphere than CO2 RIGHT NOW.
Also, Fluor literally dissolves glass and silicates. It's the only gas that should destroy the spacesuits and yet its effects are the same as of Argon. :)
I saw a load screen note about the "lead group" of ores.

I think you just need to abandon all science.
Bethesda: "we can't have in game space travel because the realistic distance between planets means that would take a long time." 

Also Bethesda: "here's space magic and inert gases filter through your spacesuit and kill you."
I've been preserving my wine with Argon all this time, NOT EVEN KNOWING I'VE BEEN SLOWLY KILLING MYSELF
It's argovating
I use argon in my drysuit...
Thank you
It's inert dumb Bethesda lol
This is giving me an acid flashback to one of those confusing-as-fuck, Adult Swim fake infomercials I remember seeing a decade or so ago about Jesus. It's a group of huckster bible salesman trying to sell bad Jesus artifacts while they slowly go delusional from getting gassed with argon.

"Hey, argon preserves documents, so it should preserve humans as well. If anything, we should be breathing more argon."

"I was in Lake Nyos in 1986, we were gasping for breath, but our lungs wouldn't fill!"

"Nonsense, there's nothing wrong with the argon! We're just having problems; when Jesus had problems he didn't blame them all on argon!"
I think there are many ways that the game design team would have benefitted from a high school science teacher.
As a chemist there is some hilariously inaccurate chemistry in this game. 

Like, straight up dumb level inaccuracies lol.
*cough cough* during a dialogue with my companion
The only reason I’ve died in the game is from Accute radiation poisoning, I don’t even notice the beeps and I’m dead in a vat of goo.  Or mushroom spores.
Me too.  Though that is mostly due to getting the "poor air quality" bug...
Or radioactive uranium, for that matter
In Morrowind if a dust storm kicked up, you'd hold your left hand up to shield your face. Never understood why this never made a comeback.
It would have been nice if they considered this *at all* because as it is ballistic weapons are ridiculously powerful and there’s no reason to use anything else besides maybe particle weapons. Having ballistic weaponry skills stack with gun type skills, and then having additional skills for semi auto or scoped was such a dumb decision when melee just has “melee I guess?”
And a compelling use case for energy weapon development.
My particle weapon that can knock a random pirate across the room and detonate a fuel tank from 80 meters away but has absolutely no effect on an empty ~~paper~~ synthfoam coffee cup? Seems safe enough on a ship.

/s
Of course real space suits have literally the opposite issue, that being, that they're so well insulated that they have to be actively cooled to prevent you from getting heat stroke even at -100C
It certainly wouldn't surprise me if they simply forgot to properly program in Space Suit Functionality...
There’s even this fantastic tool called the internet you can research things if you don’t know them, maybe Bethesda staff will use it one day.
Corrosive gas makes sense as you could say it's melting seals on the suit.
Vacuum tape becomes the most precious commodity
On planets with enough oxygen in the atmosphere where you don't need a helmet, you should be able to sprint with a much slower co2 buildup since you're not breathing into your enclosed suit system. BUT, without the helmet, you should be susceptible to breathing toxic gas vents. 

Wearing the helmet should be an option on those planets, granting you a smaller, oxygen supply and/or faster co2 buildup in exchange for immunity to those stupid vents. Maybe they could make some of the really nasty ones corrosive enough to damage your suit, but the majority shouldn't bother you if it's supposed to be air tight.
I get hit by gas while on planets/moons with no atmosphere.
Or assume Bethesda must be full of idiots who don't know how to use Wikipedia, that seems to be the most popular theory.
And use some of that ubiquitous vacuum tape to seal up holes from getting shot at while wearing your suit.
Decontamination shower in the landing bay. Come in off a frozen hellworld with your suit all coated in nasty, corrosive, uh, *argon*, and wash that shit off into the drain.
Scrolling through a huge list of aid items to cure something is the most tedious thing without having a separate category of med items from food and buff chems. But inventory in general really needs a lot of work in this game.
Me running around with ever ailment known to man.

Scanner: "Eyy fam ya whole shits kinda fucked, you want these 6 meds?"
This is my biggest beef with the system. Sure, the ailments make no sense but they add some flavor I guess. But please, please just make it easier to use items to heal. My inventory of aid items is massive. I hate scrolling the entire list looking for the right color icon. Make it easier!
Yeah it's honestly just a minor bother in actual gameplay. So much so that I essentially just ignore it. No real need for it imo
There was something about the original design requiring different suits for different environments but in the end they judged that too survival-oriented instead of just a fun game. Not realizing that space gamers are definitely into that kind of thing. A++ for whoever designed the original system. F-- to Todd for putting the kibosh on it.
I disagree with this. Some planets need to be hell. I hate that we can just chill out on Venus without consequences.
Agreed.
"Say, what is that giant ball of fire in the sky?"

"Sun?"

"Ah, sun? Sure glad we don't have one of those in England!"
It was 35c in Edinburgh when I visited last year. It was 38c in London the same day.

But yeah, it is miserable if you don't have a/c. Our hotel in Edinburgh didn't have a/c, so my dad and I found a pub down the street that did and basically spent all day there.
We in Australia call that a summer night time.
Maybe all of starfield is just a what if of the British empire constantly expanding hence why -10 is near lethal and 30 degrees is far too hot
Same, but really considering we can walk on more than 400°C Venus surface in this game, I would think our characters could handle 30 just fine lol
This is a hilarious comment. You've made a funnier joke than every meme ive seen today
Thank you for your service 🫡
Ok, kelvin
But he doesn't know,  since, well, he's 0K
Yeah but when I have that condition, it’s guns blazing time.
Yesterday I got a sprain after boosting too high and hitting the ground too hard. Went to check the status screen expecting to see some sort of penalty to movement or whatever. 

Just made sneaking use O2. 

Not only is the stealth mechanic almost a complete non factor for me, but at that moment I was busy slaughtering high level fauna to level up, so I simply laughed and continued.
Well, I saw the little notifications in the upper right corner of my screen, but, they went by so fast I figured they didn't mean anything.
It doesn't even make sense in the lore of Fallout. You literally get a car in the second game
Fun Fact! -40 is where C and F match up.
Yes! I think that’s why. It might’ve been the “unsealed gear” you wore on Earth-like planets to get a little protection.
Nah. We get snow up to my glove warmer. It is insufficient.
Oh you mean the large masses drifting yet in a stable orbit? The ones that become meaningless dust when shot enough times?
They're a lot closer than one would intuitively expect, but I still don't see Pluto being warmer than Mercury at any point. Pluto's warmest is estimated at around -369 F, while Mercury's coldest is estimated around -300 F.
It does say "protection depleted" but tells us nothing about what that means.
Your character may be dying of frostbite but I’m dying of laughter right now.
yeah, I'm in winnipeg and I've gone to school in a hoodie in temperatures that apparently kill Starborn lol
That makes it worse honestly
200kg is 200kg everywhere. Kilograms are a measure of mass.

You're talking about weight, which is a force measured in Newtons.

200kg weighs 1962N at 1g, 491N at 0.25g.
So my Argon filled windows are corrosive?!?!?! OMG!!! HOW COULD THEY USE SOMETHING SO DANGEROUS IN MY WINDOWS?!?!?! 🤣
Space suits are just body covering gasmasks that filter the bad air from space!
I mean, if you inhale too much argon, you will die, but it will suffocation, not corrosive.
Actually that's a good point. Maybe they just mislabeled it in Dev and is just a big.

Stranger bugs happen in Bethesda games
They didn't even bother consulting Wikipedia, much less a real scientist.
They didn’t bother doing any reading about the systems they wanted to use as far as I’m concerned. I got my undergrad in biology so I was super stoked to meet a xenobiologist, and then Hadrian gave me the binomial name for terrormorphs. They didn’t even bother formatting the name correctly in the subtitles. Like, to begin with, in my experience, biologists don’t use scientific names when they’re speaking to someone who is outside of that field because the person they’re telling about this thing doesn’t need that information and they’re not going to know what to do with it anyway, unless they’re trying to differentiate between two things that share a common name. There’s only one thing called terrormorphs in this universe, unless I’m sorely mistaken. If I start spouting off about *Pisaster ochraceus* when I’m talking to a patron at an aquarium, they’re going to look at me like I’m stupid for expecting them to know what the hell that is. If I tell them to check out this cool ochre star, they’re gonna get it. But on top of that, they used the naming conventions incorrectly by having both names in the subtitles capitalized. It’s been a week since I experienced that and I’m still upset about it. It’s such a small thing but it was so much more upsetting than any of the other little type-o’s I’ve seen in the subtitles.
Good thing we're on the ground
Good thing we're not wearing space suits then... phew... was close...
It should also be super poisonous besides just corrosion but nope just as dangerous as friggin helium
That's hydroflouric acid. Or chlorine triflouride ...

&#x200B;

Also, yeah right, no need to worry about dust from radioactive metals if your suit isn't 100% tight.
I saw a load screen note telling me about refueling my ship… yeah, about that…
As a chemist, the ones about "families" of elements hurt my brain so bad...
Biggest miss of all time to not have space travel with a couple warp points on interstellar ley lines, or some other bullshit I could make up in my sleep, to get from system to system, to have interactive travel and random event mechanics.
There's a steam game called interstellar Rift.. I think they handle traveling from system to system and planet to planet really well. You could alter your speed so it could take 30s-3min or lower the speed and it'll take 5min-10min to travel. Hell you can go at the lowest jump speed and it'll take days to travel to a planet (I haven't actually sat for days though.) Longest I set the speed was for 10min so I can rearrange some cargo and prep for the mission. I really wish starfield had some of the mechanics of that game
Every day you breath that shit you're one day nearer death...
You should switch to Chlorine gas in your wine bottles! It'll be MUCH safer!
You mean like scuba drysuit? What in the world needs argon there?
To their credit, uranium is barely radioactive like, at all. Half life in the hundreds of millions of years.
Not to mention Plutonium - IIRC, toxic AF even if you disregard the radioactivity... (Or that a kilogram of the stuff probably doesn't naturally exist in the whole galaxy combined IRL).
[deleted]
They learned nothing from Morrowind.  Even with the god awful combat, it was their one truly good and interesting game and they took away absolutely 0 lessons from it.
The insane stacking & cross multiplying of high tier ballistic skills had me singing the 'murica song every time I levelled- for a good 20 levels haha
I was really surprised at the limited energy weapons in-game. What could be better than a proper sniper rifle that fires at the speed of light? Nope. Mini-guns, shotguns, and all those _wood inlaid_ pistols and Wild West bs. I feel like 2/3 of the weapons are re-used _Fallout_ assets.
The...in-ter-net? Do they have that on computers now?
But after you used an injektor or whatever heals that on yourself, the suit suddenly is airtight again? Nah  nothing about the gas, temperature, corrosion, radiation etc. system makes any sense.

My char freezes at -10 degree, but not at -213 degree. Also there are living breathing creatures around, while there is 0% oxygen and other nonsense. The whole system is garbage.
True, right up until you realize that the "corrosive gas" is ARGON...
Random guy on Reddit creates a simple but significantly better game mechanic for Starfield than Bethesda could muster in 10 years of development. 

GOTY
This is how suit integrity worked in No Man's Sky.

There are protection modules that get worn out first, *then* you begin to take damage from it. That's why you could walk on planets that were literally on fire and be fine for 15 minutes due to the suit keeping the wearer cooled down. And why you could go underwater in the suit and still breathe until your O2 eventually runs out. Only sudden temperature and radiation extremes would cause direct damage. It baffles me why nobody at Bethesda would have thought to adopt a similar mechanic.
Space magic it is lmao
They have WAY more curative meds than the game possibly needs, it's some sort of "more is always better" design philosophy they seem to have, and that's on top of having 3 types of what are essentially the same basic healing item and god knows how many enhancement chems.
I like the Sky UI version of the favorites menu where it had 8 separate categories you could assign different things to, like magic schools and equipment/potions. I wish someone would do that for Starfield. Because it's driving me nuts to have to fight with assigning hot keys to each power selection or pulling up the whole ass menu.
StarUI is out and they did exactly what you said and in general their menu is much better than vanilla.
Also it feels like there's way too many aid items that "feel" specialized, but are all doing the same things with different amounts of crossover. I don't get it
"Huff this panacea and call me in the mornin'."
I've stopped picking up food or drink items (unless they grant XP, then I'll grab and forget), makes getting to the medical item I need a bit easier.
I honestly would’ve been okay with a tiered system of armors. Breathable > not breathable > extreme environment would’ve been a great compromise. No idea why they decided on this boring half baked system them got going on.
It should just be an option. I wouldn’t want this mechanic as it sounds tedious and annoying and ultimately just sounds like even more loading screens as you forget to change your suit and have to re-enter the ship and change it.

But a toggle for environmental damage difficulty would appeal to both types of player. Bethesda doesn’t bother with stuff like this though because it knows the community will develop mods for it. And then Bethesda can just take those mods and include them in a future special edition. Free development and testing!
Given the appauling amount of menu crawling, I'm kinda glad the system is this dumb. I honestly couldn't think of anything more tedious than having to constantly equip different suits every time I land somewhere.
Honestly, they were right to put the kibosh on it. Most players don't want to deal with that. There's already enough going on in this game, and having to manage your spacesuits for every planet you visit would get clunky. There will almost certainly be a hardcore/survival mode that will incorporate those original design ideas, and I'm looking forward to that.
Totally agree with your last point. My problem is that the current mechanic is pretty clearly vestigial from an older build that would’ve spoken to the kind of scenario you laid out. Instead, we’re chilling (pun intended) on a -200°C planet with no issues and getting frostbite and toxic gas poisoning while in our space suits on a -10°C planet. The feature as it currently stands has no meaningful connection to the rest of the game, it regularly breaks player immersion, and frankly just is an annoying debuff. They needed to either commit to having a mode where any of the statuses were actually leveraged and worthwhile or they needed to cut the system because it no longer interlocked with any of the gameplay.
The moon should be mostly radiation and temperature extremes. Mars should have windstorm extremes. But Venus? That should be cooking you and crushing you by the second outside of a ship from the future specifically shielded against it.
> "Say, what is that giant ball of fire in the sky?"


*runs away screaming in Irish Ginger*
Yeh our houses are built to keep heat in and ac is faaar from common domesticaly at least
Thank God our suits don't have lead In them! 

*looks at my bullets*

*Ah, shite...*
this game has awful stealth anyway.  1 person glances at you from a football field away and the whole base sees you.  even the guys inside buildings.   i tried to do stealth a few times as i'm a big hitman fan, eventually i just started using the most powerful least ammo consuming guns and just 1 shot everybody.  then i got bored and quit playing because i can 1 shot everybody on very hard...
But in Fallout 1 there were none, so working cars were definitely a rare occurrence in that world. It makes at least more sense in a post apocalyptic wasteland than in a spaceship galore sci-fi world that is all about exploration.
Less than fun fact.. it gets down to -62 with the wind here. Frosty I tell ya
Yeah. It does.
I put argon on top of my wine! Oh no I’m totes gonna die.
I personally love the physics element of the game, but chemistry seems off. Another thing is why is argon gas corrosive but I can just casually walk around in the game with plutonium and uranium like nbd
just wait til you hear about all the Dihydrogen Monoxide that they put in literally everything you consume.
If you inhale too much space, you die.
So the trick is filtering all the vacuum out from the air?
"Goggles on everyone! The cabin is filling with SPACE AIR!"
Gotta filter the nothing otherwise you die bro
Yeah but a vent free-flowing into atmosphere isn't gonna do it unless you get right up in there and suck on the motherfucker.
You have to inhale enough to displace the oxygen though. So basically it needs to be a shit ton of argon. In the game you are wearing a space suit so it really shouldn't matter. Source: I work on stuff that uses Argon as a purge gas and I wear a supplied air respirator for situations where I'm going to basically be sticking my head into a box of Argon.
Inhaling Argon is actually kinda funny.
Unlike Helium, it drops your voice like 10 octaves.
Stranger actual design decisions have also been made in BGS games.
How many years did they say it took to make the game?
In a previous post I suggested they talk to the
"Weather Girl" from their local TV news.

I stand by that comment.

Just imagine they'd consulted with Sean Murray, the guy who single handedly developed No Man's Sky.  Irony is, he's such a good guy, he'd probably have offered to help for free to make Starfield better.
I don’t think they had a science writer/copyeditor. They have a few terminals describing tests that have serious errors in measurement, incorrect hypothesis testing, or have what look like wikipedia-level basic and loooong explanations of very routine tests.
A lot of games (including Starfield) just have this fundamental tendency to portray "biologists" as if every biologist was a stereotypical scientist along for the ride in a story about 19th century explorers, not really knowledgeable about modern biology (because that would require the writers to do some research) but mad to find new species, dissect them, and give them goofy Latin (or pseudo-Latin) names. (so basically a cartoon zoologist)

In reality, if you wanted to study a multicellular alien organism at anything like the level of detail possible with *current* biological research techniques, you would need a team of hundreds or thousands of people...
You, I like you.
I snorted at this. Thank you
Helium actually is ultra skilled at going through seals and walls you'd think of as absolutely tight. However.... it's not exactly toxic in reasonable amounts, can shift your pitch though :)
I hope you took a screenshot.  But at least that's... realistic.  Although helium as a fuel source is questionable.  Not sure what the supposed energy extraction method is.  If it's fusion, I don't know why the fuck I need to mine beryllium.
Elite dangerous does it well.  Watched so many movies exploring
Thing is. In-game they do have that level of control as well. There is no reason why they can't even imitate NMS 3 Level flight speeds.

1st. Standard Thrusters.
2nd. Pulse speed(turning that 1 year flight between Mars and Earth into a 20 second one)
3rd. Grav Jump/Warp Drive
I hope we get to see something like this in the future
Technically correct, the best kind of correct
Ahhhh chlorine gas. I love the smell of it in the morning. Funeral at dusk.
Dry suits inflate. Argon is cheaper and a better insulator than air
To package all the responses and add some of my own reasons... I dive Nitrox and cold a lot, the high oxygen eats away at the seams and seals faster than air, reducing suit life. Argon is more insulating, requires a small bottle, doesn't use my air, is relatively cheap, more dense and requires less weight to compensate for bouyancy, and lastly is only connected by two boltsnaps so i don't have to disconnect when I tank juggle. I use a K2 undersuit and the combination with argon is very warm for ice diving.
Honestly I kinda doubt they have more than 20% of the same people working on Starfield that worked on their previous titles. There's a lot of churn and turnover in the games industry.
I booted up OpenMW this last week and the truly unique and 'alien' setting of Morrowind still stands out, even compared  to the much less visually distinct Oblivion an Skyrim games, from a design perspective. 

Places that just feel like Europe or Scandinavia, not some fantasy landscape like Morrowind. 

I miss that design philosophy.
At least I haven't seen any place that is -274°C yet, so they have some limits.
I wonder how often they thought "don't solve this like NMS/ED
> sort of "more is always better" design philosophy


Honestly, I kind of get it - in Morrowind and Oblivion, having so many small miscellaneous items you could pick up and move was new and immersive for the time. All that extra detail did have some kind of value in engaging the player.

I absolutely agree with you, though, they pushed this in the wrong places for Starfield. They added so, SO many redundant aid items, with such similar effects... And so many mostly useless food items. Not to mention all the excessive junk and clutter items. HUNDREDs of uniquely, beautifully modeled items...

And then we have, what - maybe a DOZEN unique spacesuit models? So many sets are just recolors, or have a couple extra bits slapped on. Even most "Unique" suits are lucky if they get custom colors/ textures.
I just got in the habit of carrying medpacks and a few panacea. hotkey both and no sweat. I ignore ailments that don't impact the task at hand- cure them in bed later. panacea for things that are impairing me.
why the favorites cross shape isnt just a wheel  like from fallout 76 just baffles me. 12 presets just doesnt feel like enough with all the powers, weapons, and chems in the game.
I would’ve cared way more about my space suit resistances if they had done this or properly implemented hazards impacting the player. 

The corrosive gas debuff would’ve especially worked better if suits had durability. You could’ve convinced me that exposure was damaging your suit leading to health losses or even death if severe. Instead it’s just my lungs were damaged and the player is left wondering how tf that’d even be possible.
That idea really fixes my biggest world immersion nitpick with the game. It's bizzare that our character walks around wearing an EVA space suit as body armor on planets with earthlike conditions. I mean realistically with the suit design in the game everyone would be waddling around, struggling to shoulder a rifle.
Probably someone convinced Todd that the bigger audience didn't want nerdy game mechanics. The whole thing smacks of that sentiment.
Honestly, my biggest gripe is that there is no auto-toggle to put on / take off the suit based on environmental conditions. 

This way, my character simply always is in the suit because it just makes no sense to take it off one item at a time and then to remember to put it on the next time you leave your ship for what is essentially cosmetic reasons.
It could easily have been sorted through UI DESIGN! Give the player the ability to choose, say, three loadouts: one for breathable planets, one for unbreathable planets, and another for extreme environments. Game chooses the most appropriate armor loadout you set automatically.
It's not the lack of it I'm salty about right now. It's the band aid system they went gold with where, as was previously pointed out, the temps don't make sense, you're taking illogical environmental damage while in a sealed suit, etc.
>1 person glances at you from a football field away and the whole base sees you

Unless you are landing your football field sized ship 20 feet from them. Then no one sees you or knows you are coming.
Ha yeah, I noticed a couple of times the AI goes "looking" for you. But it doesn't do it sneaky, it tries to get line of sight (because you know, the AI already exactly knows where you're at. The NPC's 'don't') and then you'll instantly be detected by all enemies.

On the other hand I've had enemy AI run towards other NPC's to warn them.

It's like a 50/50 mix of when which one gets applied by the situation
It's especially stupid when you're sniping from distance. The first man goes down, the base is alerted, everyone (including in airlocks, shooting through the door) starts shooting directly at your position, scoring hits, but you're still technically hidden since you're still getting stealth attacks from 'caution'. This will continue until either one of them gets brave and collapses on you or you move to the magic detection range and then the sneak meter moves to 'danger'. It's so stupid and entirely immersion breaking.
No thanks. I'm bloody North enough. I had friends in Winterpeg that talked about the cold. No thanks.
You can afford Argon? In this economy?
What do you do?
Gotta change out those filters! Be safe out there space cowbo
Remember kids… don’t breathe in too much space or you will die of space overload!
Technically correct.. the best kind of correct!
That's not entirely UNtrue, only it's exhaling that does the trick
So that’s why they called that game Dead Space!
inhale to much space? no space inhales you!
You've got it!
If you can't filter out the vacuum you should try to stay at least 2m away from it.
Ha, I knew this conversation sounded familiar :-D
Sounds trippy ✌️
Yeah, I try to avoid sucking on motherfuckers myself, but I can definitely see how this might be a hazard for folks with a proclivity for such things...
I too use instruments that use argon as a purge gas, but the window isn't large enough for me to stick my head in it, haha.
That's sulfur hexaflouride. Argon doesn't change the rate of vibration in your vocal chords like helium or sulfur hexaflouride.
With all the unnecessary detail in environmental hazards they also, at the other end of the spectrum, have us repair our ship's hull from the captain's chair using vague "ship parts" when we remember to press "o". And loot space objects and trade with other vessels without docking or somehow capturing the floating debris. We have scifi teleporters now?
Yes
Well all the dead scientists you find have nothing but half-eaten sandwiches and fucking lockpicks in their pockets so maybe in the starfield universe they stumbled on technology by accident and everyone is a fucking doofus
I feel caricatured 😭
Helium is used in high vacuum environments to test seals. It is nit the smallest element, that's hydrogen.  But, ironically, helium can find gaps in sealing surfaces better. My layman understanding is because hydrogen is unstable by itself and is always paired with another, forming H2
Someone should make a mod that pitches your companion's voice up if you get too near a helium vent.
Key point of *Have Spacesuit, Will Travel* was the hassle to  get his freshly won, slightly refurbished space suit not *air* right, but *helium* tight, just to make sure it was as effective as possible.
It's to keep you busy while the gnomes charge the batteries
I think they mean the He3 isotope which is used in fusion reactors if I am not mistaken so the implication would be that grav drives are powered with fusion reactors.

Normal helium would indeed be useless
They take clear inspiration from *Elite: Dangerous* for spaceflight, except for the part that, like, makes it compelling.
Ironically in lore we shoudln't be jumping so near planets but we do and nothing happens, by some reason only Earth had that problem.
Cool. TIL.  I have scuba'd but never in a dry suit. I figured they just hooked up to the same tank you breathe from. :-)  I guess that's some serious cold water.
That's extremely cool info. Thanks for the details!

If only there were a way for Bethesda to go back and look at their old games...
It's really just a shame that they went the direction that they did.  Everything from Oblivion onwards has been dumbed down and washed of any real character.  Morrowind was basically when they had enough spine to commit to an idea even if it meant obstacles for the player.  God forbid the player then have to overcome those obstacles.
Remember that the whole planet earth - without any atmosphere - is a cozy -1C.
the whole thing smacks of them trying to make a game for the masses. The RPG fan, the action game fan, the sports game fan, etc.
Must have been the wind
I have something ridiculous like 120m range on my rifle. Why are they able to shoot back w/ their shitty beowulfs?
this exactly.  i tried the remote silenced sniping several times from huge distances and realized it was pointless.

Air is good!
I mean... there might be truth to that. Ever saw a sizable vacuum container (eg, a large CRT) blow up? Dangerous stuff!
There have been many incidents of choking & suffocation associated with sucking on a motherfucker recorded throughout history.
Proclivity.. That's a word that's gonna lodge itself in my brain somewhere and pop up randomly. And I'm gonna wanna know what it means. 

The last such word was Soliloquy. Thinking out loud for for example stage actors' characters to clue the audience in on their thoughts.
You're correct that SF6 is what produces that response, but Ar is ca. 30% more dense than air and will lower the frequency of the voice.  Just not so much as SF6 (which is 5 times more dense than air) and not as much as helium raises it (which is about 7 times less dense than air).

Once back filled a flask I was collecting material in and wondered how I got about 400% yield - turns out you really shouldn't back fill with Ar for an accurate mass.
Maybe that's what Bethesda was thinking of but couldn't fit Sulfur-hexaflouride in their text database.
Having flashbacks to trying to pick salvage without a collector drone in Elite:Dangerous. Especially in a big ship, almost there, almost there, nice and slow, keep her centered...



and *BONK* shit, and now it's spinning real weird.
You send Vasco or Superfan out to get it...
Your understanding is not incorrect, a He atom's atomic radius is indeed smaller than a H2 molecule's, but also smaller than atomic hydrogen's. This diagram shows that He has the smallest atomic radius of all atoms: [https://www.mdpi.com/ijms/ijms-03-00087/article\_deploy/html/images/ijms-03-00087-g001.png](https://www.mdpi.com/ijms/ijms-03-00087/article_deploy/html/images/ijms-03-00087-g001.png)

(Ghosh, D. C. & Biswas, R., Theoretical Calculation of Absolute Radii of Atoms and Ions. Part 1. The Atomic Radii, International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 2002, 3(2), 87-113)

The reason is not really that H2 usually occurs as a molecule and He is a single atom, but that the nuclear charge in He is bigger than in H thus the electrons in He (that are in the same shell as in H) are pulled closer to the nucleus. This is why even an oxygen atom has a smaller radius than a hydrogen atom.
Seriously. I spent a good hundred hours in E:D just running courier missions until i could afford one of the bigger ships that i immediately got blown up in because Bigger ships are useless if you don't know how to fly them in combat.
It's kind of remarkable how they were able to copy so much from Elite and NMS, but still wind up with such shallow ship and exploration gameplay. Your spaceship doesn't feel like a spaceship, it just feels like a plot contrivance that exists to explain how you fast travel between planets
I want you to close your eyes for a second and imagine *jungle Cyrodiil* with all its weird fucking cults for a second. Poof, there it's gone, sorry. Was nice for a second though, no?
agreed though if they ever did a remaster of morrowind, one thing i would like to see added is journey log/quest log instead of the small book that just list everything in order of who you talk to last by date, cause i would end up talk to one person start a side quest but end up in area for it months later and dont remember what i need to do  and go though the book was a pain.
The sky is also a std nice day blue despite there being no atmosphere to scatter the light waves.
The Stroud-Ecklund shipyard quests were definitely a cry for help from the dev team.
At this point I am starting to think they forgot to Include their QA testers on the development process. Someone should probably check on them... probably a bunch of skeletons at this point.
Does he have a lusty Argonian maid, too?
Roll down dos windows and let in dat fresh space for all de innas beltalowda! Oyedang inyalowda, im ta nating!
Youre not wrong, or vacume tube tv, it really is. I used to like to break things as a kid, my dad had to warn me and the neighborhood kids i hung out with not to take anything to the tv we were throwing out. He was an electrical engineer, so we all listened, and no one messed with it. Thank fuck for parrenrs who actually warn kids with explanations.
I watched a documentary about it just last night.
I read SF6 as Street Fighter 6 lol.
I don't care if it's super or not, fans don't work in space
Cyrodiil architecture is just variations on European designs.    
Morrowind architecture is all over the place giving each area and each great house a distinct feel.  Hell, you can't even navigate Telvanni structures without levitation.
Oh yeah, like the ship design one. Like I wish that having the ship design skill meant something other than access to parts. Like, let me work for a ship building company and design new ships, and upload them to the game network (and workshop functionality for this for steam would be cool, too). This was discussed in another thread, by the way.

I think he means that in the original lore you can for instance find in Morrowind books, Cyrodiil was not supposed to be Western Europe, but more like Aztecs living in a jungle.
The ship design one annoyed me to no end. You were pulled in to lay down the law yet you still have to haggle with everyone. I should be able to flop my dick on the table and say "No bitching we're making a blah-blah ship". Guy who wants it to be luxury cries? Too bad so sad, make it or get fucking fired and blacklisted. Especially if I have maxed ship design. He starts crying you should be able to say he's easily replaceable and you yourself are proof of that.
Wow. So jelly

No no, I'm well aware of that and agree with them that it would have been much more interesting than what we got in Oblivion.
Oprah addresses 4chan
THEY HAVE OVER 9,000 PENISES
**"Damnit, who put a 4chan pasta on the teleprompter?! For the last time, anything you put on that prompter, Oprah will read!"**
you can say what you want about 4chan but they perfected trolling the media. It's not what it once was now, but same goes for Reddit.
This was 15 years ago fml
Oprah is Q
I love that she just took some bullshit someone wrote on the internet, and was like "WOW I NEED TO TELL AMERICA ABOUT THIS BREAKING NEWS"

like good god that's comically out of touch.
Vegeta, what does the scouter say? ITS OVER 9000 PENISIS!!!
Oprah pauses briefly after saying "we have over 9,000 penises and they are all raping children," looking up and down the teleprompter almost as if she is second guessing just saying out loud what she just said lol.
Classic
LOLPRAH
Ah this brings back memories of exploding vans.
Top kek.
Yeah there definitely aren’t any pedos on 4Chan Oprah is so out of touch
sorry, Pool’s closed
Oh god. Legendary trolling right there.
All those penises are looking at that school over in Africa she owns. Especially since it’s probably sex trafficking. Oprah deserves nothing, except what she gave to the world.
That pause she took is classic.
ITs Over 9000
Is the cringe on Oprah or the pedophiles?
Middle aged women world wide gasped in that moment
She sounded like a Q follower.
Hyprbrh
I think she anounced her retirement shortly after.
Zero irony.
"In a row?"
Is she wrong? Thats what 4Chan is
Oprah vs 4Chan was not how I thought WW3 would start
She's so hot
There was a great comment under that youtube video that said "its funny how oprah is pointing fingers at the internet when her own close friends were doing the ones doing the r@ping" - mic drop.
I'm Ron Burgundy?
They literally made the “okay” sign tied to white supremacy and everyone falls for it to this day lol
Friendly reminder that they made the entire world think the "ok" sign with your hands is a racist symbol just to fuck with everyone.
They did, until they became the satire they were portraying to be.
4chan is like masturbating no one wants to admit they do it but they all do anyway.   Wonder what she’s posted?
The number of penises have only multiplied then...
And back before everyone knew she was a pedo
Two years before I was born too 💀
That's how all normies were back then.

Actually they're still like this.
No fucking way you can read that and take it seriously even if you are the most professional person in the world.
Now that takes me back.
Over 9000 is probably underestimating
You have to remember that this was 2008, back when 4chan had a very different culture to today. Sure, the joke may be cringe now, but the real world interacting with the internet back then was a novelty, so it was funny to have "old media" act seriously about  what was obviously a joke (albeit a very edgy joke) for those in the know.
Yes

You dirty pirate hooker!
The meaning of a word or sign is whatever a community of speakers perceives it to be. Signs don’t have any meaning outside the meaning we impose on it. 
     Since the okay sign has been adopted by the altright as a result of this 4chan troll, it has become widely used and understood to mean, if not “white power,” than at least “I support Trump.” Because of this, it now means “white power/I love Trump” in addition to whatever else it previously meant.
     A person may “fall” for a false definition, but once a community of speakers has “fallen” for it, it’s no longer false.
Its been adopted by actual white supremacists lmao what

Edit: Downvotes without a single response = “I know I’m wrong but I don’t like it”
4chan was and is rife with white supremacists. So when one 4chan user started it as a "joke" (maybe), other 4chan users who were definitely white supremacists spread it to the outside world. Same thing as lots of gaming forums. It's a [well known track for radicalizing kids](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/07/18/steve-bannon-learned-harness-troll-army-world-warcraft/489713001/).

4chan also was rife with CSA material. It was barely moderated back in the day. This video is probably 15 years old, so pretty soon after 4chan got serious about policing it.

It's honestly filled to the brim with people who think they are super geniuses and just acting like morons, but in reality they are just morons. So yeah, there's a shitload of racism, misogyny, etc. on display there and it attracts people with similar interests. They are seriously people who never matured out of the edgy middle schooler phase and all think that their shitty jobs and inability to get laid are someone else's fault.
That's because white supremacist groups actually adopted it
White supremacists were actually using it as a dog whistle. It's debatable over whether they did that before or after the 4chan thing but either way it did become a dog whistle for racists.
Damn you 4chan and also well played. I'd been using that gesture on strangers for years not even knowing this.
You know an online community is bound to change in two decades right? Buut it was always anti-establishment so their latest right-streak still checks out, idk..
I don’t browse 4 Chan since it’s a known enclave for CSA

So why do *you* use it friendo?
Lol I don’t know what sexually repressed culture you live in but masturbation is common and at least guys are pretty open to admitting they do it.
The only change is their hubris has grown fat.
He said kek not kok
it was hilarious to have a meme (vegeta over 9000 meme) clearly played up for laughs back then
I dunno, I still laughed at her serious face when she said 9000 penises. It's just so absurd.
Who is this 4chan guy?
Sneed
Lmao. No the pedophile no-lifes on 4chan.
Bro you fell for it 🤣
Dude the alt-right never adopted that sign. It’s literally just a meme. The left’s outrage over the meme is the only thing giving it its meaning.
Lmfao cool 👌
That's a long-winded way of saying you fell for it 😂

Joking aside I think 90% is harmless, sheltered edgy kids, 5% are actual racists/white supremacists/awful people, and 5% are stupid, sheltered edgy kids who are susceptible to radicalization. So something like OK symbol is still ironic 90% of the time but then 5-10% ends up being malicious among that group. Just my 2 cents.
I was very surprised to see you downvoted so hard. Everything you said was accurate and a joke turned into a real life white supremacy symbol is still just as bad when many racists use it as an actual dog whistle without knowing the origins.
Ok but if they adopted it they adopted it. That doesn't mean 4chan itself is racist for inventing it as a joke. That's the point, their prank worked, and they are laughing at you for falling for it.
[deleted]
like you can tell she has absolutely no awareness of the context for the text she's reading. it's absurd.
As soon as she finishes reading it off, she takes a breath and realises she's been fed utter shite.
Oh, same! I can just see why someone who doesn't understand the old internet might find the joke cringey these days
bro's never been to /r/teenagers
Bro you need to take a linguistics course
Yes they did, there are numerous images of many different alt right and white supremacist groups using it in their public protests.

Just a few for example:

[Roger Stone with Proud Boys in Salem](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/stone-proudboys.jpg)
But 4chan is notoriously racist, mysoginstic and homophobic - I really don’t get your point
It’s not a prank and it didn’t work how they intended. They tried to make a fake white supremacy symbol and it just became and actual one used by white supremacists. 

Like take the media and the people who “fell for it” out of the equation for a moment. A bunch of racists got together and started using a symbol to make people think that symbol is associated with racists. The symbol catches on amongst other racists and quickly becomes a white supremacy dog whistle. 

What is there to “fall for” in that scenario lol. By the time anyone said “the okay sign is a dog whistle!”, they were objectively correct in that statement.
Yeah it’s pretty ducking weird
Those are antifa double agents employed by Hunter Brandon!
😆 🤣🤣🤣🤣        😉
So the pyramids endured thousands of years of wind erosion, but without wind they collapse
Everything on earth vanishes because there is no air? Wtf
Maybe folks have been popping back home and looting bits. “Authentic piece of earth history - 20k creds”
People went mad max when they found out the Earth is doomed. The they went even madder max when they found out only some can leave.
The Ancient Alien technology that helped them endure was powered by cats.
Same with the alps, it bothered me quite a bit when i landed in the Switzerland/Italy area.
The mountains gone in a couple hundert years?
The last Bonaparte descendant, instead of escaping Earth, went down and crashed his craft into the Pyramids to "finish what his ancestor started"
Earth is a good example of something that should have been left out of the game entirely. It's cool that you can go there and visit these locations for the snowglobes, but people will inevitably complain it's not realistic and fleshed out enough.
Worst thing is....these things endured millenia before that...but the fucking shangai tower/empire estate/ all other bullshit build last century is still up
Anyone read Seveneves? I feel like breaking the moon and it covering the earth would have been a suitable apocalypse!
Meh.  Should have said it just blowed up so everyone could be happy.
Kind of missed the Planet of the Apes opportunity with New York
Maybe it was Space Napoleon
Imo, what they should have done was have a rogue planetoid be detected in the kuiper belt on an impact course with Earth.  That gives people some time to evacuate, it's something we can do fuck all about even if we had a century of dedicated effort, and will ensure there is no need to render anything on earth.  It would actually be neat to see a rendering of what the earth would look like 200 years after a Theia-like impact.  Massive flows of superheated planet debris still in motion and not even close to condensing back into a planet and second moon.
Leaning tower of Pisa stronger than pile of stones lol
tectonic activity maybe?
I think this happened before the grav drive incident.
As climate changes so did the winds, which could do more harm to those structures, more sandstorm and such.
its kinda sad that starfield do not have any more loore or missions related to eartha late history and fall.

it would be an interesting storyline that is quite relevant to the reality we live in to date
Yeah, most of our landmarks would still be there after two hundred years. If anything they should have just made Starfield thousands of years in the future or gone through the trouble of generating a better earth. I am pretty sure once the creation kit is out people will expand on it and make it more plausible with actual landmarks.
This damage was caused by the religious upheaval after humanity realized the apocalypse was coming. There was massive conversion to older religions such as the Egyptian pantheon, this lead the Islamic Egyptian Government in an attempt to destroy the pyramids to prevent their use as centers of faith.

It's canon, you need to find the book that describes the events.
Cosmic rays and solar wind decay things very quickly.
If Earth is abandoned and I have a spaceship full of weapons I am sure as shit shooting monuments like tin cans in the back yard.
You’re playing a game where bullets don’t penetrate spacesuits, you don’t need to eat, drink, sleep, laser weapons recoil as hard as ballistics, etc, and this is enough to warrant concern
I wouldn’t be surprised if major world leaders decided to nuke the planet as a “mercy killing” for those that couldn’t afford a ticket off the rock.
Bud we've got terrorists blowing up monuments over ladies hair, you can't tell me the world didn't start going crazy and blowing up everything over impending doom.
Earth is perhaps the perfect summary of what's wrong with Starfield. The premise isn't bad - Earth is abandoned to set up humanity for interstellar exploration.  But how do you explain or represent an abandoned Earth? Obviously you don't want to devote too much time to developing Earth since it's not the focal point of the story. But if you have people living on Mars and Titan of all places, there better be a darn good explanation for why there isn't a single soul living on Earth in habs or in Cydonia-style cities. But there are none, except for some incredibly lazy line or two about how humanity has some sort of collective PTSD and doesn't want to go back. It's one giant chasm of a plot hole.
Pretty sure people took souvenirs when they left Earth.
In the terrain it generate meteorite crashing sites wich lead into piramids been crashed by meteorites
There’s also been thousands of years of restoration just to keep it where it’s at now.
Do you really think there was not a war before the earth died?
I sold a soccer ball for like 20k I can only imagine what a brick from one of humanity’s oldest civilization is worth.
I mean, I walked across several US states in a few minutes while playing Death Stranding without complaining that it wasn't realistic enough.
Solar winds>Atmospheric winds?

Or perhaps the lack of atmosphere leads to yearly thousands, if not millions, of meteorites instead of meteors. Resulting in a heavily battered and flattened out surface?
Yeah all buildings turned to dust, other than the important landmarks they wanted to keep.

Whole thing makes absolute 0 sense.
You think a planet losing its atmosphere is simply "without wind" ?
I love these threads solely to feast on the "head canon" nonsense the zealots come up with to justify Bethesda's lack of logic and effort.

Top reply doesn't disappoint!
How did you find this though?
Napoleon III came back to finish the job.
Nah I was just letting Cora drive for a bit and well
Earth and Mars without their major landmarks. Earth only some lonely single ruins on earth but not the vast city ruins one might expect. The repetetive somewhat empty looking planets and settlements. people looking like sprung from a handful of clones. the unity. this grav drive did much more damage to reality and we might find out when the DLC comes out. It is names "Fractured Space" at all and i think it may be a hint to what really happend to reality. My theory is, that the "multiverse" the starborn have created is based on their common memory of places and things and those memories are not complete and damaged etc., thus it created a "Fractured Space" and we never ever start in the real Universe but already in one of those Multiverses caused by Unity...
The entire plot of earth losing oxygen is such a stupid idea. Literally the most famous planet meaning you are gonna have to make eart look like earth and they place some fucking assets willy nilly. At least have the d3cency to blow this bitch up and say you can't land on it be cause its literal space rocks left and maybe a part of the eiffel floating around this bitch somewhere.
It’s literally just a cool easter egg, nothing more nothing less.
I'm from St. Louis and was SO excited to see the Arch in the trailer.  Visited the site in game and was SO disappointed.  They just plunked down a landmark in an area that looks NOTHING like where the landmark is located.  This goes for every landmark in the game.  God this game was such a disappointment.
And where are the habitable outposts? There are civilians on dozens of planets without atmosphere and none on earth, huh? They really should simply have destroyed the planet in the game.
Like at the start of that flopped scifi series, where that happens in the first episode, don't remember the name...
The entire premise of Earth's collapse in this game is completely incorrect, also. If the magnetosphere suddenly disappeared, Earth's atmosphere would not just "sputter off into space" as described in the game; radiation from the sun would increase exponentially and some atmosphere would erode over time (millions of years). A better story that is even lore-friendly would have been that the early grav drives caused an anomaly with Earth's gravity, causing gravity to be reversed slowly over time until it became a very low gravity planet (anomalously). This *would* cause the atmosphere to "sputter off into space" but not the in-game story, which is not at all based in science.
What annoyed me about the pyramids was that the stone blocks only render when you’re close to them; otherwise they appear as big mounds of sand. I wanted to build an outpost as close to them as the game allowed but it’s just a sand hill.
You can take a shotgun blast to the face but this bothers you?
Or maybe because this is an alternate universe and not the one we are all familiar with.
Solar storms are devastating to a planet’a surface. No atmosphere = devastating solar storm damage
I've written it up more than once. The entire premise of "Earth got fucked three ways from Sunday because fantasy science" that's given in the game, and *contradicted* in the game's own story, is basically total horseshit, as is the whole "we only got a few million people out" thing.

Solar winds *wouldn't* turn Earth into a sandball in only 200 years, and in fact couldn't at all without some *serious* celestial fuckery like meteorite strikes.

The atmosphere isn't held in place by the magnetosphere (the thing early Grav Drives destroyed), but is rather held in place by *gravity,* which the Earth still *has.* It wouldn't vent into space.

Plant life would basically be fine without a magnetosphere. In fact, so would fauna and humans for *hundreds* of years because *the fucking Ozone layer exists*. Really all that would change without a magnetosphere is that the Ozone layer would slowly be stripped away, causing higher levels of solar radiation, but humanity *already, today,* has the technology to largely mitigate this.

Doubly so, *some* plant life would actually *thrive* at higher radiation levels, since some plants grow much, much *better* in lightly irradiated zones, meaning that increased solar radiation would be *totally fine*.

Basically, the atmosphere would continue being generated so long as photosynthetic plankton still exists as it accounts for *50%* of all oxygen generation for our breathable atmosphere. Plankton *is* sensitive to UV light, but for as long as the Ozone exists, that's pretty much a non-issue compared to their vulnerability to microplastics, which is likely to kill them off *way* faster than the loss of the magnetosphere and subsequent damage to the Ozone layer. Hell, they'd stick around *even longer* since back in 2004 it was discovered that plankton is actually able to influence weather patterns and generate cloud cover to protect themselves from UV light.

Earth had *50 years* to evacuate. To be clear, that's *three generations*, with the first two being adults by the time the third's time runs out. That *entire time*, not only did humanity have off-world colonies, but also access to fully liveable planets *and* prefab technology ***and*** Grav Drives. The UCS Constant left *before* Grav Drives were invented, meaning that human spaceflight and FTL travel was not only *possible*, but also *perfectly capable* for *50 fucking years*, wherein they actively *chose* to do nothing and not evacuate because all of humanity was holding an idiot ball for literally no reason.

There's more, but frankly, the entire setting is a flawed premise based on bad science and explained with completely nonsensical plot holes, which are then *totally ignored* so that a completely detached story about multiverses and space wizards can happen. Even Elder Scrolls lore makes more sense, and the lore of TES is *very literally* "The entirety of reality is the dream of a dying man in a coma. Oh, also, aliens exist, and they're not part of the dream, but they still showed up here for some reason, and the coma guy's family and friends are actively trying to kill him for various reasons, so everything is basically pointless because it's all a dream".
With the law of entropy they wouldn’t change much from a pyramid shape from wind erosion
No atmosphere, means meteorites. Maybe one shaved it?
It's funny how this game goes hard sci fi / nasa punk but is completely devoid of scientific credibility. Why is the Grand Canyon filled in? Where is Mt. Everest? Why don't lower gravity planets have low gravity in doors? How does Argon harm a player in a space suit? You can safely fire guns \*inside\* a pressurized space ship? What happened to atmospheric pressure on planets?Yeah its suspension of disbelief but it seems to hit and miss.
People nitpicking the fuck out this game like goddamn bruh it’s just a thought experiment. Maybe a fucking missile hit that shit?
Whiner
The grav drive, strong enough to suck the atmosphere off a planet, maybe was strong enough to lift rocks?
I guess you can say that the increased radiation degraded the structures. 

Meanwhile, I'm still trying to figure out why the temperature is only in the single digit negative celcius all day and night, when the average temperature on the moon ranges from 140 °C to −171 °C
It's not the lack of wind. it's the lack of an atmosphere protecting the earth from stellar threats such as radiation.
Without an atmosphere all the water in the stones would evaporate and cause the stones to become very brittle
Anyone else get weird noises when they walk inside the pyramid that caved in?
And why no Mariana Trench did it all fill in?
This is not a game that withstands ~~much~~ any overthinking.
This isn't a clever take. You're scraping the bottom here.
Bethesda logics are unbeatable.
I was quite disappointed with Earth, they should have put a lot of time into creating the ruins of old earth
Maybe it was actually the wind that helped them stay together
what spacesuit
Btw where is the third of the great pyramids?
Tbh the way some of the tour guides act sometimes, you'd think just wiping sand off your shoes is gonna topple the pyramids.
I heard this was Napoleons fault
How do people find these landmarks?  Do you basically just have to keep landing near where they should be?

I wanted to see the St. Louis Arch (because it's on a loading screen)- but I can't seem to find it.

I wonder if the Washington Monument is still standing.
I thought there were giant, global earth shaking storms and seismic events as part of the planets collapse?
I wonder if they could use google earth tools somehow to more easily overlay a realistic depiction of the geological formations that wouldn’t have been affected by loss of atmosphere? I mean, much of the tools are free for use.
Why didn’t they just recolonize earth with the tech they used on all the other planets? SMH?
snow might add erosion through ice expansion.. that thing can work its way through mountains
There are no magnetic poles anymore, so there would technically be wind, but it'd be solar wind.
I assume there was some cataclysm. Something more than just ‘oops the atmosphere is gone now’
I expect that the sudden dramatic uptick in radiation probably didn’t help things, as well as the much steeper changes in temperature that the evaporation of the atmosphere would entail
The lack of ANY habitation or cities is super weird. They could've copy pasted a bare-bones set of destroyed buildings and it would've still been better than nothing. 

Even more strange is the NASA launch pad is sitting there relatively intact, along with other popular buildings. Very selective erosion I guess. 

My head canon is that we scrapped every available source of material for ships and everyone just lived in tents. But there would still be SOMEthing left.
...k?
Be cool to have an expansion narrative with the sand people of earth. Big underground complexes built into old structures buried in the sand. 

Be fun as an artist to figure that out.
I guess the sphinx was not as lucky.
I am not a scientist but I’m fairly certain that when the magnetosphere no longer exists then solar radiation, cosmic rays, solar wind and asteroids/meteorite/meteoroids/comets would all add up to destroy these remaining structures pretty easily

“The wind speed of a devastating Category 5 hurricane can top over 150 miles per hour (241km/hour.) Now imagine another kind of wind with an average speed of 0.87 million miles per hour (1.4 million km/hour.) Welcome to the wind that begins in our Sun and doesn’t stop until after it reaches the edge of the heliosphere: the solar wind.” -NASA

So in this case we could even say they collapse *with* wind…solar wind
I am still waiting for a space game that has Earth declared as a sanctuary world. Basically a national park. So you can visit a few places, but it's strictly limited.

That will probably be the way Star Citizen will do it. Most of the planet will be declared a no-fly-zone with very tight corridors.
I dunno, it's obviously unrealistic for just a handful of select landmarks to have survived (but the snow globes have to be somewhere, right?), but with the atmosphere gone, there's nothing to stop the ground being ravaged by solar winds, radiation, and all the other delights space has to offer 🤔
It’s the fifth element!
Should have just exploded Earth and left an asteroid field instead.
The Pharaoh sailed to Orion, what did you expect? :D
I would vandalize if the world was about to end.
Erosion?  Where did you get that hypothesis from?

It's obvious someone went inside and simply activated the dormant anti-gravity engine and flew away with the upper portion after digging through the archives of Ancient Aliens.
Being blasted by solar winds is nothing compared to weather.
If there’s no atmosphere then the planet will be bombarded with solar radiation and solar winds. One would imagine such things could have damaging impacts for the surface and topography?
Are you sure that's supposed to be the pyramids? The bricks that made up the pyramids were huge. Those look like house bricks.
Everyone has a spaceship. You know some bozo tried landing one on top of the pyramid.
It's not the lack of wind, it's the lack of an atmosphere protecting them from the Sun's radiation.  That radiation will make rocks brittle over time.
If you look around earth you'll see it's catastrophically changed. It's not just 'no wind' that's done damage to the pryamid, it's the same stuff that's wrecked the rest of the planet
It’s like when your finger busts through the toilet paper, that’s the same story here. 
BGS on you finger
Theft.  San Francisco and Chicago ' residents ' moved to Egypt and gibs happened
I feel like you'd see more damage or damage that corresponded with it but my thought would be meteorite impact. Without an atmosphere to burn up smaller bits there would be a lot more ground impacts.
Gravity does take a toll. I mean all planets are roundish due to their mass creating gravity
Now you know what the Terran """""""preservation""""""""" Society is about
starfield doesnt even do basic gravity right earth is 9.8 but its 1.0 in starfield making it seem less precise its stupid and dont say they changed the system they still go by 24 hours on uc time they just dont do things right for a nasa-punk game it throws me off when simple things like gravity arent matching what it is like irl
I blame the flerfs
I think they should have gone with a Nuclear war story for Earth rather than just the atmosphere went away. It would have explained the lack of everything better.
There was a terrorist on the back of a Jeep taunting me to kiss him... smartass mutherfucker.
Without the atmosphere you are also talking radation weathering too.
This should be a spoiler
Your first mistake is using logic, your second mistake is playing this dumpster fire game!
Is there only one pyramid, too?

So weird that in Dubai for example the Burj Khalifa is there, but no trace of any other building at all
Honestly you are barking up the "Look any deeper and literally nothing about this makes sense" tree. If the earth were devastated sufficiently to look as it does and be uninhabitable like the game says it is then there shouldn't be any ruins or surviving locations at all.

The reason the earth is destroyed in any case is because they can't even begin to simulate a fully populated world, same reason Elite Dangerous doesn't let you land on inhabited planets.
Heat destroys everything
But these planets have drunken pilots who probably crashed those after a barbecue on this planet
No, they stay up cus of space magic

Like the guns in the game
If there less or no atmosphere then solar winds and debris would hit alot more
Temperature, winds, storms, and corrosive substances would be absolutely destructive prior to the state it's in now. It's also been a very long time.
"Why does the moon have so many more apparent impacts than the earth does?" They ask, not understanding what an atmosphere is or does.
Is it that they have no air as in oxygen. Or atmosphere.  Cause that distinction changes things.
Everything was looted.
just me or is this "pyramid" vastly under-sized lol
It was actually a spaceship, haven't you seen Futurama?
What Pyramid is that supposed to be ?
This is dumb
That makes zero sense
If there’s no oxygen there’s no buildings, it’s pretty common science actually. Look up what would happen if the world lost its oxygen even for five seconds, pretty interesting stuff
Yhea, Bethesda dont know what they are doing anymore
The pyramids were built to attract tourism to the region.
And so they are almost the last ones standing.
It won’t let me fast travel to most star systems even tho my ship is fully decked out
My theory:  The early grav drives didn't have the right environmental protections and caused micro-rifts in spacetime.  This ultimately made Earth uninhabitable, reducing cities to rubble, evaporating major bodies of water, killing off forests, jungles, and so on.  The Great Pyramids were just another victim of mankind's tendency to adopt and use disruptive technologies without knowledge of or regard for the environmental impact.
I just want my fucking snowglobes back (I put them on display in my captains quarters because……..you know…….. and you can imagine how quickly they disappeared into the bowels of this sphinxter of a game)
Radiation is a hell of a thing
One possible explanation is that there no atmosphere to stop meteorites. Not to mention all the space junk falling to earth at top speed. 

Sure the majority would be smaller then a basketball, but it be constant acceleration till impact.

Edited to add that all it would take is one strike from a meteor of relatively small size to do such damage.
Tectonic activity and cosmic rays can do a number on things
Dont take it too seriously. Don’t distract bethesda from fixing the real issues.
I assume Napoleon came back to take potshots at them.
The whole ”earth monuments” thing is rather dumb imho… there is no way some of those things would have survived, it’s just a very, very lazy effort to put something to see on Earth.
Wait where can I find the pyramids??
It’s laughably on the nose when the only structures left just happen to be iconic landmarks. Oh the entirety of St Louis has been reduced to literal dust? Don’t worry the Arch is mostly intact
I mean, the game takes place an extra 300 years from now, who knows if it’s from the atmosphere dump or from something else
The way they handled earth sucks so much ass
The main thing that kept a lot of these buildings safe is that the sands covered them. Even to this day they are still eroding, so wouldn't surprise me as the magnetic sphere started collapsing major storms and such took their toll on it.
Okay, so a complete absence of atmosphere accelerates erosion
They're maintained by the Egyptian government so they don't collapse. I know that awhile back they spent more than a decade and millions of dollars to keep one of the first pyramids built from collapsing. I don't think it's a very far-fetched idea that they'd collapse without human intervention.
Just one more thing in Starfields narrative that I don't think is properly fleshed out in a way that feels sensible. Too many questions and variables, a lot of "you wouldn't understand" narratives, or just zero explanation or exposition whatsoever.
Can't we just agree that Starfield is not a space or physics simulator as we know it?

Before NG+, the universe and its constants are just one of the multiverses and may not be the same one we experience.  After NG+, all bets are off.

*^(YMMV)*
The pyramids don’t have rad-x
Rule of cool
>Bing did have some thoughts on the matter:  
>  
>*That is a very interesting question. The Van Allen belts and the Earth’s atmosphere are both important factors that protect the pyramids from various forms of damage. Without them, the pyramids would be exposed to more intense solar radiation, cosmic rays, meteoroids, and temperature fluctuations. These would accelerate the erosion and deterioration of the pyramids, making them more vulnerable to collapse.*  
>  
>*It is hard to estimate exactly how long the pyramids would last without the Van Allen belts and the Earth’s atmosphere, as there are many uncertainties and variables involved. However, based on some assumptions and calculations, we can try to make an approximate guess.*  
>  
>*One of the main threats to the pyramids would be the increased solar radiation, which would heat up the surface of the pyramids and cause thermal expansion and contraction of the stones. This would create cracks and fissures, weakening the structure and allowing water and sand to enter. The water would freeze and thaw, causing further damage. The sand would act as an abrasive agent, wearing away the surface of the stones. According to one study, the average erosion rate of the pyramids due to solar radiation is about 0.02 mm per year1 Without the atmosphere, this rate would be much higher, as the atmosphere blocks about 70% of the incoming solar radiation. Assuming that the erosion rate would increase by a factor of 3.3 without the atmosphere, we can estimate that the pyramids would lose about 0.066 mm of their height per year due to solar radiation alone.*  
>  
>*Another major threat to the pyramids would be the cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles that originate from outer space. Cosmic rays can damage the molecular structure of the stones, causing them to lose their cohesion and strength. The Van Allen belts and the atmosphere act as shields that deflect and absorb most of the cosmic rays, reducing their intensity by about 99.9%. Without them, the pyramids would be bombarded by cosmic rays at full force, which would have a significant impact on their durability. According to one estimate, the cosmic ray flux at the Earth’s surface without the atmosphere and the Van Allen belts would be about 10\^4 particles per cm\^2 per second. Assuming that each particle causes a damage of 10\^-6 cm\^3 to the stone, we can estimate that the pyramids would lose about 0.1 cm of their height per year due to cosmic rays alone.*  
>  
>*A third major threat to the pyramids would be the meteoroids, which are small rocky or metallic objects that orbit the Sun. Meteoroids can collide with the Earth and cause impact craters, which can damage the pyramids if they are close enough. The atmosphere and the Van Allen belts help to reduce the number and size of the meteoroids that reach the Earth’s surface, as they burn up or break up in the air. Without them, the pyramids would be more exposed to meteoroid impacts, which could cause severe damage or even destruction. According to one estimate, the average meteoroid flux at the Earth’s surface without the atmosphere and the Van Allen belts would be about 10\^5 particles per km\^2 per year, with an average mass of 10\^-3 kg and an average velocity of 20 km/s. Assuming that each particle causes a crater with a volume of 10\^3 cm\^3 to the stone, we can estimate that the pyramids would lose about 0.01 cm of their height per year due to meteoroid impacts alone.*  
>  
>*A fourth major threat to the pyramids would be the temperature fluctuations, which would be more extreme without the atmosphere and the Van Allen belts. The atmosphere acts as a blanket that moderates the temperature of the Earth, keeping it relatively stable and comfortable. Without it, the temperature would vary widely between day and night, and between seasons. The Van Allen belts also help to regulate the temperature of the Earth, as they reflect some of the solar radiation back to space. Without them, the Earth would receive more heat from the Sun, increasing its average temperature. These temperature fluctuations would cause thermal stress and fatigue to the stones, making them more prone to cracking and breaking. According to one estimate, the average temperature variation at the Earth’s surface without the atmosphere and the Van Allen belts would be about 100 °C, ranging from -50 °C to +50 °C. Assuming that each degree of temperature change causes a strain of 10\^-5 to the stone, we can estimate that the pyramids would lose about 0.1 cm of their height per year due to temperature fluctuations alone.*  
>  
>*Adding up all these factors, we can estimate that the pyramids would lose about 0.271 cm of their height per year without the Van Allen belts and the Earth’s atmosphere. The average height of the pyramids is about 140 m, so it would take about 51,661 years for them to be completely eroded and destroyed. Of course, this is a very rough and simplified estimate, and there may be other factors that could affect the longevity of the pyramids, such as earthquakes, wind, biological agents, human activities, etc. Therefore, the actual time span could be much shorter or longer than this estimate.*  
>  
>*The exact rate of deterioration would depend on many factors, such as the intensity and frequency of the radiation, the temperature and humidity of the climate, and the presence of other natural or human-made hazards. It is difficult to estimate how long the pyramids would last without the Van Allen Belt, but it is likely that they would suffer significant damage within a few centuries, and possibly collapse within a millennium.*
Honestly at this point i feel like Bethesda didnt model Earth as well Earth because they didnt want to make it look too fallout esc since thats probably how it’d look. That or they got lazy
War?
Terrorists, before the atmosphere got poofed.
Starfield fans are so annoyingly uneducated about space
Ok so I have a potentially good answer but it's got spoilers and idk how to blur spoilers cause I'm pretty new to actually commenting on reddit. So don't read if you don't want spoilers? Mods help me?

---------------


There is one lore explanation that would cover both this and things like mountain ranges being gone.
 Earths atmosphere was messed up due to gravitational anomalies caused by early grav drives being derivative of an artifact. The magnetic field protecting the earth was disrupted and the atmosphere failed.
 These same gravitational anomalies could have larger devastating effects to the environment such as earthquakes in strange places, and other such natural disasters and devastating events. The pyramids didn't erode, but rather were toppled. 
It's a somewhat flimsy answer imo, but probably what Bethesda was going for.
Because of the runaway greenhouse effect. Temperatures rise so high that stone is able to melt. They get so high that the atmosphere can take it anymore. That’s my head canon. And with how much water is on earth it’s kinda believable
Earth, man. What a shithole. Alien Resurrection…
I think about the amount of resources for a mass evacuation.
Earth needs to feel more Fury Road and less like a spilled sand bag.
Loss of atmosphere in a day likely didnt mean it just floated away.
I believe the story is the use of the first hyperdrive along with that first artifact did alot of damage.  Something like that.
If earth lost its atmosphere, would it be more prone to meteorite impacts, since they no longer burn up in atmosphere?

Maybe the pyramid got taken out by a big one
Without an atmosphere, a lot of stuff that normally burns up in the atmosphere and falls as harmless dust will hit at full railgun velocity and leave craters.  That's one of the main drivers of erosion on the moon.

As an aside, if you want to find out just how much meteorite debris falls in a day, scoop up a square meter of snow, melt it, then filter.  Microscopic examination of the dust shows aor of melted rock, and you can even pull bits of nickel-iron out with a magnet.
The aliens came back to reclaim their blocks
Whenever I'm on Earth in the game, I'd still hear the wind. Are you sure there's no wind? What am I hearing then?
form what i understand what happen to earth is cause experiment humans did with an artifact mess up the gravitational fields around earth. which could cause a lot of shake which could cause top of pyramids to go bye bye
Playing devil's advocate here: how do we know the pyramids didn't already look like that when Earth was evacuated? I don't recall seeing anything about that.
I'm not admitting to anything, but *somebody* may have gotten drunk and tried to land on the pyramids.
Solar radiation, it's the reason Mars likely looks the way it does today
I landed in FLA and Florida Man was waiting on me  “‘bout time man…my gators were gettin’ hungry”
Huge missed opportunity for Bethesda. They should have made Earth not accessible and gone back to it in a future expansion.
Earth's atmosphere actually plays an incredibly important role in defending the planet! We are bombarded with hundreds of meteorites, meteors and pieces of debris on a daily basis! However, these various missiles are usually stopped short of hitting the earth with much, if any, force, due to air friction causing both terminal velocities and ablation as they fall. Without that atmosphere, the debris hits us with SHOCKING levels of force due to:

Not losing any mass due to burning up in the atmosphere, and:

No longer being slowed down by air resistance, which means they will accelerate until they make impact. 

Force is Mass multiplied by Acceleration, so the fact that we're increasing both factors means the force of impact for each piece of space debris increases quadratically.
W/o air or oxygen the mortar would start to come apart. Look up what happens if earth lost oxygen for 5 seconds
Didn't grav drives strip away the atmosphere? That would leave the planet open to all kinds of things. Isn't that what happened to Mars?
Clone Napoleon (same group as FDR, Eihart, etc) went back to finish the job
Probably got its vibe checked by a stray space rock
Go onto the top in the pit of both and there’s a low rumbling sound
Dude I've been. Walking all over Egypt looking for these things. Where the fuck did you find them
Duh because there's no people left to do the maintenance for the Pyramid.

/s
What planet?  I wanna check it out myself
With no atmosphere, there's nothing to stop the approximately 25 million meteors every day that used to burn up, break up, or bounce off that atmosphere from instead hitting the Earth. At full speed. There's no magnetosphere to prevent cosmic rays and solar ejections from doing massive damage as well.

It isn't just that there's no air. It's that the Earth has lost all the armor she had that protected her from the damage the galaxy is constantly trying to inflict on her.
They kinda explain this in one of the missions, it's not because "no wind" 

(idk how to do a spoiler tag but, there is a reason earth is barren)
No oxygen stems from no atmosphere.

No atmosphere = no barrier between us and the massive ball of burning gasses in space.

Things are weird when there’s extreme radiation and temperature deltas.
But how about that amazingly tough Empire State Building!!
Probably struck by small meteors with no atmosphere to burn them up.
Without atmosphere *
Such a shit game fr!
It’s called a cataclysmic event
Without wind?  Isn't that a little bit of an understatement for the destabilization of  the magnetosphere and loss of the atmosphere?

The pyramids lasted for thousands of years... under normal Earth weather conditions.  When the atmosphere leeched away that caused all the moisture on the planet to boil off, I don't know much about rocks but google says limestone has a moisture content of 2-5%, that doesn't seem like much but a loss should still have some effect on the structural stability you'd think.  Then there's the obvious drastic temperature drop that comes along with the loss of the atmosphere, increased exposure to solar radiation and finish things off with the fact that without an atmosphere to burn them up the planet is likely regularly struck by meteorites of all sizes.

The pyramids can take a bit of wind like a champ for thousands of years but I doubt they'd fare very well against a single chunk of rock falling from space unimpeded.
Pretty sure it’s worse than not having any air. I think they said >!the magnetosphere collapsed due to use of the artifact powered grav drive or something!< Probably not *exactly* that but I know it’s worse than there being no air
I'm sure that there is some smart excuse that has to do with no ozone and a harsher sun or something like that
Doesn't the lore say that there were massive earthquakes, fires, and tsunamis all over the world? Take that, and at several hundred years of looters and asteroid impacts.
Judicial
If earth suddenly lost its oxygen, yes, many structures would collapse, including the pyramids.
It'd be really cool if someone made a mod adding all the fallout locations to Earth in starfield like full maps and everything. I think that'd be sick. I mean it would be a lot of work but it would be definitely sick
Retcon excuse to not flesh out the home world
Well concrete without any air disintegrates (heard that somewhere a long time ago if that's wrong please correct me) so that plus the what is it 200 years since humanity left earth would decimate most human made infrastructure I wonder what the effects of zero atmosphere are on other building materials like wood
I'd have to research it, but I'm assuming the direct solar wind and radiation would do far more damage than wind erosion. You're talking molecular bonds decaying. Honestly they probably should not even be in that level of repair.
Well, in fairness we don’t know exactly how the evacuation of Earth went aside from a general sense of “poorly.” So, it’s possible a terrorist attack or some other man-related disaster damaged the Great Pyramids.
Don't forget that the planet is dead now and has lots of toxic fumes flying around and the sun can burn down without anything to hold it back. i guess it is just way more extreme on the planet than before and because of that buildings decay way faster. Even the ones made out of stone. Could also be that there are way more and stronger earthquakes
Radiation erosion, thermal stress weathering and frost weathering are a thing. Once the protective layers of the atmosphere and magnetosphere are gone all these effects would have a much larger effect. Molecular and atomic bonds would deteriorate, some 400 degrees Celsius difference between day and night combined with water or other liquid in cracks would split mountains apart. It's really not that surprising.
There's no magnetosphere.  So the Earth is bombarded with cosmic rays and dust and stuff.
It’s not a lack of atmosphere. It’s a lack of magnetosphere. The earth was torn apart by solar storms/ solar winds. Now the part that’s somewhat inaccurate is that the distraction happened too fast. Basically without a magnetosphere the earth would be constantly bombarded by everything the sun could throw at it. First all life except where sunlight doesn’t reach will die. (The survivors will die but not as fast). The reason for the untold death is due to massive amounts of radiation poisoning due to all light getting through the atmosphere. So in a matter of hours everything is dead and the ocean is being superheated at an alarming rate boiling the entire ocean. The atmosphere enlarges by 1000x it’s current size. unsurprising earth’s gravity isn’t strong enough to to support the atmosphere suddenly expanding to 1000x its original size so a large amount is lost. But the sun keeps boiling the oceans. Luckily because a large amount of the atmosphere is lost it is now really thin and the atmosphere has stopped losing mass. Because of this the earth can’t sustain an ecosystem and areas of the earth in the sunlight are boiling hot where parts in the dark are frozen solid. Meaning there is near constant monsoons, followed by deep freezing followed by rapid evaporation. This causes extreme erosion at a rapid pace. Now all that would probably take hundreds of years if not thousands, however it’s very likely that’s what would happen if the magnetosphere were to suddenly disappear like it does in the game.
In summary. The games depiction of earth without a magnetosphere is completely accurate though probably a bit accelerated a few hundred years.
ITT: people are confused what solar wind is

No guys, solar wind and radiation can't destroy the pyramids after 200+ years, just like how asteroids are still around after millions to billions of years
The pyramids used to be bright white marble with a fat gold cap at the top.

Guess what happened to all that.

Hint: it wasn't erosion.
It’s not just that there isn’t any air. There is no atmosphere to protect anything on earth from solar flares or even solar winds.
Maybe somebody crashed a spaceship into the top of it 200 years ago.
I kinda hoped earth would look like how it does in Cowboy Bebop. Still lots of water but all ruined buildings and cities. And some barren wastelands. With small surviving communities
I think the process of loosing atmosphere would start giant storm and natural catastrophe that would destroy most of earth.
 It would make sense to see more ruins but that’s impossible to do since earth is the real size of earth
I think it would have been better to have it just be in pieces like a new asteroid belt or something. This was one thing that kind of disappointed me.
Maybe some drunk Spacer decided to use it as target practice?
Hobby Lobby has been busy
Theres still wind... its just now solar wind which might be worse. (it is)

&#x200B;

But the actual reason they are crumbling is because people  are probably stealing bits of it to sell. Something the game should have explored a bit more. In fact, i would expect earth in this universe (starfield) to be a hub of either tourism, or, treasure hunters/pirates working for rich off world benefactors who want that old world swag. Earth should either be clogged with tourist traffic or incredibly dangerous. Shame its neither.
same with mountain ranges like the Himalayas or the Alps that existed for around 40 million years or more, but then vanished without a trace in a mere 250 years
I think earth without atmosphere would actually get bombarded into oblivion. Small meteorites enter the atmosphere and get burned up all the time without causing damage. If the atmosphere wasn’t there, small meteorites the size of a baseball would hit with the force of an cruise missile just because of its velocity. It wouldn’t be as blank as Bethesda’s interpretation but everything would get destroyed over time.
That s actually the most sensible critique to my critique 👍
By far the most likely scenario considering how easy it is to go there
New British Museum
Funny story…

About 20yrs ago my dad was down in Peru for work (he went several times a year). He was flying home and got pulled into secondary all the way to almost a strip search. He had a couple “fishing needles” in his luggage that were old looking (not antiquities). 

The federal police started questioning him and doing it VERY ANGRY. “Why do you have those items in your luggage?!?! Are you a smuggler?!?!”

My dad was considerably freaked thinking he had done something terrible and maybe the needles were antiquities until the federal police showed him the items they were talking about.

He had 4 bottles of “Inca Kola” in his bag wrapped to go home since he thought the bottles were interesting shaped and the name was great to give to all the members of the family. 

They wouldn’t believe the Kola was plain kola and made him taste each to prove it was actually plain kola. 

He ended up missing his flight and had to stay 2 more days and even had to call the US embassy in Lima and get them involved. They apparently felt it was hilarious and everything finally got straightened out.

And none of ever got the Kola although I did get an empty bottle…
Come on man this is a game where you take lung damage while wearing a space suit.
“Sorry for some reason I only carry 5k on me at any time”
That sounds like a pyramid selling scheme.
but the vendors only give them 2k for it
$20 says it was the British doing what they do best. Going to a foreign country, digging up buried sacred tombs, graves, and ancestral artifacts and calling it an archeological study and taking their valuables home with them.
That or the ensuing chaos as the underprivileged were left behind on Earth to die?
Yeah worth 20k credit but when you sell it they are worth 1700 credits and the lender only has 1200
Considering there's a quest that gives old earth momentos to sell as the reward, I'd believe this
Or you know the whole planet is fucking sand now. Everything buried. It’s a mad max world.
Sarah dislikes that.
I can see this being a plausible scenario
[deleted]
it still seems highly unlikely that even sans atmosphere SOME humans wouldn't survive. There are a lot of humans and we are famously very good at wanting to remain alive. Given the amount of warning and the fact that we already had the technology to survive in vacuum there is a 100% chance someone would have been like "Let's seal up Cheyenne Mountain and install a hydroponic garden and air-circulation."
Where's Vault-Tec when you need them?!!
Kind of wish they explored that more in the game, instead it was just a footnote.
but the BRITISH managed to keep the shard up? hmm
Oh yeah, you best believe I’m stealing one of those pyramid slabs if I found this out.
Some redneck: LETS BLOW UP THE FOKIN PYRAMIDS BABY!!! YEEEEEEEHAAAAAAW!
I imagine a DLC where you try to escape Earth (when it's still habitable) as everyone gets obliterated.
They could have then made the planet radioactive as well from this.   Basically remaining people started lobbing nukes around.  Would explain a lot of the destruction rather than just solar winds.
Can we get this as a mod? lol
How ironic. Two hyper-intelligent beings both pretending to be simple house pets.
And cats, like dogs, no longer exist now that humanity has left Earth.
*mice
Gradually people are realizing that the "Earth" story has nothing to do with worldbuilding and everything to do with they couldn't make it but couldn't figure how to keep people off of it.
Same with the Rockies and Utah in general. Hell even all the landmark sites are unbelievable, with exposed bedrock a dozen meters higher than it should be. I would have honestly been happier with Earth having crumbled into a debris field than the injustice to its memory that exists in game.
Napoleon shooting at the pyramids, so in right now
the /r/napoleon movie was so terrible and inaccurate i cringe everytime i see a reffence to napoleon now sadly…

they made him a clumsy clown that couldnt walk in a straight line…
a damn sniper at the waterloo fight with a scope even tho the scope was’nt invented yet….

prussia conquest that seemed to last 10-15 min of the movie but was one of his biggest conquests by far….
the egypt conquest that in reality lasted like 2.5 years but in the movie seemed like a few months.
AAAARG, wrong sub…. but i’ll be damned
I mean, the reason why Earth atmosphere went awol is fun in terms of the quest that makes you discovering that why.

But damn, Earth is so badly made. As a Dev I would've been quite ashamed of our work if I were to release this.
There's an alternate timeline where people are complaining that Earth was not added in despite the sol system being present.
Landing on earth should load you into fallout lol.
I feel like it should have just been so insanely hazardous that you can't land on it, and if you try your ship crashes and you get a game over. 

Not enough time has passed for it to look like it does, and it makes little sense that all these monuments in the middle of sprawling urban areas are the only things that are still standing.
Bethesda would have been literally damned if they did and damned if they didn't. The kind of entitled gamers who populate this sub and elsewhere online would have complained even harder if the game just straight-up prevented them from landing on Earth than they are complaining now about Earth being disappointingly barren and unrepresentative of real-world terrain.
Someone posted a theory that people have periodically landed on earth to take something home. Over a few hundred years I could see people taking parts of the pyramid but it's harder to take parts of a skyscraper
Narrator: They wouldn't be happy, nothing would make them happy.
That would’ve been hilarious
Totally agree
There are earthquakes in Egypt.
They're still essentially manmade mountains, and they erode at roughly the same pace. The pyramids will be one of the last structures left standing if humans were to disappear/go extinct, if not *the* last.
25 million meteors hit Earth's atmosphere every day. Of those, on average only about 17 actually hit the Earth as meteorites. Now imagine all 25 million having not atmosphere to slow them down, bounce off of, break up on, or burn up in every single day. Times that by 100+ years, and imagine what Earth looks like after that.

People wildly underestimate how much our atmosphere and magnetosphere protect us from everything the galaxy throws at us.

So they blew up every house, road, mailbox, lamp post, street sign, bridge, man hole, and essentially every other single tiny item one could find on planet earth, except for these 8 land marks? 

rofl, sure...
Artistic vision and compelling gameplay make up for lack of realism. The US also doesn't share really any biome similarities with Iceland, either. Sometimes a game is an allusion and the unrealistic parts are evoking something intentionally.

Starfield is not an allusion. It's just a mishmash of sci-fi books and games.
So now we all need to play games like you do, or what's your point?
Like they could actually make a planet with 16000kms, or anyone would actually walk for weeks through barren lands. No sense in complaining about that...
But btw, I adore this game don't get me wrong.
Though for all the good things there is at least one thing most 10years olds would have done better
[deleted]
I feel like they just knew that no matter what they did with earth, it would be heavily criticized, so it was better to put their focus on other things than trying to figure out the best way to present earth.
[removed]
I think no atmosphere is no wind indeed, a little atmosphere like mars does still have wind. Is that the point though, even with hurricanes in stead of no wind that is not what would happen in a few centuries if it didn't in millennia...
I actually think they should have asked scientists a few questions before making several decisions in a game like this.
Would have been better for their reputation and wouldn't been very difficult
Mars is a real missed opportunity. We have it mapped IRL, but the procedural system is too muddy to make recognisable mountains and valleys beyond a few slopes.
They really should have made earth unlandable apart from one handcrafted area or something for a mission.
> Earth and Mars without their major landmarks. Earth only some lonely single ruins on earth but not the vast city ruins one might expect. 

Bethesda already made that game a few times now.
Less cool maybe I suppose.
Nothing against some childs deseases in the programming at start, but I dunno, in many regards I just feel somebody didn't pay attention who should have had an eye on the game during the development.
I think it is a great game, but with a little more effort it could have been really awesome.

This post must seem as if I hate it, but I actually love it just with a little dung pile of disappointments. It just adds up after playing something like 500hrs, once one gets to know the smallest details of it.

Still, going on and on, haven't played another videogame since this one launched. Am glad I didn't pay for this one specific though (had series x and ultimate already before this)
Really strong "not interested in discussing how realistic things are in an alternate universe post-apoc game w/ talking mutants and ghouls" vibes here
What is the logic in progamming it without the few extra rocks? The shotgun blast in the face is gameplay and btw, i do got some awesome armor between the slug and my face tbh
You're not wrong, this is a science FICTION game. Yet, a third of the people playing this game are questioning why things aren't as they are IRL. JFC, people these days are pissed because it's not authentic to how it actually would be or because it's too authentic (empty planets and fledgling human settlements).

I haven't played the game in about a month, but holy shit some of these critiques are just insane. I loved my time with it, but people who for whatever reason want to parallel this game to reality are something else. Anyone who complains about these things simply needs a sign in front of them saying Science FICTION. It's also just a game, play it and move on.

Whining would be: why the heck is a sanddune in the pyramid as soon as your like 200 meters away from them, but it vanishes again once your closer...
Anyone else hearing their companions footsteps on the moon?
Yeah with those bricks 😉
Yeah, like dying when you put your toes in microbial infected ocean water wearing a space suit which keeps you save on a planet with vacuum and 400 degrees C ...
Hard disagree from me. That's a lot of effort for very little impact on the game at large, a game that could have really used more effort. As others have suggested, they should have kept earth out of the game, maybe by having a better story to explain why fuck all is left.
Indeed either put more work into it or make the story one of a more devastating catastrophe imo
It’s actually something they had to make laws about in a lot of places. Otherwise your monuments slowly disappear via looting/scavenging attrition.

I’m sure no laws like that exist for earth considering you can just land and folks seem confused about why you’d go back.
Thats why there are some amazingly preserved stretches of Hadrian's wall that have survived in Northern England. And other parts (nearer to towns) that you can barely see any remaining stones. 

Basically, for almost 2000 years people went, "Fuck yeah! Free masonry!" and just nicked it.
That is a major thing IRL. It is also a major issue at any major battlefields with people picking up UXO. 

Also an issue with some old shipwrecks, especially more modern ones from WWII. People are diving them and scrapping them out.
Don't forget that Egypt pays to maintain them.  They spent 14 years and upwards of $4M restoring their oldest pyramid - it reopened in 2020.
Not really considering no one in the entire universe has more than 10k on them...
Yes, it's easier in the game to go to Earth than it is in real life to go to the grocery store. Also, some homesteaders could easily be plundering all the remaining stonework for homesteads. That stone in the walls around Akila had to come from somewhere. Ships make it easier to plunder a stack of stone several systems away than to mine it anywhere.
Or maybe, just maybe, the Todd Squad just don't put their hearts into their games like they used to
This this is one of the most ridiculous things in the game
What a fascinating king you had, we’ll take him.
Plausible or exact scenario that will occur?
Well, oil wouldn't do much good I'd think without an atmosphere. Wouldn't be able to spare the air needed for the combustion process. I imagine they had better energy tech at that point anyway.
[removed]
The issue is resources.  All of Earth's resources went to ships and it didn't do much.  There was likely 50 years of chaotic fighting as well
Bruh why do all that when you can just dial the alpha site and dip out?
Maybe that’s a DLC coming. I mean there was e colony ship… why not an entire society under the mountain? 😂
I’m honestly surprised they didn’t throw in a vault-tec Easter egg. Would have been neat if while you’re exploring around you found a defunct or prototype vault-tec bunker
DLC hopefully?
Who do you think stole the bricks?
Glad I'm not the only one who immediately thought of Futurama!
Right as if the elite would have left their beloved pets behind.
Do you think it would make sense for there to be horse and carts in, say, a GTA game?
Honestly I think this is the right answer. What they should’ve done though was pulverized it or had it be covered in tremendous storms that made it unlandable. That way they could have had their “earth is gone” story without also having people expecting them to render half the planet into the game.
Yup.  This true of so much of Starfield'd worldbuilding.
This is the correct answer. The better way imo is to have had the last remaining humans on earth nuke the fuck out of earth as they fought over what little resources and time they had left. Make up some bombs that threw so much debris into the atmosphere that is became basically a shield around earth and no ship can get through it without being torn to shreds. Then even if they could get through the earth is basically glassed.
I completely agree…. Representing Earth has and will always be kind of an issue in space/flight sims. In any game where you have the ability to freely explore a realistic universe the first thing the player will do is go find his home. Even if you are able to use procedural generation on all the planets present in your game it’s not really an option when it comes to earth due to the immense amount of handmade assets and locations you would need to make. It’s best to just prohibit the player from visiting it and coming up with a lore reason. Starfield is kinda lazy about this, but I don’t really blame them that much. The only game somewhat fixing this issue that comes to my mind is Elite Dangerous, with you needing a high rank in the federation just to visit the solar system and access to earth being only authorized to important figures in the federation. I am very curious to see how Star Citizen will handle earth however, considering Sol System is planned and they already made in the current build a fully explorable mega city planet.
I think part of it was world building. Obviously not many people made it off Earth, but giving too much of that story pretty quickly pulls focus from what they were trying to do, which seems to be getting you to explore everywhere else but Earth. Going into detail would have been distracting, but not going into detail is also distracting.
>but couldn't figure how to keep people off of it.

I mean, they absolutely could figure out how to keep people off it. Just make it out of bounds. You travel to Earth orbit and click on the map to set a landing spot and the game just doesn't let you. Simple. Or if that seems too arbitrary maybe make it so a message pops up informing the player that UC law probibits landing on Earth out of respect for what is the graveyard of billions and also just to prevent looting of what little remains of humanity's heritage.

There, problem solved. Issue is, I suspect, that there would have been a far, far greater outcry from the likes of you and the other incessant whiners who populate this subreddit and other online gamer spaces if they'd gone that way than what they ended up doing: just making the planet a boring, desolate wasteland with a landscape that is - *quelle horreur* - not actually a literal 1:1 representation of the Earth's terrain.

Honestly, the entitlement here is insane.
The need to fit everything into lore when either the lore isn't there or the answer is "Bethesda didn't build it/think that far ahead" is sometimes maddening. 

Modeling Earth is a losing proposition for the vast majority of games. Everyone knows what it looks like and there's few good says go do it without wasting dev time, even fewer that make sense for most games.
This comment gave me a stroke
Went to Missouri.

It was flat.

Missouri is a hellish landscape of hills you can't see over.
And so comically inaccurate

**WERE YOU THERE?!**

edit: You guys are morons. It's an obvious reference to Ridley Scott's bullshit response to criticism.
They spread themselves too thinly, had too many things fighting for their attention, more than they've ever had before. Really most of the big issues in the game stem from the "land anywhere" philosophy. Had Earth just been a couple of fleshed out hand-crafted landing zones you can go to for quests, it would have been much better.
I mean, how would you have changed it? I’m not a developer so maybe I don’t have some special insight, I really don’t see any reasonable way that they could accurately represent earth in this type of game.
It would have been kind of fun if,

A) It made any sense at all, which it could have with a VERY minor rewrite to the effect of "the gravitic disruption caused increasing worldwide volcanic events that scoured the surface," which is not great as far as lore goes but makes approximately a million times more sense than "the failed magnetosphere caused the atmosphere to sputter away therefore flat rocky desert," which is gibberish. Earth and Mars are losing atmosphere to space at similar rates, Mars has effectively no magnetosphere and Earth has a strong one, and of course none of this would have a measurable effect on oceans or mountains in a couple hundred years.

B) The discovery had \*ANY\* effect on the gameworld, you literally can't even take the news to anyone about the key events in human history, there's no dialogue, it has no effect. This is one of the reasons so many people complain about the lack of "aliveness" of the gameworld, very few things have an effect, even huge news. Some missions have radio announcements associated with them, but you frequently can't talk to relevant people about it (FC quest chain is awash with those).
Not necessarily. They just shouldn’t have made every planet land-able. 

Venus is a hellscape on the surface. Massively acidic, intense crushing atmosphere pressure, everything we’ve sent down there has lasted minutes at best. 

I wouldn’t find it a leap of logic whatsoever to say that the ships and spacesuits of Starfield’s era still aren’t capable of withstanding environments like that for any significant length of time.

There would be many planets like this across our galaxy, that just aren’t feasible for landing and especially extra-vehicular activity unless there were significant advancements in the materials we construct our ships and environmental suits from. Which the game could have easily said were not made at this time and no-one would bat an eye. 

They could have come up with a much better cause/effect for Earth’s destruction and made it, like Venus, completely inhospitable for longer than a few minutes and so made it unavailable for landing. And that would have worked fine.
Spacefaring race being the only ones able to move pyramid stones confirmed.
They seemed fairly happy with Bethesda games prior to Fallout 4.
Hell, they could even set a mission to go after some pirate or whatever hiding out in the obviously hideously dangerous environment that would make detection rather hard.  Or even make that a secret SB base or something.  So many more options for the kinds of fantastical vistas scifi regularly throws out, but that would actually be possible.  Dense asteroid fields don't actually exist anywhere but in the debris of a destroyed massive body, and this one would be backed by the glowing, molten ruin of a recently liquified planet.  So much potential got squandered in this game and it makes me sad.  I like the game, but man the things they could have done
Mars has practical no atmosphere, but it stil has mountains and riverbeds. It didn't just become a flat ball of dirt.
The grav drive specifically stripped the magnetosphere. Not the atmosphere.
You find out as part of the story, i won't spoil it :)
I'm sorry what
hardware limitations are not an excuse, a good game director would recognize the unfeasabilty of an idea and opt to either cut it out entirely or change it to a more feasible idea instead of implementing the original version in a half assed way.

example: earth being a debris field instead of a desert that make no sense, or really any other of the myriads of ways earth could have been handled.
We all know what videogame requirements are, but it doesn't excuse incomplete or lazy design. The fact there there is *nothing* on Earth besides a few landmarks is extremely boring and makes it feel like nothing was there to begin with.

Making a super detailed Earth would definitely be too much effort for what we'd get out of it, but there is so little done to make our home look like we'd expect that I think it would have been better to just forbid us from landing there.
There are [other kinds of wind](https://g.co/kgs/kZmi92). I'm not saying it could destroy the pyramids, I'm not that smart, but no atmosphere doesn't necessarily mean no wind.
Buddy, what do you think protects Earth from all those shiny new craters scattered around in game? Come on bro this is shit you learn in like 3rd grade
Yeah I guess they should’ve consulted Reddit first
Lung damage anyone?


"Laser" weapons without continuous beam, but travel time, limited range, magazines and recoil? x)
I'll give you an example. A Belgian couple was caught by Turkish customs officers trying to smuggle historical artefacts. The woman claimed she collected stones from streets and beaches to decorate her aquarium 💀💀. She forgot to mention there's a 2000-year-old ruin of an ancient city next to the beach and the stones are actually hand carved marbles. Sky News tried to whitewash this, insane, just insane.

https://twitter.com/IsilAcehan/status/1707078844941811825
Some of the pyramids used to have gold caps on the top but would be later looted. Give it a few thousand years and people just start grabbing anything related to "hold a piece of history"
Well, there are probably still laws in effect that protect, I don't know, the Great Barrier Reef or something or all the monuments. It is just a bit of pointless to actually enforce the law since there is not much to protect now, some 200 years later.
If you play Crusader Kings 3 some of the counties have "Hadrian's Wall" as a special building, where it's modifier decreases building time because it says the locals occasionally nick the bricks from it.
Just like the Roman Aqueducts still in use today. Fantastic feats of engineering.
Dunno about that.  You ever picked up A rock?  Shits heavy.

Those damn ships can barely carry anything.  Trip halfway across the galaxy for 6 bricks seems like a bit much.
Yeah… but if I’m recycling bricks I’m not going to start at the top and make my way down. I’m breaking a corner and making my way in.
Yeah...  So lazy of them to not model the entire planet of Earth.

If they had taken the time to do it right, we could have had a really magnificent game in 2097 when it was finally finished.
We saw what happened when people fought over toilet paper during covid lockdown...
if they told me "we're abandoning the planet and you are not we" I'd riot for sure.
Realistically if we get a big solar flare or other event that fucks the atmosphere, any warnings will be from scientists and thus like climate change ignored until it's to late to prepare meaningfully.
[removed]
Or Napoleons cannons?
I'm sorry but this makes no sense. "All of earth's resources were devoted to one single solitary thing"? Governments don't work like that, not even absolute authoritarian dictatorships. Everyone has a hundred contingencies and backup plans. Assuming there were corporations around, they would have scrambled to create underground bunkers and sell out rooms to those who can afford it (which is basically Vault-Tec).
I see you and I appreciate this post.
They could be living in hundreds of sealed facilities built by a megacorp with questionable ethics?
I'm more surprised that the central premise that saved humanity in the Fallout series was somehow never considered in the Starfield universe. Or at least it was, just not on Earth.
[deleted]
The pyramids…to shreds you say?
This would make sense if "fast travel" was literally teleporting and no ground transportation was ever needed. I'd take even a horse to ride around with on planet in starfield.

You can still own and ride a horse and cart on earth, so while I wouldn't expect it, it wouldn't be weird to see that in GTA. But the fact that there are no cars, or other ground transport replacing cars, is definitely weird
Well there could very easily be an Amish town in a gta game.
yes.
The Earth being battered by constant hypercanes (superstorms that form when the ocean surface temperature goes above 50°C) that prevent any form of landing as a consequence of a runaway greenhouse effect would have been a vastly better option (could have even added some cutscene-landing "sheltered" areas).
Or make a shattered earth like the moon in Jedi Survivor.
Go full fallout and cover it in Hbomb craters
With no atmosphere, meteorites and space trash would pulverize it similar to the moon.
There are so many better options on how to explain away their game limitations with lore, and they picked one of the worst and dumbest. Writers at bethesda are big dumb dumbs.
There are a LOT of things like this, it \*literally\* would not have taken more time to do it in a way that made a lick of sense, and they just handwaved it.
And then people would complain about them taking the cop out and wanting to land on Earth. Tbh we need to lower our expectations. It's Bethesda. We all knew this was coming, and if you didn't, then you are too gullible.
They should have made gravity unstable all over the planet.  Suddenly pulling things up or smashing them down, or no gravity entirely.  Fits with their existing story, gives interesting gameplay on the surface (and immune during a story mission for the first part of it), and explains everything busted up or ground to dust.  It'd also explain why nobody comes back to settle or research.

indeed
I would have set the quest on the moon, where the effects of the artifact were significant enough that it still affected Earth despite the distance. The Moon wouldn't be significantly affected because it had no magnetosphere, no atmosphere, and no molten interior.

That way, you don't need to make Earth a place you can land on.
They weren’t. People shit on Skyrim for being buggy and broken too.
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

I take it you weren't around for the release of Oblivion, or Fallout 3, or Fallout New Vegas, or Skyrim...
Ha!  You clearly weren’t there.  It’s been a “disaster” for the whiners every time.

“Oblivion is just generic fantasy-land crap that gets rid of everything that made Morrowind’s world unique!  Minotaurs?  Really?!”

“Fallout by Bethesda is just Oblivion with guns, what a terrible idea!!”

“Skyrim is the most dumbed-down excuse for a Bethesda game ever made!”
Sadly, I think Skyrim was better, even with its flaws, it was more grabbing, more immersion, even without being recognised as a legat by simple soldiers.
I like scifi more than fantasy, still with the extra years and experience, they should have done better. I became a cynic a while ago, but I would hope quality to be more important. They can make the money and the quality, but it is only about making a quick buck with it. That at least is what radiates of this game when you play it long enough.
I hope some of the devs involved are really sad about that, sounds like management decisions to me. Those are ignorant too often
Mars is also more than 50% further from the Sun than the Earth and has only 38% the gravity of Earth. (Gravity is unchanged by the lack of a magnetosphere, and *mostly* unchanged by the lack of an atmosphere, so Earth's would be generally the same.)

Mars is impacted far less by solar storms than an Earth without a magnetosphere would be, and meteor impacts on Mars cause less damage because Mars' gravity is significantly weaker, meaning less acceleration as meteors are drawn in by Mars' gravity and therefore less kinetic energy.

As an aside, I'm not saying that the Earth would be completely worn down to a uniform surface after just 100 years without its atmosphere and magnetosphere. I was saying that human-made structures would be severely affected by the lack of those, to the degree that most would essentially be obliterated in that same period.

Tell me, because you obviously have advanced degrees in physics, geology, metrology and other sciences. 

What would earth look like while the magnetosphere slowed and stopped? Would the weather be perfectly normal for the 50 years before the complete elimination of the atmosphere? 

And do you think that a fledgling space faring society wouldn’t strip the old planet for everything they possibly could? 

Use your advanced sociology degree you obviously have to tell me if society would be totally cool with knowing the end of the literal world was around the corner?
Lol, and a few years later you learn the size of the planet and the amount of meteorites, you are talking about longer timespans than that mate. Otherwise the night would always be filled with fireworks
A hundred years of earth lacking an atmosphere would not results in *nearly* the amount of destruction you see on the Earth's surface.

According to NASA, about 15,000 tons of material enter Earth's atmosphere every year and about 700 tons make it to the surface. So let's assume 14,000,000 kg of matter travelling at 150,000 km/h impacts earth surface. That gives you a total kinetic energy of **1.2 \* 10^16 joules**. Now, that's a lot, but the average energy of a hurricane is **5.2 \* 10^19** joules per day and we experience an average of 10 storms with that level of energy per year.

So, it would take 5000 years of bombardment in order to reach the level of destruction caused by hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones each year. Happy to cite my sources if you're interested.
Yeah take a pill and be healed in seconds, though this may be forgivable, getting your suit damaged by corrosive gases and still being able to wander around in the almost vacuum for hours and hours... Mmm

The cargo system is ludicrous. You're telling me a container that literally has "1 tonne" or whatever plastered on it can only carry 100 kilograms? You're telling me that a cargo hab has no effect on cargo your ship can carry?
Reductio ad absurdum isn't an argument.
Who said anything about them modeling the entire earth? I just said they don't make games like they used to. And you double down on them being trash by saying it's gonna take til 2097 to make a complete game. Are you disagreeing with me for the sake of disagreeing or are you upset with The Todd Squad too?
OMG! I totally forgot how people went crazy for toilet paper during covid lockdown. That was fun
One thing about a solar flare type thing is that it would be clearly visible in the atmosphere if it gets big enough. There'll be warnings, and people ignoring those warnings, but when the solar wind hits the magnetosphere, there'll be glowing night skies in places that have never seen them before, and you won't be able to ignore that.

Depending on the specifics of the flare, that might be the same time it screws up the planet, or it might be a little earlier.
Don't look up
A huge part of what makes oil-based plastics commonplace is their low price point. Which is in turn because it's basically subsidized by the extraction of oil for its primary use. I struggle to see oil extraction being particularly efficient without combustion engines and the like requiring its use. But I don't know enough to say with certainty. 

Synthetic oil/lubricants are already commonplace. As are bio-plastics. Standard oil lubricant and oil based plastic is just cheaper to produce... But again, that's because we use it for combustion purposes as well. Economies of scale and all that.
Oil != fossil fuels.
What do we make with oil that we can't make using other resources? There's plenty of ways to make plastics without oil.

So many possibilities lol
Speaking of runaway greenhouse effect, they could have turned it into Venus. Crushing pressure, corrosive atmosphere, terrible visibility.
or actually make the height map of the generated terrain cell roughly follow the high level map, something other games do  on the fly already
I don't know why people keep suggesting this. It's not possible. The earth's gravity would put all the pieces back together and make is a sphere. For real why is everyone overthinking everything anyway? They didn't want people on earth but didn't have the time to render in millions of poi
Not in a couple hundred years though.  The cratering on the moon took billions of years, including the heavy bombardment period where the earth was hammered by colossal impacts regularly.  By comparison the modern solar system is super clean.  What we see of the earth looks like it turned into Venus for a while and then got bombarded with billions of micro meteorites moving at comet speeds.  No evidence of colossal impacts or even mildly bad ones.  Just a general vaporization and sandblast with a few recognizable monuments preserved by magic.  Whatever turned the earth into that blasted wasteland hell sure as fuck shouldnt have left anything standing at all.  The Himalayas and the Marianas trench look the exact same.  The hell are any human constructions doing even mildly intact?!
Not in 200 years though
Bethesda is more invested in scale of content and accessibility than they are in depth of content. That’s why their games get shallower with every release.
I can't wait for this feature to release in 2035
its not a good movie at all i would say, they jump from one sceene to another like its a brazilian football match and dont go deep in any of the historical events that made Napoleon great and made him eventually fall.

they fail to also show for real the huge support he had by the french people when returning to power as well as the authoritarian side of him and the crushing of womens freedom.
under his rule women had quite litteraly Zero rights and is a very talked about part of his history.

at the end every person has its own taste, but i feel like when they make something of an historical figure they should at least listen to the historians that they hired. ( znyder (edit: ridley, messed up the names) is known to tell them to shut the heck up)
he is good with dramas but not biography or anything that has a root in real events.
I'd rather have people complain that their steak dinner was missing the baked potato side than complain that their steak dinner was actually a spam sandwich.
A small minority would, but the rest of us would understand that the scope of "land anywhere" is not yet feasible without an AI that's advanced enough to create high-quality content on the fly without human input. 

It's a cool feature nonetheless, but it's not worth the trade-off in my opinion.
It's not perfect, but it's the best we can have at the moment without advanced AI technology. It's not Mass Effect per see, it's the idea of having worthwhile and handcrafted game worlds to explore. Mass Effect didn't have this consistently either, there were quite a few of these boring and featureless maps with unintersting content in them as well. 

Starfield and Star Citizen share the same main issue really: unchecked ambitions. I respect the fuck out of both CIG and Bethesda for trying to make THE space game, but that ambition comes with a high price to pay unfortunately.
Because it still, to this day, is very buggy. 

Regardless, Skyrim was enjoyed by the vast majority of people despite the bugs, because other features held the game together - like exploration, world building, stories. 

None of that is in Starfield, or only in the most generic & forgettable way possible.
People are just never happy!

I can't imagine why they'd complain about a game being buggy and broken.
They were buggy. 

This game is boring. 

Major difference, and you know it.

Oh definitely a management issue.  It looks to me like directorial overreach combined with at least two scope changes and then business daddy demanding their payoff right now. 

I personally like Starfield better than vanilla Skyrim myself.  It draws me in more even with the setting issues and obviously cut corners.  I am hopeful that in a year or so we will have a couple of good updates and a solid DLC and a bunch of quality mods
It's a stupid premise all around. This is why they should have just had the earth be destroyed.
Sorry, I thought you meant that the gas giants haven't been destroyed by meteorites and I was just confused because... well it obviously doesn't make sense.
bruh why the fuck one would need a degree in phisics to point out bad game design, also spoiler alert none of ggs developers have one either, also stop pushing your headcanons and theories as if they were canon, nowhere in the game it dove an adequate explanation on the state of earth and why shit like the empire state building is still up while entire *mountain ranges* are not, stop coming up with justifications that bethesda itself didn't have the grace to come up with.

also even if the scenario in starfield was realistic ( and earth is far from the most unrealistic thing in the game as it is a sci fi) it would not mean that it is  good game design, earth as it is presented in game is clearly a castrated version of an idea they couldn't implement, they should have rscognized the unfeasability of it and should have moved over to another feasible idea.
This is not about science, this is an entertainment product, and thus we are talking about the "suspension of disbelief". 

Nothing has to be dead-on realistic in a game, movie, tv show. But it has to be believable enough to immerse yourself in the world on the screen in front of you. 

And immersion is the one thing Bethesda has completely f***ed up in this game because nothing remotely makes any sense whatsoever.

Nobody is talking about Earth being a dustball. We're talking about the top of the pyramid being busted from (likely) a meteor.
Alongside a bed?
return the ~~slab~~ marbles
*stares in Nicolas Cage*
That's...my point, yes.
Well, now I'm going to go home and play CK3 for the first time. After this little tidbit, I feel like I have to.
Who cares, it’s more absurd to say they didn’t put soul into their game when discussing earth, the most difficult planet to recreate in a game like this.
Unfortunately George Carlin was right about how stupid people are.
Lol. We still have like ten 12 packs of it in the garage.....
>you wont be able to ignore the auroras and sky effects

sure, but thats like saying "you cant ignore the tsunami when the water all pulls back and the gigantic wave becomes too apparent to ignore;  sure, you can't ignore it, but you're also well beyond the point of escape.  If there's visible phenomenon, the flare is *already hitting* and theres no more warning time
We have snow in Texas and Desert temperatures in northern Europe and climate change is still called a hoax. I guess people will just call it the jewisg mind control rays becoming visible or some other crazy made up stuff

It's not just plastics though, it's the petrochemical feedstocks themselves which allow us to create so much, even medicines come from oil

could be an issue, because the current landscapes only generate a few thousand meters. So sloping terrain or mountains beyond that size would be an issue for the render distance.
I think Black Ops 2 zombies had a good spin on this idea, it’s “shattered” but still together
Ok I'm not a geologist I don't know bro. It's a fake universe who cares what gravity would do in real life
You’re right, the human structures don’t make sense but I guess I just see those as Easter eggs. The whole thing is a “macguffin” but that being said, for Earth to lose its magnetosphere based on experiments happening on the moon, implies some sort of colossal change that would impact not just earth but the surrounding areas in the solar system. It’s not hard to make the leap that if the iron core was that dramatically disrupted, it would devastate the tectonic plates and shatter Earths surface. And whatever happened on or near the moon to cause the iron core to fail would have been a massive disruption to spacetime, that it would have impacted the orbit of not just earth but the asteroid belt. Being them much closer together and so on and so forth…
The movie is directed by Ridley Scott not Zack Snyder lmao
You don’t evaluate a movie based on what you wanted it to do, you evaluate it based on if it succeeds at what it’s trying to do, and Napoleon is a pure character study, not a history. It’s not aiming to educate you on the politics of Napoleon’s time, and that doesn’t make it a bad character study.

Who’s “Znyder”?
This is it, chief.
So then they weren't happy.
Buggy isn’t even remotely what people complained about.
Which y’all would have shit on too, because absolutely nothing would make y’all happy. Outage porn addiction is a real thing.
[removed]
With an open beer next to it that hasn’t immediately boiled away due to the complete lack of pressure?
Or suffer my curse!
We also get a concrete example though of Earth laws being overruled and ineffectual in-game. In First Contact >!The colonists aboard the generations ship have an earth-based legal claim to the planet, but the Paradiso Board counters that their actual, currently legally binding claim stands on its own merit, while these colonists don't have any current effectual legal basis!< So unless the UC has earth as some sort of Heritage Site, no one will care about the old earth laws.
Also it’s literally a game about space travel and humans existence beyond earth. It’s like being mad that the cars in the parking lot of a FIFA  game aren’t brand accurate.
So yall were part of the problem
Because they see snow and ignorantly think it contradicts the term "global warming" as if it was some kind of mistake made by the grand masters of this huge worldwide conspiracy that apparently exists for no reason whatsoever.
Absolutely, but I think the time frame is close enough that it avoids some of our monkey brain issues with delayed cause and effect.

There is absolutely zero chance there weren't "it's all a hoax" conspiracies up to (and probably for a very brief time after) the atmosphere went away.
But there's always been snow in Texas... There are no major noticable changes in effect due to climate change. It's still something that has to be carefully measured to be perceived. It doesn't help that the news blames every major weather event on climate change despite the fact that there is no way to pin an isolated weather event on climate change. There's so much made up garbage, it's perfectly reasonable to be skeptical.
Except that plants that die today will never become oil. Oil is plant matter from before our atmosphere had much oxygen in it.
Are you unaware that we can also make these (or have substitutes) without oil? 

It's an economic problem (scale of production), not a chemical one.
Hemp, most immediately.

Edit: corn, [bacteria](https://www.technologynetworks.com/applied-sciences/news/making-plastic-without-fossil-fuels-339146), Lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose,
Terpenes,
Vegetable fats and oils,
Carbohydrates (sugars from sugar cane etc), 
Recycled food waste
I mean with the exception of starborn the setting at least does try to be some what grounded in scifi and leans more towards hard scifi than soft scifi like star wars. If people are complaining about the poi of interests on earth not being realistic having a shattered earth would be even worse.
mixed up the names, sorry for your hurt buddy /s/
Well if it's a character study of a historical character, then historicity ia definitely a standard you can apply.
Whoever wrote the script was very clearly trying to make an allegory of a comparison of Napoleon to Trump. At the expense of actually portraying Napoleon and his exploits accurately. I’m about as left leaning as it gets and I hated almost every second of the movie
They were, and still are. Unlike with Starfield.
The intentionally obtuse shit is annoying af
And it still wasn't anywhere close to Starfield.
I’m convinced most people, when they wake up in the morning and look up “news”, are in reality craving their daily hit of outrage porn.

What's your offer!
No one cares about the laws of any vanished state, outside of historians and the occasional sov-cit.  The settlers claim in that mission is even more outdated than someone today pulling out a charter granted by the ottoman empire.  When was the last time you heard a proclamation from the government of East Pakistan, or East Germany?
Ruins the immersion /s
Even the existing in space and space travel is done poorly, so bad point
You've never confused unit wirh case when ordering online?
Skeptical sure, but willfully ignorant is a different story.
[removed]
The only thing that leans more into hard sci-fi is their art design. Everything else is very soft sci-fi just like Star Wars. Magic ftl technology, magic gravity on space ships, actual space magic, dog fights in space because it's cooler.
People were happy when they bought Skyrim for the PS3 and the whole game didn't work?
The man is gauze! The Man in gauze!
East pak is Bangladesh so if they made some kind of independent rule proclamation prior to 1971 it could actually be viewed as having some relevance?
Can’t say I have
I'd argue people are just as ignorant on either side of the discussion. Those who discount climate change because it doesn't feel right and those who blindly accept any climate related claim which furthers their agenda. The scientists who actually study climate are far more undecided than everyone else on the details.
Are you trying to say avocado oil and petroleum oil are the same?  Plant oil does not have the same applications as fossil fuel.

Aight ima give you the benefit of the doubt you heard a few facts and some wires got crossed.

So, our fossil fuels come from plants, not dinosaurs: true. BUTT. All the oil we use comes from a very brief period of geologic history where plants died but before bacteria had evolved to decay it. So it went into the ground undecayed. This will never happen again.
Except that the oil never makes it into the ground before the bacteria and fungi responsible for decaying break it down.
Well, I did. Ordered from the office supply company my dad's firm uses. Didn't know it was 'cases'. Was quite surprised.  Assumed the higher cost was just profiteering  based on the news at the time.

But it's non-perishable and not like it will become technologically outdated...
Sorry, I don't think you get to just blanket claim "both sides are equally bad" when people are CHOOSING not to even listen to any of the data. Again, willfully ignorant is a different story.
Rockstar deleted every post of their Instagram, except the trailer announcement.
They probably just put their other photos in private, but it is interesting...
Just like artists who are ready to release an album... wow
the beginning of a new era let’s gooo
Most likely all other post are just archived. They are fully invested right now
This goes so hard
Hahahaha no more news of gta online updates lefgooooooooo
We are witnessing history. Biggest video game release of all time is upon us. LFG!!!!!!
thats pretty serious actually… imo it means the game is less than a year away cause that’s a pretty damn committed marketing strategy..
Cultural event

Theyve been cookin

![gif](giphy|LRrHCZYvcKukTi3ayH)
I wonder if they'll release another artwork before the trailer like they did for Red Dead 2
They sure did, and they just got a new follower.
Hardest move ever
A new era is among us
Hey guys did you open rockstar.com  its realy just fully flagged poster of this announcement it look soo good trust me
Oh shit
IT'S HAPPENING
How awesome would it be if they ended the trailer with “Preorders available today” followed by “Available next week 12.12.23” go big or go home for your 25th anniversary right?
Brooo
Everything else is now irrelevant
RIP to those who actually followed GTA Online news or RDR Online news.

Shit just got real
why aren't you following the goats?
Now all they want to do is gta6things ..this is rockstar they don’t talk untill they ready… but when they ready , they just make
Histories😅
[deleted]
Wow wtf
At the end of the trailer: “Out now”
They cooking
This actually seems like a HUGE move for them to make, doesn't it? Does anyone know if they've done this for any other game release? Honestly this makes me think they MAY do the soft reboot into "Grand Theft Auto" that people have been talking about. I hope not, and it's not like this is proof at all, but it's a big play for them. 

I have to imagine they had thousands of posts across a plethora of IPs. Almost seems like R\* as a whole company is trying to reboot with this new title, which jives with the change in leadership and workforce there.
Yooooooooo
shit just got real
🍆
Yessir....Lego!!
GTA 6: Americas. Can't wait for the trailer!
Grand Theft Auto: Americas
A sign that GTA 5's online is officially ending perhaps..? 🤔
![gif](giphy|YPIrsRqqO7oB2|downsized)
the load i just released upon seeing this image was astronomical
GTAV? What’s that?
This is insane, all hell breaking loose next week
It’s crazy it’s the beginning of a new era 💯
just like my toxic ex lmao
They are starting a new era, that's why.
Clean slate new generation is about to begin.
The New Game Order is coming
Damn… I hope this, along with the fact they still haven’t given us a name, doesn’t mean they’re rebooting it just as “grand theft auto”…
this is surreal OMGGG it's here finally start of a new era lesgoooooo 😭💯
![gif](giphy|3FQxaJJkQR8U4gdzr0|downsized)
December 5th is quite literally the second most anticipated day in gaming history (number 1 is the release date of gta 6)
FINALLY, the end of an era.
GTA V Trailer dropped November ,2 2011 the game didn’t drop until late 2013. ROCKSTAR I SWEAR TO GOD PLEASE DO NOT PULL THAT SHIT ON US AGAIN!!!!
I bet it's coming spring 2024
Why they say next gta or just trailer 1. Why not mention gta 6? Are they planning to have a new name?
It’s so people aren’t reminded it’s been 10+ years. Just kidding, I think this is very big news though, right? In terms of when it releases, why do this from now unless the game is relatively close to being released (within the next year)
ITS HAPPENING!!!
It's almost time folks, we're not ready for what is coming.

Dec 5 will mark a new biginning for GTA and I'll all for it!
New era
And just keep in mind… they won’t do this if they would just announce a gta 4 remake like some people really expect…
Rockstar is like michael, deleting her past????
Just the fact that they said Trailer 1 makes my heart skip a beat. Like.... If the release was two years away we'd get the trailer or a teaser....

But trailer 1  - AND deleting all insta posts.... Tells me this campaign is fuckin on. And we could be a year out or LESS from release. Trailer 2 or further featurettes within one to three months.
[deleted]
I was here.
CHOO CHOO THE HYPE TRAIN IS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE STATION
They're really making it big, I expect an amazing fucking game with lots of detail both map and story wise, they seem to very VERY proud of this game
lol, at least censor your friends' names, to avoid doxxing them...
This tells me that they’re confident the game will succeed all expectations.
y’all think this means it’ll drop sooner than we think?? im talking like summer 2024.. am i coping???
This is a trailer for GTA V Definitive Edition coming to the Switch
Welp looks like im buying a ps5 next week
They think they rappers or sum lmao
How did it look before? Anyone got a screenshot?
Ok

Why would they do this
They finally moving on from GTA V? 😂
Oh shit! This new album, i mean game gon be🔥🔥
I was here!
U depressed asf💀
Very R* move to forget all of their history when the next cash cow is ready
It could be a reboot gta?
This is it.
The game is set to be RELEASED ON 23 DEC
I’m sure they didn’t.
Yay only took ten years!😄😄😁
Gta6 will be the last one I believe
what if this game will be a reboot? it will be called just "Grand Theft Auto"
You all are delusional
...so?...
They are afraid af for the cancel inquisition
You guys are fucking crazy, literally think everything means GTA 6 is on its way. Have you ever thought that maybe they’re revealing a partnership with Disney World?
It's gonna be like $120 because cockstar
why wtf
I find it funny how everyone is so certain about a 2024 release date when rockstar themselves said the game is going to be released in 2025
What about this is interesting lol
✌️☝️
I was following reddit for such information, but I had to wait a long time for anything and now what we were all waiting for is happening!

Why do i feel they want a lot of $$$$ for this :)
All eyes on GTA 6. This shit feels like a fever dream
zamn!
I noticed this..
Deleted or 'hidden'?
*grunts in tribal*
they‘ve probably just archived everything which makes the posts the not viewable until they bring it back
They‘re cooking so Hard rn 🌚
And so it begins.......
You forget thousand things everyday so make sure this is one of em
I’m jizzing uncontrollably all over my undergarments rn
The beginning of a new era
Posted 4 hours ago and almost 3 million likes on Insta… jeez
So hyped
They’re going to push this hard.
It’s obvious that they want as much people to know as possible
I think they will post the art cover one or two piece of it at a time by the time the trailer release, we will have the full version
The era of GTA 6 has begun
Thats clever Marketing they are just focusing on their biggest titel
This proves gta6online2 is an openAI machine learning npcs realism simulator
Just following the trend that music artists do when releasing a new album. Not sure why it's become a thing.
That must have took forever wtf
Yaaaaa 13 more months
Out with the old…
![gif](giphy|huJmPXfeir5JlpPAx0)
This has to be one of the craziest marketing stories I’ve heard in a while.
Is this something that they’ve done in the past?
The rollout has begun…
Something only the biggest entertainment IP out there can do. 🤣
Did you guys notice that it said "trailer 1" OMG that means that there is going to be multiple trailers coming out. LETS GO!!!!!
gold support water cough spark quack bewildered special abundant entertain

Never had so much fear to die
new category on pornhub..  GTA 6 Joi
they could like post parts of the cover art until we hit the trailer date and by then the whole cover art is revealed.
Ah shit! here we go again…
I just got the Xbox series X to play this shi and a new tv!! But I'm not holding my breath 🫁!
Imagine the trailer drops and it ends with coming June 1st 2024
Smart.
They know we want to start fresh. Can’t wait!
We are in the endgame now…
Big things coming soon

They have been whipping it up
Posts are definitely archived
Rockstar moving like a high school girl after a breakup
I'd actually prefer for it to come out holiday 2024. My wife is due with our first kid in April, and I'm going to have to choose tending to my new born son over GTA.
Time for a new age
I still bet they may not even give a release date yet and if they do it'll be like April 2025 or something
When David Grusch said "ontological shock" this is what our boi meant.
I could cry bro
ITS TIME!!!!!
Soon
I’m thinking spring 2025 but I’m hoping for late 2024
They wanted to remove all the stuff because they Are going woke
I hope it’s not the case but what if it’s just GTA Online 2 lol
It’s a new era gang!
Cause nothing else matters
Archived*, probably
![gif](giphy|Pmv6m86yGQCjkLjmqx|downsized)
I hope someone archived the old content
Heavy heavy marketing is about to happen. Expect photos of characters and their stories again on a card like post lol. 

Can’t wait and what a time to be alive
So I'm guessing the DLC stuff will be Stories and Reels
It's fucking starting!!!!!
Soon we will know if all [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/13dhi0x/apparently_a_marketing_director_from_take_two/) and similar are real.
Every game they announce game differently (i think) this feel very big. Imagine the hype now if the leaks never happened.
Archived
Probably archived, never deleted
It's time.
Just saw that 2 minutes ago
This is really happening 🥹
Let's find a room
Do you guys realize 10 fuckin years till this happen! 

This game will change the industry.
Our mind will just blow up! Can’t wait!!!!!!
Endgame is real
cloe a baddy
I genuinely still can’t believe we’ve made it. We’re so back boys
![gif](giphy|QBd2kLB5qDmysEXre9|downsized)
Did they do this for RDR2???
i did the same thing because i dont use it anymore
It’s going to be big
Is bro depressed?
Rockstar is the GOAT when it comes to hype. They marinate their games like a rack of ribs. Literally anything they post that could even *hint* to GTA 6 gets attention from the community. They’re consistently cooking.
What if at the end of the trailer they were like and it’s OUT NOW! No way that happens, but Rockstar and GTA are probably the only time they’d still make a shit ton of money with no marketing.
I really dont know how to explain this. This is cultural, Its revolutionary and theres way more words to describe this and its in FOUR DAYS. FOUR. We have two new characters. Whole new story and its a beginning of a new era. Shit is getting real.
Gta Vice City Stories remake
I thought this was a lie… what the hell
This might mean the game will come out sooner than later. Like.. how long will they commit to this?
LETS GO FUCKING MENTAL
LETS GO FUCKING MENTAL

Rockstar admin thinks he’s kendrick
Man, I think I’ll probably have to call in sick once this game drops. Maybe take a few days to recover from the “flu” I’ll mysteriously have lol.
When Rockstar, acts like rockstars 🤘

Its literally a fresh slate
They are starting fresh.
Is it gonna be a teaser or a trailer?
Very interdasting
time to break the internet

Maine fraud karke ab ek PC le hi Lena hai.
I feel like we will get more teasers in the next 3 days. There is no way its just gonna be that single teaser... it could be like how they teased RDR2 but in reverse (since they confirmed the trailer date first rather than last)
cant wait for mods
Holy shit! It's real
OOooooooooohhhhhh...not even a gamer but will get a ps for this.
Why? To bring more attention?
I'm the only one who expected more likes on the post?
Will the previous posts gonna came back?
I didn’t think there would ever be another game to surpass the excitement and anticipation of gta 5. But here we are.
Let them cook
Finnaly no more news of gta online les go
Damn.. I mean, it is GTA 6. It's the most hype thing of gaming this decade prob. Gotta start fresh and give it all the attention.
the beginning of a new era.. i’m in tesrs
It's like they said "everything prior to this is irrelevant. Forget everything. Now we're starting for real."
I wonder what song their going to put in the first trailer?
It's the dawning of a new era.
This is gonna be the longest weekend ever, and the longest Monday ever.
...like a true rock star
![gif](giphy|ojbYIfAekLAzMDv4lV)
Imagine if at the end of the trailer it says "coming in 2 weeks!" I know it won't happen and realistically I'm hoping for October next year. But... Just imagine.
This is interesting because we're expecting a few more years until GTA 6 right? Is Rockstar marketing going to forget about GTA V until then? Could the release date be sooner than expected?
Here’s to another decade for online
I would be too, they are at the announcement stage of what will be their biggest money printer to date.
i was here 😭🥺
This is exactly what they did, idk why people think they would delete all of their stuff
"Forget everything you know about gaming" type vibes
They’re cooking
fr i fucking hated them everytime lmao
You’re insane if you think there's no more GTAOnline posts and updates… Festive Surprise is still coming along with a new business brought to us by Yusuf from GTA 4.
I got an email yesterday about a new gta online update in december.. salvage yard business with high end car thefts to supply it.

Also new drifting races
There truly may not be another release this big in our lifetime. It's wild.
I’m thinking of a November 2024 release.. it’ll be perfect
Im personally hoping for as early as July but I feel like probably won’t be able to get our hands on it until October of next year
With the amount of time they've had + reduced crunch I feel like there will be no delay this time
I'm definitely thinking Oct 2024
Both RDR2 and GTA 5 had their release almost exactly 2 years after the first trailers. Though if we're lucky we may see it before Christmas next year
I'm pretty sure they did this with RDR2 too. The posts are just privated and will most likely be put back on later so it doesn't really mean anything.
definitely next year!!
What does it mean in this context (cooking)? I'm confused.
We get the trailer in 4 days, its really not necessary anymore now
They might on Sunday.
probably just change the R\* logo color, then artwork during/after the trailer drops.
2 new followers(keep the chain going)
sus
Yeah I did. I kept looking at the poster for like 5 minutes straight.
If that happens I would be in the car on my way to buy a 70" OLED TV and a 5.1 speaker setup.
That would go crazy and honestly would be good imo for Christmas sales
Dozens of millions of people would call in sick in the following week and every single PS5s and Xbox X|S would vanish from online and retail stores.
Jizz would be flying around this sub if that happened
i would fucking explode omg
That would be amazing but highly unlikely it will happen
Idk if I’d want this tbh

Perfect scenario in my eyes in Q4 2024

We need some time to prepare for this game culturally.

And more ppl need to get their hands on ps5s lmao
zero casualties
[deleted]
They did say after the leaks...

"We will update everyone again soon and, of course, will PROPERLY INTRODUCE YOU TO THE NEXT GAME WHEN IT IS READY." 

If you take that literally, the game is ready now. Dropping sooner rather than later.
i think so
Yep it means they won’t post about anything else besides gta 6 or else they wouldn’t have wiped gta 5 from their socials
I’ve been dreaming of that for a year now lol
it says trailer 1 meaning they at least have 2-3 more planned. Most likely 1 for every 4-6 months to keep the interest going like they did with red dead.  


I'd say Fall 2024 as the most optimistic one. But realistically could be 2 years away if we account for delays that will happen.

Im afraid it may be sooner than we imagined, that’s sad cause I’d love buying their stocks, just like GTA5 with Lester, only real life. 

So I’d buy small amounts after the trailer hits and probably a little til the new online hit fully.
After that I’d probably buy some other shares in some other companies or something.

This is fun folks, remember Lester with ifruit(iphone) and lifeinvader(Facebook)

May Reddit be included in this new satire I’d wonder?
It had over 3k posts before
Just a bunch of online updates and merch announcements
lmao
[deleted]
Probably to show it’s the new beginning for them. The rebirth.
I don’t know man it’s almost like they are ready to promote an upcoming game they have
If it is the R* will regret it
Why would they need to reboot it at all? GTA is primarily an anthology series, where each story/entry is pretty self-contained/isolated from the rest of the franchise and feature unique characters.
GTA6 is going to be Rockstar's magnum opus. I expect they will be updating and supporting this game for at least 15 years. I'd also expect the next non-GTA title from Rockstar to drop no sooner than 2030 but probably even later.
Grand Theft Auto: ***VI***ce City.

The dawn of $200 games! Forget about the past! It's dead!
I had the same thought lol , but then I told myself to get back to work. Stop with the bs!
if that happens jesus fucking christ i will believe the magic of christmas
Hopefully March 2024 so I can buy it for my 30th birthday that's during that month.
The game will release Fall 2025
i can’t lie that would be an amazing way to generate hype
I’d pick up extra hours to buy a Ps5
Oof say it aint so with october release thats waaay to long. Im hoping march
I was thinking this as well but it would be an amazing Christmas gift
it’s most likely coming within a year. spring or winter 2024
GTA 5 took 19 months between first trailer and game release
Rumour has it the game will be available to pre order December 12.
> we're expecting a few more years until GTA 6 right?

1 at the maximum

> Is Rockstar marketing going to forget about GTA V until then?

yes.

> Could the release date be sooner than expected?

There is no date announced at all, so yes.
It’s so obviously coming out next year.

Potentially the biggest money printer ever in gaming history (until the next GTA ie)
This won't surpass GTA V. The hype for that game was something else and the online mode also delivered and became a cash cow for Rockstar. VI will come pretty close but I don't think there is enough hype for the game to sell 190 million copies.
i was here too! 🙋
“Everything we’ve made before this doesn’t matter” type vibes (in the good way)
I’m hoping the map is as lively as red dead 2

For me the biggest one was GTA V & Now the 2nd biggest one is going to be GTA VI
you guys are crazy lmao
Minecraft 2
This sub is fucking weird AF.
I highly doubt that. Mario Kart 9/10 etc Elder Scrolls 6, Elden Ring 2, GTA 7. We might not get another GTA for 15 years, but 15 years is not a lifetime.

They did say after the leaks. 

"We will update everyone again soon and, of course, will PROPERLY INTRODUCE YOU TO THE NEXT GAME WHEN IT IS READY." 

If you take that literally, the game is ready now. Dropping sooner rather than later.

definitely
as long as its not just for the fucking consoles.
I feel like early July is a solid early prediction - would be the “summer game” for a solid amount of people & whatnot, but i’m expecting a September release again hehe - 

either way i definitely can’t see it being like 2 years away from now, early 2025 the absolute latest
Famous last words
This game is not coming in 2024 2025 would be the earliest even rockstars themselves said it’s been delayed
slang for coming up with or working on something. that something could be as small as an opinion you hold or as large as a full scale project
hey hey hey let’s calm down i wanna drown in this new era like i’ll take anything 🧚🏼‍♀️
Right there with you but for another Series X. Wife wants to watch TV in the living room in those first few weeks? I’ll be in the office
100% I’m waiting until the game comes out then buying a system. Haven’t played a video game in about 7 years.
Imagine if the global economy shows noticeable slowdown on release day
You mean you ALSO play on ps3 right?
Ready to introduce and ready to release are completely different things. But ready to introduce still means that it is ending production soon.
when the time is ready, not the game.
Ah shit...
People are sat there playing it right now.
What a gimp
> Im afraid it may be sooner than we imagined, that’s sad cause I’d love buying their stocks, just like GTA5 with Lester, only real life.

What a bizarre take tbh. If you believe GTA6 release will be a profitable event, there is no reason for wanting a delay. As both as a gamer and as an investor you should want this game to come out sooner than later.

> So I’d buy small amounts after the trailer hits and probably a little til the new online hit fully. After that I’d probably buy some other shares in some other companies or something.

Why wait after the trailer hits? Buy now before the hype increase.
Much rather this than pointless update #600
LOL
Why?
I just hope their next project after 6 is a new IP. Something new and fresh.

 Via the questions on the conference call (believe it was the first question around 20/21 minutes into the call and then also a question later around 30 minutes into the call), the increase in earnings (theorized to be from GTA 6) has been “non materially” pushed into the next year fiscally from what it had been (possibly partially). Reading between the lines (sounds like the analyst who asked was doing the same thing) there is a possibility GTA 6 has been delayed to some extent at least compared to what they had originally expected for their game pipeline.

Nah I’m excited for the game, this just isn’t interesting or even matters for that sake. They’re literally just marketing the trailer coming out, which we already know when that’s happening.
Nah just here for actual content that means something. This? Means nothing.
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
I don't even have a ps5 yet, I could really do with not having to shell out for one right now. But of course I would if it happened...
The last two years I've gone away to live in other countries from May to October. Then I come back to where I live in the Alps in October and it rains through October and most of November till it starts to snow. Hardly any bars are open. Town is dead. March would be a bit inconvenient for me (although my birthday is that month as well, funnily enough!) October would be perfect for me.
That would be insane. It makes me not care about the trailer anymore at all lol
You mean 2035?
When GTA 5 released, they came out with a PS3 Bundle. Might save you a few extra bucks.
There's plenty of people saying it won't even be in 2024 so Im trying to keep my expectations in the dirt.  Especially because if it is slated for Q4 of 24, it's almost certainly getting delayed until Q1 or Q2 of 25.
It'll be announced for a 2024 fall release and delayed to March of '25.

Rockstar has an unannounced remaster coming.
This game is not coming next year it’s definitely coming in 2025
Nah 2025
Probably in media entertainment history

Red Dead 2 was so fantastic I really hope they brought all their skills from that game into GTA 6
I have heard graphically even now pre released graphically it’s even bettter than Red Dead 2 and i would hope so but that game is amazing with lit graphics….
Rockstar Games been shifting the gaming industry every time they release a new game. Based on track record i’m not calming down tbh.
This entire subreddit is about not calming down pal
I think youre in the wrong place
🤓☝️
I said LET THEM COOK
My reaction exactly! 😂 Check out the Rockstar Newswire for all the details.
Yes he is, he’s connected to the new junkyard business
>Our lifetime
hell no
Mario Kart and Elden Ring are not anywhere near GTA 6’s hype level. Elder Scrolls maybe, but that’s still gonna be far below GTA
Sure will feel like it lol. I get what he saying though. I don't think a Mario Kart title will be as big or impactful as this though.
For some it is, sadly
Ready to be introduced and ready to be released are not quite the same though
Games go gold mere weeks before launch, it's still cooking.
Spring 2025 100%
Hopefully not haha
before downvoting me pay some attention to the fiscal year, why the hell would they release it right at the end of their fiscal year? it’s obvious a fall 2024 release is likely.
Thanks
couldn’t you just move the xbox 😭
I haven’t gamed in years either, but hype for GTA6 has brought me back I just bought a PS5, and a OLED tv.

Currently Playing Spider-Man 2 & GTA Online, after I beat that I will play RDR2 for the first time.

I think there’s a lot of “former” gamers like us, that will come back once GTA6 releases.

People will probably not want to play it like the trilogy definitive edition
They never deleted all their posts for any other game they have released. It's abnormal behavior for them. Talking about this is far more interesting and insightful than a "do u guys thing there will be refueling" type of post.
Bro where’s ur joy in life? You sound so sad 😭
We’ll all stay skinny cuz we just won’t eat
This. I’ve been waiting for gta 6 to finally get a new Gen.
Xbox S are on sale for 250 at least lol
Gonna save up for a new tv. This game deserves to be played with the best possible setup. Untill release I guess I'll replay all of the old gta games just to appreciate how far we've come
GTA 2, remastered.
this is correct announced for fall 2024 and probably delayed until early spring 25
I am saying no release date for now. Next trailer will say spring 25 and then a delay to winter 25 to catch christmas

LOL mf´s downvoted what did the trailer say :D
Definitely proof?
[deleted]
Considering GTA V broke 7 Guinness world records not even a month after release, it’s almost guaranteed
Not enough players on consoles right now. GTA V had the advantage of releasing in the last year of the 7th gen consoles so they made money there and also the 8th gen consoles. Right now the console base is also much smaller and the game won't release on PC day one.
Bet you’re fun at parties
People love to act like they’re smarter for not being as hyped, but I can’t blame anyone for expecting THE SEQUEL TO GTA V to be amazing when literally every sequel they release for GTA is pretty groundbreaking.
I want it burnt straight up on fire
Damn, that confirms that he won't be in VI...
What are you 50?
Skyrim 2 ;)
I’m thinking fall 2024. I think by spring 2025 we’ll already be playing it.
likkleee too far away to start a marketing push right now imo, maybe if it got delayed
Don’t know why you getting downvoted lol rockstars themselves been teasing for 2025

maybe you should pay attention to the fiscal year or perhaps understand it more
I could lol but GTA is also one of the few big games my wife likes playing and we had a lot of fun playing online together. GTA 6 has long been my excuse for a second series x to go in the office so we can play together.
Bro…You lost a world…
The definitive edition is a very bad port / remaster.
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
I bought a ps3 for GTA5
Here we are 12 years later
I would pay top dollar for a remake of that. Even if only to see hot dog homicide updated & uncensored in all of its glory.
Look around rockstars themselves been teasing it for 2025
And you know this how you work for them? Rockstars themselves said the game has  been slightly delayed . Lol
GTA VI has had a decade’s worth of hype behind it behind previously mentioned game
gta 5 released on a 150 million+ install base, gta 6, even if it comes out 2 years from now, will release on less than 100 million ninth gen consoles. also, its over a decade of inflation to account for, yet the game will only cost 10 dollars more. 60 dollars in 2013 is equivalent to 79 dollars in 2023. so they are selling a game for less people, for less money. gta 5 was a prefect storm for them, especially because just a year later the ps4 and xone versions came out, and because of the lack of backwards compatibility, they got away with selling the same game twice right out of the gate, while the hype was still crazy. this won't happen again.
Who says it won’t release on pc on day one. Also, the game isn’t releasing right now lmao realistically it’s gonna take 1-2 years like the first game. By then, the ps5 pro and new xbox models will be coming out which will drop og prices a bit and people will buy them
Ikr imagine not being 14 😂😂😂
lol
hell no, not after starfield.
I hope so. I think they will say fall 2024 but then delay it to spring
GTA 5 trailer dropped 2 years before the game release same with rd2 this game is coming in 2025
I think they will plan for late 2024 and then delay it
Impatient kids is 90% of the subreddit lol
also Fiscal Year designation is given to the year in which the fiscal year ends, so FY25 comprises:

* Q1: April - June 2024
* Q2: July - September 2024
* Q3: October - December 2024
* Q4: January - March 2025

So, it sounds like they're saying the estimations of 8 billion in FY25 will fall short, but carry over into FY26, meaning right now, they're probably on course for a Q4 release, but knowing Rockstar, that will inevitably slip, so it's probably going to be released sometime between April - October 2025.
COOK
aw that sounds so fun i hope you guys enjoy it then
Crossplay should be in the game at launch, wait to see and if it is then buy a PS5
[deleted]
In the V.I.P. with the movie stars
😭 fuck
Dude, I did it for gta5 too xd
You unlocked a memory
FY2025 starts before 2025.
That’s what I have been thinking for a while now… like they don’t even need time to hype it up… they could take the next month just to try and get the word out to the few people left on this earth that don’t at least know about gta and then besides that? Everyone and their mother knows about this game and stay updated in some way shape or form.
I heavily agree, but people are downvoting you because they don’t want to face the truth. Who cares how big it is anyways, as long as we get a great game that’s all that matters.
Nah if there's anything that could come close would be a Skyrim 2. In terms of hype I mean. 

Starfield still sold like hotcakes even tho it was a new IP. 

Ofcourse it wouldn't best gta6 in terms of hype because it's gta lol, but if any game had to be second it would be Skyrim.
Damn they rlly downvoted you and u were right lol. Guess I was wrong, but I never doubted u!
put some money on it then lmao
i did bring up a delay but i honestly don’t think they’ll delay it at all, they seem quite ready this time around and i feel like they want a tighter marketing cycle - crunch is supposedly removed from the company so i can’t see them rushing it out or being that off schedule especially after a decade

also a delay would lead to a shit load of bad PR that i feel like rockstar is seriously trying to avoid with GTA VI specifically

regardless we’ll see 🤞🏾
lol it’s not impatience… there are multiple actual reasons if you look around
Bingo you got a good eye. Also it was leaked that rockstar internal employees were upset over the progress off the game  and said that 2024 is damn near impossible. It’s just hopium at this point with a lot of the people on this sub. Good eye my dude good eye
All the games you lost, you have no idea
Hey, hey I wanna be a pornstar.

People are downvoting him because he's pulling figures from his arse, lol. GTA VI is the game that will most likely convince those who haven't upgraded to next-gen to do so. GTA is a system seller, both Sony and Microsoft are waiting on this one because they know their consoles are finally going to fly off the shelves once it releases.
nope
Thanks!! Lol I was still kinda wrong though I expected the trailer to say fall 2024, but then a delay until spring. Now I am worried it will be fall 2025 😬 lol
300$?
I'm just going by my memory of every rockstar release ever. Always expect delays. They will delay a game for 6 months to fix something you probably won't even notice. And that's why I love them.
[deleted]
You think i sell my body? I merely sell my time

I aint no Cinderella,  I ain't waiting for no prince 

 in fact until just now I was doin' just fine
And well, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
As someone who's thinking of buying a PS5 just to play GTA 6 on launch day, I totally agree with you.

Countless people will see this game as a good reason to upgrade their console.
Yea I’m thinking the same thing. I bet it’s gonna be fall 2025.
i’m even canadian so that’ll essentially bankrupt me but bet 🤞🏾🤝🏾
i understand that but there’s been enough of a shift within their company eternally that we can’t expect them to do things the same way anymore. even this announcement in itself was much different than usual… i feel like it would be more naive to think things will play out the same way they always did. all those departures… there is no way the company is the “same”. yes it’s still rockstar but not the same one that released all those games we love - that will either be for better or worse and we’ll just have to see what happens. 

next year release tho
It's a great game. A bit tedious in the beginning, but worth it. It's the best medieval game for me.
Kingdome Come Deliverance….A decade of amazing games, legendary games…And your first choice is Kingdom Come Deliverance…..
It just sounds like a lot of wishful thinking to me, I don't see why there's any reason to think this time would be different. I hope you're right, but they can have as much time as they need in my opinion.
You won't be able to explore the map right away
Alleast, this is my theory. We have seen in earlier gta and rdr that rockstar chooses parts of the map to be forbidden in the beginning. Resulting in 5 police stars. Gta v was an exception though. I think this time will again have a map limitation. Why? Because Lucia is wearing a police ankle tag in the released promo art. This is the perfect way to limit where we can go.
That's a really good observation. It would also be a fun way to be restricted, because we *could* go beyond the limit but immediately get chased by the police. Smarter than putting physical limits to our movements
Judging from the trailer she doesn't really seem like someone to give that much of a shit about something like that. Could be something like RDR2 where you get some serious heat for going to close to Blackwater etc.
Im going to guess she's going to break the monitor and they go on the run at some point.
[deleted]
I'd like to add that a map limitation makes it even more fun to play, because there would be new parts to explore later in the game
she didnt have it on when they were robbing that store at the end of the trailer!
Hmm I like your theory, makes perfect sense, it would be cool to have that again
Don’t know if someone already brought this up, but i genuinely think that Jason is some kind of undercover agent. Watch his face when he’s saying “trust”. He is pretty nervous, almost like he’s hiding something.
I've seen this idea floating around and what I kinda don't get is that Jason probably wasn't in Jail so what's stopping the player from switching to him and exploring the map anyway? Unless we don't unlock the ability to play as him until Lucia's ankle monitor gets removed?
Limitation makes it better experienced IMO. Just like RDR2, chapter by chapter the map expands until fully
I assume that Lucia and Jason will start at the opposite side of the map. Lucia being in jail and will start in the southern part of Leonida while Jason will be in the northern, more rural and redneck area of Leonida.
That's a good spot and good theory. A great way to lock parts of the map without having islands
 III: Bridge exploded


VC: Storm alert !


GTA IV:

Closed bridges against immigrants, LCPD gives 6 star wanted level if an immigrant crosses.


GTA V has but partially.

When Trevor kidnaps Martin's wife both him and Michael will face against Cartel if they drive in LS till Trevor gives her back to Martin. Franklin is the only expection.

Yes we can't explore when started a new game, maybe in some missions we can see that tracker will be removed. This means, "Hey you can't start to discover till you are ready."
Good catch
Guess I’m switching to Jason and throwing an alligator at a gas station cashier in the Keys.
o shit thats cool
I like the idea that it could start in prison too. Spend a little time in prison walking and talking with other inmates and guards, before being released into the grand world of Vice City
Is this Promo art by rockstar? I thought it was a fan art
Guaranteed you’ll play as Lucia in prison for a bit and they’ll start introducing you to the mechanic of the game, she’ll get into a fight, they’ll probably introduce the eating mechanics, shower mechanics etc.
If thats the case then we probably won't get to play Jason until that ankle monitor comes off. Otherwise we could just use Jason to explore the map. Also aren't these ankle monitors just for house arrest?
I hope so...instinct is to explore the map and ruin all suprises asap...restrictions mean you get nice reveals all through the game.
Who else thinks GTA 6 brings back 6-star wanted levels?
I have seen many people saying ankle monitors after the trailer. Can someone explain me what is it exactly and what it does?
I wonder if Jason and Lucia will have to buy guns at different places. Jason can buy them in actual gun stores but Lucia would have to buy them from black market gun dealers, kinda like GTA 4 since felons can't buy guns.
It's a double edged sword, I prefer to have a map that restricted from the start as it persuades me to play the main story and get rewarded by unlocking new areas. On the other hand, it's kinda pointless since it's mostly one large metropolitan area with some rural towns(as far as I know).
How do I get the flair?
Given the first scene being lucia in prison id say your bang on eith this. What i find funny is why they added thia to the promo art almost like its going to be a permanant thing with her character?
better. It makes the game feel more like an adventure
smart! how did it take rockstar this long to think of that?! the ankle monitor could be used to just constantly lure police to your location when you’re somewhere you’re not supposed to be. perfectly valid way to keep restricted areas of the map restricted without arbitrary walls and explanations.
First few hours of story is probably Lucia getting a charge, on house arrest, mission involves petty theft where Jason ends up helping her out of it/escape somehow which allows him to be able to play from then on.
Mostly likely you start the game as Lucia and play as her for an opening chapter while restricted to a certain part of the map until you then are able to play as Jason.
Safe assumption I think but good find nonetheless
It's gonna be interesting
Makes sense, would be a good way to do it.

Wonder if the parole officer will be used in a similar way to the therapist in V.

Off doing all these crimes, but got to make your meeting and talk about all the ways you are staying away from crime.
There better not be no fucking curfew
This is what I missed from the GTA franchise. Like there's always an adventure looking forward.
Lucia seems like a bad ass, can’t wait to play her
Good catch actually
Nice observation
I never would have realised this
really good observation!
Has the ankle monitor been done in any other games? It's such a creative and perfect solution for gta to open up the game later. I feel like it's so simple a 100 games must have done it before.
Honestly...in a way that is a good thing. I know when 5 came out, I was quick to explore the whole map as fast as I possibly could and really overlooked way too much stuff. Looking back, that was a mistake and I should have taken my time with it and enjoyed the immersion of the game. 

I planned on doing it with 6, but if that is the case and they limit it, it will help me fight the urge to check everything out
Ok if that’s true then that is clever af
Damn every time I see somebody come up with a speculation like this and it makes too much damn sense. It just pisses me off that my brain doesn't work and connect the dots that quickly.
Your starter missions with involve your probation officer too
Why'd they make Eminem the main character?
Haven’t every gta game locked off areas?
Yes, because this game has always been known to follow rules and laws as a player.
And he’s a Narc! He’s undercover or an informant
Just FYI, all GTA games except 5 had map limitations.
I think that would be kinda fun.

&#x200B;

R\* "don't leave this area"

me "no"

R\* "Call NOOSE"
If the multi city theory is real maybe the ankle monitor stops you from going to the other cities.
would be nice if it was a new mechanic for being arrested, like being unable to use one of the couple for a while, and pay bail. Got both arrested? auto bail or get back into the save.
Most GTA games until GTA 5 restricted you from going to areas that you're not suppose to go too otherwise you get a 4 star wanted level. So it seems like they are bringing that back in GTA 6.
Yeah but Jason doesn’t have an ankle monitor so he could go everywhere when the story makes you play as him
damn
I don’t get it. Can’t she use scissors?
Dang
Damn, nice eye
I think this will be similar to the beginning of GTAV, where you start in North Yankton. Maybe in GTAVI, we’ll start elsewhere, and when we move to Vice City the ankle monitor will disappear.

Great observation btw, somehow I hadn’t noticed this.
Like every GTA game minus 5.
Man that’s cool, If the game starts with Lucia being in prison and we have the map locked until she gets released and then we slowly get allowed to see more it would be badass
Good strat from Rockstar, altho since GTA3, they've always try to include a somewhat logical reasoning behind why parts of the maps were not explorable until the story progresses.  It was definitely fun back in the day trying to circumvent the barriers though, through stunt jumps, mods, etc
![gif](giphy|d3mlE7uhX8KFgEmY)
thats crazy
Jokes on you she’s on house arrest the whole game uh oh
you probably will be able to. if an ankle braclet is limiting you to the city, then you'll probably gain a couple stars for leaving. similar to the trilogy and 4.
Expect to see an article that says “Redditor finds interesting fact about GTA VI map”
Really hope we get a restricted map that opens more throughout the story, would love the feeling of seeing some of the cities/sights through the story in a proper fashion!
I first thought the ankle monitor was part of car and she was missing a foot. Thought, "oh Damm, can't explore til I get a prosthetic foot"
I just assume it will be similar to t where you will be able to switch between the characters. Or will be like cyberpunk and you can pick the gender you want to play.
I can imagine how people will still explore the map even with a 5 star wanted level. after 10 years of practice, we are ready to dodge the Police, Military, UFOs. :-D
One of the greatest observations/theories ever for GTA...no bs.
That’s a good theory that makes a lot of sense.
I can't wait for this to be released!
Oh I hope collector’s edition has an ankle monitor that’s actually a step counter
Sadly it’s not releasing to PC till 2026. I’m ok with that tho seeing as the console users will be beta testing the game till they iron out everything and port it to pc. Same thing happened with GtA V and when it went on pc it was the definitive addition
My take: first part of the game we control Lucia, only having a portion of the map available. Later she meets Jason, an undercover cop who was told to gather info on her. He instead falls for her and is divided between his job and love. At the end we have to choose for him.
Christ I love this community. It’s been 4 day. Y’all put in work
Oh god please no, the best part of GTA V was the open world and discovering
I think i will be with chapters, and jason will play the main role at the begining, Lucia being restricted in movement and doing crime.
Just like playing as Arthur in RDR2
Why so sexy
Pfff 2025..
why so late the game release tho?
Am I the only one who thought it would come out 2024? 🥲
Perfect. The trailer dropped so we can start making shit up. Then 'credible youtubers' will read the random shit and say it's factually coming out with the release. Then when it isn't fans can say rockstar lied to them.
As long as the map isn’t discoverable I’m fine with a restriction for the first few missions
nice catch
Alternative theory: This GTA map won't be an island and the ankle tag is the way they prevent us from going out of bounds.
>Gta v was an exception though.

No it was not. You probably just forgot because it was a much shorter lockout time. First there is the intro bank robbery in that one snowy intro map and then upon transitioning to Franklin, I don't think the game really gives you true exploration until you get to his house.  Though I might be wrong about the second part as I think the cop chaise actually gives you a lot of freedom to go wherever you want in the map.

edit: I just remembered that GTAV also implemented mid story lockouts at least on on a character basis.  Pretty sure there is a part where Michael and Trever will get a crazy wanted level if they step into the city part of the map.
Wouldn't mind this at all honestly, when I played RDR2 the first time I didn't allow myself to go to St. Denis until it made sense for the story.
Are we not seeing that rockstar could let you play as the guy for the beginning of the game until they both find a way to take off the ankle bracelet
That’s Troy Baker without a doubt
Out of curiosity why would you want the whole world open from the start?  
I love exploring for ages and then realizing all that time it was a small part of the whole world. 

I.e. OG FF7 you spent the whole disc 1 just in Midgar only to realize thats just one city of the whole world.
OR, later in the game after she commits serious crimes? Sounds interesting.
imagine being stuck in the house for a week🤣
Haha, forget exploring the map, you'll end up in a parallel universe where cats rule and humans fetch. Trust me, it's a wild ride you don't want to miss! 😉🐱
This tracks tho because in every game you can't just go everywhere off jump
I so wanna see a return of Tommy Vercetti
Finally!  This is something from the old games that was sorely missing in five.  It's like you want to check it out, but you couldn't, although you might be able to find ways to do it and then have the police chase you, it was so exciting when you would eventually unlock a part of the map.

I also think this helped you learn the map better, because since you were in one area for longer, you would fully explore that area more.

This is definitely a great change if they're going back to expanding the map slowly.
Wow I never noticed this. Crazy. First time I’m seeing it mentioned as well. I believe your theory is 100 percent right. Since it seems like we should be getting vice city, San Andreas and liberty city. If that’s true I can see us being stuck to vice city at the beginning of the game.
I‘m thinking they might be trying to throw us off the prison break idea with the artwork so it comes as a surprise? Cause I don’t see how an ankle monitor would make sense. There would be no logical way to lose any wanted level if the cops have GPS on you
In RDR2 you can go anywhere after the intro gameplay. Same with GTAV. I see no reason for them to revert to nearly 2 decade old gameplay.
Yeah so screw this two year out announcement garbage.
I'm already limited to nothing by wanting to play it on a pc
But please take note of the birds in the sky, this could indicate Lucia is capable of animorphing into a bird allowing the player to explore the entire map. Alleast, this is my theory.
Paid DLC to unlock the rest of the map by removing the ankle monitor.
I just hope every building is accessible
Uh, I hate when games do that
It's laughable that they even revealed this game so early since it won't drop for about another year and a half. Why not wait to show it off next year instead? Or better yet just wait till 2025 to reveal it that way its way closer to release?
Keep putting out random theories and the one that gets you a DM from Rockstar legal, you know you're on the right track
CAN WE NOT?? 😒

Leave that shit in past games!! We don't need it for modern ones thank you!!
Pretty sure the story starts off with lucia getting caught doing robbery and she loses her baby or something then you start the game breaking out of prison
Gta VI = big ass twerk
GTA 6 = BIG ASS TWERK LOOL
Your theory? I saw someone post this earlier but not mention the map thing until the comments and now it’s here…weird
Weird how I made the post like this couple of hours before this one, and it never got going.
Just testing if I got the flair
Anyone else bothered by Lucia's arm looking unrealistic long? 😂
#trailerdayOG
Am I the only one that doesn’t want to play as a female character? I’m glad there’s the option for those that do, but it seems like the story revolves around Lucia mostly and I don’t want to play as Lucia. I’ve seen someone called an incel for saying something like this, I’m not sure how you’re an incel for wanting to play as a male character.
She's a liability. Dump her in the river.
im 48 years old.  I was so excited for this trailer. Was any one else underwhelmed by it?  No past story lines?
I cannot see gta online having a restricted map and the millenials that start playing the story mode and realise theres a restricted part of the map will just hop onto online and play the full map 💯
Restricted map unless you pay £89.99 to unlock the next part of the story
Nice way to dlc the rest of the map.
#trailerdayOG
Crazy how boring of a game gta 5 was
Y’all understand those limit you to a house or designated areas like work and going to work.
just like Niko was going to have fingerless gloves, according to posters?

i wouldnt make such statements right off the bat, besides, theres 2nd character...
i like the new trailer but story wise i got a bad feeling, like why do we have 2 main characters that is a couple the strong point of gta in general was the freedom so that you could do everything but now that is going to the bonnie and clyde direction i got a bad feeling

i also heard that there were 3 or 4cities to play in 
like los santos, liberty city, vice city and maybe las vegas. i really hope that in the next trailer or something we meet a new main character and that they released this trailer to keep the fans off on the wrong track and that we still got other playable characters to play as only 2 characters like a boyfriend and girlfriend really is a let down for me

and dont get me wrong if it was only a guy or or only a girl or 2 girls and 2’guys i was not really disapointed i really dont like the fact to play as a couple in gta but thats my opinion what do yall think of it
[deleted]
That's been gone by the way side. It was broken bridges, the Ubisoft models and now the botw model. Even in 5 everything was mostly open. Hell, spider man 2 did away with towers that just wasted people's time. I doubt r* is going backwards
This is not your theory, you saw it from a YouTuber like we all did.
[removed]
Ankle bracelet in art = map locked

&#x200B;

Genius thinking here

&#x200B;

/s
Maybe its like when Michael was barred from entering LS but the other characters can
Oh wow how didnt i notice this haha well done op
Nice catch!
jason looks like a police officer who is looked down on his job
what if lucia is a criminal and jason falls in love with her and the story starts like this
great catch!
Maybe Lucia has the limitation but Jason doesn’t
Nice catch! And a great way to limit the players in a "fun" and realistic way
There's nothing strange about hearing that. This allows Rockstar to limit the character's movement to one zone/towns, leaving time to potentially develop other towns or islands.
That's a genius idea
i wonder if that will give you instant 6 stars or a 1 star but you couldn't hide from it and it quickly goes to 6 so you could see/interact with new zones briefly before getting killed
Like in GTA IV where you'd get 6 stars for going to another island
I think the ankle monitor will stay with us as a part of the prologue of the game
Like what they did in rdr2 for trying to enter black water
I mean, that's a pretty classic Rockstar mechanic. 

Even in games like GTA:SA you could force your way into the different areas despite the bridges being closed and you'd just get a wanted level.  Very similar to RDRII as well and heading back to Blackwater.
That would also make far more sense being restricted via tag rather than on previous occasions where we would get 6 stars for simply exploring the other cities that were blocked because of an earthquake with no other context.
In GTA 3 you couldn't explore the entire map in the beginning.  But I liked to use a cheat to get the jet, and as soon as you left the starting area it was an immediate 5-star level.

This would have its own in-game explanation as to why you couldn't just leave the level.  But I'd rather see like a perpetual 2 or 3-star rating that stays with you as long as you're in the wrong area, but it goes away when you're back in the starting areas.  The FBI isn't going after someone on house arrest.
Imagine Rockstar goes even further with the police system and has a warrant system on top of the wanted system
Didn't they had something like that in previous GTAs ? Where going to a new area causes you to gain 6 stars immediately. Not sure how fun it was for the people that wanted to explore to be punished by it (Even more if they didn't care too much about the story)
GTA SA did that I remember lol.
This has been Rockstar’s go-to method for limiting map exploration since GTA SA
That was literally the case in GTA IV. You could just hijack a helicopter and fly to the other boroughs, but you also caught a 6 star wanted level doing it. Wasn't actually that much fun.
It’s gonna be like in red dead 2 where they make it impossible to explore because you eat 50 bullets a minute
This is exactly how it worked in the old games though. You *could* leave but you would have 5 stars.
The invisible aimbot sniper is back!
Let’s say she’s out under conditional-release like a furlough, she could be fed-up and rip it off illegally herself, or he finds out when he goes to pick her up and they decide to tear it off.. 

Orrrr.. They don’t?

Only as an added consequence, maybe now they’ll have bounty hunters or heightened police AI leaving Miami giving our first “in-game limitation” 

Like that’s *if* the subplot is prison break which is being debunked that it couldn’t be the case.
[removed]
Breaking it will just alert the police i think. Im sure she will  get rid of it in "proper" way. Either from doing good things for the police, or by using police insider to access the release mechanism.

That way she will be more free later than getting blacklisted
I like the idea of this being her third strike, so breaking parole again would give her something like a life sentence.


When she breaks it, her and Jason know it's their last time together, thus the all-out crime spree.
Could be how she ends up in prison? I doubt they would release her and put her on house arrest. Too big of a profile and an easy target.
It is actually an intelligent way to limit the explorable area
It was, actually. Saw it here a couple of hours ago.
Where can I get that flair? 

I am a member of this sub even long before any leaks.
It has been lol on on like the 10 other GTA related subs.
I agree, a sense of progression is what keeps me coming to the game days after days
I dislike it, but at the same time its good for players like me. I would have discovered and fucked around for weeks before hitting chapter 2 in the story
Maybe this is how they Include the switching between characters game mechanic. Maybe Lucia can’t leave Vice City, so to explore the other cities/areas of the map you have to switch to and play as Jason. Then taking the information you gather while playing with Jason can help you locally with Lucia.  Idk
Hasn't that always been the way though? You couldn't go everywhere at first?
Absolutely not...
Classic gta experience
Why so sexy
Nice catch
If the game gives you the option to kill one, who would you kill? Would be an interesting choice between a violent criminal or a backstabbing undercover agent.
Not fucking Heat ending again
I’m getting fast and furious vibes, if he’s a fed at all I doubt he’ll stay one
Or he could be having second thoughts. So far Lucia seems like the brains of the operations and is taking advantage of him because he could have a kind soul in comparison
I like this idea. Might be a stretch but the chain Jason is wearing reminds me of the type that police officers wear with their badge attached.
That would actually be a nice way to play as a cop as well
I doubt. I don’t think R would repeat a similar story line from GTA 5 (Michael working with the feds)
The trailer made it feel like Lucia is the main character. I'd guess that you start the game as Lucia and don't unlock switching until later on.
[deleted]
Good question! Maybe Jason isn't playable in the beginning? Like in gta v it also took a while to play as Michael and Franklin? Or, also possible, they follow each other everywhere?
You don't get to play as other characters in GTA V immediately, so why do you think you do get that in VI?   


We probably start the game as Lucia being released from prison, but given an ankle monitor and told not to leave certain area. Then, after a bunch of story missions, she is released or finds a guy to remove the monitor, and we also get to use the other character as well.
I think you hit the nail on the head. V had us play as Franklin then introduced Michael then finally Trevor. So I think we'll play as Lucia: escape, get change of clothes (like Claude and 8-Ball: The bomb maker 💣) and link up with Jason. I do wonder if Jason breaks Lucia out: A Bonnie and Clyde thing. 

What will the hidden packages be? Maybe 🎈red balloons as a nod to Vice City Stories 🌴🩷.
Thats what a mate and I were thinking as well, defo seems like we'll be Lucia for a while at the start of the game, we'll see her get out of prison and somehow she'll meet Jason. Curious to see whether Jason is just some guy she randomly meets or if she knows him from before.
all these micropenis hicks that drive lifted ford f150s with 15 american flags on the back cannot comprehend the thought of a female main character

theyre gonna lose their shit
My theory is that Jason betrays Lucia or dies like Jackie in Cyberpunk early on.
I'm so happy to see most folks agree.  Much better design
In RDR2 after the first chapter the entire map opens up so I don't know what you're talking about.
RDR2 lets you explore the whole map after the first chapter lol
It also allows them to have the whole map open for GTAO from day one without doing anything meaningfully different to the map itself. The GTAO character just won’t have the ankle monitor, and bam! The whole map is open.
IV islands were closed because of terrorism threats. Man are there any GTA ogs left here?
>VC: Storm alert !

I always thought this was so cynical. "All bridges to the mainland have been closed due to a severe weather warning". Nope, we're not even going to evacuate you, if the storm hits, you're locked on that island. Good luck.
I think you forgot GTA San Andreas there buddy boy
It also gives you the fun game of seeing how much map you can unlock before you get taken down.
3 was actually because the bridge was broken during the opening cutscene and the tunnels were under repair
Didn’t San Andreas also block you from certain parts of the map? It’s been ages so I’ve forgotten
LCPD are racist 😆. No immigrants allowed here. I think the bridge being closed is a reference to GTA 3: Bombs were used by Columbian Cartel to blow up 💥 Callaghan bridge. If GTA 3 were remade it would be the Demolition Charge from Cayo Perico.
Few “shanking” missions.
Yeah the tutorial of fighting, wrestling, stealth and the weapon wheel should be a few missions while Lucia’s in jail
Seems likely and would be very cool
it's the thumbnail of the trailer video
Yeah exactly what I’m thinking
Sometimes a parolee has the ability to work and run errands to get acclamated with life again upon release. But the stipulation is that they need to be home by a specific time and not associate with specific people from their criminal past.
it'll beep and send the police an alert that you're fucking around and doing shit you're not supposed to be doing. nowadays they got microphones and shit, so they can hear you and talk to you and ask you if you're fucking around.

usually used for house arrest iirc, so im surprised that lucia has one whilst living in a motel
Its like a type of monitor you get on bail to monitor your movements i think
It's a GPS tracker, so the police can tell you that you are not supposed to leave a certain area, and if you do they are notified, and they can track you with it.  


So in terms of a game, they can be used to lock you into a certain area of the map, just like they used to do in all the games before GTA V.
They exist in real life. Police uses them on arrested people that should stay within a certain place, so they can't flee. And that they can monitor where they go
There’s no gun stores in NY lol that’s why Niko buys from black market dealers
[deleted]
it's def not though because it's gone already in the liquor store robbery clips
with an emphasis on the ASS.
Because Sex sells.
I figured there was a chance for end of 2024, but not surprised to hear them hedge their bets towards 2025. There is always a chance of an early release, it's happened before and if they did manage to get it out by end of 2024 with limited issues on release it would buy R\* a *lot* of goodwill. Underpromise and overdeliver.
You’re not the only one. I didn’t think it would given R* past trailer/game release time lines. What I did find interesting was they said 2025. Didn’t give a date. So could be early 2025 or it could be mid for the summer or late just in time for the Holidays. Maybe that was intentional so that way if they do have a “delay” it’s still in the same time frame of when trailer one was released and doesn’t disappoint their fans and most of all its stockholders.
U kno the vibes
Except the previous game. GTA 5 has no limits you can go anywhere from the start
He doesn't exist in the HD universe and the VA is dead sooooo... best chance is an easter egg nodding to him
Unlikely given that the voice actor, Ray Liotta, passed away earlier this year, or sometime late last year.
Personally I couldn't care less about the gender of a game character.
It's not incel behavior but it really is pathetic
Flip side, I don't enjoy playing dudes. This would be the first time someone could play as anything other than a dude for the story in any GTA game (at least for ones made in this century).
You’re dumb or young if you find this surprising. Been doing this shit for 20+ years.
The invisible sniper in RDR2 was extremely backwards, and that was their most recent game.
it’s really not a bad theory
I'll probably will function like trying to get into New Austin with Arthur in RDR2. You get sniped right away, and it's impossible to make any relevant advance in the area until you progress the main plot.

In GTA 6 you will probably get a bunch of stars and won't be able to freely roam the area (I think there were similar mechanics in previous GTA games, but my memory isn't helping).
That's pretty much what happened with San Andreas - the cops didn't want you leaving town so as soon as you went to one of the "locked" areas you had cops after you and pretty much no way to get away from them.
1 star and Dog the Bounty Hunter comes for you
Imagine having the military go to town on you just because you broke police monitoring.
My guess is if you go into their the game’s version of Disney world and start shooting up the place, they are gonna give you 6 stars real quick
Same in San Andreas, and vice city too i think? It's a pretty common thing in GTA.
I wonder if each character will have their own special abilities and the female protagonist will have certain abilities that make certain areas of the game more accessible but you wont be able to use those abilities until the ankle monitor is off later in the story.
I will forever be annoyed with all the single player stuff that was cut
GTA VI made sense too to be fair. There was a terrorist scare so you needed documents to go between bridges and enter other boroughs, but Niko is without a visa. Roman states it in the first mission.
I think u mean FIB not FBI
They do if you're a terrorist crossing into ~~Manhattan~~ Algonquin.
I realllly hope not-that was a terrible part of RDR2. Like give me 6 stars with unending droves of cops, but don’t just kill me randomly in one shot. Really kills immersion.
[removed]
It'll alert the police sure, but you've still got that initial time from breaking it to the police showing up. We could theoretically see her break it early in the story and then within seconds jump into a car with Jason and speed off. I just really hope there isn't a plot where you're helping the government/police again, I really didn't like the FIB shit with GTA V.
What if we have to do filler missions to get the ankle monitor removed before we can continue Lucia’s story, or if we decide not to, they’re harder because we’re hunted
They’re not that hard to take off you know. There’s YouTube tutorials on it
*It's an intelligent way to explain immediate police response.
I liked GTA IVs. "Fucking terrorist attacks"  forcing you to stay on the New Jersey side of the map
Imagine the first few missions as Lucia are just spent under house arrest, like you can’t even leave the property, that would be kinda entertaining imo
yeah I was shocked when that shit was first noticed here. literally never would've seen it.
check main post on the sub, the second one pinned by moderator. have fun.
Totally agreed. I missed that sense of progression in GTA5. I didn't like how you started out with fast cars, good weapons and the entire map immediately. I like it in SA when you struggle to find a good car and weapon at first and money is tight. It makes it feel better when you're on top of the world at the end.
For just $20 a day you can experience Vice City in all its glory. * 

*$20 a day unlocks the game for 2 hours or 3 missions whichever is completed first. Purchase Shark Cards for additional time in Vice City.
I'm the same I did all fishing 🎣 spots/Bunkers/Hunting before completing the story of Far Cry 5. I just love exploring
It’s good for the first time you play the game, but quite annoying for later replays..
I still haven't ever gotten to chapter 3 in RDR2. What usually happens is I play enough to get every weapon (currently purchasable), and all the craftable gear I can craft, run around faffing about (so fun in rockstar games.) Then I quit for a couple of weeks and eventually decide to uninstall to make space on my ssd. 

Due for another repeat of The Cycle pretty soon, actually. I think this'll be my fourth time.

Great game. 197 hours.
I’m here for the online play. We’re not leaving the house in 2025.

Edit: 
Your boos mean nothing to me, I’ve seen what makes you cheer.
Good point.
Not in GTA V
That’s what I thought but apparently GTAV didn’t have locks on it, which I can’t remember at all anyway because it’s been so long
no its mostly like this. remember Red Dead Redemption 2? the entire first chapter is an isolated part of the map
I think you replied to the wrong comment 😭
Why not?
Option C:

Bonnie and Clyde Ending  (I bet this is one of the endings)
And obviously if you stay on the option selection scene for 30min you also unlock Option C - where you do neither and you unlock the secret hot coffee ending. Only the first 5000 people will unlock it before R* patches it before they get into tons of controversy like they did with San Andreas. It was a way for Dan Houser to give a final love letter to the fans before he left the company years ago.
form the story point, i think i would prefer to kill Jason, just because i don’t think i’ll cope with a situation where you lied about yourself throughout the entire game and then kill the person who desperately loved you.
If it comes down to one or the other, I'm offing Jason in a heartbeat lol
Maybe once you develop "trust" with Lucia and they're really a team do you start playing as Jason. Or once the game deems it important to show his side of the story, basically.
This was just Lucia's trailer, and I think that was pretty obvious given the content shown. The next one will be Jason's and fucus mostly on him and other areas of the map.
This makes sense because if we had access to Trevor 💥☠️ from the start. Would we want to play as Michael or Frank?
I mean the first GTA trailer made it feel like Michael was the main character, and that didn’t exactly turn out to be true
Yeah. Could just have a long first act; not something Rockstar is unfamiliar with. You didn't get to play/switch as Trevor in 5 until a few hours into the main story (not counting the opening bank robbery). GTA 4 took its time and kept most of the map locked for a bit as well. RDR2s opening is known to be a slog by many, and is rumored to have been even longer.

Wouldn't be at all surprised if the game had an opening beat with Jason (like 5's opening) before putting you in the shoes of Lucia, whom we play as for ~2.5 hours or something, and then get reintroduced to Jason in present-time with the ability to free-roam and switch between the two.
Rockstar loves doing trailers like this, where you think one character is the main character and then they release two to three other trailers of other characters.
[deleted]
Lucia: i can ~~fix~~ break him
You mean it took a while to play as Trevor. You could play as Michael and Franklin almost immediately.
Maybe Lucia , after being released, catches Jason doing a shitty robbery and sometime later offers to help him bc she has experience since that could be one of the reasons she was put into prison.
GTA V had something similar, after Caida Libre neither Michael or Trevor can go back to Los Santos until after Paleto Heist
Same. Gives a bit of an incentive to focus on the story missions.
You can't really go to New Austin and Blackwater as Arthur so no. Also Guarma is limited.
I don't really understand how are you downvoted. After you complete the first chapter which is extremely short, you come off the mountain for your second camp location and you have the map to yourself to explore.
I never said not being physically unable to go there, you're (knowingly) completely missing the point.
To remember playing IV at release you’d have to be at least 19 now (aged 4)

To have played it at release when it was more appropriate you’d be ~27 (aged 12)

Absolutely wild there’s going to be 17 YEARS between IV and VI
That's why they did that. LCPD found that terrorists nationatilties are similar with immigrants who tries to survive in that land of oppurtunity.
I always took it that the bridges were the dangerous places, not the islands.

But it was almost always sunny anyway :P
SA burnt me while playing as a beginner, will play again.
And liberty city stories - a prequel to 3 basically gives the excuse of strikes from ferry workers for the reason why the bridge is closed.
Yeah, which I think in the story was based on officer what's his name not wanting you to go to far.

Regardless of the reason, I absolutely love when they restrict you like this because it's just so much more fun to progress through the game and unlock more parts of the map.

Plus you spend more time in fewer areas and therefore learn them better.
not always used for house arrest; can just be used to enforce restrictions like curfews when they want to keep you in a spot where you can still do work and give a reasonable contribution to society while still serving a punishment for your crime.
Ohhh. Thanks for the info
Probably not during the holidays. Wouldn’t make sense to try and compete with COD.
Put some respect on Ray Liotta’s name please
I didn't know about that. I think the ankle tag will be the "Starter Island" of this game.  Pretty much everyone copies botw now. It's a good way to do it. Give a little bit of the map and then after the tutorial or prologue is over you get the whole map.  If it's really 3x the size of gta5 then in might need to be broken up a little. Shit the only game I can think of bigger that gta5 is eldin ring even if gta5 is mostly desert.
In GTA 3, the bridge to the rest of the map had to be repaired and wouldn’t be repaired until a certain mission

And Vice City had weather storms where the bridges were closed off until a certain mission.

Can’t remember if SA or IV had forced limitations and 5 didn’t restrict you at all
5 stars for a parole violation (tanks, FIB, swat teams) would be overkill. But it has GPS, so even 2 stars you couldn’t lose would be annoying.

But maybe they just do a cut scene and put you back in the city. They do this in GTA Online with the Cayo Perico heist if you get seen by guards. Cut scene of you getting caught, then you spawn back at the airport.
This reminds me of San Andreas: leaving Los Santos before being kidnapped by Tenpenny🔵🔴. 6 stars but with Invincibility on you could collect all the: Oysters and Horses shoes early.
It's like in GTA SA,where Hernandez told CJ not to leave Los Santos,and if he does...Bam! instant 4 stars.

Lucia probaby got threatened by some government officials to do their bidding for them.
I would really hate not being able to freely explore by means of a physical blockade or an instead death.
> trying to get into New Austin with Arthur in RDR2

It was almost like a mini-game in itself - taking Kamikaze runs past the river to see how far you could get.

In retrospect, it was a brilliant design choice - it kept you wondering 'what's over there?' - I loved that game.
There'll be tons of videos about "how to get in all areas of the map without wanted glitch" I wonder what cheat codes there'll be
i’d bet if anybody at all sees you you’d get 3-4 stars, and all shops would close down, manhunt style
hey! how did you got that flair?
No stars in III and VC. But in theory you weren't supposed to be able to reach later islands before the barriers were removed, in those two, as you coudn't swim.
Every rockstar game has a ton of stuff cut from them, GTA VI included.
VI =/= IV
Not to be that guy... but that actually is pretty immersive.

If you were riding around an area where you were basically wanted dead. You'd likely just get shot on site and not realize it.

I can't think anything more immersive. Nearly every criminal who has died running from the law did so by a bullet they didn't expect from a shooter they couldn't identify at the moment they were hit.
Maybe not 6 stars because you are not exactly new saddam hussein but someone suggested 1 star that doesn't go away which is enough to keep you out of that part of the map in a realistic and fun way
Sorry bro. How do you do the spoiler tag? I also have no idea how to link websites or gifs. Bit of a newbie 😶
every gta game has missions with the goverment, not as much as gta V tho i guess
Not getting caught sure, but with that device they will know whhich device on whose ankle just broke and put it on wanted list. We are back to "cant cross areas because the police blovk you" again then. Think like gta iv "no immigrant could pass" thing.

You would still undet heat then

About Fib missions, Its been like that since previous gta games, gta iv feature fib heavily too and it doesnt really suck imo. You doesnt become goody two shoes, but just doing the usual mayhem thing but with result in favor of the FIB

I've been hearing theories about a prison break, which doesn't make any sense in this context if she broke outta prison. Maybe she'll get released on parole or something

Thanks bud.
tbh in retrospect the GTA 5 map feels surprisingly small compared to RDR2 for example so it makes sense that they didn't block anything
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)
"I ain't political I just want to grill fish" kinda freedom fighter, I get it
On contrary, in Gta San Andreas it is quite fun still being locked out of Las Venturas and San Fierro and yet venture to the islands trying to survive whilst grabbing weapons that might be unique pick ups on those islands.

In GTA 4 the easiest way to get stocked up on guns in the beginning is to go on rail tracks and  go to second islands subway station and have a shoot out there with police. They just keep dropping goodies.
New Game+ please
Oh look, I found the problem with gaming
Im with you man. Gotta love all the hate for online. Like not my fault yall have no friends lol.
Yeah the map in GTA V didn't feel as exciting to me just from the fact you could freely explore it off the bat.

One of my greatest gaming memories is in GTA IV and unlocking Algonquin (the middle island) for the first time, and finally being able to freely roam it. I felt like a tourist in New York City lol.
Yeah thought it was quite weird at first, took me a while to realise it too. Meant I didn't really have too much urgency to progress
And it was highly praised at the time, now for some reason everybody wants the limit back ???
Half of this subreddit wasn't born when the GTA V trailer released so they wouldn't know.
Well it had a similar thing. After you kidnap Madrazo's wife you can't go to the city or the cartel will chase you. Only after you return the wife of Madrazo you can go to the LS
The blizzard was a really unique and creative way to limit exploration in RDR2. I really hope that GTA VI just gives you a 2 star wanted level which is impossible to lose.
I like turtles
Jason could end up falling in love with Lucia and betray the law enforcement.
Can u explain that or help me find ways to search that up. I never played SA but that’s a rlly cool thing
In this scenario though Jason would unequivocally be the good guy.

He’s a cop killing a mass murderer
Same but for Lucia.
Great idea. There’s a scene in the leaks where they switch from Lucia to Jason in a hotel room. Maybe that’s the scene
Maybe Jason is still in prison when the game starts as Lucia? Only after your ankle monitor is (illegally) removed, will you be able to pick up Jason at the prison gates or maybe put together his escape? After that, you can play as both.
now that you say it, i did end up playing as trevor most of the time in freeroam
Yes. F\*\*k Trevor.
Yes, I feel like Michael was definitely the unofficial main character.
You do spend a good chunk of the the first part of the game as Michael before switching is introduced, he does feel like the main character in some ways tbh. They also didn't bother to restrict the map in GTA V, so was less important. I like the ankle tag idea. 

I did wonder if they'd use the island based nature of Miami to do it that way, I've been stuck on Miami Beach before because of flooding during hurricane season.
What happens if you try?
Also the VERY beginning takes place in North Yankton. It could be a similar one or two tutorial-style missions in VI.

I liked how in III, VC, and IV, you were kind of forced to familiarize yourself with a limited portion of the map. Later on, returning to the first safe houses felt like a homecoming. Also, by the time the entire map opened up, I could navigate by landmarks pretty well and not need to rely on the radar all the time.  In V, I relied on the GPS for much longer (though to be fair, it was a bigger and more detailed map, so that probably had something to do with it too).
It barely felt worth going there anyway
Not all of it
lol WHAT. I am missing the point? Who is stopping you to NOT explore GTA5 as well if that's what you mean? GTA 5 never reveals or expands the map either by itself.
If you could legally buy GTA 5 on release, you will be 30 when GTA 6 releases, minimum
I was 15 when Vice City came out 😭
[deleted]
Officer Tempenny
Yeah it would be a cool concept to bring back, along with 6 star wanted level
yeah bro you're welcome.
That has not stopped anyone before. Call of Duty is losing all trust anyway.
Who's that nobody LMAO
IV had forced limitations in the islands, you had to unlock each part of the city through story.
San Andreas closed all the bridges, although you could swim over or fly to the sides, landing you a 4 or more star rating if I remember.
SA bridges were closed but if you managed to cross you got high wanted level instantly
Turn flying cars cheat on and sail over to Staunton Island using the Banshee from the showroom.

Basically my go-to every single file back in the day
In SA tenpenny tells CJ in the beginning of the game not to go anywhere because they got an eye on him. Presuming Tenpenny is a higher up in the police department, he orders the police to catch CJ when he escapes Los Santos, as it goes against his motives and uses CJ as a tool.
But you could fly over it with the tank (yes i mean tank)
In Vice City you could get across by stealing one of those ramp trucks, parking it by the edge of the film studio and using a bike to jump over the wall into the film studio. From there, you can hit a jump in the film studio to launch onto the bridge, past the construction wall, giving you access to the second island.
My favourite memory of Vice City was having a boat drift towards me through the storms before the bridges were open. 

Went to the other half, farmed drug dealers and bought the Shack safehouse, and had a blast exploring a "forbidden" area. No meaningful plot progress but 14 year me was THRILLED.
SA was the best i think. no force restrictions just the full bounty so you'd have harrier jets going after your airborne ass for violating a county zoning restrictoin or whatever it was in lore.

i wish they do that for 6 as well. send an f-35 after you for violating parole (or whatever the anklet is for).
Remember crossing the bridges in Vice City and waiting for the game to load the other half of the map? Good times
There is also a broken bridge visible in the trailer
In Gta 3 you could use the tank to shoot backwards and launch onto the other side
-GTA 3, bridge exploded and 2nd bridge was under construction 
-Vice City, A hurricane warning was in effect putting the bridges under lockdown 
-San Andreas, C.R.A.S.H (Officer Tenpenny) were watching C.J blocking access to San Fierro & Las Ventures
-GTA 4, Police lockdown was in effect 
-GTA V, the entire map was free to explore after completing Franklin’s first mission
Four was the last GTA game to have limits, I tried swimming across the water but hit an invisible wall. San Andreas had the barriers, but you could still get over it yet if you did you'd get an immediate wanted level.
Nothing breaks immersion quite like a cutscene. I really hope they keep them to a minimum.
Cheat in a grand theft Auto game? 😮😮😮 I would never!






Right, R2, Circle, R1, L2, down, L1, R1
Just get a flying tank. Ez.
Actually, there are small imperfections in VC bridge barrier's collision models, so there are multiple ways to get onto second island.
Hopefully they avoid advertising VI based on stuff they're going to cut. That'd be a real kick in the pants.
For GTA 6 it should function like GTA 4. 6 star wanted level. The player will be stuck fighting the cops until he dies. Even if they do manage to cross they wont be able to start up any quests.
The actual definition of outlaw
Nah. But give you 3/4 stars that you can't get rid of until you return back to your designated areas.

Those 3/4 stars will of course rise over time, and to make it challenging, the police will never lose track of how to find you because of the ankle monitor.

I think that would be a fun way to do it.
Was told an ancestor of mine died from a sniper while watering his horse near a river during the American Revolution.  So I agree.
They didn’t implement the idea very well though

It would be more realistic to drop dead from a heart attack than to be headshotted by an immortal omnipotent invisible sniper
[deleted]
My guess is it won't be *that* bad, lol. Rather, you only have one cop chasing you first, but then more join in over time. You fight back, you kill a few, shit escalates from there ***far*** more quickly than usual, you die and go back to the tutorial area.
>Imagine sprinting back home at 6:56pm on a Tuesday because you got distracted again

Have you never played Bully ?
exactly!! I literally thought a prison break made so much sense but then that GODDAMN ankle monitor appeared. it's really really bizarre.
Memories of Shen-Mue resurfacing
Bully had a similar system where you could be late for class

Redditard when someone has different preferences: 😡
Yes, you’re right. Gatekeepers like yourself.
🤝
YES agreed, and how different each area of Liberty City felt since you got to know one area's ins and outs for much longer. With GTA V I really feel like because of how fast you can traverse and how open everything is, it just all feels like one big "bleh" and less distinct in each of its areas
The first day I played GTAV, third day after release, I climbed on top of Mount Chiliad... wish I couldn't because it kinda killed my excitement
We tried it, we liked it. But prefer having that limitation as it makes exploring the rest of the world even more fun when you get there.
I guess they figured that it was there for a reason. 

Land lock wouldn't make sense in GTA 5 with the Trevor story starting you from the top part of the map.
🐢 There ya' go buddy. Enjoy
what it's a flip of GTA 5?

Plan A: Kill Lucia

Plan B: Kill Jason

Plan C: Instead of *saving* both characters the hard way, we get some kind of suicide mission and end with two characters dying.

This does kinda have some issues tho to be honest, like how the endgame would work if both protagonists die. I guess if the rumor of Lucia having a baby is true, we could play as the baby when it has grown up in a RDR twist? That's stretching it at that point tho
Exactly like Brian from the Fast & the Furious
That would make sense as they seem to be in the hotel room in the scene where they talk about trust in the trailer. It's possible that the story will have them at odds with each other until that moment where they finally decide to trust each other and that is the first instance of character switching.
Yeah that seems feasible. That’s what I was thinking too.
I played Franklin most of the time cuz of his sick driving slo mo
Cos he emulates the Player mindset: Anarchist and psychopathic. It didn't make sense for Niko to feel guilt for killing people in Campaign but fire RPG-7 @ cops in freeroam. Trevor doing Rampages made sense. But it always annoyed me he didn't kill Martin Madrazo, take over his gang in Los Santos. It'd be easy to do considering how T holds his own against Merryweather. Maybe to take out the Madrazo gang use Ballistic equipment and a Minigun.
You mean like Ashley did?👄"Mine ain't nothin' special but it gets the job done" ~ Trevor Phillips Esquire III🧐
Michael was the mentor character, it’s Franklin’s story, which is why he makes the ending choice
You say that as if you're not exclusively Franklin for the first hour
cartel come and chase you down

franklin is exempt
New Austin yeah, but there are a few things. Around Blackwater at least had missions and another gang.
I was 25 when GTA3 came out, I bought a ps2 to play it and I’ll buy a PS5 to play this one too
and his dog Polaski
The game would still sell like crazy but COD still tops the sales charts every year despite releasing at the end of the year. Would definitely reduce sales. Also, reddit is a minority of the gaming community. Most people haven’t lost any trust.
GTA 4 had the bridges closed due to risk of terror attacks if I recall correctly.
It was possible to get through the bridge using a motorcycle. You could also get through the metro tunnel.
Yeah IV definitely had those restrictions with the bridges, and you'd get the whole police force on you if you tried to cross early. SA had a similar system too where if you tried to go to other cities like Las Venturas or San Fierro without completing certain missions, you'd instantly get a 4-star wanted level, making it pretty much impossible to explore. It's a classic way for open-world games like [GTA](https://www.rockstargames.com/) to keep you focused on the current storyline before letting you loose.
As much as I love GTA in general, I just couldn't get into IV. I never even made it to the first map expansion before I gave up. I just hated the driving dynamics. Also doesn't help I played it after playing V.
You could drive through the barrier with a train if you go what I always called ‘rocket speed’. You had to drive really fast for a long time so when the train begins to slow it doesn’t slow down in time and you go through the barrier. You’d still get the stars but this was my favourite method, I was bad at the missions
Kidnapping a train was the easiest way
I would just crash my car into the barrier and land the wreck on the other side. I managed to see bits of San Fiero and whatever Vegas was called, before they killed me.
I remember the first day of San Andreas as if it were today, I had the tricks to spawn a military jet and I had gone around the whole map and ended up in Las Venturas not understanding what it was ahaha
Same for Vice City and IV, if you found a way to get there, you'd get 5 stars
You could AEZAKMI and chill though.
It would freeze the game for like a good minute lmao
I have forgot most codes by now... but god I remembered so many of them for so long
*furious shoulder button taps*

#BOOM!
Don't think the method of getting to each island early isn't permanently seared into my brain
This is why it's not released on PC right away
Thanks bro. How do you post gif or link a website?
Would be like the perfect opening mission too
In my mind few things emphasize the misery of the American penal system like being out on parole and feeling like you’d practically be better off going back to prison because life can be so hard for convicted felons after release. I’ve seen a few movies use that trope as a reason for a character to start breaking the law again. Wouldn’t be surprised if that’s what Rockstar’s going for at first. Then mid game we get our parole revoked and have to stage a prison break.
I would speculate that it's not Lucia that breaks out of prison. it's Jason. You start as Lucia and only after your ankle monitor is removed, can you put together the prison escape plan of Jason. After or during the escape, you can probably play as both.
Swear it shows Lucia in front of a judge in the trailer? Is it not obvious she’s trying to get paroled
Sorry, but imo your comment is the "*redditard*" comment.

IMO if someone's preferences/opinions are in direct conflict with your own, it's fully fine - and in most scenarios I'd even say that appreciated - if you voice out your disagreement.


Trying to silence someone by calling their opinions or feelings over any topic "redditarted" is truly the least productive thing one can do. If you have nothing constructive to say, it's better to keep quiet.
Thank you 🥹💕
Theyre not at odds with each other lmao. 

They’re very obviously a couple already prior to that point

They’re both in their underwear in that “trust” scene
Trevor is good for shootouts because the special ability makes him immortal
[removed]
I wouldn’t say it’s just one of the characters’ story, and although Franklin does make the final choice, the entire story revolves around Michael. Franklin serves as the catalyst, and gets the ball rolling, bringing Michael back into the game, but from that point on, which is only a couple hours into GTA 5, Michael drives the story, and eventually pulls Trevor back in. Not to mention, you do start the game as Michael.
I guess he means the robbery in North Yankton, and by “good chunk,” he means approximately 5 minutes.
i got a ps2 for 3, i switched to x box at 4, bought a one to play rdr2, and it looks like i'll be in the market again for this one.
21 and in college when III hit.

“Can’t go across the bridges no more cuz terrorists” - Roman
You could cross the one bridge in 4 from I think the Bronx into Manhattan but you got 6 stars immediately and the police were blocking the bridge so you had to book it while getting shot at with no cover
Yep. I like that they're still making creative ways of keeping the restricted areas and haven't ditched them. I'm still waiting on the return of the SIX star wanted level system.
And in San Andreas due to earthquakes
also if you used the low gravity cheat you could turn a tank into an aircraft by firing backwards lol. I fucking loved that game.
SA would show your trail across the map. You would have tracks down the stretches of road where your low level character could stay alive long enough to get a glimpse of the next town before you died.
Fair enough! Can't be expected to like every game in the franchise. I played 4 before I did 5 but I was pretty young and my gta 4 experience at that time was mostly respawning at the hospital and running full pelt into the swingset, ended up actually playing the full story after five and found I enjoyed it a lot more in the mission structure. Five was just a bit wild to say the least, It was a bit jarring coming from 4 to the heists that we saw in five, really glad to see with 6 we seem to be getting more down-to-earth robberies like a pawn shop or store, i'm sure we'll have more extravagant ones but It's just really promising to see it's not all balls to the wall bank robberies in the first trailer.
You made a good point, I can’t even finish gta 4 but I’m definitely going to try
Kinda funny, cos once I got used to the weight of cars in IV and got good at driving in it, I clearly remember hating the driving in V at first, but soon got used to it. Plus they changed the damage models for the worse too, in IV parts would be flying off or deforming when you hit something, but you could still drive mostly fine. In V they were like tanks in comparison bodywork-wise, but (in SP) a lot of time your wheel would buckle and jam in a crash, making you need to switch cars which was frustrating in a chase. I still think driving was more rewarding in IV, felt awesome when you pulled a massive powerslide round a corner in a Dukes, and dodging Annihilators driving a Sentinel round the airport in MP. But yeah, I think I'd hate it too playing it the other way round tbh
Lmao nice. Me and my buddy got it illegally from his friend and we were always playing on his computer, spawning a tank and causing mayhem without caring about anything else
A couple of HESOYAM pills and you were good as gold.

I wonder What crime a GTA character has to commit to earn prison time.
She's in front of a classifications officer.
Not really
Just because you sleep with someone doesn't mean you're a couple or you necessarily have a greater than average degree of trust in that individual. It's also possible that them being in their underwear is a result of them engaging in coital relations when their relationship has already reached that point and what's said is them confirming it either before or after engaging with each other in that way.

Look at the artwork of them together, she is staring daggers at him. I do not believe such a thing is unintentional and considering it's released before the game it's probably establishing their relationship at the beginning of the game rather than a twist that happens later in which causes her to dislike or distrust him.
M4 and AR10 are two vastly different calibers.   You don’t upgrade from an AR10 to a M4, they’re used for different tasks.
I mean yeah it’s a shared story but Franklin definitely gets more focus, climbing the criminal ladder, mediating between Michael and Trevor, ultimately getting caught in the middle of their drama dating back to long before he even entered the picture, and getting the final say in which, if either, dies. Of three main characters it always felt like he was the main main character, if that makes sense
Fucking terrorists
I read that in Roman's voice
Or just spawn the tank and have tons of fun
I think you mean from bohan to Algonquin
Yep.  It was one of the methods to get the 6 star wanted level achievements
I think you’re thinking of 3 right? I remember doing that in 3 and it was probably some of the most fun I’ve had in a video game.
Thanks man. I'm not very tech savvy. So this helps. Keep it up champ 😎👌
Littering
hey man never say "coital relations" again
She’s literally straddling him in the artwork you’re referencing.

Not to mention she isn’t even looking at him. Her eyeline goes over his right shoulder. 

They’re a couple.
 > them being in their underwear is a result of them engaging in coital relations

Username checks out
This is obviously a Bonny and Clyde doomed couple trope.

My guy, they're a couple.
You make complete sense, and I can’t exactly disagree. I guess that’s part of what makes GTA 5 so good. I on the other hand viewed Michael as “being in the middle” (excluding the final choice obviously), since Franklin, albeit much younger, is the positive influence, and Trevor is the negative influence in Michael’s life. I genuinely think it’s cool that you were able to play through the game and feel like Franklin was the main character.
What?
FAAAAKIN THEROORRIST
[deleted]
terrorists.. theres been a beeg scare and you cant go across the bridges so good..
....tank? you mean the apc?
No tanks in IV
This was a thing all the way up to San Andreas! But ye not possible in IV
Worse loitering
Coital relations
Eh, okay fair. I didn't notice the gaze wasn't at him at first, instead she's likely just firmly assessing her surroundings as he is. My bad.
Yeah I’m always a fan of a game that can leave people with very different takes that can’t really be stated outright to be wrong. But the real truth we’re ignoring is that Brad is the real main character
I said COUSIN, let's go BOWLING
Terrorists. There’s been a big scare and you can’t go across the bridges so good
As far as the radio content went, nothing will ever top GTA 4. The commercials and talk shows were absolutely hilarious.
GTA 4 will probably remain my favorite GTA but it will definitely be dethroned along with V for being the best GTA of all time. Not even a contest, it's not fair.
Over time and reflection I like it more, but when it first came out Niko and the new driving mechanics weren't working for me
No problem! I don’t doubt that there may be some initial distrust between the two, but I do think they become a couple fairly early (if they aren’t already) and the big twist will be something that breaks their trust down the line.
Stumbled upon a strange moon that orbits very close to a gas giant
Don't know how common this is. Decided to land on the dark side of the moon to see what it's going to look like. Not bad of a view..
Tidal forces would be insane on that moon
What a place for a outpost lol, where is this at please?
This is Traveler.  Be wary of the Witness and giant triangles.
Why does their proximity give me anxiety?
Seems that some of you curious on where this is, The moon is Pontem, planet Etherea, Wolf System. But like others has said, might be just a funky bug on my game :/
…


….

Have you tried jumping to it?
That Roche limit though
I once was in space in my spaceship and fast traveled to a poi near a planet.

I loaded in and was a mere 50km from the surface and almost shat my pants.
Where is this!! Ty
Whould gas giants shine like that if you saw them from this perspective irl?
That’s no moon!!
on of the coolest things ive ever seen in this game tbh
Pretty sure that moon would be within the Roche limit. Should be a ring.
Where?
Which moon!!
I think your game glitched. The moon is nowhere near that close to the gas giant on mine.
Visited to see this. Yeah. Not like that for me.
>Gas giant

>Rock surface

10/10 GOTY
Has anybody asked what system this is in yet?
For a moment I was really confused why there was a big moon looking sphere sitting on the table next to your gun…
Orbiting... Or rolling?
What system is that?
That's no moon. It's a space station.
I had the same bug when i visited Red Mile for the first time. One of the moons was half inside the planet and i couldn't land.
That's not a gas giant.

It might be labeled at such in the game, but that's not a gas giant.
Y'all are nerds


Freaking love it.
Oooh I saw this movie when the moon was actually an alien ship! Lol #moonfall
This happened to me on a planet with rings and the rings were super close and it was one of the first times ive felt some megalophobia lmao
Damn does the game really look like this?  I’ll have to try it out.
All you have to do is jump halfway and the planets gravity will do the rest to bring you in.
That is well within the Roche limit that moon should be a ring.
That’s no moon.
So do ppl still recommend this game or should I try star citizen?
Decent little bit of interesting thrown in
It's actually insane to me that the game realistically (to an extent) shows you how it would look if you landed there. Like it looks from the surface the way it looks from orbit.
Been there too!
Holy shit, this is beautiful
Aren't you on the bright side of the moon?
SRV up to it!
That's just Zim and Dib battling it out.
Is there really a dark side of that moon?
On galactic time scales isn't this impact pending rather than orbit?
What planet / moon was this so one of us can see if our moon is the same?
Very cool!
I mean it looks cool but the tidal forces being exerted against that moon would rip it apart. The rouche limit is a harsh mistress.
What system???
I hate that and also love it
Looking at this is creepy i cant explain it
Whoa!
Holy Roche limit, Batman.
That's Karen. Classic satellite parent.
Is it the traveler???
Boost up see if you swing over to it like Mario galaxy.
Realistically, that moon is either really dense/rigid as hell, or the roche limit on that Gas Giant is insanely low.
Where is it located?
🎵I am being followed by a moon shadow, 🎶moon shadow...
Wait... Is that a fuckin Destiny reference in Starfield?!
Keep an eye on it, it might disappear if you stop looking at it
Where is this I wanna check it out
Hourglass twins
Those are great screenshots 

Idk why but I keep thinking of Martian and interstellar with this game lol
Roche limit has left the chat i guess?
“They called it, The Traveler”
What planet is this?
Orbits!? Shit that moon rolling on the surface....
Well, beautiful screenshots first of all. Secondly, there are some terrifyingly close encounters between planets and their moons. I actually jumped into a new system and directly in front of a blue gas giant 😬 there were asteroids too but it still felt crazy, kinda made me nauseous
Even though I know this is about Starfield, my first thought was that I would open the pics and see a buttcheek or something.
I'm pretty sure the density of the moon would have to be equal to the mass of the planet. That also means the gravity on said moon is gonna be ridiculously high.
Ok, so I knew fuck-all about what "Roche limit" was or even meant. I find all of these discussions fascinating. For everything I dislike about this game, these threads help me stay interested.
This is why I love fiction... Such an awesome vista that could never be seen in real life.
Roche Limit? Artifacts Son! They harden in response to physical trauma.
Got any more pics of that ship?
That's no moon! That's a bocce ball, rolling on the surface of that planet!
Roche Limit would be a cool name for a ship 🤔
this is wizard
Someone activated Chibaku Tensei
That kind of thing is kinda super rare to see as it would either be smashed into the planet of torn into a ring and either way you may not have wanted to land there tbh
I really like your ship design. Do you have some spare screenshots for "inspiration"?
where is this?
Wow eclipse goty goty
This is siick
This reminds me of a Futurama episode. I believe it was  Mars that was so close to earth that they were able to jump from Mars' surface to the Planet Express building on earth.
Im no expert, but considering the mass of a gas giant, this should be phisically impossible, because the tidal forces would wreck the moon into a ring. I may be wrong tho, as I said im not an expert
What moon is this?
Where is this and what's it called?
Not a lot of .....




Personal space
\* Careful now Dave the moons swinging round

\# Ah I'm not near the water the tides will be fine here.

\* No, no, I mean you need to duck
I've gone 30 years never hearing the term "Roche limit", and now I hear it, like, a dozen times in one reddit thread.
The lunatic is on the grass...
The Roche limit wants to know your location
Why don’t you fus do rah that thing away so you can fit
With that ship for a split second I thought it was desitny
This really feels like Interstellar
I saw this last night and wanted to explore but forgot
Wouldn’t the moon just crumble to peices at that point? Or begin entering the planets atmosphere? Is there anything irl like this?

Also really cool screenshot
No planet or moon name/location.  Dissapoint
That's no moon... that's a space station!
Holy shit. Some of the best Starfield screenshots I’ve seen. Amazing!
The traveler looks bigger in person
The moon is performing a “slingshot” maneuver to get its way home faster.
*Heavy Breathing*
What system and planet?
Just a marble rolling on a bowling ball
Glitch aside that looks so awesome
The skyline in picture two looks like it's supposed to be in a trailer
I don't know enough about planetary physics to have any idea if this is a dumb question, but in addition to the possibility of the moon being torn apart, should it be pulling gas away from the gas giant too?
I feel that this moon should be in the middle of breaking apart from tidal forces.  I don’t know enough about the math to say that absolutely though.
That is... BRIGHT.
Is there a subreddit for Starfield screenshots? Love these
I dont think that's the dark side of the moon. Dark side is typically the one that faces AWAY from the planet
where?
Maybe the density of that planet is very less , so moon can orbit so close.
What system and planet is this?
I have a question I hope you wont' mind me asking. Have you ever played Elite Dangerous, or Everspace 1/2? I'm just wrapping up on Everspace2 and looking for my next game I was curious if you could provide input on how this game feels in relation to either of these games.
So…Roche limit?
Thats no moon..
Majora's Mask crossover.
Where is this ? in the game, I want to go 👀
Name of the system? .
So what system?
That's no Moon!!!!!
Where is this at? I wanna check it out.
Bizzare.
NOT SCIENTIFICALLY POSSIBLE!
Having a hard time making any kind of choice in this game. There is so much going on and I feel like everyother mechanic I need to look up how it works on the internet. I'm level 13 have 1 outpost that just collects iron helium 3 and beryllium. The ship upgrades and building has me  dizzy . How should I approach  it

And the size of the moon is far from neglibible compared to the gas giant. Tidal forces on both of them would be insane, and we would see a noticable motion of the gas giant too as the center of mass of the system would be reasonably far from the center of the gas giant. Not to mention the insane drag forces that make this proximity impossible to begin with
That moon is made out of pure Stalinium
Incredible… I love this! I’ll have to keep my eye out for cool planet/moon alignments like this
Where is this??
We should have the ability to bookmark locations/ planets. That way, in a few months you could check back and see if anything has changed.
Where is this?
Found that one, too. But if you land on it, you seem way further away.
Could be an eccentric orbit.
“That’s no moon…”
That moon should've become rings ages ago
I’m going to say something that seems like it could be really stupid in my head but here goes. What if the solar system containing the gas giant existed and at some point the rimnants of a very small neutron star passed through the system at the absolute perfect time for the systems sun and gas gian to trap it in its orbit.
That's no moon..
gravity go brrrrt
Where is this ?
I've yet to see this definitely not in my Wolf system that's for sure. It is definitely a sight though so lucky you! I'd have to build a outpost there just to see. Maybe by NG20 lol I'll see something like this. I'd have to start NG+ though so I got a ways. Todd be damned I never saw that as a mechanic to rush I see it as the opposite. Gives me a reason to come back to it cause it doesn't quite have the staying power of their other IPs.
Imagine the speed it would need to be traveling at to orbit that close
Roche Limit! New Asteroid Belt…
The Traveller is jumping ship after Destiny shit the bed
A nod to Ministry of Truth, maybe?

I wanna go swimming there!
Can anyone say Roche limit? Also where is this?
Do you know what the mass and radius of the planet and moon are?
In contrast to what people are saying about the roche limit, I actually think this is totally possible in a real life. We have a very real example of Mars' moon, Phobos, which is only 6,000 km above the surface of the planet (it literally takes up a fifth of the martian sky on it's closest days and the thing is freakin tiny) above the martian surface and only 18-22 km across and honestly doesn't have a unique density compared to the other moons in our solar system. It won't cross the roche limit for millions of years. 

A calculation of the roche limit on Earth in relation to the moon would allow for the centers of the 2 objects to be only 9,500 km, which would mean the surfaces are only around 2,000km, even if we are generous and allow 5,000-6,000 km for safety and other variables, this would look absolutely ludicrous from space since it would still be closer to the earth than the diameter of the earth is, and the earth is 81 times bigger than the moon with the moon only around 1.2%. Imagine if earth had a bigger moon, give it a moon big enough and dense enough, than that moon would collide with the earth before crossing the roche limit, this could almost certainly be done with other moons that already exist in the solar system. 

For example, this would never happen to Pluto and Charon and they basically orbit each other they are so close in ratio. And would certainly collide with each other before one turns into a ring.

So if we have a gas giant that isn't super dense, maybe just a bit puffy (we have many examples of exoplanets that are about the mass of Jupiter but also far larger in diameter, even if most of these are this way because of how close they are to their star), and a fairly large moon. So if the ratio of the densities and the relation of the objects are good enough, I absolutely think this is possible even give how absurd it looks. not every moon is going to turn in a ring when it get's too close to the planet.
Something recalling interesting is happening here in 20 years
Where is this planet been trying to find it for awhile
Lol I was thinking.... don't build an outpost there its about to be broken into a ring any day.
That moon is absolutely within the Roche limit and would be ripped apart by tidal forces.
Tidal forces is the reason Saturn has rings

100million years ago, a moon got ripped apart by tidal forces
There would be no moon. The tidal forces would rip it into pieces and it would turn into a ring. 

There is an orbit a moon has to be in to prevent this from happening. 

I cannot remember the name of it but this is where Saturns rings came from. A moon that got too close.
“This little maneuver is gonna cost us twenty seven years”
That moon wouldn't even exist as it's definitely inside the Roche limit
I actually think it would get pulled apart into a ring, see [Roche Limit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit)
Bet it'd make Io look like our moon by comparison
Not if it's tidally locked, much like our own moon.
Waiting to see the Neil deGrasse Tyson post about how wrong it is.
To shreds you say?
"That's no moon..."
Tidal force would have tore this Moon apart tbh but its so fun to see it
What system is that?
Haha.. It's Pontem, moon of Etherea in the Wolf system. Although I'm not sure you'll get the same view or not.
Seconded, I want to build an outpost on this thing.
Not sure if this is the same one, but there are a couple of moons surrounding a gas Giant in the **Freya** system that are this close. One of them even has primordial fauna.

r/destinythegame is leaking
*Very heavy breathing*
Because realistically that would be an impact.
Because you've played Majoras Mask
idk if its a phobia and has a name or not but seeing celestial bodies soo close next to each other just gives me a very bad sensation.
I mean, at that distance, it’s not so much “orbiting” as it is “rolling” around the gas giant… if the gas giant had very hard clouds…
It’s unrealistic. They planet and moon’s gravitational force would be ripping each other apart at that proximity
There was a video on Youtube or something that showed what the various planets in the solar system would look like if they orbited the Earth at the same distance as the moon does. When it got up to Jupiter, it just filled up the entire night sky, and they also cranked the music up to a really ominous pitch. The video should have had a prologue that read "WARNING: THE FOLLOWING VIDEO WILL GIVE YOU A WHOLE-ASS NEW PHOBIA. HAVE FUN GETTING NERVOUS AT THE SIGHT OF JUPITER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, IDIOT!"
Your view from space is definitely bugged, when I warped into that system I was between the two bodies and while they were very close (close enough that the textures looked *awful*), they weren't that close.
Wrong game for that, try playing no mans sky for stuff like that

On this game youd have a loading screen as you jump out of the atmosphere, then another as you enter the gas giants atmosphere
No, but it seems to have given me Light powers....
Came here for this. Thank you
It has left the chat.
[here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/s/epExj55QGT)
Our real life moon shines from the Sun, so this is possible.
no atmosphere either
Starfield is free on GamePass, whereas Star Citizen is still in development and costs quite a lot to get in the door and isn't on consoles lol 

Considering that many games have done a lot of what Star Citizen does on consoles, I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a release of a console portion of Star Citizen. The game has been in development since the PS4 was out, I think, 15 years now? 🤔
A few people have already checked and it's not the same in their save but [OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/s/epExj55QGT) says.
Huh, you're right..
Could this be a reason for it existing where and how it does
I didn't do the math(tm) but this moon has to be way, way inside the Roche limit?

Anyone want to punch in some ideas for M and p?

[https://physics.icalculator.com/roche-limit-calculator.html](https://physics.icalculator.com/roche-limit-calculator.html)
Thanks. I couldn't remember what it was called when a moon gets too close and is ripped apart. I would be quite the sight to see...from a safe distance of course.
If it managed to somehow get that close to the planet's atmosphere without breaking up it wouldn't even make it a day before it just fell in
Also why we have the astroid belt! Jupiter said no planet here.
Not that I'm saying we should do it, but you're saying we could make a ring around the Earth?

Probably better than my idea to very gradually move the moon slightly closer so we can keep enjoying eclipses.
That's just an urban legend. I've been hearing that one since I was a kid.
Saturn has quite a tidal force which is why it ripped out its moon.

Sadly developer don't give data about the planet on the scanner but maybe some day (?

We can't asume the roche limit of this planet without all the data
Sure, but what's the timescale on that process?
so will the earth eventually have a ring then? That's pretty wild to think about
That's no moon.

OK maybe it is. :p

Maybe some weird solar system collision caused it to get pulled from elsewhere and it's orbit is decaying.
It's called the Roche limit.
Your game might be bugged honestly, pretty sure I surveyed that entire system and that wasn't the case for me.
Unfortunately that's a cool bug for you and not for me lol, I just checked my game.
Ya mine looks nothing like :(
I also surveyed that system and the moon is not that near on my playthrough. Could be you happen to land on it as that moon is orbiting very close to the planet. As mentioned by others moons and planets do move/orbit though you can not notice it very well unless you wait for certain intervals.

Depends on the moon’s velocity and the gas giant’s mass really.
Well Akshuly it’s within the Roche limit. 

Kind of a neat phenomenon where the second objects gravity overpowers the gravity that makes the other thing round.
Ugh... great. Now I have to go back to therapy...
Oh shit i only saw videos about that game and its just pure nightmare to look at.  
Edit: I mean to look at the moon closing by.
/r/megalophobia
Dang mine looks nothing like that. Darn
our moon shines because of the dust on its surface.
That gas giant should also be taking up at least 80-90% of the sky from that perspective.
Woah didn’t know it was free on gamepass.  Since My Xbox gave out was debating either getting another one or getting a pc. Thanks for the info
I believe the Roche limit is around 15,000 miles or kilometres? Might be wrong but yeah that moon is stressed
That moon would have to be made out of something extremely hard, but given how round it is it clearly isn’t. This is probably either a bug or a developer putting this in for shits
Is there any possible composition of a moon that would make it possible to survive the immense tidal forces while existing within that distance, and not break up?  -I imagine if there were it would make the potential for an outright collision more likely?
The satellite would need to be a hell of a lot more dense than the primary body for this to be possible.  

For example:
RM = 70000 (roughly the same as Jupiter)
pM = 0.05 (cotton candy)
pm = 5.4 (roughly the same as Mercury)

d = 70000 x (2 x 0.05/5.4)^1/3
d = 70000 x (2 x 0.00093)^1/3
d = 70000 x 0.123
d = 8610km

Where RM is the radius of the primary, pM is the density of the primary, pm is the density of the satellite and d is the distance to the Roche limit.

So, highly unlikely but not impossible given that [this exists.](https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-cloud-like-planet-discovered-thats-as-fluffy-as-cotton-candy)
If that involves long division, I'm out.
If the moon is insanely dense compared to the gas giant then it should be ok since the limit is partly defined by the ratio of the bodies densities.

Also, seeing as how they visually place our moon about 1 lunar diameter from the Earth, which is less than 1/100th the actual distance, relative positions should be taken with a grain of salt. ;)
To shreds you say
Thanks to the power of save-scumming, you can even see it from an *unsafe* distance!😁
JUPITER: I'm the king around these parts
It's coming for Mars next! It wants to be the first planet!
Jupiter's big, but its tides that far out are fairly negligible. Its gravity did disrupt protoplanet formation, though. Small perturbations accumulated, causing material that would've otherwise coalesced to be thrown into wildly unpredictable orbits. Some of those asteroids probably became its moons. Some collided with it. And some were ejected out of the solar system entirely.
There’s a theory that was used to be there was another gas giant, with 2 planet sized moons, Planet X was lighter gas (helium), and it slowly got blown away by the solar wind, eventually tearing apart planet Y, leaving behind the only “moon” left or as we know it now… Mars.
https://youtu.be/DUztyRYQ5iU?si=BSxfTrpkbZa0Rkmm

This popped up on YouTube for me today, few good reasons why we wouldn't want a ring around the earth
Earth had a ring system a few billion years ago after a Mars size planet hit it. That ring system became our moon.
The moon is on an unstable orbin in the opposite direction.    It is slowly drifting away from us.    'Soon' it will be far enough away thar total eclipses won't be a thing anymore.
Well, it may have been unconfirmed in your day. But it’s absolutely fancy now.

Edit: Fact, not fancy lol
Umm, that’s how planetary rings are formed
If you were to teleport a moon into such an orbit, then probably pretty fast. But the timescale for the orbit to degrade to such a point naturally is probably millions to billions of years, at least outside the chaotic period of early solar system formation
A better question is "what's the timescale for satellite formation".

Planets and moons don't just pop into existence fully formed. They coalesce from debris fields. 

So in reality a moon like this wouldn't really be ripped up by tidal forces at all - it would have just never existed.
Our moon is being 'flung' out away from the Earth. Although the sun will swallow both of them before it gets far enough away to break orbit.
Moon is getting further not closer.
No but the earth had a ring. At one point the “proto” earth was much smaller and a larger Mars sized planet smashed into it. The two cores combined, a large majority of the mass was pulled to earth and a ring of debris formed. Some drifted away and the rest formed the moon.
No. The Moon is moving away from the Earth, no closer. Eventually the Earth will no longer have a Moon. 

It is inching away but the rate is slowing. It will eventually equalize and stop receding. This is billions of years away. The Sun is expected to go red giant before this happens. So the Earth and everything on it is dead anyways.
might have caught an elliptic orbit at a cool time? Are there elliptic orbits?
It’s most definitely bugged. Orbits can sometimes get fucked up. I once had Deimos Staryard orbiting at the center of Mars. On the occasion the game would actually let me travel there, the sunlight would come and go every 5 seconds
Most likely. I had this happen but the moon was like 1/3 of the way inside the planet.
Yeah, I have a base on that exact moon and it looks like any other gas orbiting moon.
It's not a bug. Everything is procedurally generated with a certain set of rules. 

It just so happens that their copy was like: "Ehhh. Good enough for a moon placement." Without checking if it's scientifically sound or realistic.

This is what we love about games!
Titan Strong
There might be more if Final Shape comes out.
Eyes up here guardian there are more than two of us here.
For that to not be an impact, then it can't be an orbit.
Side note:

Your username is phenomenal.
It's well beyond the Roche Limit. Could not exist unfortunately
Well, that moon, even ignoring tidal forces, would be smashing through the exosphere of the gas giant.  I.e. is gonna slow down from atmospheric drag and fall into the giant.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit
it’s not as simple as middle school physics
That's one of the problems here, yes.

It's within the Roche Limit and should have gotten ripped asunder. It should be space dust or asteroids.
Yeah, I'm gonna check mine too when I get a chance. Kind of hoping it is an elliptical orbit and it just depends on game days or something but no one has confirmed if they actually do that or not.
There is definitely no dust in a gas giant's atmosphere. /s
I'm not sure about GamePass on PC, but it was free on XBOX. I preordered the premium edition upgrade for £29.99 and even with the 1 week early access, I'm still on my first playthrough, lol 😆  

I've seen people posting about NG+ 10, and I keep asking myself how lol
Aren't we all?
It would depend on the mass of both bodies and their manner of orbiting
The Roche limit isn't a constant.
>Roche limit

The Roche Limit is calculated via various knowns and factors. It's not a constant "one-size-fits-all" number.
I fucking relate so much…
It depends on the maas of both objects.

I would say its just in the very limit of become a ring system and clearly its tidal locked 😅
That depends on the stellar body
Don't bring science into this nerd. This is beautiful and that's all I care
Recent extrasolar capture. Death is in the cards.
I wonder about some wierd fluk of a moon that's made mostly of metal. Or has some lattice work of metal mixed in. Diamonds are pretty hard but they are brittle if you could break one with a hammer, tidal forces would. Don't know what has high shear resistance
It’s a solid tungsten sphere!
If it was a lump of metal, then it would survive intact.  But that is extremely unlikely.  Also if it's tidally locked that would mean that it's not getting stretched so might remain intact.

The real issue, however, is that anything that close to the surface (>!hint: there isn't a defined surface!<) of a gas giant is going to experience atmospheric drag and de-orbit very quickly.
Oh my yes
“You’re in my personal space. Now you die.”
Planet q: howdy neighbor!

Jupiter:  NO

*Jupiter disliked that*
Jupiter helps redirect a lot of comets and such out of our solar system. But the scary part is that some gets redirected into the solar system.
I love these theories, like also how Neptune is believed to have been closer to the sun, mercury is just the remaining core of the once believed larger planet, and the cataclysm that may have occurred to change Uranus's rotation.
Same here. Reading these comments I can feel all smart now.
How did fragments mend themselves together into a moon? Please explain
Grantes thats still a few hundred tbousand or million years away.

On that, if we ever make contact with other intelligenes and FTL travel exists, Earth would be tourist central for the solar eclipses, the odds of that existing, and for us to see it, so cool.
It’s also pretty fancy too 😊
That's insane. How would a collision like that not totally fuck the orbit off?
It would be hard to tell unless the orbit in question was very eccentric, most orbits IRL are elliptical with low eccentricities so they appear circular on most scales.
No, the only thing that's prcedurally generated is the placement of POI's, flora and fauna.

Even the surface features of moons and planets are mapped beforehand.

And orbits of planetary objects most certainly are mapped beforehand.
Apes stronger together.
Bungie hates Titans because Bungie is afraid of Titans
Hahahahaha so true...
It would probably be ripped to shreds via tidal forces before any real impact. Sure, massive chucks of rock will still impact the gas giant, but a ring ala Saturn would have formed millions of years ago.
You got a remember that the volume of a gas giant is also depending on its mass. A lower mass gas giant would have less gravity to hold its atmosphere close.  So it could be relatively large in volume.  The gravity at the surface of the atmosphere could be quite low.  Think of the moon orbiting the gas giant’s dense core.
It may be an ejected moon of another body, or a moon with a distorted orbit, doing a close flyby before leaving the planet’s gravity well.
May your roads lead to warm sands my friend.
gas giants emit light rather than reflect it. thermal radiation.
mood
If I could still give you an award, I would
It's a shame this gem of a comment isn't getting more notice.
Ok I'll bite. What bodies could have this manner of appearance and orbit this close at these apparent speeds without breaking apart? What's going to be strong (or fluffy) enough to look like this and yet hold its form?
This game has brought all of the weirdos out who watched a YouTube video and think they're physicists now.
Right like something that at some point was the core of bigger stellar body.
Tidal forces aren't like a hammer, they are shear stress.
Nothing survives this in this apparent state.
Jupiter: howdy neighbor! ... oh.
The solar system had about 20 - 30 planets when it formed, until Jupiter and Saturn 2:1 resonanced all those posers our into interstellar space.
*red spot narrows disapprovingly*
Mercury is believable since we do know of “hot” Jupiter’s, I think this theory is based on the slightly higher amount of gas in the area and heavy scaring on one side of Mars
There were a couple fragments large enough that they were pulling in the smaller ones, and that gradually accumulated over a couple tens of millions of years Edit: Words.
650 million years (ish).       So not THAT soon.

I'm of the thought that IF aliens have ever been to earth it is because of our eclipses.    Bit of a tourist destination.
Fancy facts are the best facts, I think we'd all agree.
It more than likely did. 


Edit: It’s not even the first time a planet sized object has collided with “earth” either. Proto-earth was formed from the debri field caused by two other Mars sized proto planets smashing into eachother. You can consider one of those to be the proto-proto-earth.
That thing would be absolutely *trucking* at perigee
How eccentric are we talking here? Like, Monty Python level?
*Unga Bunga Intensifies*
Buy your copy of Starfield at GameStop?
To shreds you say...
Oh for sure. For it to be intact while that close is already odd.
>impact the gas giant

Idk if rocks hitting condensed gas particles could be considered a impact, wouldnt the rocks float through  it if they dont get stuck in the graving and make a ball at the core
That would result in even more issues around how the tidal forces would impact the shape of a gas giant with a lower gravity and a moon that close.
The mass of a gas giant is still very large compared to any terrestrial planet or moon. Saturn's about eight times less dense than Earth (0.7 g/cm^3 vs. 5.5 g/cm^3 ), but it still out-masses Earth by a factor of nearly 100.
Yeh, that would speak to the "then it can't be an orbit" at least.
They do both. But I think we're limiting our discussion to visible wavelengths.
mooned
That caught me off guard. LOL Thanks!
Why'd they take them away?
Took me a second but yes, as a public school teacher, yes.
The two few-hundred-meter wide asteroid moons of a larger asteroid that LUCY discovered a few days ago.
Calling it how it is. Seriously you're right, half of these people are probably young kids that are suddenly paying attention in their astronomy lessons just because of Starfield.
Is that like being a personal trainer?
Not with that attitude. Wonder if an artificially made object could. Like alien tech from mass effect. Although then you get into like Dyson Sphere area. That would have to withstand gravity force of a sun.
> over a couple of years

Checks out.
How did they form a sphere shape and stick together though
The hour per day is probably 3 mins of UT time per hour on planet LOL.  

Also this reminds me of that futurama episode where they reach out and touch the other planet LOL
Considering they seem to be touching right now I think it's a safe bet to assume this is as close to peri**apsis** as it's going to get.
"Eccentricity" in reference to ellipses and elliptical orbits is a description of how much the orbit will vary. A low eccentricity is very close to a circular orbit, and a high eccentricity will result in a more oval shaped orbit. It is determined by measuring the height and width of an ellipse then doing some maths bullshit, for example Earth's eccentricity is ~0.0167, resulting in the Earth being 152 million kilometres from the sun at its aphelion  (or furthest point), and 147 million kilometres at its perihelion (or closest point). A very eccentric orbit would result in much larger differences between aphelion and perihelion.
I have not aped since Starfield came out, and i'm not actually feeling bad about that.
Steam.  It was easy... i like easy.
Probably to dust actually, look at Saturn's rings for reference. The same thing wouldve happened before the moon went half that close
And elliptical orbit is still an orbit unless it gets interrupted and sent out of rotation around what its orbiting, the moon orbits us in a slight elliptical shape and we orbit the sun in the same way (which is the reason for different seasons in the year)
This alone made me save this post
No idea.. I don't think they said why
site is going public so they have to strip out all the fun parts
They sent them to Ukraine I think.
Private school teacher here. Occasionally stressed. My condolences to the public sector.
I’m so, so sorry
"that look like this"
Probably explains the low Steam rating.

"Oh god no! Now I have to work and, like, do math?"
So what if starfield sparks a space crazed generation that actually makes space travel/exploration possible...
Wouldn't that be amazing?
I hate how little space physics and astronomy have on both primary and secondary lvl
Which *is* a good thing, though, is it not?
No. It wouldn't.

I love the enthusiasm but we don't just get to 'make up' physics and pretend it's real in this conversation.
I just realized I left a couple words out that I intended to have in there, I was extremely stoned when I wrote that lol
Gravity
Gravity pulls evenly in all directions towards the center of mass, so over time it forms a sphere. Everything on earth is being pulled towards the core, which is partially why there’s such high pressure there
And then Leela and Fry grab each other's arms and their arms just come out of their sockets and drift off into space

That episode was a whole other level
It was a bad joke, there’s no need for science here. But thank you?
If you haven't already, give Futurama a watch, the person you replied to was quoting that show.
An ejected moon would not be an orbit, and for the moon to be in a distorted orbit that can bring it that close to another planet would be a) way more than a slight ellipse and b) would require a planet of considerably greater mass than the gas giant and would likely be affecting the rest of the planets in the system quite a bit.

EDIT: Also c) the fact that the moon is well within the Roche Limit regardless, and unless that thing is flying past that planet at frightening speeds out of the system, it's crashing.
It sucks balls, I miss my silver
Charter here. Everyone eventually leaves my network to go public for more pay, fewer hours, and less stress. I just want to be able to leave campus when the kids leave.
Honestly, that'd be great. Maybe this game will inspire some of those kids to acquire the knowledge they need to invent new ways to (literally) reach for the stars. Might take a few generations though. But if people are just going to Google a couple facts about space and assume they're suddenly an expert, they haven't discovered anything and likely won't, because they're obviously not willing to put in the work. Typing in a search bar isn't scientific process.
I thought it was high pressure due to a lack of HR oversight allowing the core to be put under extreme working conditions
Ive had many people tell me to watch that but haven't had the time for it. Also, adult animation doesn't typically interest me very much
I wasnt saying its realistic at all i was just saying an elliptical orbit is very possible and the ellipse can be way more drastic than what the moon does around us, i think one of Neptune's moons might travel around it in a pretty clear oval, look at Nereid for example, at one end of its orbit its 7x further away that it is at its closest point to the gas giant, the biggest difference is it doesn't hug Neptune like the moon in the picture does to its planet
An ejected moon is still in orbit, just not an orbit that stays within the gravity well of a planet.
I have people leave public to come to our private School for less pay but more job satisfaction. And the teachers stay. Christian School though so that might be the difference.
It’s 50/50. Gravity is an abusive boss
Most orbits are elliptical in some capacity. But yeah, planetary bodies being this close is straight up impossible.
Problem is the elliptical orbit proposed wouldn't fix the circumstance presented. The Roche Limit matters there and a wide elliptical orbit has to have both the forces and the space to facilitate it.

That kind of just turns into an aside statement like yeah "orbits can be odd shapes", but that doesn't really influence the outcome or consequences of the scenario depicted.
Not sure where you got that interpretation, an ejected moon is a [rogue planet/planetoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_planet) that's been "ejected" from it's orbit. To eject a celestial body implies it's been flung from an exiting orbit generally out of a system. And if it's not a satellite of a planet then it's not really a moon either...

Did you mean something else with the prior comment?
Gta 6 is coming for Switch!
Huge W
“We have grand theft auto at home”.

Nice Ray tracing is that 8k? Oh 320p sweet! Even better!!

Why is Vaas from FarCry3 riding the boat in the middle lol
I’d unironically play this
Heisenberg is a Switch exclusive mission-giver confirmed, awesome
This is actually how 007 looks well similar ish

Me in the year 1999: OMG This is top tier graphics!!! 😱

Slightly disappointed that Lucia doesn't have triangular boobs tho
try squinting it looks better
Do you know why you're here?
Graphics I guess
Is that a t posed waltur? Is this the same guy who made the breaking bad ps2 game?
Hahahahah. Walthu hitting the t pose
Dude I would totally play it.  If it's Rockstar, it may look funny, but it probably won't be bad.
vaas?
the flamingos got me
Lucia looks like a wrestler from No Mercy.
Dawg this is n64 graphics
I would unironically buy this
Where's the rest of the video? This was amazing
Major win for r*
estaria bueno uno pero hecho en gta vice city
🤣
*Still runs at 20fps*
Yo the zoomers would be all over this.
Remember when Rockstar made GTA games for portable systems?
Highest quality troll of all time
Still better than that trilogy bs they dropped on the switch
30fps
He needs to do the whole trailer!
That was crazy 🤣
waltuh
😂
LOL
If only it was coming out for the Wii
The console that is the successor to the switch.....
Better than the trailer made with GTA 5
lmao PS1 graphics weren't even this bad
Oh... This made me chuckle.
THAT T POSE!!!!!! *CHEFS 💋*
Tbf this is Rockstar's remaster quality
looks more like ps1 lol
60 fps on Switch, 30fps for Xbox One X, PS5
Song should have been in midi

This is pure comedy gold.
This surely looks better than every Zelda game
Where is the woman twerking tho. Let me see those pixels
Day one purchase!
“Do you know why you’re here?”
“Bad port I guess”
When you order GTA6 on wish
Lmao
It’s gonna go on switch before pc
Is this the Expanded and Enhanced everyone is talking about?
Lol at Michael Scott on the jet ski.
Lolol
I laughed so hard at this
You know what I really don't like about Switch: how its hardware is inferior to PS4 and XBOX One.

I can understand it being weaker than PS5 and XBOX Series, but come on, Nintendo! I do not want to subscribe to cloud gaming to play Resident Evil 7!
He didn’t even complete the full render of the characters 😂😂😂
Finally a aaa game for Quest 3
Hahhaahha wtf is this
I really adore this fan concept! It's incredibly creative and unique! Given these graphics, it might even be more suitable for the PlayStation 1, to be honest! haha
Is that NPC in yellow 💛 Walter White in Hazmat suit, bald head and glasses 🕶️.
Copping this in 2035!!
Un real graphics
Puppet Combo really lifting off
You’re being very generous. This trailer was way to smooth and without a single screen tear or frame drop.
This is good
I'll take 2
The notification banner on my phone psyched me out. "SWITCH BUT NO PC?!" 

10/10
More like N64
Performers mode
The graphics look better than the original Lara Croft
Is this mincraft?
lol!
the graphics are better than i can do! rockstar is really showing their skills!
yall joke but they really need to upgrade that hardware or stop supporting 3d games
Fuck, I thought it was another official announcement after I checked it on my email 😭💀
Oh, man, this is HILARIOUS! 🤣🤣
GTA 6 wish version
Looks like the most recent Pokemon
Have you seen rdr1 on switch. It can look good
I really wanted to see the boxy twerking
Xbox Series S graphics lol
Ok nah
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
I’d play this ngl
This is what yall get if you dont get a job and save up for 2025
Simply beautiful looks just like the current gen
It's not Switch. 

This is a leak of the definitive version of 6 that Grove Street Games are working on.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is just demented
project zomboid lookin ahh
me trying to play gta 6 on my intel pentium 4
Hype!
Exactly what I was waiting for 😂
Quit basin the switch. It's legit
AHAHAHAHAHAHAAH!
I want it lol 🤣🤣
Still better than Superman 64
The yellow T guy is Walter White 😂
Is this Zerglings on the beach running/jumping ?!
Might have to sell my ps5 and cop a Nintendo switch 😍
80$ at lunch
GTA Goldeneye
6 atg
Switch can do better than this. These are N64 graphics
This is so dope!
Man Mk1 was a let down but GTA6 will be even more of a letdown
When gta 6 comes out on Roblox
Bwaaahahahaha!! 😆😂🤣
Wow look at the graphics
Ah yes small theft motorcycle from Rapstar games
Switch players still be hyped
Grand Theft Roblox
GTA 6 on Ps4
Is that vas from far cry?
Oh man, I'm flashing back to Eddie now. Thanks!

The most cinematic framerate.
I'm more than happy with it !
Truly definitive
Put your switch away waltuh
For the next eight years.
Nintendo fans would rave about it and it’d win multiple GOTY awards
Only the publisher of the game can put the price
Is Nintendo making this version or something? How would they control the price? Lol
Pink turkeys 💀
can confirm, why the hell did I buy this thing
Jokes aside, they manage to get RDR running on it without much graphics downgrade (if at all?)
Goldeneye Theft Auto
Cuz of Jason
Buying a switch if true!
Lucia and Jason gonna rob the store with Klobbs.
I read this in Niko voice
![gif](giphy|G0H2s9BvqqYus|downsized)
Well at least the handheld pc are on the rise
Gta Sa graphics and I’m in
Honestly even with like PS1 graphics, a 1:1 recreation of the entirety of the US would be an impressive feat
Honestly think that'd be bad.ASS!!
The most cinematic PowerPoint presentation
I don’t want to play with your switch right now, Waltuh
For Mario and Zelda ofc.
You bought it for realistic games? Lol. The Switch has tons of great games, but if you're looking for realistic ones, no idea why you though Switch was the right choice.
I'd play it.
There's that one racing game where it recreates the whole US, at a smaller scale tho.
Bro flight sim has already recreated the entire planet with much better graphics lmao
I’d go look for my house lol
It could be doable if the map is progressively streamed from the cloud, like how google/apple maps have entire cities in 3d models.
Here you go https://earth.google.com/web/
Impressive, but boring af.
It would be possible when AI gets powerful enough
Every angle change in every cutscene has a different transition effect.
I bought it for Pokemon and even though I have played every title they've ever released I've thus far been unable to force myself to finish any of the switch releases
And Switch Sports.
Y'all know about Microsoft Flight Simulator?
Yes, The Crew.

I loved the first game and had a lot of fun driving coast to coast and explore the USA

The other games were are far less immersive and fun
Yup, plenty of open space, but also plenty of very dense and detailed urban areas. Imo, the best map in any open world racing game ever.
Huh? Flight Sim doesn't have detailed maps for the whole entire world. Only certain cities/landmarks are detailed. With a game like GTA, you have detailed buildings, foliage, NPCs/traffic, collision detection, etc.
I just laugh at the scene of shooting people and then a nice transition with flowers show up, lol  
GTA VI by Granny
Wasn't the Crew 2 basically the same?
They added planes and boats. But my general feeling of the game was worse.
The game was more focused on the racing part (logic for a racing game) than by creating this feeling of liberty and discovery they had on the crew one
Cops arrest Man who was trespassing in a restaurant
I just watched the cringiest video of a cop arresting a guy trespassing and a store. I've never posted here before so just let me know if this counts
It felt like a comedy sketch with no punchline.
As it turned out there were indeed some bad vibes...
3 min in, I refuse to believe this is a real person. This 100% feels like a skit. You could tell me this is from Reno 911 and I would have believed you.
“Don’t ever work for Joey again…that’s a baby kangaroo”
I can only imagine how difficult it would have been for those people in the restaurant to wait on him. That dude is absolutely bonkers
Is this democracy manifest?
I’m just 20 seconds into this thing, would’ve already shot the guy. Let me go back to watching the rest.
This guy has to be on high on acid or mushrooms or something. I just can't comprehend any of his decisions or choice of words anywhere in this video.
Dude I honestly feel bad for these cops. This dude sucks
The "I can't breathe" thing made me think this is nothing but a guy trying to fake everything.
"wheres your id?" "Its right behind the photos of my children." Idc what any of you say, this guys fuckin hilarious
Reddit moderator?
Just noticed he has no shoes on 🤦🏽‍♂️
When did they let Ron Jeremy out of prison?
This was really disturbing to watch
Why does this feel like a Reno 911 character lmao

Maybe I’m just high but this is fucking hilarious
Is his medication that elfbar?
Now **THIS** is why I follow this sub!!! Riveting content bro
Matty Matheson has fallen so far.
Gus Johnson has hit hard times
Is this Reno 911?
I think this is mental illness or a very powerful drug. Either way it’s sad!
What an obnoxious GTA npc
This looks like very classical schizophrenia symptoms.

That cop did a damn good job. I hope that guy gets the very much needed help cause he needs a lot of it.
and a code 1089 is about employment rights, it has nothing to do with a bomb lmao
Why aren't ball gags deployed for ppl like this?
Thank you for wasting so much time...😒
Anyone else get an absurd amount of ads?
And I highly doubt those kids in his wallet are his. This guy gives off a certain creep vibe…
“My day is going *exactly* how I *wanted* it to go”

Sure, sport, sure it is lmao
Straight up harshing the vibes
When your personality test comes out "drug issues" 😞
This guy was absolutely high out of his mind

And an asshole. I mean, to try to pull up actual tragedies (I can't breath, Mommy, etc) as some means of getting out of trouble (or whatever the fuck his end goal was).

But yeah. I don't want to give him fame or anything, but I want to hear his side of things. Like, show him the video and then just have him explain himself
He‘s on drugs…
I am so far left politically that you wouldn't believe it, and this video makes me want to march downtown with a "Back the Blue" banner lol. These cops have the patience of saints, hope bro got his Jameson after work
[deleted]
Officer Ricky Ricardo arrests Simpson Comic Book Guy
lol after he pats him down he does a little booty shake while looking back at the officer. It’s honestly so hilarious. I can’t tell though if this is real or not..
This guy is having the worst trip ever
Looks like Gus Johnson!
Legitimately hilarious thing to say given the circumstances
That part killed me
Imagine this mofo on a PLANE!
Without any class version.
It only gets worse😂
That looks like a heroic dose gone bad to me
Well judging by his super cool shirt…
Who takes a bunch of psychedelics and thinks "you know what would be good right now, going to a sit down restaurant for a full dine in meal."
It actually blew my mind that someone could act like this. I have to assume drugs or mental disorder
ONLY BAD VIBES
I’m curious to the aftermath and repercussions of this
The “he said he planted a weapon of mass destruction in the restaurant” part didn’t confirm that idea for you?
I really don't know what's wrong with him. I don't think it's drugs. I think he's just like that hahahhaha
Don’t work for Joey that’s a baby kangaroo!
Hahaha might as well be
He had on slides but kicked them off.
Damn I didn't even notice that
I was thinking Jack Black
It was the "mommy"s that got me
Or my own personal favorite- both
Different departments use different police codes. 10-89 is indeed a bomb threat for some departments.
great question
YouTube nowadays is crazy unless you pay for it unfortunately
good thing we have the police to round them up when they get all disorderly
Just wow. 

Can you turn on the radio? This guy must have some mental illness..
I agree.
\*clears throat\* Umm.... not me. Pssh
His shirt tells me it is mushrooms.
Got a timestamp for that moment?
Yes. I’ve heard of this one. The ol’ *both*
Or my personal favorite.. NEITHER!   


**He's just an entitled, self aggrandized asshole.**   


Not everything should just be explained away by "mental illness" or Drugs.
oh, mb lol. I just gave it a goog and went off the first thing i saw.
Or use Re Vanced
It was actually hard to watch lol. The penis touching and and the mommy screams at what made me cringe
Gosh he says it a couple times. Literally as soon as they put him on the ground after he says I can't breathe.

4:18
Thanks! Kick-ass video btw,, is it in Florida? ( Mels diner )
I'm not entirely sure. I just saw it on YouTube and figured y'all would enjoy it. It was hard to watch the whole video😂
Yep. Shocking!
Virgin terrorizes London
Marked NSFW for language
I got 2 minutes in and right on the 2 minute mark when he says "maybe when your daughter's a little older eh?" On a video about trying to lose his virginity,  That's enough for me.

Also as a father I don't think I'd have taken that comment so well..
That accent is dancing all over the place.
Thank God he's a virgin. He should not procreate.
Holy shit this is quality cringe content, and so few views; OP how did you find this guy???
damn this one was super hard to get through, but I did it. One of the worst ive ever seen on this sub
Bro is actually pretty handsome; if he wasn’t such an insufferable asshole he’d probably get so many girls. Instead he wants to record himself talking like a pedo and harassing street performers with his outlandish behavior.
I always found that the guys that try the hardest to “crush some puss” are the ones that take the longest to do so. That, or they end up taking it by force. What a total shitbag..
Giving us other virgins a bad name
The real cringe is his fake American accent.
I’d pay top dollar to see this waste of oxygen take the pavement temperature challenge
I’ll try again tomorrow. Shooting for 2 min at least
He talks like he’s trying to impersonate a Canadian from South Park
I'm worried for his mental health.
These are the kids Tate's University pumps out.
Not a bad looking guy. Though to myself, if he's still a virgin, its his personality.

And damn, was i right.
What is this accent? It’s like a Bill & Ted affect
I was really really hoping for that guy at the end to clock him in the jaw.
This guy is trying really hard to be a youtube sensation and he's failing miserably.
Seeing how this was nsfw, the more I watched just made me hope he got seriously hurt at one point or another.
This physically hurt . Cringeiest video i've ever attempted to sit through. skimmed most of it. This guy needs a full time carer
Did he really say '"aching for puss"?
This guy needs to be on a watch list
Now this the type the cringe this subreddit was made for. 

Skipped randomly through the vid to the part with the busker and blowjob in front of the crowd. Had to turn it off because I couldn't deal
Been awhile since I've seen some good cringe in here
Kids a cringe lord- wannabe Andrew Tate and deserves to his face rearranged.
I hope he's on some kind of watchlist and I don't mean the YouTube kind.
What the fuck did I just witness??
This is unironically the worst video I've ever seen and the reason this sub exists. What the fuck, man.
I couldnt get past the intro ... damn its bad if thats just the start.... very cringe
This is the type of guy who could go off the deep end and go shoot some people one day before turning the gun on himself.
This dude is going to rape someone one day.
How long until this ends up on Cr1t1kal's channel?
Can almost guarantee the result if he goes to Glasgow or dublin
Major Nathan Barley vibes
Fucking punch his face.

the only good part was 9:40 in when he walks up to the man with two mone and said 'alright stud, how did you pull not one but two chicks?' and the man said 'first of all, i am young and that's irresistable, and the other thing is i exude sexuality'
The woman drinking wine out of the bottle in the play park with her kid was genuinely weird, what was going on there?
If a dick has a mouth is it oral?
I need to fuck until completion.
Reminds me of that Incel.  The ultimate gentleman…Rodgers?  I think his name was…ended up murdering a bunch of people.
You're literally doing what he want you to do. You're giving him attention.
What a creepy little dumbass.
Guy needs to get run over by a double decker
“Me an the boys lookin for puss”[https://i.imgur.com/B7DyWl3.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/B7DyWl3.jpeg)
When you think someone like this can’t actually exist, but they do. 

This is cringe and scary in a number of different ways. He gives major watchlist vibes.
My god that was horrific.
Perhaps London has gotten too soft. I seriously don't know how this guy made it through all of that without getting his ass whooped. I don't believe violence solves everything but the lack of repurcussions is what caused this.
Guys, I think I know why he's a virgin.
Sweet mother of fuck, I didn't realise how close this guy lives to me! That's a Bracknell boycot from now on.
the only good part was 9:40 in when he walks up to the man with two mone and said 'alright stud, how did you pull not one but two chicks?' and the man said 'first of all, i am young and that's irresistable, and the other thing is i exude sexuality'

Report the piss out of this guy to YouTube.
I don’t understand these guys salty about their virginity, like if it’s REALLY an issue you gotta push, can’t you bang a prostitute? Head to Vegas and pony up cowboy.
Poor guy some girl must of really stuck it too him, now he all bitter.
Ok I’m not gonna lie this guy is a huge piece of shit but after watching him he’s so funny
I'd take his virginity.
Later on he harasses a busker.

He has a crowd around him and Brad Chad jumps in, says I can do something cool with my mouth too and he starts pretending to suck the busker's cock.

The busker then says something along the lines of "yeah that is pretty funny... in front of all of the kids here" to which Brad Chad responds with "hell I'll suck their dicks too".

Truely a cursed person.
I didn't even make it that far.

I got to him approaching the family and asking the father something about how he got such a beautiful collection of...something. I couldn't watch any more than that.
He’s doing this shit in London. He is going to get stabbed any day soon.
As a father, I'd just want the interaction to end ASAP. Whatever I need to say to get this over with.
He talks like Andrew Tate, unsurprisingly lol
Talks like the guys on Alaskan Bush People, who admit they made it up.
Australian?
Here's his channel description:

>Comedy driven channel based in the uk. Adult themes. The jokes, stunts and pranks on this channel are not meant to be taken seriously, its comedy. 

So I'm guessing he's just playing a character, and isn't actually an incel. That being said, he's definitely harassing random people in the street in the name of "comedy".
Believe it or not I actually found this dudes reddit profile a while back. Unfortunately I don't remember what his username is though
I dont think i've ever cringed this hard in my life. When he goes back to the guys show? oh my lord
The BradTheChad person posts his content on here regularly
”I wonder what is wrong with me. Maybe I should go harass and insult people on the street to discover myself.”
Don’t insult Bill and Ted by putting this guy in with them! He is most bogus and they are most excellent!
He truly goes psycho when he catches that woman alone at the park, stands between her and an exit, and just rips into her. Dude is gonna murder someone someday
yup, you can sense a tryhard from a mile away. He just wants views at any price
You must not have any children. Sometimes you just need a break! It was a beautiful day and her husband was there as well to take care of their son.
You're blaming a supposed girl for this guy being a douche bag?Maybe the guy is just naturally a douche bag.

>  girl must of really  
    
Did you mean to say "must have"?  
Explanation: You probably meant to say could've/should've/would've which sounds like 'of' but is actually short for 'have'.

I'd sell it back to him
I wouldn't, it comes with a lot of self-loathing
That should, and I'm pretty sure is, a criminal offence on some level. Gross kid.
What's a busker 
Yeah, we all get stabbed in London. I'm getting stabbed right now!
”We’re not in Romania” he says later in the video, ironically.
Somewhere in between Australia, USA and England.
No he definitely has true Incel vibes. Something is socially playing against him. And not to insult anyone with autism, because most show higher class then this fellow. But he doesn't make too long of eye contact with anyone. He might actually pick up on his inner cringe awareness at that point.
Ah the pinnacle of comedy, sexually harassing random people on the street
Thats kinda worse tbh. 

Also:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZDuAQ8Cvlw
That's the distraction to throw people like you off

This kind of white guy for, nearly,  ever now has gone around being racist or whatever the local flavor of terrible is and if you call them out

>it's just satire 

Or

> it's just a joke

Or

>no one would take tucker carlson serious as an actual human so he can say whatever

Don't let them fool you with a disclaimer.
I hope you're joking. I have two kids, that was strange behaviour, day drinking, in a public kids park, out of the bottle, odd.
https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=Busker
Downvoted by six hungry buskers.
Wrong city but: https://youtu.be/tIK60-mFGSA?si=DnOdOpArCWQZT7PT
man i have aspergers syndrom, i cant use a bus because i feel weird and its to much be around a lot of people specially when i cant get out if a want; that being said this guys confidence in doing all this in public, i'm just jealous hahahah
jealous not because i want to do this but the confidence
Again, whether he's an incel or not, he's still harassing people on the street. It's only a "distraction" to idiots.
Look here buddy no worries, what you lack in confidence, this guys lacks in awareness. You I promise will be one day forced upon a situation and within that situation you will meet someone who just adores you. And your shyness or lack of confidence will forcefully subside. Hopefully by your efforts, if not it will come from the other person's. You WILL be uncomfortable, but that only temporary. This guys lack of awareness seems permanent. But glad you are not him. 

Cheers.
How weapon storage should work in GTA VI
They should go with red dead 2s “weapons on horse” mechanic where the protagonists will be able to carry only a primary and secondary weapon at a time, the rest of your arsenal being stored in the trunk. It could even be something you have to earn with car upgrades, meaning early game you’d have to store weapons at a safe house. 
This would be cool because it would make larger vehicles like vans actually serve a purpose which sports cars cant
It would also be cool if you could buy upgrades for certain weapons to get a folding stock so you could have it be concealed in a back pack or under a coat etc
“You won’t get this type of stuff at Ammu-Nation”
Gun vans for sure, or, yknow...modding our personal vehicles for more gun space. That will also work.
I think it will be something like that
I wanna put people in my boot tho
Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure the leaks disclosed plenty about a duffel bag and backpack system. With that in mind I'm inclined to think that it'll be similar to Rdr2 in the way that you can likely carry 1-2 sidearms at any given time and 1 primary + more if wearing bags. Idk tho, that just seems like what it would be to me. If that were to be the case I imagine a personal vehicle would be similair to the horse load out system, just pick from the trunk and equip your loadout in a small menu
As long as they don’t have V’s “carry every version of ever weapon”. RDR2 had the same tbh. I preferred the old style of selecting one from each type. In 4 deciding between Glock and Desert Eagle was actually satisfying
I miss this. GTA IV was truly a masterpiece lol.
If that happens, I wonder what you could use semis for....
Only problem is this may end up like Red Dead, someone kills your horse then you can’t get your weapons while they spawn kill you
Nah R* can't really care less about some players suddenly wants the game to be realistic, they'll do what's the best for the game and what majority of players prefer
Would like the option of a rdr style weapon carry or a normal gta style, and the car acts as like the horse with the weapon storage
Probably, but I really enjoy the “carrying every weapon in creation” method
No. I want to hold every weapon in my ass.
No thanks, I like disposable cars. The game is called grand theft auto.
If they do anything they should limit the amount of ammo you can take.
Nah, Lucia pulls all of them out of her bra
This would be a neat mechanic. No chance it’ll cross over to online though.
Except it would cut the flow of the game down. Pulling up to a mission to then go to your trunk and pull out only like 2 guns to use would take the fun out of it i want to be able to use all guns. Now if the missions restricts me that’s perfectly fine but why should we get restricted in general.
I dont think this would be very fun at all. You will be stuck with 1 single car for the majority of the game (with superfluous upgrades), really locking you into a certain playstyle. No longer will you be able to just go crazy stealing cars
I don't want GTA to be realistic. I want to be able to pull a rocket launcher out of my pocket because that is more fun. It's a big dumb action movie and that is what it should remain.

I think people need to remember that Red Dead 2 and GTA are very different games in a lot of ways. Not everything that works in GTA works in Red Dead, just like not everything that works in Red Dead would work in GTA. 

Putting limitations on the players weapons, or some of the ither insane suggestions I have seen like a hot-wiring minigame every time you steal a car, or an even more ridiculous one that cops would chase you for speeding/running red lights would completely break the gameplay and actively spoil what makes the GTA games fun in the first place.
I want every arm on me at all time.
I feel like I am the only one who isn’t asking or wanting these realistic changes like not being to carry all your guns
Nah, I want to pull out my mini gun the same way I pull out my pistol >!out of my ass!<
Nope i dont like it i feel like realism is more of a rdr thing and not gta
Highly disagree. What worked in RDR2 doesn’t necessarily means is going to work in GTA, after all these are very different games. I think it should stay how is always been “armory inside your pocket”
I wouldn’t mind either or. Like there being specific online options where you can hold onto every weapon classic GTA style or new red dead style. Kind of like with Max Payne 3 you could choose hard auto aim, soft auto aim and manual aim.
As long as the guns won't disapear off of your person because they're stuck in the car I'm fine with it
Duffle bag in the back. Breaking Bad style. Done.
I hope something similar to Resident Evil. I always thought they nailed the grid storage system perfectly.
I heard rumors (I cant remember where but I had to have heard them somewhere to even remember this but) it was said to have some sort of car storage for some/all weapons in the same way cyberpunk does and sort of like how days gone did with the pouches.
State of Decay / State of Decay 2 operates on a strict weight system for weapons and consumables,  and vehicles have slots for storage. 

It would make GTA much more realistic.  As much as I liked carrying 4 handguns, 4 rifles, 4 shotguns, 4 explosive launchers, and 2 tons of ammo in GTA V, it was a little laughable.
This was something TrueCrime did and it made you much more immersed and appreciative of your car
I mean I think the idea would be fun for a little bit, but eventually people prolly complain not having their RPG, LMG, and all their other shit in the press of a button. We’ll see what happens!
Agreed 👍🏾
according to leaks, it is
from what i saw in the leaks, we’re gonna have a RDR2 weapon and inventory system for sure

but if we wanna conceal bigger guns, i imagine we’d need to have folding stocks, duffel bags, or just not get spotted with them lmao
Im cool with this if they remove the gun weapon and only let u hold 2-3 weapons which is realistic
I’ve been saying this since they teased VI. It should work similarly to how you would store weapons and other stuff on your horse in RDR2. Make your car feel more unique and incorporated into gameplay
Ya that would be awesome as well as environmental damage from guns and vehicles ect
![gif](giphy|Pl4PHOXVpPPDG)
They confirmed that there will be duffle bags,so ig the inventory system will work like that if they plan on going realistic
Until my car catches fire from the three lightpoles I took out and guard rail I jumped into oncoming traffic and I hijack a different car.
But this is a choice that caters to one portion of the player base, what about the other players that don’t want this?
RDR2 was an EXTREMELY easy game. I never failed a single mission while playing it. GTA 5 has way more features but it is still much harder than RDR2. You can just finish RDR2 with one shotgun in hand, it is super easy. Unlimited weaponry should remain in GTA 6. It makes the game so much more fun.
Like rdr2? But with cars?
i dont know about that, having to return to my personal vehicle if i want/need to change my weapons in the game about stealing cars would be tedious. cool idea though
You crash and watch all your guns fall out into the street
I've thought this since before rdr2! Pockets/holsters, car trunk, and a backpack. Pockets can fit 2 pistols and a rifle, backpack can fit 2 rifles, extra pistol, and big stuff like rocket launchers, and it can go in your trunk or on your back. Car trunk is unlimited storage. If I'm walking down the street carrying 3 rifles and a rocket launcher, it should look like it
First of all, if they have guts to add a Trunk Weapons Storage system in GTA 6, it will probably be something like RDR2.

Where you can pick up any long gun (or 2) you’ve bought from the trunk and swap them. 

And you will only be able to do that with your personal car. 

And I hope, if you ever get arrested and they find your car with you when you get arrested, you lose all your guns, not just bullets like in GTA5.
No
Boy that trunk was like Christmas!
I think it would be cool, but it shouldn’t only be available at your car. It should be other places too, like your apartment or hidden stashes throughout the city.
[removed]
I'm pretty sure it's gonna be that way, would add some realism of the good kind and thats what they aim for
Have it as an option, rdr2 was fine because that was way more story driven and made sense for time period. GTA 5 and now 6 should play more like sandboxes and not have a limiting thing like this(or just do it in the “big” missions, IE if for casino heist we could store a van near the casino that has extra stuff in it)
If they go for realism it would give us a reason to use sawed off shotguns and small SMGs more. Also pistols will be the most used type of gun which is logical for a game like gta.
YES!
This is dope. Maybe even add a duffle bag or backpack system in game (like the hitman briefcase mechanic) where you can get long guns like an ak or shotgun into places without causing too much attention. This as a way to transport numerous guns from your car on foot and be well equipped in case you aren’t able to get back to your car once the shots start letting off.
I fucking hope so!!
Is this from gta iv? I don't remember ever seeing this lol...
I appreciate this shit, man
Red Dead 2 already does this with the horse.
Honestly the idea of pulling up with pistols on you and then grabbing a shotgun or something out the trunk is so cool icl

It's immersive AND cool asf
Early leaks suggested this would be the case. Basically the horses from Red Dead Redemption 2.
People in this sub don't play the online? People want a truck of weapons in their pocket, if it's difficult to access, they'll complain to no end.
Cant wait to reach into my glovebox before missions🙏🏽
I really hope they take this “realism” approach that they did with RDR2. It’s more authentic and I love the thought and details behind it.
Well, sounds good until you remember that most of the players is switching cars every 5 minute
I hope GTAVI will be somewhat similar to Red dead 2 in details like this
Ithi k you should just be allowed to carry one of each weapon type
This is exactly what it will be
If anyone played LA Noire you'd remember that Cole only carried his pistol by default but you could pick up guns at any cop cars trunk or off dead people 

A system like that could work
I did see backpacks/some ofther duffle bags inventory system in the leaks. Maybe you can store weapons in there
what's the problem with gta 5's system? and don't come at me with "realism" because if it were for that then we'd need to have to refuel cars and.... yeah it gets very unfun very quickly.
Nah that takes a lot of fun out of a GTA game. It is part of GTA's nature to have a whole arsenal in your back pocket..
It should be a choice that affects a players play style. Also, Short Barrel Rifles (SBR) and Short Barrel Shotgun (SBS) should play a role if you want something more lethal than a pistol caliber carbine (PCCs). I think a lot of people are gonna see how useful PCCs are if you can carry 3 weapons if you run short barrels. Also, Under Barrel Grenade Launchers and Grenade Launcher Pistol would be awesome.
I totally agree, imagine planning an assault on a target and having to carefully plan the type of weapons youd want to bring to carry out whatever mission or even free roam activity you’re on?
Nah Gta 5 system is better
You *want* this??? Oh dear god, no.
i hope we can get pulled over and cops can search the car w body cams n we can cause a parade and it gets shared on the 6social
For both online and story, it would be great if carrying weapons was limited to inconspicuous holding without attracting law enforcement. Equipping an assault weapon (eg a sub machine gun) Even if the weapon isn’t in your hand, having it on your characters back or in a sling should immediately draw suspicion.
i like this idea, but i also dont. i have been playing rdr2 for the first time lately (havent completed it yet) and enjoy all its mechanics and story, but i enjoy going on rampages and using random guns in gta too. i wish thered be a way of keepi g both mechanics in game somehow via  a setting or different game modes
Na man I have al my guns in my back pocket
I can’t wait!!!
Realism isn't Fun
Nah dont leave the gta formula

No refueling cars

Multiple weapons and 9999 ammo please thanks.


If you want realism install gta mods.
Yes 🙏
Great till you realize you can only drive 1 car if you want anything and if its destroyed well too damn baaaaad.
So if you lose your or it blows up you lose your weapons? No thank you. The game is called Grand Theft Auto why should i be penalized for doing what the game demands, if i steal a civial car am i just gonna be stuck with 2 weapons? Thats horrible just give us all weapons simple as that
thought about it for 2 seconds, hard pass.
GTA V has pussified the entire community into wanting convenience over character/realism. GTA V has stupefied an entire 3 generations of morons into thinking it's the best when San Andreas and IV literally exist to disprove that. GTA V is a childish, cancerous, pos downgrade both in story mode and especially Online. GTA V is not Rockstar's magnum opus as you clowns want to believe; GTA SA, GTA IV, RDR1, and RDR2 are the true magnum opuses.
When prepping for a robbery/specific missions you would have to to choose between a fast car with limited space or a big car with the extra storage for weapons & the items you steal
That’s a really cool idea. Because there wasn’t any real reason to have the bigger slower cars/vans in the other games other than novelty. We could store all our weapons in our house or whatever and when our car is on the property or garage we can choose what goes in the car when we take it
this is so fucking cool imagine having a reason to drive an rs6 wagon for transportation instead of a small sports car maybe not even for guns only but wares to sell even?
Super natural style with their impala. Would be sick.
Or larger sports cars would be the perfect blend

One of those old American 4 door muscles or an AMG 4 door sedan
Yesss preach king. I've been talking concealment and holsters this whole time! That was cringe lol. 

Wearing clothing to conceal a sbr or normal rifle might be more sus in Florida's climate than anything though lol
![gif](giphy|AssqAJR8ib5WmCNGOU|downsized)
Salesman: Sells me a hand grenade 
  
*Works well in the crowded areas*
Yeah. Some guy that got copyright strike from R* not so long ago said a bunch of stuff on Twitter that’s apparently legit, at least by the looks of it. 

He and some other reputable leaker both said it’s **much more RDR2** then we could think
Hope you can hogtie or handcuff people
Its gonna have both. You can choose any arm in your car, but to carry more than 2 big guns you need a bag, other use could be to hide big guns from plain sight
Yeah I remember hearing on the leaks they were going to add a car storage system similar to cyberpunk for some/all weapons but I think it may just be a few weapons. Would be really cool to have each vehicle have a certain amount of storage slots and each type of weapon/item takes up different amounts. An rpg takes up 3-4 slots while a rifle only takes 2 and a handgun is just 1 slot.
Yeah but It was alpha gameplay, they could have changed already to the more easy wheel of weapons, which I think is really a big no no in 2025.
How exactly did RDR2 have the same? RDR2 was perfectly balanced with 2 sidearms, 2 primaries, and your molotovs, melee, etc
In red dead your horse could hold every gun 

You had to choose what you wanted if you were going to dismount
It really wasn't deciding tho because the Deagle was superior in almost every way
Seriously. All I beg is for cops n crooks mode to come back
It wasn't.
Haul around an entire arsenal for yourself and your Org
Having multiple cars in the trailer. Drop the trailer somewhere and unload your cars. Do some shenanigans lose the cops load it up then rinse repeat. Swap plates on those cars afterwards.

Or hell maybe have the semi trailer be a mobile cook house for some illicit operation 

I think if they ever do a Mid West GTA it should absolutely have a Semi truck base system
just respawn further away lol also in gta 5 online it is exactly like that. if you don't want to be spawnkilled, you turn on the passive mode.
that's a skill issue
Its going to have some new updated player mechanics and car physics but it will be your usual gta game. I read thatvrockstar pulled the devs off of rdr2 and put them on gta6 to FastTrack the release so maybe we will have similar character movement or something
People used to say the same about gta 4 that took an extremely realistic aproach compared to the ps2 games. And gta 4 wasn't a ubisoft nor a nintendo game. It was rockstar going for realism even if it was polemic at the time.
The great part about red dead was the realism, horse needs some oats, car needs some gas, maybe not oil changes and all the other bullshit, but it would require more planning for going on long murder streaks and running from cops
The majority of players spent their formative years sniffing glue, they don't know what they want. 😉
Get with the times. Assholes are tighter nowadays.
That's what she said
Exactly! In rdr2 it works perfectly because your horse is not only a transport method, he's your companion, but in gta a big part of the fun is to go around stealing cars every 5 minutes, this wouldn't be fun or practical at all. GTA is a game with faster pacing
Just let us carry one of each weapon type and go back to a safehouse/gun shop to change them
Or you could just have a duffle bag you have to toss in the trunk to make your car like rdr2s horses

You could make any horse your armory by just putting your saddle on it or by just walking up to your saddle if it was on the ground or on a dead horse 

I think a duffle bag system could work well
Thank you! Realism in videogames is cool, but some people is too obsessed with it
try rdr 2 you will see that its fun
GTA 6 is going for realism though
Where did this belief that rdr is for realism and gta is for arcade even come from lol? Rdr and gta4 were pretty similar (both used euphoria and had weapon wheel) so it’s safe to assume rdr2 and gta6 are gonna be similar in that aspect as well. Unless you’ve only ever played gta5 and rdr2

Not saying they should load this game with realistic features though.
this. gta is about fun, not realism. we don't need to fill up cars with gas, we don't need to be restricted to like 2 guns.
Lets be honest here. When have you used more then justbone assault rifle and maybe an rpg in the singleplayer? Most people use very few weapons
No joke, as someone who actually goes to shooting ranges and hunting

A handful of bags in back is super easy.

And you know if your expecting trouble unload the guns and put em on the passenger seat
Maybe there’ll be an option to carry weapons in a duffel bag
They can either move on or cry louder
How is GTA V harder?
And imagine a Grand Theft Auto in where you're not able to steal cars because all your weapons are in the one you have. GTA is not RDR2, not every game has to be super realistic in every aspect, why don't people understand that?
TBOGT DLC
it adds difficulty and some strategy to a core mechanic. Same with rdr1 and 2s systems. its not a solution, its an upgrade and if it weren't for those gta 5 would just be a gta 3 with better visuals
If you don’t wanna refuel then just steal another car, makes more fun if that’s what you’re looking for. Also they could just add an upgrade at the mechanic for a certain price so that you don’t have to refuel anymore. Similar to gta 5 with the damage upgrade. 
Less to do with realism, but it would make more challenging for sure. Having to decide which weapon is best for the situation before leaving your car behind. Imagine entering a building and a shootout ensues, and you think to yourself “damn I should’ve got that shotgun from the trunk”.
But having a duffle bag full of weapons in the trunk or backseat wouldn't make anyone suspicious. When you exit your car you can choose to go with concealable weapons and or unconcealed weapons 

And people would react accordingly
They can just make it optional.
But life simulator VI
cringe take if you dont want new gameplay systems why even play a new game?
And in comes the insurance mechanic as it was in V.
I WISH. I hope that in GTA six people won't walk around with rocket launchers and drive flying cars. I hope that people at the start of the game at least will carry a knife and a small firearm at most. I hope that destroying your car will actually have real consequences.
Rockstar?? Get this guy on staff
Armored hummers coming back in style!
Easily one of the best directions to go. Same with ultra weaponized vehicles online. Easy balancing mechanic to implement if they go with a vehicle storage system. Your car flies and shoots mini guns? Your character is gonna be strapped for weapons on their person.
Your username entertained me today, thank you
Such a good idea that I'm gonna be annoyed if it's not there now lmao
Armored van that is slow with lots of storage that can carry a minigun, rpg, etc. Or a supercar that can only store sidearms.
I had a similar hope with RDR2 that there'd be a mechanic of small, fast horses could carry less so you'd have to balance horse stats depending on what you were planning to do. Alas, it wasn't meant to be.
The game will still be easy. It will just make the game boring.
Rockstar sweating to get it done before launch after reading this
Unfortunately, we can't have nice things and we would get the $25 pay-mobile sporting high capacity and favorable handling
to conceal a steel ball run?
is that a firearm or are you just happy to see me?
Twice as much pig shit shovelling.
Because they fucking use trailer leaks for Rockstar to strike it. GTA 6 will be nothing like RDR2. RDR2 already got humbled by GTA 6 even though GTA 6 is not even out yet. RDR2 was nowhere as successful as GTA 5 was. GTA 6 is leaning into GTA 5's way not RDR2's way.


It is truly mindblowing that GTA 5 came out 5 years before RDR2 did and it's still soooooooooooooo much better than RDR2.
2 big guns is too much in my opinion. You can have a small firearm in your belt under your shirt and a belt with a rifle on your back i think that would surffice if you can store more weapons in a backpack, duffel bags ir store magazines and grenades in a tactical vest/harness and the rest in a transporter or big enough car if some sorts
Im well aware how old the footage is and that things are due to be changed lol, I'm only going off of leaks because this is purely speculative and they are the only thing we have to work with as far as gameplay mechanics
Ehh I would've liked just one primary slot. It looked bad when Arthur had two guns on his back, too cluttered. I avoided it as much as possible but the game puts weapons on your back for you if the mission contains a firefight. Plus, with just one primary you have to be more aware of your loadout and with two playable characters you could do complimentary loadouts.
In the wheel you could cycle through all of the options on your horse, how is it carrying 30 revolvers and 10 different repeaters? Older games you'd go to the gun shop or back to house/camp to change them out. 

I just preferred that. It was definitely an improvement on V though
Oh my god yes. For real I never had the same feeling while playing GTA V. I mean the game isn’t bad and I definitely was older (16 for IV and 21 for V) but the vibe just wasn’t the same. The city didn’t made me feel the way Liberty City did, the fall atmosphere and the air you see at night when Niko is breathing, shivering when you didn’t move for a while. Everything really felt like we were Niko, like we were all seeing New York City for the first time and it was exactly the same feeling I had when I first saw NYC back in 2018. Just a magical game.
Always some little child who only played V saying stupid shit.
I was thinking more on the level or hauling nuclear bombs or something, lmao
the thing is devs will do what they've been told to do, they have next to zero decision power about game mechanics or just anything in general. they have supervisor and people who are in charge of making critical decisions and so far so good! we saw downfall of many companies but R\* did not let us down yet and hopefully will never
I'd love for a fuel system, needs to be realistic though and not overly fast like Days Gone's system. Excuse me but a bike doesn't run out of fuel after 2 minutes.
I have played RDR2, I did not like it
I have finished RDR2 many times and GTA 5 is so much more fun. GTA 5 is just something else. RDR2 is good and all but GTA 5 is legendary.
i hope gta vi gets as realistic as rdr 2
It doesn’t matter which one ive used the point is i CAN use them all. If i want to rob a liquor store with my mini gun i have to call my car and take it out of the trunk? Why? That’ll just discourage me from getting in crazy situations. If theres a jet flying around i need to call my vehicles to get a rocket launcher really?
Exactly this. Not only that, but I'm always annoyed that I have to scroll through useless guns every time I want to pick the assault rifle I always use on foot.
Sit down comedian
the thought of one/two big and small weapons is cool but infinite weapon storage has not been gta's thing forever but makes sense
And how are you gonna steal another car if (based on what the post is asking for) all your weapons are in the one you have...?
I personally think this mechanic works better with red dead, because the game encourages you to take care of your horse and if it dies it's gone forever. But, in GTA, cars are really disposable and this mechanic would discourage players from stealing cars. 

I really like the idea of the challenge itself, like the shotgun situation you mentioned, I think it would be fun. But what if your car explodes? What would be the logic for the weapons to be intact? Or would you lose all of your weapons? And if the weapons do survive, you would have a hard time finding a car that can hold all of your weapons, like a van. And also, in a shootout, I think that wouldn't be fun for the majority of people to come out of the car, run to the trunk and get a gun.

I think that this mechanic would be more frustrating than fun in a GTA game. But I'd love to hear y'all opinion to convince me otherwise
New map, new missions just like how gta 3- gta 5 went?

Its not like gta 5 suddenly became hyper realistic.

The formula of SA and 5 is the same.

The formula of VC and 6 also has to be the same.
People downvoting me: *has to think hard about it for more than 2 seconds*......"nuh uh".
Ikr
Can confirm.
You could fit a sub machine gun in one, maybe an assault rifle
STEEL! BAAALLL!!! RUUUUUUUUNNN!!!
Three times as much house building.
There’s too much to do in rdr2 to say that gta 5 is better in anyway besides online and actually making content.
Check out how Mortimer stores his weapons on his horse in For a Few Dollars More
The horse has bags and youre shown tucking weapons in and out of saddle scabbards
It’s not that deep bro
I know exactly what you mean and I totally agree. Maybe it’s just a liberty city kind of thing.
Right but pulling devs specifically off rdr2 which was their biggest title besides gta and sinking them into gta can't be a random call when they left devs on lesser selling titles.
Lmao right, a trip or 2 around the map on a tank would be good. But not the infinite laps I do around the map in 5 during police chases
what part did you like about gta 5?
GTA V is undeserving of it's praise. V is praised for doing what San Andreas and IV did better lmfao
What makes red deads gameplay so fun is the realism.
You get it. GTA is a sandbox that lets you run amok putting a limit on how many weapons we can use will hinder that feeling. Would it be cool? Maybe but I don’t want my GTA for high levels of realism, that’s why RDR2 is here for
Yes really
- Pistol as backup
- SMG or Auto Pistol for drive by
- An AR for everything else on foot
- A heavy weapon for fun
GTA 4 was pretty limited in ammo capacity compared to SA or 5
[deleted]
fr. They just think "realism good, it works in rdr2" without considering that GTA is not RDR2 and how badly that would limit the players
They’ll introduce a new mechanic where you need to wait in line at the DMV for a driver’s licence. *So immersive*
No, there is not too much to do in RDR2. It is a highly repetitive game and taking place in 1899 automatically makes it weaker than GTA 5. Arthur's death was rushed and the legendary John Marston was portrayed as a complete fool. Dutch's Micah fetish was also annoying. RDR2 is nowhere as fun as GTA 5 or RDR1.
Cool, I like that, thanks for the info
Yeah you’re right actually, my bad
Maybe! It’s the second GTA I only booted the game just to cruise around the city, first one being Vice City. One thing that helped all the love for GTA was the official website that was like a real city official website. It was awesome. Man I used to go into the Superstar Cafe when it was raining in game and pretend i was a regular customer enjoying the jazz music lol
Which titles are you talking about that they left devs on
pretty much everything
In games like GTA where everyone has a random assortment of rifles pistol rocket launchers and mini guns being caught behind the barrel of a mini gun while having only a sniper and pistol would suck. If you enjoy that then thats on you
Thank you very much.
Having to do laundry would go sooooo hard
Rushed after 40+ hours of gameplay bro what. Dutch’s “Micah fetish” is an important plot point. Epilogue John you could argue was portrayed as a fool. GTA 5 story mode is feels empty asf after I played rdr2
I was mistaken i was thinking of another game but the point is that they pulled devs off of a title that is extremely popular to put them on gta6
So the heavy movement, snap aim, story focused mission designs. Everything rdr2 has except rdr2 has a looting system and limited carry system ontop of it
It already leaked that they are doing a limited weapon system like rdr2.
We’ll see.
The GOD helmet
From the netflix series “28 Days Haunted”. At least hire good actors if you are going to try something like this.
i hate this shit with a glorious passion. so corny.
I just feel bad for the animator that went way too hard, that bro should work on actual science shows.
10/10 acting
That show was so deliciously terrible. The wife not being able to sleep because of her husband's snoring, and them chalking it up to "demonic activity" trying to drive a wedge between them. Comedy gold.

Now that’s pod racing
Only a person with a playdough brain would think that this magneto helmet was going to work
Just making up random stuff
Mental illness
Netflix paid money for this? 

Please, Netflix; next time your higher-ups discuss a new show, make them wear the God Helmet for heaven's sake. It will filter out all the bad ideas polluting the meeting room.
That's not what the god helmet is.

This IS Lucia
Clips from 2022-09-13 will also help you verify this obvious fact. That's her.
if its her, her movements are very exaggerated, like trying to bring attention to herself, i can see this as some kind of plot by the duo to dupe and steal all of some old rich dudes money
Biggest gta debate
But the most important thing we can all agree on: both fine as hell
https://preview.redd.it/v92558v99n4c1.jpeg?width=351&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf0776c61ec0edd0a1b2c846bba81d9be59efbfb

Risking myself a ban,I’m sorry mods but for me it’s over,it’s like everyone forgot how she looked here.

Edit : Someone just throw a pair of glasses in PS and we all will see.
Where’s the mole under her lip? Lucia also doesn’t have moles on her cleavage, bikini girl does.
The ears look similar too, the girl on the right which could be Lucia is also most likely wearing makeup considering where she is, what she's wearing, etc etc.
Whoever she is shes gorgeous
Bro this is the gold dress/blue dress debate all over again
Why is everyone so fixated on the moles when the faces look identical? She has the exact same eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips and facial structure.
Besides the moles argument, the biggest point for me is because i dont think that Rockstar would put a character so similar to the MC, specially considering that she appeared in what looks like a cinematic, also the fact that this game is so absurdly detailed.

Character design, recognition, uniqueness.

This is Lucia.
Where are others moles, those one on left chin.
Maybe in a flashback before she got arrested bc she does looks different
That's her in the car speeding down the freeway too, no?
Men discover makeup
Also, the earrings
This debate is fuckn nuts 😂
If you are going to take the two moles that matches as evidence that it is, you also have to take the multiple ones that don't as evidence that it is not. There are more moles missing than the two that are there.
Plottwist: it’s her sister.
It’s just the GTA 6 cover model girl she’ll be famous just lollipop girl (IV), bikini selfie girl (V), wine girl (VC), lip licking sunglasses girl (SA) and others before her.
The model on the right seems to have blue eyes...
This could be her but I'm leaning towards no. The girl on the right has other moles in different places and Lucia has many more moles that aren't visible on the girl on the right. 

However, we don't know the extent of customisation which will be available in the game so, it could be her, but I'm still leaning towards no.
The lips arent the same
Also the same earrings

I thought that was her from the first time I saw it
[removed]
GYATTTTT
Lucia has two more on her chin, and a few on her belly which are absent on the bikini babes face. Furthermore, bikini babes breasts are larger. Yall are literally delusional
It’s not Lucia.
if everyone is focusing on the moles why not focus on ALL the moles. She clearly has moles UNDERNEATH her mouth on the left, and not on the right
[deleted]
You guys like to pick and choose I see. Match ALL the moles for me. before I hear the excuse that she has makeup on in the second pic, why aren't all the moles covered then, also why is the mole on her upper cheek even larger if she has makeup on?
The body looks different. Lucia looks thicker around the waist whereas this girl is a little thinner, unless this a flashback or younger Lucia. But I love how this is the biggest debate😂
That's Lincoln clay
I will continue to think it’s not her until it’s confirmed
I just assumed it's Lucia at the start of the game Vs Lucia near the end when she's 'made it'.
Then she's missing a mole under her lip in the bikini shot.
Compare with her in Black dress + long hair. Answer Gotten.
Sure I can see those two freckles match up… what about the rest? She has two more on the chin and at least one on the forehead that should be visible as well.
They have the same red circles in their face.
We're just ignoring the moles that are also missing on glamour girl? Okay then.
Girl on the right has huge boobs while Lucia has kind of normal size.
It's definitely not at all
Ugh I'm not looking forward to this debate for a year and a half
100% NOT her. Aside from the fact that several beauty spots are completely missing, the hairline is different, and so is her jaw/face shape. Eyebrows are also a different shape. Lucia has more of an arch to her eyebrow, and extends wider. See below comparison. I'd also suggest that her eyes don't look to be brown behind those lenses, but that's harder to determine because of the colour tint. The do look much lighter though, as though they could be blue/green, not dark brown as Lucia's are. She does have the same ear rings, and there's some other similarities, but it's not Lucia.

Wah wah wee wah! Very nice!
Not from Miami nor have I ever visited, but she is supposed to be of which descent? Cuban?
You forgot the two love spots under her lip, it isn’t on the girls with the bikini
That’s clearly her evil twin sister, that’s the plot of the game. Trust me I know.
What about the mole on the left side of her face under her mouth
There's 4 other moles/freckles on the left's chin. Not on the right
Bikini girl has a mole on the knuckle of her right middle finger. Lucia in bed does not. Seems weird she'd make up her face, but not arms in bikini pic; and when she's with no make up on her face she covers her arms and hands.
The first GTA game where you actually play as hot loading screen girl 😎
White bikini girl trailer when????
Kind of on the fence because in that "Trust" scene her tits don't look anywhere near as big. Could be wrong, but it's not that deep.
I get transformations and all but it really doesn't look like her.
So am i the only one who thought this was not lucia or didn't understand why people called her lucia. Like never in my mind i thought it was her.
This clip was to clearly show off the advancements they've made in hair physics in addition to character customization.


Then I get on here and see people like "but her titty moles!!1" 🤓


lol it's clearly Lucia, probably doing some honeypot grift angle or some shit
All I know is, the trailer brings soooo much thickness and I’m glad for it.
Cmon guys is the same fucking nose, eyebrown, earring and mouth. How you guys don't knew its her?
She's just with differenr hair and makeup
“Is this Lucia” bruh it’s one of the most detailed characters in the entire trailer. Of course it is
i believe the lady in the bikini was also on the boat with the old man dancing
I think it is her, and not because she looks similar. I'm basing this entirely on the social media aspects that the trailer was really hammering home. If I had to hazard a guess as to what's going on, I'm guessing Rockstar is doing some sort of modern take on Bonnie and Clyde. The duo gains media attention via social media and this is probably Lucia doing such. What better way to grab attention than to wear a bikini in some party for someone to record her?

The same thing with that footage of the woman in the car on the causeway with her arms in the air. That woman was Lucia and the driver Jason. Someone was recording them in the car next to them. Maybe there's some sort of gameplay element, a-la hidden packages/side missions, but with building notoriety for the duo. I'm well aware that I'm probably grasping at straws here, so we'll just leave it at that.
If so the plot about this change must be very fun.
Fuck yeah, haircuts are back.
They don’t look the same facially and the girl in the knock off LV bikini has way bigger boobs than Lucia.
Red dead 3 should star a female character too
If this is Lucia, then Rockstar has definitely upgraded character customization for single player
She must be wearing makeup
the brows neck moles all look the same ngl.. fuck this is hard
I want Lucia to be a baddie, not an influencer
😋
why does this matter?

OH IT MATTERS
Yeah sure. From A cup to D cup ( . )( . )
The hair physics in the trailer is insanely good
No it’s not. The spots on her chin are gone in the picture to the right
I think it's her because the hair is kinda the same on the leak where she has a dress and the same hair
The hoods greatest minds are on the case
Twin sister
Lucia has 4-5 pieces, the other girl has 2 pieces. Also, Lucia's breasts are not that big.
Could be when they get loads of money during a heist and are partying. I’m sure they get busted and are forced to do dirty work like CJ did for the police
Anyone else going to play a majority of the time as Lucia? 😅
Has anyone tried matching the hairlines? The spots can be covered with makeup so I don’t get why people keep using them
Yet you forget the other moles on her chin and forehead that don’t line up with the girl on the right. It ain’t her.
Lol. Sure, just ignore all the other birth marks on her face
[deleted]
Yes, it is her. She's taking a pic for social media.
it's crazy that this is even up for debate when it's literally the same girl
Good to see other people mentioning it. TGG has been saying this since the moment the trailer came out but a ton of people in his chat were doubting and I see every single other place call her just a random bikini girl
Yeah it's her 100%
Mods will let you to undress her anyway. Second trailer maybe will show more hints. I'm inclined the bikini girl to be Lucia because of leaks. Lucia in a dress and blonde hair looks too similar.
She even does a spin similar to inmate Lucia, as if she celebrates her ill-gotten gains.
Since we play as Lucia, I’m sure we have the option to hit up Beauty salons. Not all that different from going to the barbershop in SA or customizing Franklin’s appearance. Not that far fetched of a concept.

And actually, I wouldn’t be surprised if there were some physical changes possible — no different than MP characters in GTA 5 as part of the make-up/beautification if it’s a subplot or customization option at a salons and parlors (fillers and such).
Funny how some people forget that makeup exists.
Plot twist .... lucia will be voiced by cardi b
As a girl who wears makeup and knows the power of it, I’m saying this is 99% Lucia given the matching of beauty marks and her face overall
Everyone saying the bikini girl’s chest is bigger: it’s a Rockstar game set in the plastic surgery capital of the US. I would honestly be more surprised if you couldn’t get her a boob job.

Also she has the same hoop earrings you can see on Lucia in multiple scenes.
I don't understand why people are saying that isn't her, it veryy clearly is. I'd bet the farm on it.
Hear me out. Compare boobies in this pic with the last scene where they both are in bed. Look at those boobs. They actually look smaller there
Lol like a true gta fan.. Pick and choose the evidence that supports your argument ignore all the rest.. All the other moles suddenly irrelevant..
Yeah, different hairstyles and makeup can do wonders. Know this mysefl
You know rockstar employees are laughing their asses off at these debates
I always thought it was Lucia. And was surprised by the debate lol
Lips don't match.
Yep, that's my baby. You can really tell by the nose too
I’ve been saying! The bikini moment is probably from her getting rich and partying from robbery’s
[deleted]
No it’s not. She doesn’t have the mole on the bottom right underneath her mouth.

And literally every scene she’s in she is in a tank top/prison or robbing a store.

Why would she suddenly be in a bikini with different coloured hair? It’s not her.
It seems the GTA community really lacks common sense
Smash
No. Moles are in different spots, and some moles are missing. Not her.
test disagreeable smoggy carpenter teeny apparatus attempt placid fade square

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
dude thats not her just give up, other than few twitter users and thirsty dudes no one says it, and i loved how to didnt show the mole thats on her chin
I mean why did people think it's not here in the first place? why would R* add another character that looks exactly like the protagonist in a 90 sec trailer. Also i don't see what exactly we've accomplished by proving it IS her lol
You can literally see a mole that sits under Lucia’s mouth missing from the model, it’s obviously not her
It's Lucia. Until the game comes out and proves me wrong, I'm gonna believe it's Lucia. The power of makeup, jewelry, clothing, accessories, etc. does wonders
[deleted]
I did not think it was her. But I’ve read through the arguments on here and now I concede that it might well be her. I don’t think it being or not being her will impact my experience of the game whatsoever.
what about the other two moles on her face by her lips?
[removed]
My gta 6 theory:

Bikini girl is Lucia undercover. The scene is gonna be something like this:

Lucia (to jason): Im gonna be undercover at this private party come and find me/help me

Jason (as the player) goes to the party and runs into the bikini girl

Bikini girl: Hello there handsome. (trying to get his attention with that pose)

Jason: Sorry but im already seeing someone.

Bikini girl: Look again Jason.

Jason: WTF? Lucia thats you!? I could not even recogniceze you. That look is incredible! What do you need me to do?

&#x200B;

Or im most likely wrong and just stupid. But hey might as well have fun with theories while we wait.
The moles Jason, what do they mean?!
Not all the imperfections on her face line up, plus an entirely different hairline
So, the moles under her lip just magically disappeared, then to reappear on her chest. It aint her. Sorry folks
When I first watched the trailer i thought it was. I didn't even think about it. I was just like "oh another shot of Lucia". But now with all the debates and with me watching the trailer as many times as i have now, I don't think it's her. She resembles her but I don't think it's actually her. Lucia has more moles on her face that aren't present on the other girl. Maybe it could be makeup that is covering the other moles but i don't think so. I know about the old leaks showing Lucia having a similar hairstyle too. It could be her don't get me wrong. It's kinda 50/50. Guess we'll see in 2025.
Pool girl has bigger breasts
No it’s not
Shes missing the ones on her cheek lmao its not her. The eyes are different. 
If it is her. Maybe customizable flat parties from gta online could be a thing.
Damn when's the hot coffee mod gonna drop?
Dude, this is 100% a mission where she gets dolled up and pulls of a scheme on some rich dude. How can folks not see that?
its not her, they dont even have the same jawline.
So we just gone look pass the 2 other beauty marks on her chin 
COPY
I doubt it because you can't see the rest of the moles

But at the same time is like. Why dude, why would they make this NPC so similar to Lucia even in the moles. 

And you see this hairstyle in the leaks

What I don't understand is: Is this a cutscene? Maybe for some mission? Why would Lucia pose like that? What is she doing, taking a video? A photoshoot? Is an exclusive animation for the trailer? 

There are many shots in this video that are just a mystery
She’s fine as fuck
I don't see her so much as posing for attention but just a gal that wants a certain life and she's a little off herself but she's just young and wants to Have fun, Jason is the one that's gonna have to pull her back
It’s crazy to me that you posted this, and decided to ignore all the other birthmarks on the left photo. 3 on her forehead, 2 more under her lips. But sure, it’s Lucia 😒
She's soo damn beautiful.😍
Yeh, acting as a distraction for something big
The girl on the Right is 100% the same person from the music video being filmed a couple of shots later. Where the two ladies are standing on the roof of the car. Same hairstyle, same glasses, same facial features.

So if this is Lucia, it would mean that Lucia is a famous Rapper/Musician.

I don't think it's lucia because of that but maybe I'm wrong.
mommy
She’s fiiinnee af😋
Why does this matter can I ask?

Been seeing alot about it.. Not sure what the issue is whether it's her or not
It’s very obvious is her lol, men discovering how makeup and dyed hair works
People must be blind if this is a debate
The graphics on the right looks straight up like GTA 5
I don't think so. The fact that it's not immediately obvious should answer that.
Yeah we know
Yes, it is
Bozos
All I care about is titties so if it’s her cool if it’s not her cool
Wouldn't the other moles be there? The ones under and to the side of her lip
Why are people trying to debate so hard that it’s not her? 

Why would rockstar add a character that looks so similar in our first ever look at the game
I mean is it not obvious it’s to show off customization? But Jason looks bland Asf obviously she’s the main focus but what happened to the red neck look he just looks generic🤷🏽‍♂️
Why is this even a debate lmfao didn’t she have the same hairstyle in the leak where she had that dress on
Edited?
Don’t understand how many of yall were so adamant that this wasn’t Lucia.
oh yeah ig she looks different cus in the 2nd one her hair is done and she got makeup on n stuff
Doesn't matter busted to both
This Lucia looks closer to the leak with her in the black dress. Similar hair minus the half braids.
mama mia
i love her
😍
in another angle the one under her nose is in a different spot
Boink
Her hairstyle was in the leaks, definitely her
So a History of going up?
JFC. This is what we’ve come to? “She doesn’t have a mole on her left titty” you know it’s a fake person? Completely made up video game person. Who gives a shit if the cover person is the main character and if they have a mole on their titty. 2025 can’t come soon enough if this is already what you’re on, touch grass

No this is not her
So of all the moles on her face, she just decides to not cover those 2 with makeup?  Her eyebrows are a different shape too.  Plus this was taken from a montage of random NPC's.  This is NOT Lucia.
[deleted]
No moles on her chin tho?
Gonna just circle those moles and conveniently ignore the 3 chin moles that aren’t there. Lmao
Nobody mentioning Dan Houser retired?

This makes me feel that it will never be the same again.

From what I saw, it's some kinda mix of Farcry or Modern Warfare and the Crew.

I still have high hopes...

It reminds me of what the story writers after Ian Fleming did for the James Bond franchise. They were very succesful.

I really hope this will happen to GTA, otherwise it's over!

Gameplay was always a bonus, it was hard, frustrating and sometimes impossible.

Having a gangster life is never smooth sailing, not even with a controller, a keyboard and a mouse, or a with a multi billion dollar company!

GOURANGA!
Could be a heist👀

It’s her 100%
[deleted]
Just like that shot in the trailer of her being recorded in the car. I think they go on missions trying to rise to the top and she’s gotta be a model
Man, I can’t wait to fight myself out of a heist mess-up situation in full bimbo string bikini outfit. This is going to be the weirdest action boner.
#TeamLucia
In the next scene she’s on the party yacht, so yes
She’s posing for a picture.
It's an allegory on social media and how insane women go for the right selfie
The objective of all games is basically for you to start at the bottom and over time move up in the life of crime, achieving lust and fame, which makes me think that this woman could be Lucia, after achieving this success.  All the NPCs that appear more "isolated" in the trailer seem to have a certain degree of relevance, this woman may not be Lucia, but why would the rockstar create an NPC so similar to her?
Possible, her chest looks a little bigger tho, and the bikini looks Main Character material.
 It could be one of the body variations from weight and exercise. She also had straight hair in one of the leaked clips.
lol this sub is gonna be wild for the next 2 years.  What if all of this is from some sort of pointless montage clip that will be in like the opening title card.  Everyone is diving in so fucking deep on a pre rendered announcement trailer.  Like come on.  We are all excited but not every frame of a trailer is filled secrets and Easter eggs.  I’m willing to even bet that 90% of this trailer will not even be scenes in the game and if they are it will be in an opening cutscene with the title card like I said.
Or she gets rich
I don’t even know how either, I immediately assumed it was Lucia. I don’t see where the confusion is, it looks just like her

About this particular scene: I took it as Lucia finally living a life of comfort and luxury with her ill-gotten gains
Biggest GTA masterdebate
I know they like being mysterious, but Rockstar should seriously confirm it at this point because I don't want us to spend the next year and a half fighting over this shit.
I WONT EVER believe that it's Lucia, look at all the moles on the Lucia's forehead on the left, blonde girl however is missing plenty---almost all of those on her forehead . YOU NEVER RED CIRCLED THOSE !


GET IT PEOPLE THE WHITE BIKINI GIRL IS NOT LUCIA !


When I first saw the blonde girl, the thought of her being Lucia never crossed my mind, I simply saw and believed that it's some random girl in Florida. You people exaggerate simplest of things way too much, c'mon it's not that deep , this won't help pass 2 years we must find something else 😭
This is a debate?? Are people *that dumb*? It’s the same character
Most sane post in this sub.
it's not her. debate is over
![gif](giphy|3oFzmc1StpUPOCtOtW)
You see past the conflict and stare straight into the truth
I think this basically confirms it’s her.
Lucia does have the exact same mole on her left side cleavage. You can see it in the shot where she is in the car with the cash
Could be makeup? Wouldn’t be surprising if rockstar put a feature like that in the game
It’s called makeup
and her body looks the same too
The big takeaway for me is the fact that she can really transform with makeup and hairstyle and accessories and clothing.

But yes, it looks like her face, and the small beauty marks *should* confirm any doubt.
Yeah.

The eyebrows are the same shape, the nose and lips are the same shape, the jaw is the same, the skin tone is the same, the hairline/forehead size is the same.

It's like some of y'all can't understand the concept of makeup + that a woman pushing out her chest in an exaggerated manner means her boobs look bigger.

"B-but the moles!!!" They can be easily hidden or added by makeup and lighting. Also moles can darken from sun exposure, which I'm assuming Lucia was when in prison/out in the yard in the Florida sun. Similarly in rdr2 Arthur being in the sun for too long gives him sunburn and a slight tan afterwards.
No she doesn’t though. Lips are different, eyebrows are different shapes. Eye colour is different. Not the same girl.
If the “she’s wearing more makeup for the party” argument won’t satisfy some, I would like to point out it’s very possible this trailer was edited together with scenes that were finished months apart and the character models hadn’t been and likely still aren’t 100% finalized. Arthur Morgan’s jaw shape changed noticeably from the first trailer you see him to the launch of RDR2.
Her hair looks pretty different, from the differences in her hairline on the right side, to the blonde streaks you can especially see on her right
Either that or bikini woman is her long-lost twin sister...
The only possible reason I can think of that says that bikini girl and Lucia aren't the same is where bikini girl shows up in the trailer.

She is put in the middle of the clips showcasing NPC life in Vice City. The trailer seemed to show story/character moments beginning and end.

But that might be a stretch.
Plus in the leaks when she wore a black dress her hair looked exactly like this.
Cosmetic surgery confirmed.
It’s called make up girls will cover their entire face in make up and then add any markings they had on their natural face back with makeup.

Or they will add a mark they don’t have because they like it.
Makeup
Might be a small oversight. But apparently leaked files show it is her.
Makeup
I think the opposite. She will earn money and will be in high circles with Jason later in the story, receiving more interesting offers.
Maybe everybody here is dumb as hell because they prolly gonna nix all of what y’all are saying and introduce makeup and advanced customizations to the game. Like this shit is available on GTA Online already so it wouldn’t be a far fetch idea. Y’all kinda yapping though bout the flashback or time skip shit
It is also possible that she got plastic surgery.
Yep pretty sure that’s Jason driving too
Femboys confirmed
lol I can’t believe this is a debate.
Ah yes the only girl to wear hoop earrings in Florida
Yeah like some other guy in this thread said, I'm not looking forward to a year or more of this debate
that's what i thought too
It’s her cousin and a big gameplay feature will be her constantly calling you to ask to go bowling.
Wait for the "It's the lens" replies. Fr they so stupid.
If she's undercover for a robbery it would make sense to wear contacts with different color eyes, just like she changed the color of her hair.
There are more similarities than differences. I lean towards it being her but of course anything is possible, we don't have any confirmation yet.
Have you ever heard of “makeup”?
Lip filler
It’s super faint and hard to see but pretty sure you can make out the back of the same necklace when she’s standing in the convertible. Also has the earrings in that scene.
This is a serious comment. Wow.
Apparently alot of people in this sub don't realise that bras and bikinis push up boobs so they look bigger....
I mean. Weird it is to say but not everyone's breasts may appear the same size with clothing on.
thought the same xD
I have sisters that wear makeup all the time, sometimes moles on their face are visible when they have makeup on, other times they aren’t. Moles can also fade as you get older so it could very well be that the second image is a younger Lucia before she’s in jail. It can also just easily be a stylistic choice by rockstar to have a few moles be present and defined whilst Lucia has makeup
have you heard of makeup smart guy?
She DOES look like Lincoln, I said this in another thread. That shot in that backseat, they could be brother and sister
Yeah, they’ve just cherry picked what they want to make a point 

Funny that
They'll say it's makeup that conveniently doesn't cover those moles. I've just read a comment saying that glamour girl has blue eyes because she's wearing contact lenses on a heist setup.
makeup
Maybe because the bikini is making them look bigger.
Its her and you are dumb
The clip on the balcony is way too fast and the angles are way too out of place to even make a judgement on the jawline. She couldve had her hairline changed, you're forgetting that GTA is about building a criminal empire from the ground, wouldnt be surprised if she built her sexiness up along with it. And the thickness of brows can be changed with makeup. It's 100% her, how is this even a debate
Are you guys trolling? She obviously has a different hairstyle hence your first point is irrelevant. The second point you made is literally dumb, she is pursing her lips, hence a different jaw size (see picture attached below). The third point you made is literally just makeup, my god, have you never seen a girl with makeup in your entire life?

I think you're right. The way the hair is parched is completely different. This isnt her.
Plastic surgery is definitely going to also be in it
M.a.k.e.u.p
That's your baby?
[deleted]
If it's her she got rich and got a boob job
>Why would she suddenly be in a bikini with different coloured hair? It's not her.

Did you forget customization and outfit changes exist 💀
Except it's not just the mole, the biggest giveaway is the nose. Lucia has a wider and flatter nose. The face shape, jawline and mouth are all different aswell imo. It's a random npc.
Yep, just ignore those. The different shape nose too.
Agreed, the nose, jawline and mouth are different. Hell even the skin tone, It also wouldn't even make sense for her to appear at that part of the trailer, it's just a random npc like the many others that showed up
Not everyone 🫤
Don't know why this is getting downvoted. There's been like 5 posts clarifying this is Lucia.
Lip moles are a pretty popular makeup thing for latinas
I’ve heard of women distracting guards like this for heists so it’s possible
Or it could be a flashback of her past life before going to jail
Heist would be cool
I seriously hope that the obsession with heists won’t be brought over from V to VI.
I hope not... I'm so sick of heists..
Yes I guessed that too. The one driving is Jason.
? how does this suggest it’s her 100%?
They need to work on her a little more npcs look more real than her wtf 😭
🔥👌
My guess is that it’s the blonde woman in the background, and she either has something to do with the man on the yacht -or- she might even turn out to be one of the main villains in the game… while a female protagonist draws in headlines, could they be doubling down and having a female nemesis as well?
It's Miami....Jason and Lucia can do a couple's OnlyFans to make extra money.
This is the most random thing I've seen in this whole thread
Every woman doesn't want to be a model 😂😂
That’s a weird point to make. 

One of the Grand Theft Auto V trailers straight up showed an end-game scene slightly changed. 

I think you’re being silly. Let people imagine and talk about it. We’re excited and that’s what this forum is for.
it’s not pre rendered 🤦🏾‍♂️
I think you’re rather silly
It’s one years and change.
There’s normally a random big titty bikini lady in the promos 

It’s usually not a main character 

I think that’s why. I didn’t notice this, but I actually do agree it seems to be  Lucia after this post.
I thought it was some random model girl, not Lucia.
I didn't recognize her as Lucia, it didn't look like her at first, maybe bcs her hair color and she was putting makeup 💄
In the end the models can just look similar, it happens
I think it’s her… that being said… if you guys are familiar with a games development then you would know that this trailer was not only put together by a team at Rstar but these could have been made at seperate times. Remember the RDR2 trailer? Not all characters stayed with the same exact look down to facial features and markings (beauty marks) when the game came out. So yes, two distinguishing features line up but there’s two that are not circled and not the same on both models. I think we just saw two different styles as far as character models go for Lucia. This is most logically the case. Outta the rabbit hole peeps lol
Don't worry bro, they don't know her like you and I do...
BOOBS are too big. Compare this pic to Lucia and Jason laying on the bed at the end. If it's Lucia, she had to have gotten a boob job at some point in the game.
mass debate
Nah it’ll be fine
Keeps the community busy till the release
there’s a thing called makeup
But if they were on the run why wouldn’t she dye her hair, chicks do that all the time
RemindMe! Two Years
I agreed the equivalent to the gta 5 girl
It’s her.Debate is actually over
I’ve looked at every shot of her in the black camisole top and don’t see any moles in any frame. I’ve all but given her a breast exam at this point.
but the mole right below her lip is not on bikini girl. nose is different, and top lip structure is different.
GTA fans really be looking and analysing cleavage’s for the lore
If you zoom in on her chin in the left pic, one of her moles is bigger and more elevated than the others, and on the right, that exact same spot is elevated. (They added shading and elevation texture for a mole, wtf...)

So it's her, just wearing makeup.
To conceal some but not all moles? Yea... that's 100% not a thing in the game.
People been sayin' bikini girls' tits are bigger. I feel like that's just their crotch talking and not their brain.
Long lost cousin. Eyyy Lucia wanna go bowling???
It isn't.
then why wouldnt they cover ALL of the moles?
as a foundation fein who erases my moles to then draw a select few back on you’re right!! so it could be possible. though i doubt rockstar would go through the mess to implement her doing that lmao i’m pretty sure its a different person or an accidental oversight
why would a video game add this feature though.. seems a bit unnecessary for a game like gta
Finally someone gets it
Then why are other left? And I can't even see the right one, above the lips.
Exactly what I thought too. The pic on the right might be later in the game when we’d level up financially etc
I was thinking it could be some sneaky stuff, like posing as a rich couple to scout a potential heist
Agree with this assessment. GTA is all about working your way up. From petty criminal to criminal mastermind.
There's like absolutely no way the jail scene is from later in the game right?
You guys are telling on yourselves 😂 that sidepart hairstyle she's got in the rooftop shot is out of fashion today but you saw a lot of women with it in the 2010s. it's gonna be a flashback
I think a lot of people are influenced by fake leak back in the day, that doesn't seem to match this game anymore. Where they stated the game would go through different decades
Yeah maybe Michael got fucking plastic surgery and became Lucia. After all, he likes the weather
nah that'a Jackson & Lupita according to some 🤣
I mean  they áre similar. The thing is, there are so many birthmarks that don't match, it's 99% not the same person for me. And it would make for a "Hmpf, my sister always had it so easy, always the attention from the boys" kinda story. Later to find out she's actually in trouble and the criminal sister has to help miss popular out. 

You've heard it here first.
Assessing eye colour behind purple tinted glasses, you can’t make this up
Are you actually being serious?
Jesus Christ
we'll probably have no confirmation ever, seeing as balcony girl is most likely just an NPC used to show off the culture of vice city frfr
why hasn't she applied it to her moles then?
I’ve never heard of selectively patching some of your face and randomly not applying to the other parts of the face
Its a gaming sub, they probably think women pee out the same hole
Another thing is the face shape. Lucia face is a little bit fuller compared to the slimmer face of the bikini girl. But you could be right, maybe this is a flashback scene or something.
did you even read the what they said smart guy?
Not too fast at all… you can clearly see her jaw. You can’t change hairline like that on the side, it grows like that naturally. It’s totally consistent in every other shot of her, yet in this ONE it’s different. It’s not brow thickness either - it’s the shape, arch and width. On top of that, the balcony clip feels very out of place if it IS her… the way she’s behaving doesn’t sit right against her demeanour and attitude in the others. Lucia very much strikes me as a strong woman with her own mind who would not bow to those sexy stereotypes that the balcony model clearly represents, unless she’s putting on an act for some reason, but it doesn’t come across that way. But unless R* confirm it, we’ll be waiting over a year to settle this.
Are YOU trolling? She is not grimacing or pulling any kind of extreme facial expression in either shot. Normal face, normal expression, completely different jawline in both. You also don’t understand hair if you think that’s a “style”… there is hair growth in a place where it is absent in another. That’s not hairstyling. The eyebrow also is not makeup… it’s her eyebrow shape and proportions which clearly differs. Her eyes are also a different colour… find me tinted glasses which changed brown eyes to blue.
Trust me, you don't change the shape of your lips with makup. They are totally different. This is not the same person.
Obviously, but in the first trailer for the game? I don’t think so. That’s not something they do. Go back and look at all the other trailers rockstar have released. Do the main characters have entirely different physical features at any point? No.

Also how about you explain why she has moles in entirely different places and a different sized chest? It’s not her.
A lot of people seem intent on insisting it's not her.
If that's the case then hopefully we're able to flash our tits or something, only so that we can create a larger distraction though of course
I like the episode of Burn Notice where Fiona couldn't distract the guard enough because 'she wasn't his type' as he tells her to her face and she gets legit angry and stomps on his foot with her high heel lolol
yea i thought too
Yes it's him too. I'm really intrigued about Jason character, I think he will be very interesting
I think it might be her in the car because I think the driver is Jason I probably sound ridiculous lol but I was watching the trailer earlier at 0.25 speed and you can see the driver look over and he has that same pronounced bridge on his nose 🤣 I'm in tin foil hat territory
I predict them doing missions where she does classy modeling or acting idk just me
The hair the body the vibe it's her! That lines at the beginning of the trailer told me everything I need to know about her
[deleted]
I can’t wait to see what onlyfans is called in the game
Not model, but rather social media influencer
But that’s what the posing and the taking photos implied for me lol
Rags to riches
I highly suspect there will not be anywhere near the amount t of NPCs in gameplay as there was in that trailer
> There’s normally a random big titty bikini lady in the promos

> It’s usually not a main character 

Well they would need to have a lady main character in the past for this to mean anything.
Also from the vibes I get from Lucia it’s hard to see her in this situation, but of course we know nothing about her atm really
now that we know npc's are super unique and not copy pasted like crazy, I bet we can actually find the cover girl on the beach this time. maybe she'll be one of the big social media stars
It’s us. We were the big titty bikini lady the whole time. My dreams have been realized.
That’s big titty?
There were 3 big titty bikini lady in this trailer, 5 actually, arguably.
This is where I was at.  I had no idea people were assuming this was Lucia.  I figured it was just one of the GTA girls.  I STILL do not think it's Lucia.  Different lips and noses.
I have a hard time believing Rockstar would be sloppy enough to put two different models for the same character in the premiere trailer of their biggest release ever.
I could still see it being her, that shot on the bed was at a weird angle to fully tell (also lmao we're the boobvestigators). And boobs in bikinis can look bigger then they really are at a good angle and lighting.
Her pose pushes her chest out though…🧐
Dr Miami or Dr Leonida or Dr Mi-YaYo is probably in this game as well for human customs
It IS based in Miami
DUDE!! i know i'm really stretching it, but what if this was a scene after she got plastic surgery after she was caught on cameras in a previous heist. like so she can hide from the authorities. and this is her flaunting her new body around everyone and celebrating that she got away with the heist. she is wearing a luxury bikini after all.
When wearing a t-shirt or something, it's not like when wearing a bra
Plastic surgery confirmed in GTA6? Hmm, maaayybbeee😁🙂
Gameplay spoiler. Boob job is a thing in this game.
Lol, Padded bikinis exist.
First time in my life i heard someone complain that the boobs are too big. Then again, i didn't continue to read what you wrote.
Man do you know what gravity does to boobs when you lay down?
I bet you'll be able to get a boobie job, why not ey. Would also be cool if everyone starts off with the same physique which changes over time based on how active or lazy you are. I'd work my glutes out everyday if it meant I got to grow a massive booty. And if you don't log into the game frequently you'd lose your gains and worsen your stats, that'd be good haha. The body builders would only be the dedicated ones that play the game every day
Masturbate
then what about the other ones shown in the picture? She left out makeup on only a few moles but completely covered the other? I swear people just WANT this to be her because they cant keep it in their pants lol
Not her, nope. We’re done here.
I've been forced to look at balcony girl so many times I could vomit
Check your dm and you’ll see it for yourself
Jesus Christ, go outside guys
Also can’t really get a good look but pretty sure she doesn’t have blonde in her hair
The games still being developed and characters will always be tweaked, they’ll probably look different again when the game is released
Nah, I do think the tits look bigger on bikini girl. But she's also in a different pose that we haven't seen Lucia in before - leaning back like that stretches the bikini out a bit and probably makes them look bigger. I think that white bikini also just kinda makes them look bigger somehow... I'm starting to believe that this is Lucia, but was certain it was not her yesterday.
I mean the boobs are objectively bigger.
Tits look bigger in bikini than normal shirts. I think make Lucia inside the instagram models world will take another type of missions, something like administrate social medias, feed it with posts of landscapes, aleatory events or some silly things... but it could be just a specific mission too.
I love this community 😂😂😂
It's possible.

But... I think it's Lucia. Of course anything is possible but at this time, bikini girl is Lucia.
Bro look at Marlyn Monroe, she always kept her mole when applying makeup, they’re called beauty spots!
I kinda disagree. You obviously know the effort and skill that it takes to draw them back on much better than I do. I kinda disagree because I think that’s just how detailed Rockstar is that they would take into consideration what a character dislikes about themselves. Rockstar is a company that prides themselves on story and detail.
GTA V has makeup already, and its a good addition to make your character feel more personal to you
Before and after of Arthur is a good contender, maybe they force her appearance.
Good to see the ladies back me up on this.

I only really know of the trick because of Marina and the Diamonds she would put a heart shaped Monroe mark as remember it which obviously has to be makeup because it’s a perfect heart. But thinking back to it it’s a beauty mark and a Monroe piercing not a Monroe mark lol
Yea if it's her this is definitely an undercover mission
She has an ankle bracket on in the cover photo so I'd bet you start the story in jail, similar to Yankton, and then get released and the game turns into your life while on parole
Lmao so it’s impossible it’s her because the hairstyle is not on fashion anymore? Also the game doesn’t come out up until 2 years from now, fashion could easily change.
Why did I move here? I guess it was the bussy surgery
Lucia’s looks and Michael’s personality? That’s wild. I would tap that.
Nah it’s 100% a light bright blue, you can tell if you zoom in
...yes? Those two characters look pretty damn identical, she's just wearing makeup and trying to conceal her identity. Also, have you ever played a fucking Rockstar game? Why wouldn't you be able to customize your hair and makeup?

Are you guys really that shocked that Lucia looked less attractive while literally in prison than she might if she were like halfway through the game with thousands of dollars? Good lord, don't tell on yourselves like this. Some of us have been around women.
The game will come out and then we will know.
Wait....

Girls don't pee out their ass?
men legitimately think make-up changes your entire facial structure.
Insane copium
**BONK**
Makes perfect sense
go to horny jail

You got me on this 😂
K y s
I also thought that
I didn't think there was any debate over that car scene being Lucia and Jason
I like to think it’s gameplay of Jason taking her out on a date activity. They could really pull off some cute shit ala John and Abigail’s awesomely wholesome marriage proposal. 

After the dynamic stuff NPCs could do during travel in RDR2, I have high hopes that these talking scenes will feel more immersive than just characters sitting and moving their hands every once and awhile.
Thinking it could be a flashback thing, pre-arrest.
All Air Conditioners AAC
lonelyfans? 

may almost be too close to the real thing. lonelystans?
It's 100% Lonely Mans
HornyMans!
Have you ever played GTA before. I'm 99% sure the MC's are going to despise people like that.
I believe she uses social media to cover up for all the crimes she will get into.
guess we’ll just have to see. rockstar have never been one to show us something in a trailer that we aren’t going to experience, they’ve never “falsely advertised” through a trailer before & i don’t see them doing that now
We had Trevor in a nightgown...close enough 😄
Give me Tommy vercetti with huge tits
I was thinking pulling a con on some rich people
ehh in the animation she goes into the pose a little awkwardly, even glancing at the camera like "am i doing this right?"

maybe its a mission where she needs to go onto that fake bezos' ship and needs to post thirst trap IG pics to get a pass in or something and you'll have QTE shit like GTA5 yoga, except ur now doing horndog poses and jason (who's taking the pics) keeps making fun of her or something like in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table. 

tldr; ya she hot we all down bad
I dunno man, they did it even as far back as since IV, it wouldn't be too odd.

Also, make up is a thing, it could very well just be that.
Good boobvestigation
Yes I think you’re correct
Yeah I think this is probably correct
You rang?
Who knows. I think it’s possible, even if unlikely
We can still dream!
Reading comprehension is dead lol
Maybe you should've continued to read, I'm not complaining at all...? I'm just pointing out that the boobs seem bigger on the white bikini girl.
she's not laying down in the clip i'm talking about, jason is, but Lucia is sitting up on top of him. I do know that boobs can look different at certain times, I'm not the only one noticing this. I do think this is probably Lucia in the white bikini, but this is a debate for a reason. There are noticeable discrepancies.
Masturdebate
yeah they’re reaching for the stars lmfao it’s so obviously not her…
There’s a reason why some moles are referred to as “beauty marks,” and some just aren’t. In case you weren’t aware, some women accentuate some
of their moles, and choose to cover up others with makeup.
I dont know much about prison but I highly doubt they allow you to be wearing makeup. At a balcony hot tub party I can see a more likely scenario for there to be makeup
Actually you're mistaken, it's her. Now we're done here.
It’s hard work but someone’s got to do it.
You on it, I stand corrected
You should DM everyone in this thread, they are really adamant bikini girl is not Lucia smh
Why not just post the image? Anyway, I'd like a DM
send me. I need to be convinced
I need proof
I wanna see
It’s almost as if she might’ve changed her hairstyle or something, what a ludicrous feature that would be in a rockstar game
It's not Lucia. Swimsuit girl has moles in locations Lucia doesn't.

They aren't even the same skin tone.
[deleted]
One word homie. Bra.
You didn't play gta 4 did you brother? Roman wants to talk to you
The period details in the 2004 flashbacks were subtle but very effective in V, including the character's hairstyles. If they were going to flashback to the 2010s in VI, i would expect them to follow a similar playbook.
![gif](giphy|Y4jGnkLhC1kcV9k3po|downsized)
Because rockstar don't change their MC appearance for trailers. You sound like an absolute loser adding the line 'some of us have been around women' I've probably been with my 'woman' longer than you've been alive bucko.

It's not her. Birthmarks are different and glamour girls boobs are twice the size.

Plus her being wedged into the middle of the segment showing NPC life and vice city culture? Nah. Go be round women little man.
You’re reaching. Rockstar don’t do this kind of thing in their trailers.
Ikr. Then why they pee sitting? 🤔
I understand, there are some differences but they are similar enough that it's more likely they are the same character than not.
i’ll only be ok with this as long as jason gets to hang dong
I bet someone already prompting ai to make a porn of her and jason
“A female protagonist is very sexy, we can even see her naked with no clothes.”

  - cyberpunk2077 devs
Taking away the female protagonist because y'all can't behave
No u
GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE

/s
That’s a really good take actually! Like she misses the old her or she’s telling Jason where she used to be in life
HVACfans
How about ShowingFans
GTA V had some stuff about this level of on the nose so I wouldn't be surprised.
LonelyHands
People forgetting that rockstar got Red Dead 2 to run on PS4 in 2016 lmao. They know what they're doing
Trevor in a nightgown is my star sign.
The perfect Disney princess doesn't exis.....

Lame ass tryna be shittymorph smh
Man I miss shittymorph
Boobservation
Guys stop... exacerbating.. 🤣
You guys are being really silly. Keep in mind that left image is her in prison with no makeup living rough while the right image is probably some way into the game with thousands of dollars, enough to afford a luxury bikini and fancy makeup. It's obviously her.
I'm very hard for one.
I did post them and with a lot of proof but my post was removed saying “there already have been too many discussions about it”. Meanwhile a lot of the posts about the same thing has been up.
I hope I can give them both hockey mullets.
and the mole removal too you reckon? Clutching at straws now little fella
True
Except the hair looks like it could be modern...
Thanks for proving my point, fatlord
Why would that matter, Rockstar haven't had a woman lead in one of these games before. Rockstar don't show twerking in their trailers either, it's a new game with a different emphasis.

Also consider how much emphasis the trailer is putting on different effects on people's skin: mud, beach sand, spray tan, sunscreen, etc.
Oh no bud we’re on the same side. I meant isane copium for the people who are intent on not believing it’s her even with the more the enough proof
That's how you will fast travel into the jail
The Gang Goes to Vice City to Confirm Jason Hangs Dong
(Old Man voice) I remember when *real* artists were out there making porn of characters within a day of their reveal...
Of course, there is literaly a 14 year old child in Far Cry 4 that is featured in porn.
Trevor in a nightgown is my totem animal.
Damn really had to double check the username, thought I finally saw him in the wild
Examasturdebating
Damn, the mods are useless as usual
Oh no please
That’s a little cringe calling me little fella. You sound like a stereotypical fake tough guy who can’t fight trying to intimidate someone. Anyway makeup is a thing. She’s clearly wearing it in that scene
Brilliant response. No rebuttal just a nonsense comment.
And they are showing all those effects on NPCs. During a montage sequence of the Vice City atmosphere/life.

She’s an NPC.
Yeah, for sure. IDK why. Perhaps some people don't like the idea of playing as a woman in a bikini...?
Oh...that's disheartening
he's still active i think, like shitty watercolor still pops up unexpectedly once in a while too
Yeah see at this point it’s really easy to determine you are always wrong about everything. So now you are saying shes put makeup over that one mole and not the other two? And got an upper lip job as well? Clutching at straws little fella.
I think I saw a new one from him just a month or two ago
Actually I’m usually right about most things ask anyone. There are literally products that enhance “beauty marks” after applying foundation. And what are you talking about upper lip job what makes you think that. Lucia is posing and pouting her lips in that shot
Yeah see when you have to put it out there that you are ‘actually usually right’ about stuff that doesnt look good for you at all buddy, you’ve infact been hideously wrong most your life and now have to keep telling yourself you are right as a coping mechanism.
This has to be the Cutest [Hail] in all of Starfield.
I’ve been endlessly searching for Hostile Activity among the settle systems and stumbled across these sweet people.
BRING MORE MONEY.

Sounds like my kid lol.
This and Grandma. Are my favorite encounters so far.
“So anyways, I started blasting.”
Seems like a crimson fleet trap to me. Better not take any chances. *missiles locked*
i stumbled onto them while i was teabagging ecliptic and i've been searching for them ever since. easily one of the best and most wholesome random space encounters in the entire game, i'll gladly fork over 500,000 credits to buy more of that kid's orange-flavored lemonade.
Is her name DEEZER
I haven’t run into them yet, but I can’t wait.
"that's not lemonade"

me: *instant panic*
Aww that's cute...\*arms missiles\*
Ran into her for the first time yesterday.  Playing a pirate run since Constellation isn’t there.  Still didn’t have the heart to give her less than 500.
awwww "quick save" pew pew pew
Awww that’s so sweet! I was so upset the other day because I was in the middle of jumping when “grandma” hailed my ship to invite me to dinner. But it jumped before I could talk to her! The other wholesome one O have found is the Irishman on the Valentine. Loooove him.
*sigh* time to teach them why they shouldn’t hail strangers..
Oh can’t wait to blow this up
Ugh this encounter kills me, especially the "they grow up so fast line" since I became a father earlier this year. Gotten the encounter twice and I smash that 500cred button.
So can you take out engines and raid them?
I know what I have to do, but I don't think I have the strength to do it
Mag dump missiles. Dang kids think they can sale lemonade (Aurora) in my sector. Not today kiddo.
I got this yesterday. Was wholesome and a nice change
I'm going to need you to drop all your cargo
Little girl: [Give me money.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxpkIVaYcfw&ab_channel=JeriAnnSoper) Money me, money now. Me a money needing a lot now.
if you board the ship its just a pervert alone scamming people
I killed them. I blew up their ship
The valentines is even cuter!
Sounds like a trap. Would have blown that bad boys to smithereens.
Never got that encounter, got grandma 5 times in a row tho.
400 hours played and never saw this. 

Always wonder just how much stuff I'm missing in a game.
So cute…
*shoots them out the sky*
Sounds like she has one of those tooth adjuster device in her mouth when she speaks. Or she's just very young.  A shame the translation will give her the voice of any other kid in the game
Aww
Ngl, this hits me hard every single time.
The little girl sounds abit like B.E.M.O from adventure time
I've never seen that random encounter after 180 hours in the game.
*pirate role players fighting their innate urge to start blasting*
I've had the school teacher one like five times now. Nice to know there's more to look forward to.
Man, those specs on your ship!!!! Lol
The moment the kid said 500 I tried to blow up the ship but it didn’t let me, didn’t even have a moment of self reflection until I saw this.
I just got the Indian voice asking me to extend my warranty
The way I'd so quickly open fire 🤣
[ ATTACK ] ENOUGH TALK, PREPARE TO BE BOARDED!
I turned them into space dust
I was waiting for the part where you blast them and take their credits.
Thought it was a pedophile
Wait did he stiff you on the oj too?! 😂
He  can have all my credits here's 600000 kid
Wow a new one , very cool
[Attack]
I killed them
BLAST EM
I have a fantastic option if you’d like a refund but would LOVE to keep the orange juice 🤠
"I'll pay 500 credits for lemonade"

-dad: that's orange juice

[Target lock acquired]
Thanks, now prepare to be boarded
It might have been, if it were voiced by an actual child. Any time I hear children who are clearly voiced by adult women in media it COMPLETELY takes me out of the game/movie/whatever.

Cute idea but execution is disappointing.
No one feels like that dude is talking like a creeper?
Cute? That was so creepy. That guy sounds like a serial killer
has anyone dusted the ship?
Is that Carl Sagan as the dad?
I bumped into them too 🤣
This was one of my favorites.
200 hours in and I’ve never encountered this one.
Are they licensed? Lemme see some paperwork!
I should *really* buy an Xbox and Starfield just for this part
Have you met Grandma yet?
These money sinks just keep getting more and more sinister.
As a dude whose kids are all grown up, this bit made me choke up. Guess I’m feeling that empty nest thing.
It's so cute!

For me, the best one are the tourists who go to Neon and hail you to ask a "real captain" about what it's like to be a captain. :)
So anyway, I started blasting!
Even on my evil run I could not attack this ship 🥲
Man I literally just encountered this one for the first time around the time you posted this.
So I'm not the only one that have painted my ship like an X-Wing. Hats off sir.
It's a spy. Blow em up
LMFAO i know EXACTLY why they chose to make them warp out as soon as the conversation was over
Weapons to full power
The family ship should have had a containment failure at the end and blew itself up. Just for the emotional impact.
I never met this ship but I hope it's one of the most deadly, well armed ships in the galaxy just to blow away all these psychotic weirdos who want to kill a little girl.
wepaons free..open fire
That was cute.
The missile knows where it is, and where it isn't, and where it isn't is in possession of lemonade. Solution: The missile will change it's location to last known location of lemonade.
Got this encounter on my evil pirate play through, I just couldn't do. Being evil is hard
Board and kill. Jk Star field probably wont let us.
Wholesome content
"All power to weapons"
There should be an "I HATE LEMONADE!1! [ATTACK]" option.
That’s the cutest thing I’ve seen in a game ever. I have 440hrs into the game and haven’t experienced this yet.
I haven’t seen this before in any of my playthroughs, but GODDAMN did that just make me tear up a little. Two daughters of my own, and I just had flashbacks to being in the same position as that dad in the ship.
imagine declining the hail and blowing up the ship immediately without knowing who was onboard
*[Piracy]*
Shoot their engines. Space the crew. Take the lemonade
Blow it up
Plot twist: the ship is a 100 years old derelict with no one on board. Makes that kid’s laughter sound creepy and unsettling.
Haven’t met them yet! 😭
Someone needs to mod in the ability to rob the ship and then blow it up for the lols.
That is freakin adorable.
The crazy thing is, I would’ve either boarded the ship for proof then killing the capt or just shot it up without a care. My character (zion) don’t care bout nothing since leaving his universe…..
Ferengi energy just right there
Wholesome
I’m gonna assume that this kid has the same hair as Sona and Cora
No lemonade after I paid 500 credits? ::Locks on target::
I haven’t run into them but I’ve seen the guy singing shanties three times. I love him.
I bought the hell out of that "lemonade" without hesitation.
I like the bard hail
"This lemonade tastes like SHIT"

*Targeting mode activated*
*Hull: Critical Hit*
I got the one about ships extended warranty and blasted them to shit so fast they couldn’t even respond. 

It was satisfying
I feel like my game just bugged itself as I fly ships more than anything I do and have been to every system and spend the whole game flying around and I havnt seen any of the things people post here aside from warranty man. None of the legendary ship battles. Not this. Not grandma. Nothing cool. I cant be just that unlucky I am missing everything by chance right?
When I found out that I paid 500 credits for a box of orange juice, I was like “Oh you’re gonna get it. You *and* your cute kid. You better jump. You better fucking jump”. They jumped. Lucky bastards.
C-can you shoot em down?
Skipped to the end, was reaaaaally expecting their ship to be debris
*Target Lock
I adore this encounter and always give the girl her 500 credits. Her excitement warms the empty void my heart should be.
The one where I got hailed by a space tour bus full of kids was also pretty cute.
Imagine if the video ended with the player blowing the ship up after that wholesome encounter 💀
Teeheeteehee next thing completely blown away lol I’d have to do it
I got this in my first play through and I swear it was the cutest thing ever, then I went and murdered a bunch of spacers to make up for the 500 credits I paid the little girl
Just too adorable...
Ah, so there are lemons on board… excellent. Target engines with main weapons and prepare for boarding action.
Waiting for the "The lemonade is a lie" shirts on Amazon.
I encountered "Grandma" a few days ago and it was so cute!  She invites you in for some food and a chat.  That's it!
Why can't I find hails like that all I get are extended warranty doushbags.
That's awesome lmao
Destroy them!  So annoying
I would have blown them out of the stars!!!
BLOW OUT OF THE SYSTEM!!!
Had this encounter the first time to jumped to jemison
I got a pranked by a Uranus joke in one event, he then jumped systems immediately
Out of curiosity I'll try to blast this one out of the sky when I encounter it
Five hundred for orange juice?! Nah. All stations open fire.
My instincts tell me it's 100% a ruse. I don't trust em.
Dude I fuckin' cried. 

I don't even have kids, but damn this hit something.
My favorite was the arguing married couple. Dude was lost but wouldn’t admit it 😂 Also the geologist with the lame jokes and the faulty ship
Never had that encounter, but really heartwarming indeed
I can't believe this garbage is in a bethesda game
Voice acting doesn't sound great in this game
If you board it, it'll prob be a crew of level 2 UC staff just like the Valentine...and not a singer among them....not that I've raided the sweet shanty man..😐
Man, y’all getting these interesting hails? Best I got was the nice gay couple who needed help. They had a nice ship. Usually I get nothing.
I blew them to smithereens
It's too wholesome
Ran into this encounter on the weekend. Have her 509 credits and got a big smile from it. Totally with it
Yet it didn't even got nominate in game awards. This 10/10 GAME RIGHT THERE!!!!
I loved this random encounter absolutely wholesome 💕❤️
That's great. Love these nice little touches in the game.

Nice ship BTW.
Ah it's a scam, open fire immediately!
I would had blown up the space ship and stole everything I'm built different 😭
Well I know what I’m doing today. Haven’t come across this one yet. I swear they put some of these in and time gate them to only spawn after certain dates. Seems like that’s why new ones keep getting found. Or they just don’t publish them in the update notes.
I gave her so much money lol
Piracy: all the lemonade now.
Destroy it
Time to annihilate the ship out of existence…all hands on deck!!
Haven't run into that one
  *Targets their engines*
can you destroy the ship? cuz if you can I'm blowing it up when I encounter it lol
Y'all are so negative. I'm choosing to believe that it's a loving dad and his kid. There's gotta be some light in the depths of space. It isn't all dark and dreary and corrupt.
Andreja: "Are you sure that is the best use of your money?"
The budget cruise liner hail was funny. One of the best hails I've had so far.
I got this one. Gave the girl 500 for the 'lemonade'
Andreja liked that
The Mantis: You got a permit for this lemonade stand?

Little girl: no?

The Mantis: ... (Proceeds to blow up ship.)

The Mantis: FOR JUSTICE!!
Did you blow them to pieces...
*intrusive thoughts*

“Blow up the ship, see what happens”
Q u e s t i o n. . .

Since it says "little girl" that means there is a kid on board right? Would that make this ship indestructible?
That's also why I hate those little chat in space

They could definitely made a hologram chat or lagging video chat (to bring the NASA feel), no matter what is way better than voice only chat 300 years later 

X4 vid chat for example: https://i.imgur.com/xxi0wuX.jpg

Come on, even [game of 20 years ago have video chat](https://i.imgur.com/NY5rnnT.jpg)!
They could not have chosen a creepier sounding voice actor for the dad good lord
I’m 100% convinced this is a scam. There is no kid. Especially when they asked for a ridiculous amount of money
She sounds like a fallout 4 protagonist
It's moments like this that make it á truly great game in my opinion

Despite all its flaws, there are countless moments like these
I paid her whatever the highest option was.  She was tickled pink.
My best experience was with the teacher and class trip. First i've met them before I joined CrimsonFleet, and the second time was after I became pirate. And new lines in dialogue and the result made me laugh.
I almost felt bad killing grandma and searching her ship, but the quicksave was 47 seconds old.
For me, the best one are the tourists who go to Neon and hail you to ask a "real captain" about what it's like to be a captain. :)
I was *so* on edge during my Grandma encounter, lol. I could not be convinced that it wasn't a trick to get my guard down.
The one where you run into the marines again after ground pounder is pretty good just because a random marine grunt begs the CO to tell you high.
The Valentine too! I always stop and chill for a moment whenever I encounter him.
I always blast grandma out of the sky
The lone Scotsman singing a sea chanty is my favorite so far, it's hauntingly beautiful.
Those and the person flying the ship you built for Ecklund. They told me I suck at building lol so obviously they felt my wrath of automatic class C weapons
Conan Obrien blew up the Grandma lol.
Grandma is great. Gave her credits then robbed her blind included a credit stick upstairs with more credits on than I gave her originally!
Hah, I just ran into the grandma. Then the option to give her credits came up and I laughed and hit no. Then I snuck up to the cockpit and stole all the credits on her ship. Good times.
Sure, grandma was wholesome, I’ll give you that. This was a freaking scam though!
Yes grandma was awesome
I always visit grandma
https://youtu.be/KK8OEKXQkaw?si=DNXERNuTpJ4jJeQQ
And the school bus, as previously mentioned. Any others people can name?
Gotta reach that 30 ships destroyed milestone somehow.
Damn right.
I love, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia - Danny DeVito is the best!
LMAO
This killed me😂😂
the girl is clearly a grown ass woman
I wish I could give money to the homeless woman on neon. You can only give 25 credits a day. If you ask if she wants more she says once a day is fine don't want you to go poor. I have 2 million credits, sparing a couple hundred thousand won't hurt me
Fucking *love* orange juice, kid.
Wait, is it lemonade with orange flavor added? Or is lemonade made with oranges instead of lemons, which is usually just called orangeade.
#DEEZER NUTS
he would be proud.
At least lemons exist in starfield
Right, all I get is that lazy bitch scientist asking for ore.
this encounter really made me wonder how the fuck ship-to-ship trading works, anyway. do you connect up a snorkel tube and send bottles back and forth through it like a bank drive-thru? do you just huck shit out the airlock and hope the other guy catches it? is it some of that *grav tech cheating?*
“Okay, that explains the orange smell and taste.”
Can't speak for this encounter but I do know that the schoolkid space bus that needs 10 ship parts is completely intangible, probably because there are kids onboard. I assume this one is the same.
His dad had a better voice .. apparently.
Oh is that the accent? My brain was telling me Yorkshire for some reason. Always have time to listen to him.
Just like Conan did to Grandma.
I’ve two teenage daughters myself, and I couldn’t help but cry a little watching this clip, since it’s mimics a time I had with them when they were that age.

Like you, I’m gonna jam that 500 Cred button without hesitation.
No. They jump away as soon as you start shooting. just like the school bus with the "broken down" Grav drive.
Anakin, NO!
Do we know how many songs he sings? 
I’m always so happy when I find a new one.
When I attacked him and boarded I was surprised there were a few UC guards in there who attacked me, definitely wasn't expecting that
forget the others, I want to romance HIM
Braces?
Nobody is fighting anything bro, we just pop console commands and blast that shit out of the sky
That’s a little too sadistic for my taste, even for it being a game 🤔🤷‍♂️🫠
You rich b!tch 😆
😂
Seriously wtf. he's bone-chilling lol
1. That’s a Spanish accent 

2. Carl Sagan died in 1996
He's just Vinni, not Israel.
Not sure if it was actually a real girl even, might have been AI generated voice.
Get help
Someone should board them and find out
I agree completely, it's a scam.
500 credits is a ridiculous amount of money? lol
There should be an option to blow the ships.up instead of them disappearing.
500cr is worth the effort. Dammit I wanna be a Dad.
You should see the kids during Chinese New Year... this is totally normal behaviour.
500 credits?  
Dude thats like half a dollar irl
You can tell they're scammers. Orange juice? Really expect me to fall for that?
As a Ryujin Executive, she has the makings of a Ryujin Executive.
Or some Little Lamplighter con-person.
Same. With all its flaws, I still enjoy this game. Just need to put some time in the ship building.
I can't remember any encounters like this in Mass Effect.
I like the one where you answer their questions. I don't so much like the one where their space bus breaks down and they need **TEN FUCKING SHIP PARTS** to fix it.
Yep, the actually I am a pirate had me laughing for a bit.
If only there was pvp in the form of Starborn invasions... You and me?  We can't exist in the same timeline.  RIP to Grandma!  May she live on in the infinity!
exactly how I was, I docked with her ship ready to open fire
Fear of being tied up and assaulted by an elderly woman? Welcome to my life at 60 on SilverSingles.com
I commandeered  the Valentine last time he turned up singing his songs.   😂 I just wanted his guitar but the ship will do.
They deserved it.
But he felt bad about it afterward.
The couple that’s lost and asks you for directions.
Simulator was honestly the easiest quickest way to do that.
Just pop on over to Serpentis - there's always some Var'uun losers to blow to smithereens. They'll pop on over after 3-10 seconds to "ambush" you. Show them the error of their ways. Any planet or moon will have these losers show up, so keep flying around. One of the most fun ways to make an enormous amount of cash if you need it fast and don't like building outposts.

If you're feeling really spicy and you haven't progressed a certain SysDef quest chain yet, roll into Kryx and kill everything there. I do warn you that that place spawns a quite large number of Crimson Fleet ships and they can be quite high level.
I also love [show] and [quote] from [actor].
Lemonade is clearly a euphemism.
Imagine a game where you paying enough to a homeless character transforms their life and they end up end up be coming a major story character. Otherwise they never appear anywhere significant in the plot.
I was truly pissed that I couldn't buy her a SleepCrate.
i've been giving her credits every time i went to neon, now she gives nice little gifts in exchange.

it's a such a shame i couldn't even recruit her and giver her a home.
You can give 20K to the student girl in New Homestead to pay for her education.
Yeah and not whatever it was in Fo4
I keep getting people arguing over if hope tech or stroud ekland is better
Oh man, she can fuck ALLLLL the way off when she can't figure out how to end the transmission
She always seems to find me my first jump after dumping EVERY ROCK IN THE UNIVERSE off at my base for storage.
I assume it's just a "you dock, do the trade, and undock; we're just not showing it because it would get hella tedious very fast" thing.
That is what mods are for
I am honestly not from Ireland but am just basing that guess on what I have heard from tv so you might be right. Not sure. :)
Mid 30s here.  No kids.

If they stick around long enough for me to lock on, that's on them.
a few console commands and you can blow this ship to smithereens. always satisfying.
I’ve think I’ve heard at least 5 songs.
That!
I’ve played GTA too much.
Redditors when they see a good father. You guys are miserable.
I can’t stop thinking Vasco’s voice is based on Carl Sagan. Just some of the words he says and his cadence remind me of Sagan. Can’t find anything online that confirms it though
lmao i know he's dead. you act like no one has ever used his voice for anything since he passed.
But the voices get sad when I don't talk to them :(
Thats what i keep saying about the stranded school trip that wants 10 freakin ship parts to repair their hyperdrive or whatever!
lol, probably end up with that glitch you sometimes get where there are non-hostile security forces onboard shooting at you, and as soon as you fire on them all of a sudden your crew thinks you're complete scum.
Especially because he doesn't say it's not lemonade until after you already paid.  Space pirate me would've blown up their ship and then paid the bounty.
When you've got 1,000,000 credits, it's not that much. I'd ask for an Oreo on the side.
They need to be boarded!
Dark soul style invasion? That'd be awesome.

Have to remember, there's a universe (infinite amount of them technically) where Granny BTK'D me. Now I'm just Gung hoe taking them out. Before you ask, I know she did it... I helped. And constellation me, crimson fleet me, and UC me. Couldn't let the prime continue his journey. 

We kept his adoring fan though.
Starfield should have had an equivalent to the Wild Wasteland trait, and if you have it Grandma turns out to be a high level terrormorph in a human disguise.

Honestly it wouldn't even *have* to be a totally non-canon trait like it was in Fallout, considering terrormorphs have psychic abilities.
Right there with you, brother.
Haven't encountered them. Sounds like an opportunity for mischief. "Go to Bohr lll-A and turn right. Or is it left? No, it's definitely right."
Wait, the simulator counts?
Shit. I did the simulator before and forgot it existed.
Nah just hop on to serpentis and extinguish the varuun
just don’t leave the simulator while it’s still running Mistakes were made
I didnt know about Kryx on my first playthrough until I jumped in there with my Kepler S. Got a bit white-knuckley for a minute as they kept jumping in, but the Obliterators prevailed.
I also love [same show] but [different quote] from [better actor]
This is what I want! Or let me buy the penthouse and gift it to her with some credits
This sounds like one of the kinda things this game was supposed to deliver but the overhype was also so very, very real :/
Be cool if Bethesda took notes
She deserves it all
Let's petition so she can join our crew
I gave her 20k, gave the family in cydonia 20k (above frog poster girl) to find somewhere better to live. Just wish there was more
I've not had that one. I just have the couple fight about if they're going the right way when jumping systems
Everywhere, over and over, and every single time they treat me like they've never seen me before.
As an Irish man I can say he is from Northern Ireland
Damn dude. You ok?
“Tooth adjuster devices” 🤣
That’s something I would say when my brain fails recalling the correct term. 😆
it's a game lol
r/conspiracy
Open fire on their ship and ***golly gee, wouldn't you know it, damned thing works after all.***
Time to disable their ship and board to see if there's even a kid onboard.
nah you shouldve known. 200+ hours in and still no lemonade found. orange juice will suffice 🍊
Whoa, someone needs to build a better spaceship.
Or just space buffalo bill.

You come over, eat the meal, and wake up in a cage. Turns out the last crew was what's for dinner
LOL Dude OMG the horror! I'm a body builder, and I'm cut and muscular. I wish I saw that look in the eyes of women when I was younger! lol

Please someone send them a message that they shouldn't use the Glamor Shots they took in the 80's as their main pic. OH GOD PLEASE!

lol /Rant_OFF
Sure does. It gets monotonous, but those kills count for challenges 👍🏼
All simulator kills count.  I rushed through by summoning an ally, then immediately killing them.  Then hack the system for another one kill them first, too.  Once you get to the point where you're eliminated \(because you were busy killing your allies\), don't restart, just ram the disabled ships to death.  Those count, too.

They don't even force you to undergo a psychological evaluation afterwards.
Just go to the key. It's full of pirate ships. I killed over a dozen in one battle
You can head back and try that method if you are trying to level up the aneutronic fusion skill
I think it would have been impossible for me to clear Kryx on Very Hard without getting all the Constellation crew on my ship, getting a whole bunch of Tech skills, and learning the true power of zoom-and-boom hit and run tactics and particle beam weapons.

When I used to use lasers + ballistics + missiles the game was so fking hard. Enter 202 flight speed and Particle Beams. Kryx is the only place left in the game now that forces me to activate my neurons in space combat (I can't get the legendary ships to spawn anywhere, feels bad man).
Thanks for confirming! :)
I just don't want them to find out what happened to Grandma.
This is exactly what happened! xD
It's like Homer post-vocabulary tape.
And the ship is invulnerable too as im now learning
There's not. There are only two kids in all of Starfield
Just some guy squeezing his family jewels.
"You have actual lemonade? 500,000 credits, half up front, half on delivery."

"Ah, actually-"

"Fine, 500,000 up front, 500,000 on delivery."
I'm ashamed to admit this, but I have yet to build a ship. I've upgraded a couple a few, but the whole build thing befuddles me. If I could only save my progress. Please, modders, you're my only hope.
Ahahaha. Pics from the 80s and fifty pounds ago. I'm no body builder, but I've always used a recent pic.

Trying to meet women online....between the catfishing, ghosting, gaslighting, whatever, is completely fucked. And if they're young there's usually a daddy complex thing going on which immediately sets everything up for failure.
Also you can use it for the repair parts challenge.
I mean, I'm way past that at this point.
The simulator has exactly 15 ships in total if you do all tiers.
Just build a corkscrew shaped ship, and none of that even matters.  You get the sarcastic "Didn't even scratch it" remarks from Sarah when you undock from a spaceship and grind across the side the whole time, but Barrett has gotten really good at climbing back up that ladder.
You obviously haven’t found the classroom in the ECS Constant. There’s about 7-8 kids in Starfield.
It's zero now thanks to me
There's more, but most are Cora clones.
Totally worth it.
It's super, super clunky and I had to watch several YouTube videos to get a better grasp of what to do, but now I'm pretty comfortable in making my own ships.  Once you have piloting and starship design up to rank 4 you will find that it is pretty easy to spend 600k + on a nice ship.
Must be a skill tree I haven't picked lol
Fair enough, maybe someone else will see it though.
You can just keep redoing it over and over.
Yeh but I (and many others) completed that before we knew. So it's good to have another option
Actually I take that back. There's a few on Cydonia and a few on Akila.
I'm getting there, in terms of the ranking. My question is, I see these incredible, massive ships that players build and it's like, what do they do? Sit there for 12 hours building the ship, never leaving that screen, until the build is done and the ship is nominal? Yikes. I'd have to take a potty break at some point.
You can use the ship simulator at ANY time after you accept the first mission from Tuala, including way after youre done with the UC line (unless of course you sided with the CF and have a billion credit bounty on your head)
I didn’t even know Cydonia had kids. Guess I gotta explore more thoroughly.
The big thing is to build an outpost and then a landing pad with shipbuilder.  Then you can build most items in the game at your own outpost.  There are some specific items that you can only buy at certain locations (New Homestead, Hopetech on Polvo, etc), but you can rough in the ship with the basic items then go min-max later on.  

Start with a cheap build first to get your feet wet.  I actually dislike that two level bridge so am now kinda loving a single level (to minimize ladders and confusing ship layouts), basic ship with just a captains quarters for a bed to sleep in and another 2x1 with some passenger slots.  There is a really ugly Deimos bridge that has a huge amount of crew slots, so I just use that one, haha (but you need to go to Deimos shipyard to buy it).  If I need to go craft something, I'll just go back to the Lodge and grab all my crap out of the chest in the basement & build or improve whatever I wanted to.
That part I did not know... Damn
Find them. There's a cute and awesome mission involved.
I'm going to give it another shot. The mechanics are a pain in the ass. I really liked building and crafting in FO4. Starfield is more complicated with less instruction, a terrible combination. But I'll get the hang of it. Now I'm on the NG+, and don't feel as compelled to do the quest lines or the MSQ, I'll spend more time with this. 

I like the idea of having an outpost with my own space port. I can't imagine the amount of materials you have to gather/buy for something like that, but I had a tone of shit before it all got taken away. Except for that Starborn ship which is a complete waste of time. Where is the goddamn captain's quarters? Or any kind of bed? Is there a secret door somewhere? I'm back to flying the Frontier which is more fun.

Thanks for your understanding and help with all this. I'll report back when I've got something to show. I'm a form follows function kind of guy, so it'll probably be really ugly. Haha.
Now we can officially say,GTA VI is releasing next year.
Just 1 year bois.Stay Strong 💪
Hoping for early 2025 release 🤞
Not yet here
still 2023 in America. Gimme a few hours lol
It's still 2023 in Western Europe
You Australian spider humping motherfucker, we still have several hours.
this year

We are skipping 2024

So the GTA fan protested to skip 2024

The government a agree

Which mean GTA 6 Is coming out this year's

/S obviously
How much you wanna bet it releases in the fall 2025 lmao, more like 2 years away.
Already 3 hours into 2024
Yes we can!!
Still 40 mins to go, soz.
Let us salute the fallen soldiers who couldn’t make it this far 🫡
No we can’t, it’s 2023
I’ll bet they push it till 2026
Hopefully it's gonna release early 2025
hopefully early 2025
I predict next trailer in april 2024 and then more in november.
My prediction for the release date is sometime in February based on the fiscal year theory
now people can stop saying it's two years away
2024 is gonna be a filler year
Stay healthy!👍🫡
Hell yesss. Best wishes everyone for this year✌🏼
No we can't, not the entire world changes at the same time.
It's only 3 in the afternoon on the 31st here in Arizona
Delayed to late 2026 come November just like rdr2.
Not yet man still 1 hour left
You know not everyone is in your time zone right?
Next year, yes, but not neccessarily releasing on year from now 😩
Imagine its December 2025 lol
Idk, something tells me if it releases next year, it'll probably be in fall.
Not here. Still 1 hour and 20 mins away
[deleted]
Not yet it’s still the 31st 5:39 pm still got another 6 hours and 21 minutes
It’s only 5:00pm 0_0
Still 2023 in the US.
I’ll hold my breath until we have a specific release date
Cries in 2023
if there are no delays...
Wonder what the community's reaction would be if this game was to get delayed for whatever reason
imagine it gets delayed a year or two
It's December 2023. It won't be releasing December 2024 or January 2025 for that matter. There is no way this game dosent drop Q3 so October to December, Christmas 2025. So more like 2 years.
Likely 1.9 years
It releases December 422741163rd 2025
I'm gonna be completely honest with you all, a 2026 release is a very real possibility.
I'm happy even if it releases 2026.
*Then it gets delayed*
I'm going to predict september 2025 and then May 2027 for PC.
Don't forget the typical r* delays. Got to have a minimum of 2 delays so itll be a 2026 release with a 2027 release for ps6/xsxsxxsx and 2028 for pc. Need that same gtav revenue
Not sure your time zone but only US matters. So no.
Then they post pone to 2552
No way GTA 6 gon release January 1
Still isn’t 12 for me so…
Unless Rockstar completely trolls us and never releases the game

WE DO A LITTLE BIT OF TROLLING
It’s still 2024 for me
Probably December  2025
Untill they Delay it till 26.
I still feel closer to a year and a half because my guess is they’re gonna wait til fall 2025. They released the last GTA game in the fall. Don’t pay me any mind though, I have no clue how these companies plan out releases.
 Coming December 15th 2025
December of 2025.
Until they delay the release as usual
31st December, 2025... Here We Come! 🤠
More of fan of rockstar games coming out 
In October.
Yeah.... in 6 months it will, but trailers soon I think.
I think it will release at the end of December 2025. Somewhere till Christmas. Or who knows? Maybe between Christmas and New Year😁
December 30 2025 we get a gameplay trailer.
Unless it gets delayed, lol.
Not for PC
Until they push the date back another year
December 2025?
Cool,I'll be able to play it in 2026...

Because R* hates PC players!
Hopefully they don't extend it to 2026 💀
Coming late 2025 tho
Basically 2 years
*might be releasing next year
You make it sound so close 😅
You ever think they mightve meant fiscal year 2025?
I thought it had been unofficially confirmed for September 2025
Then gets a delay LOL
GTA VI releasing October 2025.
My guess, they release it early in fall 2024.   November or December for the holiday season.
The bad news being that there's not much in the way of exciting games scheduled for the entire year of 2024 outside of Tekken if you're into that.
Still an hour 5m
Not yet!
well yeah but actually no
Baffled at the number of people who think it's actually coming out in 2025
Or 1 year 11 months and 30 days
Sweet, it’s been brought forward to 2024!

Bless. Some crank virgin needs a humour transplant for 2024 as well as a new GTA game.
At the moment, I have a whole 6hrs 9min before that’s true.
Mora than 4 hours until 2024 here in South America
I can't just yet
4 hours left until 2024 where I live.
Almost for me
Still 2023 on the western hemisphere. We gotta wait till it’s 2024 worldwide before we can say something like that.
Not for half of the world it’s not
6 hours till 2024
Time flies
Not in my time zone
Can only be official when the whole planet turns, not half of it.
No, I'm still in 2023.
Not in the US
I still got like 5 hrs man
It’s only 4:51 here
I’ll be dead by then, hope you all enjoy it though
It’s not even 6pm where I am
Well, I can't. lol. Got about 6 more hours
Need 5 more hours till I can say that
The moment when we can say:
“And with that, the 2024 season comes to an end”
Lol that should be part of every country’s New Years celebrations 

The reporter just turns to the tv and says : ***a wonderful display here to mark the turning to the new year and of course, this marks 1 year until the realise of GTA 6***
NOT YET. There is light at the end of the tunnel but we are not quite there yet, boys!
1 year 1 day and 4.5 hours is the closest it could be to release est time
speak for yourself
Yes
I still cannot believe we're getting this game in a year
Not for me, until now :D
K, now to get my fat ass on the treadmil till it comes out lol at least i have motivation to go to the gym now
What the fuck is your time zone bruh
I'm gonna black out drink everyday so time goes faster.
PC
Technically you're correct, the best kind of correct
Hang on, the Yanks still have a couple hours.
I’m still in 2023
Not for CST folks
Midwestern US, it's just after 8 PM here, so no quite in my case.
WW3 announcement 2024
Okay boys hear me out for a sec, what if we just try to not die within the next year or two. Thoughts?
It’s still 2023 for me😂🤣
let's all make it on the day 1 release of GTA VI!!!
not for us pc players doe...😭😢😣😖😞
4:02 pm in hawaii dafuq lol
Hopefully that source code leak didn’t damage rockstar too much to delay the game
Yes
🙃
Hahahaha, good point! 

Cheers 🥂
If we fuckin make it that far as a planet that’d be dope 🤣
Fucking 2024 spoilers? I still have 2 hours to go.
Time zones, I can’t say “next year” yet
Don't they kinda have to at this point?
Hey brotha I’m still in 2023
Have a PS5 but probably prefer waiting for PC release.. not getting double dipped again.
Whoever you are and wherever you are, you might get GTA VI before the rest of us
I can't say that
It’s a long lost road 🤤
i was here
Gta 7 is going to be released by 2036.  It's going to real life simulation run by Artifical intelligence by then.
Probably not on Steam till 2030 :(
This subs full of low effort posts and still get 2.5k likes lol
Im coming
Happy New Year everyone but we still have to wait for another year before GTA VI releases.
It will realise Tuesday April first 2025
What a time to be alive.
Ja
Aparently gta is releasing between march and june
Why has this got so many upvotes? Am I missing something? I swear everyone knew this as soon as the trailer came out?
I wonder how much time for the microsoft windows 🥶 becoz the console release is in 2025
More than a year if it releases after January 1st, 2025...
Can’t waitttt 😁😁
But what about the pc release…
Fuuuuck.
YESSS
Feels so close 🥲
Or we could just….

Bankrupt them in the meantime & stop logging on till they release a beta gameplay, seeing as theyve dicked us around for a decade. ijs.
us on PC probably in 2 years
dam I just got to live one more year.
This year felt short enough that it felt shorter then the months
lets hope the ps5 pro is in time
Then they delay it for another 5 years 😅😢☠️
It'll more than likely be delayed until 2026. Prepare for that because it's always the way it goes.
Man I still rem 2023 like it was yesterday. Good ol days when the trailer came out.
cms,

mplk
¥'km maw
mk

I'm sure it'll get delayed 🤷‍♂️
I really hope it comes out on Valentine’s Day.
Rockstar delay everything twice
Hoping for any PC release info. Bought my kid a series X for Christmas so I can say I didn't buy it for GTA VI just in case though.
It will release early probably in fall 2024 as ps 5 pro will come out as rockstar dropped trailer before its scheduled time.
going to be delayed like every other game in the past 5 years
Hopefully, there is never guarantee they won't delay it.
Hoping for 2025 release💀💀
Please let it be on or by april 20,2025
Wish granted 

December 31st, 2025
Unless Rockstar completely trolls us and never releases the game
It's supposedly 1st qtr 2025
lol
if it’s actually gonna release in 2025 it’ll almost certainly be Q4 for holiday revenue
The game got delayed since its 2024
In my opinion - they wanted to release it for autumn this year but decided they needed longer to get everything working absolutely 100%. Just look at the trailer - there's so much going on and that means there's so much that can go wrong. So they pushed it to 2025. I think spring 2025 is going to be the aim. But they've been vague because they don't want to say they've pushed it back if they do, in fact, push it back. If they say it's coming out in March we'll all be happy. If they say it's coming out in October then people will be disappointed but it's a sign that they won't release it till they are happy that everything in it is working perfectly. This isn't going to be a bugged release with a million updates in the first few months and videos of cars suddenly taking off and flying into the sky. When this game comes out it will all be perfect, I have no doubt of that.
probably Christmas of 2025
According to their financial reports they are expecting a lot of sales in Q1 2025
Ideally sometime around January 1st 2025
I suspect that's what they're internally aiming for with the option to delay it to fall 2025. Regardless we'll see more info this year, if not this spring.
Europeans man.
Been 1 year away In Australia for 11 hours now 😎
I knew someone was gonna post something like this prematurely
Read the post again when it is then
Time zones, my dude. It's 2024 in about half the world now.

Edit: it's already 10am in Australia, ya bunch a knee-jerk downvoters! It's fucking new year('s eve), but all ya wanna do is complain and downvote. Go right ahead.

Happy Fucking New Year GTA community!

It's 2024 in Eastern Europe
5 hours 46 minutes
why tf did i read this in an aussie accent? XD
Ya got my vote
Nah, they had that shareholder sales call where they said they expected monumental sales numbers some time between June 2024 and March 2025. 

Monumental’s a big word, and since they officially announced a 2025 release date, the game’s likely coming out in Winter 2025 (January to March).
that’s not 2 years👍
Lol guaranteed by the second half of the year at the very least
Your a bloody Brit aren’t you?
it’s 2024 in part of the world
finally someone who knows rockstar
Skill issue

Fuck murica 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🛢️🛢️🛢️🛢️
6 hours and 1 minute here
Who tf said anything about the holidays though? GTA 5 was initially announced for the spring but they pushed it to the holidays because of delays. As long as there are no delays, rockstar is likely looking at March/april.
It's next year though
Many are already in 2024, i enter in 15 minutes
We would riot and start looting stores and organising protests.
That’s q4
dont say it out loud or even think about it bro u gonna jinx yourself
Never
They won’t this time I think.They chose 2025 just so they wouldn’t need to delay the game from 2024-2025
Hoping I'm alive for it
Hoping for a release ☠️☠️
this
Cries in PC
Hoping for 21st century release🙏
April 1st for sure
You fucking monster
That would be very funny
Ya because they just really wanna upset their fans 😅
If this happens we riot.(Joke)
![gif](giphy|Qy2VKY3xlI1QyR6Ix5)
Not needed and they're not known for it. Gta 4 came out in April, rdr1 in May, gta 5 in September, and rdr 2 in October. Holiday releases are actually probably bad for them cause of all the other games usually coming out around that time, not to mention other holiday spending. Gonna be first half of 2025 if they don't delay, since they're also not known for releasing in the summer
Americans also lol. Through all of Americas time zones i think its currently 3:30-6:30pm. Its 5:30pm still in 2023 where im at in the US.
Here in europe its finally 2024! Happy new year everyone!
Hopefully it releases first here in USA just to mess with you
It’s not 2024 until it happens in America 🇺🇸 💪
U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A
We in here
More like eura peanin on my balls
South america still in 2023 here, how's the future?
And Americans lol.
The world revolves around us Americans
Not where it counts🦅🦅🦅🦅🎆🎆🎆🎇🎆🎇🎆😤😤😤😤😤🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🎆🎆🎆🎆🎇🎆
Yea i know, now it's 2024 here too.
why are you downvoted? lol
OP didn’t even wait for Europe, which means Asia, and those weebs only play final fantasy, so this post makes zero sense
73 mins here..
they never used monumental in the sales call.

substantial, yes. monumental? no.
20 months may as well be two years.
I think you’re missing the point.
"more like" as in "closer to"
Yes, yes I am.
Fuck that part…I’m from Merica

fair point. we shall see
Doubt it’s gonna be any time after May. My prediction is March 5 2025
« Since the other games usually coming out » Brother it’s the other games that are worried to release around the same time as GTA6, not the other way around.
Although I agree with what you’re saying. Q4 starts October 1st so their releases do trend around Q4 outside of RDR1 and GTA 4. This goes all the way back to GTA 1 with GTA 4 being the only one that didn’t release within Q4 or within a month of Q4 which sales would still extend and impact those earnings.
!remindme June 1, 2024
We Europeans are living in the future! Gta vi is less far away from us.
Currently 6 44 here in cet
People always forget about Hawaii and Alaska timezones
HELL NAH IT AINT 2024 TILL US TURKS ARE IN 2024🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Why is the internet classed as only Americans?
Perú 🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪
Cause it's still 2023 in the US and they're bitter about not being the center of attention for once.
Half of Europe had new year by the time the post went up.
4 hours here

Can’t wait for GTA6. I think that I will take a few days off for it. Do we know what products Rockstar are going to be released in 2024?
Happy New Year’s

I doubt the game comes out on time.
Still affects sales
Yeah that doesn't mean they'd want to release in a period packed with releases
!remindme June 1, 2025
When its released you better fucking tell me how cool it is so I don't have to worry about it for like 12 hours longer than you. I'll be pissed if yell don't.
Oh fuck, going to Europe rn
Look gta 6 has been with America for a while now. It’s less than a 10 hour drive for me.
Just means it will be released at like 4am for you.
Gobble gobble motherfucker
We estonians share a timezone with you guys 🤝💪💪
Because some people don’t understand sarcasm
The internet isn't. Reddit, its safe to assume most people are Americans, because about half of all users are. Its an american website. The rest of the world makes up the other half of users. Americans by a huge majority are the largest demographic on this site. And it being only half Americans is relatively new. When I got on this website it was like 90% Americans.
I mean, Reddit, as well as the internet as a whole, are American creations lol.

It's just a probability question, an extreme plurality of Redditors are American. Hence , a lot of posts and comment presume an Amercian nationality.
Tbf I’m Australian but I’m in Guatemala rn so still waiting for new years while everyone I know is in 2024 lmao

I’m taking a week PTO.. and another for GTA Online. Well this is TakeTwo predictions. Meaning they just bought another gaming company. They own 2k24 games. They make money from Rockstars online DLC through shark card sales.
You too

Part of me thinks they’re gonna release it early
Jokes a side. You'll be pissed if someone spoils it for you. I'll quit this subreddit at release and join it again a week or two later.

Probably has to quit every social media for a week.
It will never be given to Europeans first, also there are times where we link it up it’s not that bad.
Nah you better skip Europe and going straight to New Zealand lmao.
Oh how do you like it?
About four hours here.
527 minutes here
Weeks?!! Damn!!! I have just switched workplace and therefore gotta judiciously split my limited vacations with the wifester too! I already envy you. Those weeks of PTO will be some quality time right there! Lol!

Thank you for the clarification.
Yo I’ve gotten 17 downvotes from the “Murica” joke and I don’t know if it’s cuz people think I’m serious or if it’s a tired joke 😂😂
nope,it was from may 2023,8 billion increase in revenue in fiscal 2025(april 2024-march 2025),only gta 6 can do that

You poor naive soul.
You’re gonna have to quit the internet let’s be honest haha it’s going to be crazy.
Amazing, I’ve done so much in 2 weeks
Oh i’m single, and i’m assuming that’ll be the same by the time the game comes out.

i canNOT wait to enjoy the game to the fullest extent! i’m just hoping i keep my PTO intact before it releases, that is if it’s a holiday 2025 release.

Also, my recommendation, pack that xbox and hdmi cord and hook it up at the hotel! I’ve also thought about leaving the xbox on at home and making it not turn off automatically. Bring a controller with you and your phone or iPad, and use the streaming from xbox feature with the xbox app. And voila, on the go gaming!
Hivemind at work lol
Yes, it's a tired joke.

I think GTA6 will create the world's biggest "gaming day off"
When *GTA V* was released in 2013, many people took time off work to play it. A survey by *The Telegraph* found that 46% of respondents had scheduled a day off, while 19% planned to call in sick.what will you do? will you ask for a day off or maybe two? will you not ask for a day off and will wait for the normal end of shift,How much do you think the "off gaming day" will effect the shops around the world.
Multiple people I know, including my dad. Will be calling off work for a week for the release lol.
When it comes out i'll take a week off just to play
Remember- Dont call off the day of. Get home, start the download, and go to work while nobody else is. Call off work starting the NEXT day
Easily 100s of thousands, if not millions, in the US will take days off for the release. Rockstar is going to cause supply chain issues, markets will tank, countries will be invaded.
I will quit my job just to play GTA 6. Then maybe start again with youtube videos of my finds.
Followed by another GTA 6 pandemic, where no-one leaves their house for a year cuz they’re too busy playing.
Kind of sad to think there won’t be any crowds at stores waiting for the midnight release like there was in 2013
I reckon that immediately following GTA VI's release, global crime will plummet.

That's how big this game will be. 

I'd be surprised if people didn't miss work.
Unless it releases on a weekend 😄
I think I'm safe in my line of work - not many of my colleagues are gamers, or invested in GTA at least. I'll be using my annual leave accordingly.
![gif](giphy|iHwcnP9pa9ZnS4rR0g|downsized)
I’ll be happily retired when GTAVI comes out in 2056
Didn’t go to the school but a high school in my area always got the day off when a big game came out like without fail every year, so the rumour always was that the principal was a massive gamer. Think it’s been more or less confirmed that he was.
Lmao I remember that on the day Elden Ring came out we asked our physics teacher "Are we gonna have a test tomorrow?" (They don't give us Saturdays off in India in certain schools, I go to one of such schools) and he said "Nah I probably won't show up tomorrow" we asked him why and he said "Imma have a headache from playing Elden Ring all night long"

edit: I just remembered this, he indeed did not show up the next day.
It’s going to become a new holiday lol
i hate when these type of articles come out. like why are y’all snitching
I was in college at the time. I showed up to my morning class tired as can be and there were two others there. The professor gave us an exam that day worth 15% of our grade. Easiest A that semester thanks to GTAV.
They may as well go ahead n make it a holiday event like the Solar eclipse
Imagine all those people calling off for a few days or weeks, just for the Servers to crash
That's obvious. I might actually quit my job just to have time to play the game
its gonna affect the global economy for sure
only in america. in Europe you take 2 week paid vacation atleast twice a year and they can't stop you.
When GTA V came out I was supposed to start a new job that day. I went to the midnight release & didn’t turn up. I never called and they never called me
My girlfriend is already aware that when it comes out, ik busy the next few days.
I'll be calling in 2 days and my son's going to Grandma's. That's it 🤣
My friend and I, both fathers, plan on buying our wife’s and kids vacations when it comes out
I “was really sick and couldn’t go to school” when gta v released. Hid my controller and tv remote under the blanket and when I heard my parents approaching my room I’d hurry and shut the tv off and act like I was sleeping or something.
The owner of the small company I work for keeps telling us we're taking off for pc launch day lmao

Only if he pays me though
I'm taking a week off. I just hope it falls on a long weekend.
It will cripple the IT industry. Once the release date announces, I’m taking a whole week off before my coworkers can get it in
A lot of Nintendo games and every Dragon Quest game, come out on Friday or Saturdays to avoid people calling off of work disrupting the economy in Japan.
I think there’s a lot more PC gamers now relative to console gamers than in 2013, who won’t be able to play the game when it comes out. Most probably won’t buy a ps5 or series X right away to play it day one
Gta6 release date should be a holiday
I will be requesting off, but I did call in sick when 5 launched
I'll probably still be going to work tbh, times is hard.
What's great is that in my team at work, only like 5 of us are gamers, and only a couple of us are actually interested in GTA 6, so I think I'll probably get that day off 😅
DOS attack incoming - and people will be on this sub bitching about how they are wasting vacation time.
I'm taking the week off.
My high school had a b*mb threat the same day GTA 5 came out and everyone got to leave early
Im taking a damn week off work to play that. I'll be 48 when it comes out and IDGAF
If only it had a pc release at the same time. No matter how long I’ve been waiting I’m not buying an entire 500 dollar console to play one fucking game.
Prepare for a march of gamers that day, if not riots (when the game will be sold out).
Not missing work to play a game early, I actually love my career. The game will be waiting for me when I get off. Money matters more lol
Selling a few days early access has become to profitable. They are gonna release multiple versions on multiple days. Would be leaving money on the table if they wouldn't, even if we don't like it.
dawn, GTA6 will make the new york stock market crash, the employees will all be sick on the day💀💀💀💀
do these journalist dont have holidays? are you so stupid to call "in sick"
Implying the fucking thing will ever release
Never taken a day off to game and it's my only hobby lol. Wfh so will prob play in my break unless I feel like the day off anyway. Digital as well, never queued at launch for anything.
I called in sick😅
I've already planned to catch the flu that week. Sorry bosses.
Thank mother monster i don’t have a job or go to school
They need to just release it on the weekend 😭
I can already tell some companies will have a policy in place so that doesn't happen 😅
day? you mean week 2 weeks?
🙋🏻‍♂️
I’m not going to be in work that week 100%
We need a national floating holiday for cultural events, plus super bowl Monday and Election Day
I'll take a minimum of 3 weeks off for GTA VI 🍻
I wish I could program my vacation for when the game launches. But it won't be possible unfortunately.
I cut half of Biology 101 to stand in line for my reserved Vice City copy.

I had my whole life ahead of me.
I recommend anybody thinking about this and waiting a couple days to let all the day one issues iron itself out. I've done this in the past and a couple times I'd have issues with servers being overloaded or unable to connect or download/install day one patches. Yeah, fuck all that especially when you take a whole ass day or two off to enjoy and get hit with grievances.
*requires Internet connection to play 
*servers are down 

I'll wait a few days then take off
So im saving up so that 2 weeks before I can put in my 2 weeks and my last day can be the day that the game drops , so I can set the game to install while im at my last day at work.
So when I get off the game will be reqdy to play and I give myself a week to play it with no distractions while I put in more applications for another dead end job lol 
So by the time I get through atleast half the game im employed again lmao
I've been planning to take a few days off for the release of GTA 6 for the past few years at this point. Here's hoping I only have to wait one more year before I can put that plan into action.
Im going to take the entire week off.
Day??? Iv already booked the whole week off 😂🍿
No offence, but yeah, no shit.
Will it be released multinationally at the same time? Massive call-offs!
I'm not booking any time off myself. My whole week will be me being excited every day at work, taking a week off the gym to play in the evenings, and heading to the weekend where I will spend the majority of it in my underwear surrounded by energy drinks.
I’m most definitely taking the day off, my job just going to have to deal with it.
Im hoping it comes out on a Friday so that I can have a 3 day weekend spent doing nothing but playing VI
Yea I'm definitely making some bullshit so I can get at least 5 days off
I still remember back when *Halo 2* came out, there was a noticeable number of kids missing from my high school that day.
Day one definitely won’t be a large patch and crashing servers.
I’m probably going to take off the weekend when the game is released as I’ve been hyped for this game since I was 10 ( I’m 18 now, shows how long gta 5 has been out) when it comes out and only just be playing that and going for a social media blackout. Can’t wait to play the story and explore Vice City
Hopefully this launch is better than the last one or there's going to be a lot of wasted days
It's dumb to take the day off on day 1. It'll take like 5 hours (if not more) to install, update, then I'm assuming connect into the Rockstar Launcher due to the inevitable mass load of logins
Count me in
I think I'll play for the whole night and I will have to call in sick because I will not sleep at all.
Imagine if Valve and Bethesda secretly release TF3 and Elder Scrolls 6 on that day
I’m gonna have to buy a PS5 just to not wait an extra year to play on PC 😤
I did it for College Football 25. Gonna do a whole week for GTA6
I've already told my wife I will be taking the week off to play. When GTAV released I came to bed at 630am when my alarm goes off at 7 to go to work. My wife thought I was already up getting dressed. I called in sick, slept for a few hours and resumed playing. Lesson learned.
I work nights for situations like these. Still taking 2 days
I’ll need more than a day, I hope it releases on a Friday
I’m definitely using my weeks worth of hours 😂😂 when it releases
I only get 6 days off a year for sickness and no vacation days. I'll have to wait until the weekend

I've already prebooked 2 weeks of September 2025.
It’ll probably drop on a Thursday so I’ll take a 4 day weekend for sure
God I cannot wait for this


I don't care for the game but the shitstorm online is gonna be something to behold
I wonder if there's going to be a measurable economic downturn in various industries that day.
I’ll be off I’m telling you that
Wish I hadn't "picked" 2024 to be my year of unemployment, end of 2025 might've worked out betterl
I took 2 days off for the release. I’ll be taking a couple days off for this one too.
Saving up all my PTO
What do you mean one day? I’ll be almost dead sick for two weeks
I will plan my vacation for the release. But only one week. Last time I did this was for Forza Horizon 5
Total morons will call off the day-of for the digital release and realize the entire day will be downloading and installing the game. 

Brotherman set it to download before you go to work if you can and take the day after off to actually play.
Followed by the biggest forced account backlash when the servers die.
I’m taking a week off from work soon as I know the date putting time off in
I'll be booking a few days off
I’m already saving my pto. lol imma be out for 2 weeks
A week of holidays is getting put in from work
I’m booking a week of work I always have holiday I don’t use I’m booking week off as soon as announced the official date
Dragon Quest XII release in Japan: hold my sake /s

BTW, I learned yesterday that Michael DeSanta is kinda the favourite protagonist across the whole series in Japan specially. Anybody know why?
This game has the mission to save the 9th generation.
Eh I'm a housewife. After the usual domestic stuff in the morning, I have the rest of the day to myself
When it’s goes online I’m taking off for a week
I also wonder how much traffic will dip in porn sites
Thats if it doesnt take 20 hours to download thanks to its probable massive file size
I will absolutely be doing this
I'm saving a week of paid vacation for it.
Can’t wait to see about it all on the news whenever GTA 6 does release.
More like, week off
Gaming DAY!? Try WEEK(s).
Got a strong feeling that they aren't gonna sale many physical versions
IDK why people have to play day 1. Games like this take about a month or two to finish. 
They are creating an artificial hype in the Market for this
Eh, it'll be there when I get home
As a PC user imma work extra hard that day to keep my mind busy
Nah, I’m taking at least a week off.
We don't have to wait at gamestop overnight anymore either. Like it or not.
I would have never thought of this but now I want to see the world wide I stats on this the day it releases
I plan on taking a week off minimum juat to get hammered with friends
They gotta have such massive servers my God
They gotta have such massive servers my God
Absolutely. I probably won’t, but there’s no doubt. Even more so since people can get it immediately online and go nowhere at all.
I'm sick that week
Yup, me too
My manager knows I’ll be off the week of release
I will take a week off! First time I'll be taking days off for gaming. Been there since nes ;)
Day? Try month
Honestly, I know this game will take weeks to complete so I wouldn't be in any rush tbh
One of the games I’ll only ever pre-order.
I'll give myself the day off, lol. No more queuing for me, though I did that in 2013 for a disc copy of gta 5.
I’m just taking a week off lmao
Big time. I only played the storyline and maybe some hours just messing around. But I am 100% going to be getting time off on release day for this. How exciting!
I dropped out of college. Do I win?
I'll be lucky if I have a day off then
Yup, as soon as Announce official release date. I’m requesting that day and couple days more off of work.
Right…
Ima still be in college so I don’t have to show up to class lol. Unless there’s an exam then I’m gonna be ‘sick’
I bump to the highest tier of PTO at my company next year and will definitely take a week.
In my line of work it is not possible. Autumn is our busiest time of the year, we don't even allow people to take personal days off unless it's an extreme reason. 

So it will not happen!
Cant wait for managers to get several calls from workers who are all taking a day off for the same day
If I took a few days off to play RDR2 and then Hogwarts Legacy when it came out, you can bet your ass I’ll be booking a week off for GTA6 😂
Can confirm. I took a week off to play GTA5 and RDR2.
I'm taking the whole week off. 

You think I'm joking.

I did it for RDR2 and still didn't beat it in that week.
I wonder if the market will crash coz the workers decide to take a leave altogether.
They should just give a holiday at this point
Crazy to think that I was in high school when the last one dropped, and now I'm 6 years out of college with a wife and a kid. Even crazier to think that I'll be a grandpa by the time that GTA 7 comes around. 
Gotta be this or the elder scrolls 6
It wont unless it goes on pc same day, that is unlikely.
Can’t wait until the community realizes they squeezed everything they could out of gta 5 just for gta 6 to be like it’s DLC 

The only good thing that could come with gta 6 is NO shark cards and actually have a decent in game cash flow instead of making every player invest a lifetime just to make couple mill for one purchase
It happens every year with FIFA/EA Sports FC, why not?
🕰️ waiting 🤷‍♂️
I've already told my students that I'm gonna come down with a fever for multiple days whenever GTA comes out lol
I think the non-gaming economy will collapse because ain’t nobody going to work that day 😂
Contractor, so no work on pay, as I would call in sick lol.
Now that’s fine, so when is the release date?
I like how they said ‘gamers’ like it wasn’t normal to play games
I don't. Back then, downloading games to a console took much longer than it should. We live in a digital age now. Sure, people will still to in, but it won't be as massive.
I am getting it on digital on ps store
And the servers will crash for the first week I bet
I intend to get fired and collect unemployment for 6 months while I play.
Everyone called off for NCAA25
I will call sick or brake my leg
My managers already know I’m taking the week off as well.
A few guys in my crew are taking the week off or a few days as well. 

So yeah I’m sure a lot of companies will see a trend when the actual release date is announced
I will be taking a whole week off for this game
This is the way.
I'm using 2 or 3 vacation days for sure. I'll be 40 years old. I don't even play games anymore. I'm literally buying a ps5 just for this.
As soon as I find out the date I’m sending a request for PTO on that day. If it’s Tuesday I’m taking the whole week off.
They should already be working on servers lol 😆 imagine
Me n my homies definitely skipped school to play gta 😆
The economy will collapse, partly because people won't be able to afford it no mo
Will be booking at least 3 days off
Gonna be nic-sick for that time being. Aint no way im being caught faking.
GTA V online took like a month roughly after release or maybe 2 weeks later right? Can't remember exactly. That's where the real fun is, stealing cars, buying apartments for garage spaces, customising vehicles, using the vehicles in missions and cruising. And ofcourse the icing on the cake, taking advantage of the money hacks and glitches
Take a week off work just to pay $200 for a video game then find out you need GTA+ to play online, so you’ve spent $200 to play the story
Day? I took a week off for RDR2 so for GTA6 you best believe it's going to be a week if not more
That "my stomach is hurting I can't come in today" line I'll tell manager will be legendary
I won't call in sick... I'll just book time off.
"Ahead of the games release tomorrow" wtf are they on about?
My social life ends on the release of this game.
i’ll call in the next day off, gotta let it download
I remember when GTA 5 launched, I was in college. Ny roommates and I each sequentially took a day off to play the game all day. It was my Xbox, so I had the first day.

When GTA 6 launches, I’ll probably be taking off that Friday just to rip the game, and my wife will understand.
I'm taking 3 weeks off, be  using all my days at once. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm 47 I probably won't live to see GTA 7
Imagine if the servers crash and only physical copies are available, and we get to relive long lines at gamestop again
💀
I used my saved holiday days to book the week off when GTA5 was released.
I literally have money saved so I can quit my job and play for a month
I’m taking the launch week off and my work already knows.
I don't need to call in sick to buy a game.
I’ve sometimes thought about it, but then I think… do I really want to spend a few days or a week playing it so much?

I’ve had way more fun making games last now that I’m older. It took me a month and half to beat the main story and most secondary missions of RDR2 and I loved it. For The Last of Us Part 2 I never played more than 2 hours so it took me like 12-13 gaming sessions and I wouldn’t change that for anything.

When GTA IV was released I completed the main story in a weekend. Big mistake. I was way younger though and didn’t know patience.
You know what's kind of sad? The amount of people that will *voluntarily* call off off work to play GTA VI is probably way more than the amount of people that will take off of work to go vote. 'mericuh!
I remember initially hearing a 2018 release date for GTA6 wayy back when... now it's not even Guranteed to be released by 2025 😅🤣

Realistically though (and I have this convo with everyone when discussing why it's taking so long to release/develop) Why would Rockstar release GTA6 when they're still pulling INSANE amounts of revenue from Gta5 online? As soon as GTA6 is released GTA5 will become obsolete more or less so why not hold out to try to make the game absolutely perfect while still pulling in tons of money from GTA5?
No matter how long they wait the crowd to buy it when it's released will still be the same if not significantly larger due to the hype surrounding it?
I just REALLY fckn hope there won't be a shit ton of bugs and glitches considering they'll be spending over a decade making the fucking game. 

It'll be worth it in the end, as long as it actually gets released sooner or later (🤞Not too much later than it already is ffs)
Please don't do it. It'll be better to wait for the first reviews to drop in, just to make sure the game is playable and not bugged to hell like Cyberpunk 2077. Given how ~~Rockstar~~ Take-Two let us down recently, it's not worth buing it blind.
It's not coming out on PC and I sure as shit ain't gonna buy a console for this, so no.
Nah I’d rather pay off the cost of the game at work and then spend my evening playing. Playing during the day never feels productive to me.
When it comes out, I'll wait at least six months. I recommend the same principle for any major new game. Probably closer to a year, then major patches and mods are out to fix biggest issues.
Honestly, no need to take a day off for the GTA6 release. It's not like you'll actually be able to play it on launch day. AAA games on release day are basically just high-budget loading screens with patch notes.
Most normal people just book a day or two off on holiday.
cringe
Wow you’re the first person to think this
WOKEstar game studios this time
Rockstar takes so long you are now able to play GTA WITH your dad.
Same here. I know a few people already planning their ‘sick days.’ It’s gonna be like a mini-holiday when GTA6 drops. The gaming world is gonna come to a standstill for sure, and businesses might as well put up signs that say ‘Closed for GTA Day’))
Considering the trend of major releases coming out on Tuesdays is long gone now, I’m just gonna take the Friday off.
Might as well make it a national holiday at this point 

I took a few days off for FO4 back in the day
literally waiting for the release date to be officially announced so I can inform my shift supervisor that I have a family emergency on that day
Not just book it off as a holiday?
Yeah, I'm definitely taking the week. Gotta play while the kids are at school, ya know.
Did that for Elden ring dlc lol
Taking a week off gang, please rise!
Rockstar crashes the American economy as over 40% of the workforce calls off for a week.
I mean I’ll be taking 2 weeks out of my 6 weeks PTO lol
I bet the real world stop for this period of 1-4 weeks to feel all of new world in GTA 6.
Gamecation days
Alllllll the vacation time
This is the way
only the day of release for me, anymore is overboard.
Book the time as soon as you can, man
Same
Is that all? I'm taking a month off.
Exactly, and don’t forget: Don’t open social media in that time, don’t talk to anyone! Avoid spoilers!
Very likely they'll let us pre-load before game launches
Also, be complaining about being ill all that day.
Bruh it’s 2024 download speeds aren’t what they used to be.. stick it on for download first thing while you breakfast and shower for the last time for the week. By the time you’re ready to play it’s downloaded!
just call in sick a day or two earlier and stay away a week
Huh? It’s be released at midnight ET probably. Download it during the night and wake up and play. 

Though realistically it will probably be able to be completely pre downloaded so the only question is if the login server is stable and whatever online components required.
?? Downloading 200 gigs with a good connection (1 Gbit/s) takes 26 minutes.
I'd be surprised if we can't preload it.
Preload?
This game games ^^
Banks will be easiest to rob…
Crime will drop
Tylko nie to....
my man will make one of those videos on YouTube where not even 2 seconds after the game's release he will upload the ending
That be stupid to do if ur job pays well
GTAVI25
For GTA VI? I bet your ass there will be. Nobody wants to wait for deliveries on that game lol
This will actually be funny, cops gonna be outside waiting to catch people speeding or doing reckless shit, streets gonna be empty as hell😭😭😭
it'll release friday
Most of r* games came out on tuesday, with exception of red dead which dropped on friday
Same. There’s only like two actual gamers in my office and I don’t think my colleague who is a gamer is much of a GTA fan. So yh i’ll be the only one taking time off probably
I don't believe this. Even if the principal calls in sick it doesn't mean the school will get a day off. Post source or you just pulled this out of your ass.
Based af teacher
Who cares about Online?
That won't affect single player lol Plus, online won't come out until later; like RDO and GTAO.
Gta online launched i think two weeks after gta 5. Servers wont even be up on release day
I'm European so I know this well. I wrote 1 or 2 days because I thought most of the people in this reddit were from the US
They were also busy playing GTA 5
Mutual understanding. They were like: yep. No problem.
dude you won't be able to last 1 whole year without spoilers, good luck
It’s 2024 we’re not running out of digital copies
that would be so fucking funny. with today economy even a fart could make it collapse. but GTA6 in the history books as the cause of the stock market crash it's not on my wish list
Spoilers!
Your missing a crucial part of any gta game. The story. That's what made gta popular online just gave it a massive boost. If you don't want to grind money play the story.
If they made it easy to get cash there'd be nothing to buy that's what keeps you coming back (I do think they could make it a little easier but not much)
For online almost defiantly for story hopefully not. And remember online will likely be released a month later whereas most people would have just booked the original release date off. Plus wouldn't surprise me if they just randomly released online early so people slowly find out, probably in the middle of a work day. Be the smart thing to do.
It's not about buying but about playing
haha yeah it’s stupid
Personally I don't vote because there's never any good options
CDPR bite off more than they could chew with Cyberpunk and was prematurely released because the investor's were getting antsy. Which is why the game turned out to be much better since release.

&#x200B;

>Given how Rockstar Take-Two let us down recently, it's not worth buing it blind.

How? lol Every game Rockstar has released has been a banger! 

You're kidding yourself if you think GTA VI is gonna struggle or something to not "buy it blind" lol
yes you will be spoiled the game 100%
bro, the game won't be on PC for at least year after initial release, so 1,5 years AT LEAST additional wait is wild.
irony?
And your son.
Yes I was about 7 when GTA 5 came out. Now I have to call of work myself for GTA 6, time fucking flies.
I started playing combat evolved with my kid. He’s almost 30 now. Been playin with my kid for almost a quarter century. Hell yeah!!
Thinking of buying a ps5 just for gta with my dad
I remember when so many people at my workplace were taking the week off for FO4. I was only 15 when GTA 5 came out so I didn’t see how a game could impact a workforce: FO4 was the first and only game I saw do that.
Man I wish I could get into Elden Ring. I’ve tried starting it multiple times but it just never really clicked for me unfortunately.
Taking a week off and then working from home the next week or so lol.
You only get a week of vacation?
Release days often have issues nowadays with busy servers, etc. The day after is usually a safer bet.
I’m resigning and living the rest of my days on loose change I find in the couch.
I'm taking a week off ☺️
I hate to rush videogames, I take my time exploring and getting into secondary activities and such. This game's map being HUGE grants a decent amount of hours just to scratch the surface.

Long story short, I don't know how many weeks I'll need to stay out of every social media just to avoid spoilers for this game 😅
probably when the game comes out this reddit will be empty. I refuse to have spoilers, when the game is out all apps will be muted
Uninstall every non-essential social media even.
As a future PC player my fate is already sealed, thanks Rockstar
If you dont get hardcopy that is, physical media is gonna get harder to come by.
Game sizes have also changed…
Can either down the game before it comes out but won't let you play it till its out or set up auto download so it downloads whilst you sleep
But how can I rob a bank I'm playing GTA 6
Focusing on the real tasks I see.
Why the hell would I do my job when I’m playing gta6
More pros than cons it sounds like.
How will I play GTA if I have a job though
coVId-25
Digital is way bigger…..
Oh boy do I have some news for you
You wanna bet their ass?
No chance I’m getting disk I want that shit pre downloaded and ready for the minute it’s released
Naw they gonna be playing the game too
this friday???? 🤯🤯🤯 /j
Source: my butthole
Majority of video games (as well as other Media) are released on Tuesdays, not sure why RDR2 was on a Friday for console but Tuesday for PC.
It was confirmed he was a gamer by boys who went to the school. Why they always got days off on those days I don’t know. Idk what type of source you’re expecting lol
So real, this guy got a PS5 on the day it was released, me and some of my other friends who own PS5s regularly trade CDs with him, and since he is also a pc gamer me and my friends share our IDs with each other, I've played like 10 games without even paying for them (My family can't afford to spend 60 dollars on games lol)
I mean nowadays you need server connections to even play single player so yeah…
I was in uni when GTA V launched, I just skipped classes XD
yes but I want the map sooo bad........and the disc too
💀💀
>How? lol Every game Rockstar has released has been a banger

GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition wasn't a banger, but milking nostalgic GTA players. I highly hope that GTA VI will be the game of the year, if not the entire decade, but buying games at the first day or pre-ordering them is imo always a bad practice.
And your grandson
🤣
Wait until you’re in your forties…Time only seems to move quicker!
I was 25. Now I have a son interested who is interested in 6. You have no idea yet of just how much time really does fly
lol it only goes by quicker the older you get. Enjoy and cherish every year of your 20s man
I couldn’t take off for gta 5 had just started my first ever job the same week the game came out I was sick
You won't have to call in sick for GTA 7 because you'll be retired. So there's that.
I was in fifth or sixth grade in Middle-School. I'm now  one year away from being done with my Bachelors degree. And I took a 2 years sabbatical between High-School and university where I just worked lmao
Bro, this is exactly the same for me. I don't understand how I'm gonna like the game so much like the rest of the world
It’s not for everyone. I am a big fan of the game, but can completely see why it doesn’t appeal to some
Maybe overlevel to make it easier for you
[deleted]
[removed]
you guys get vacation?
Y’all get pay time off?
Servers? You think it's launching with GTA online live on day 1? [X] Doubt.
Brother you have the decision. One week, 12 hours a day straight through it on first playthrough and second playthrough take your time OR getting hard spoilerd while trying to enjoy your first playthrough

I understand your point but we have the next 12 years to discover every corner of the map. But sadly there are assholes out there trying to ruin it for everyone.
PC players absolutely screaming and crying when they realise they'll be avoiding social media for 18 months after launch on console
One thing i can recommend you is the spoiler protection extension for chrome, it hides anything related to the topic when you are browsing.
Long story short, your unemployed 😭
We should all agree to flood the subreddit with fake spoilers. Would be pretty funny actually to see what people can come up with, lol

Like "Crazy how George W. Bush showed up as a plot-twist antagonist in the middle of the game right after that mission where you sabotaged the production equipment in a dildo factory"
You can pre-load any game, hard copy or digital - on xbox at least, through the app. You'll obvious need the disc to play but it'll already be installed.
It’s 2024, physical media is just a glorified license key these days.
Let's say it's 200GB (which is a little too much imo). If you wanna download it in an hour, that would be 3.33GB/minute. 3.33GB/minute = ~55MB/s (~440Mb/s) which is not unreasonable at all nowadays. Even at around 25MB/s (200Mb/s) it would be less than 2.5 hours.

I'd still recommend preloading if possible though. Especially since when everyone wants to play at once... I doubt the severs will keep up.
Still even if the game is 250 GB it would download in less than an hour with a gigabit connection
Yeah on our internet a 100gb roughly game takes around 1-1.5 hours depending how many people at home are on the internet. So definitely not a whole day wasted on downloading.

There's two ways I see of doing this. We drill a big hole on the side of the bank or we steal a couple of armored vans and disguise ourselves
On gta 6 release day ima rob rockstar headquarters. They all gonna be relieved their job is over and won’t even notice when I steal gta 7…
How can I gonna afford a new console and gta 6 if I dont rob a bank
gotta pay for that PS5 Pro somehow
Day offs, vacation time, sick time. I don't know if you're serious but having a job, making money, is better than playing a video game, granted I haven't been a fan of Rockstar until recently so I haven't been waiting a decade for gta 6 specifically, the game could mean way more to you than it does to me.
Errmagerdddd I think you just cracked the code
Oh no. I’m getting the disc. I wanna be able to play this in 80 years, even after PSN goes kaput.
The file size between digital and physical is the same lol

But what does that have to do with what I said?

A lot of people are going physical and midnight release is the fastest way to go, instead of waiting for the delivery later that day or possibly a day late, like in some cases.
If you play on Xbox, you can preload for physical games by using the Xbox app on your phone but yeah, it's everyone's preferences.
No last Friday. Too bad you missed it. Maybe in another 20yrs.....
I bet you these guys were taking days off. And sure maybe the principal. Not the school.

Imagine parents asking the school why tomorrow, a working day, their kids are not going?


Nah, your friends lied to you or you misunderstood. This would've made news. And the principal would've not held his position for long.
Yeah, but it's Rockstar, not Ubisoft.
>GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition wasn't a banger, but milking nostalgic GTA players.

That *technically* wasn't on Rockstar/Take-Two. They sent the work to some one-off gaming company to do the porting: Grove Street Games. So... Can't blame it on them other than the fact they didn't do it themselves but that'd be a waste of resources since they're working on GTA VI.

&#x200B;

>​ I highly hope that GTA VI will be the game of the year, if not the entire decade,

Of course it will

&#x200B;

>but buying games at the first day or pre-ordering them is imo always a bad practice.

It is but Rockstar is one of one. They've always delivered a masterpiece, so GTA VI should be without a doubt another one.
We'll be pouring one out for grandpa, who managed to convince our great-grandfather to buy GTA 3 for him back when he was a wee lad way back in the early 00s.
Yup! Days, weeks, months, even years fly by in a blur.
My son is 6 weeks old and I feel like the days are flying by faster than I can process!
in your forties, time flys so fast you just refer to your age as "in your forties" because you loose track of said age
I lost 2 weeks responding to this comment..
Yeah that’s what I was trying to do. Just didn’t really know what to put stats into other then vigor as I didn’t have a build planned. And kept running into mini bosses that kept kicking my ass lol.
The real criminals are the corporations running our country. 😉
>Kinda want to taste the end of a pistol most days.

So thats why u got that profile pic?
Wtf? What country? I get 6 weeks PTO
Y'all get paid?
Some streamers will get access to it weeks early and will start posting spoilers on Tik tok before the game even comes out
My only social media beyond Messenger is Reddit. I can live without Reddit for however long I need.
Good suggestion, I'll check it out. Thanks😀
If I were unemployed I'd have plenty of time to finish the game before the spoilers get to be everywhere.....

Have some common sense.
GTA is so crazy that this cam turns out to be a spoiler and you just ruined my 10 years of waiting
What is this newfangled.... WITCH WITCH! BURN HIM HES A WITCH! UNGODLY MAGIC
Yea, all physical disks are in this day and age is just a key to let you play. The days of full games actually being on the disk are long gone
Maybe we should trigger the alarm before hand to see what the response will be like?
Rockstar North HQ is across the road from the Scottish Parliament I don't think you can rob a place right next to the most important government building in Scotland 

And also Edinburgh is like 85% crackheads, 10% annoying Americans so you gotta get through them as well
I was just joking buddy 😊
First off most likely the disc won’t even have the game on it and it’ll just be a “key” for online download. 

Secondly, in 80 years your PlayStation is broken, in 80 years the disc is broken, in 80 years you are most likely dead.
I'm not really up on how games distribution works these days but my understanding is that a digital pre-purchase would mean the files download at some point before the release date and then "activate" at midnight or whenever the release date officially starts. That means you can start playing within seconds of being allowed to. A physical game on the other hand usually doesn't contain all the files necessary to play the game and so players will need to take the physical copy home and the run a day 1 update to get the last minute game breaking fixes at which point the servers will be massively overloaded and angry forum posts will be made. At least that's what I've gleaned from past game releases. Please correct me of I'm wrong especially with regards to GTA6.
If someone pre orders a digital game then usually the files are downloaded like a day or so before release so they can play the game pretty much immediately at midnight. I can see many people just pre ordering a digital copy instead

Also depends on if whether a physical copy will still require some files to still be downloaded. Let’s not forget modern games can be pretty huge these days
My point is that fewer people are going physical… why wouldn’t you buy digital and get it the first second it’s out with preloading?
I play on PlayStation so not sure how that works
![gif](giphy|26FKT1K97Wuiddros)

You must be fun at parties
Good point
It's so come full circle "sorry grandpa there's too much violence in this game for you" ^😆😳
Huh? You have a grandpa that was young in the 2000s? Are you 2 years old
I still feel like the pandemic was last year.
My son is 4 months and it seems like yesterday we brought him home
Eh I’m about to turn 26 and had to literally do math to figure out if I was 24 or 25 or 26 already 😂 I don’t give a shit about my age. I just work and play my games and read my books and ignore practically everything else 😂
I look forward to all of the posts about peoples employers denying any day off request around the GTA release.
I'll give you one guess lol
I remember when fallout 4 came out I saw all endings the same day from a YouTube spoiler
Mate, half the Scottish parliament will be at home playing gta 6. And the other half will be crying that they’re not at home playing gta 6. No one’s gonna notice 😂
It sounds like a challenge to me, see you in 80 years
Isn’t that why GTA and RDR2 give you a second disc just to download the game? Maybe GTA VI will be the same.
[deleted]
If you're on Xbox, you can preload any game, regardless if it was physical, by using the xbox app on your phone. So once the game is available to preload, physical copy buyers can, too. I'm not sure if PS has this or not.

Still not sure how this pertains to my comment towards iLikeMen's midnight release comment. I guarantee there will be, there be a lot of people that want the physical editions. Thus, going to a midnight-release will be the fastest way to get it and play. So, there's no reason to feel like it won't happen again like it did in 2013
If you are on Xbox, you can preload for physical when it's available to do so by using the Xbox App on your phone. So that's not an issue.

But the whole point was, a lot of people want the disc version as well as the collector's editions. So there will definitely be a huge midnight-release as they won't want to wait for delivery later that day or something like that.
This is the most anticipated video game of all time and millions of people want the collector's editions for all the physical goodies - myself included. Let alone of lot of people rather have discs still anyways. That's why

You can also preload physical for xbox by using the xbox app on your phone. So, that's a moot point.
At least I get invited ^;)
My son doesn't exist, and it feels a second ago when he came out of his mother's womb.
America really is wild. Y’all have no labour laws or unions?
this shit NOT gonna work bro 😭
Remindme! 80 years
GTA 6 will be even bigger in size and rockstar has even less incentive since people accepted it a long time ago and online is cheaper than making discs.
tf are you on about mate
Wow this was an incredibly stupid post. I trust you're not this stupid normally because otherwise there's a problem.
Every game I play now with a disk still requires some kind of online download when you first go to play it.
hate to break it to u bro but you might've been living under a rock
Least obvious Scottish embassy employee 😹
i can already picture your family in the room watching you slowly drift away in your deathbed, just to see your phone go off with a reddit notification about GTA 6
Found my first oil rig on the southern most pole of Jemison!
Genuinely don’t know what to expect as I never actually read the post when people found them! 
I've only found one of those so far in 4 or 5 NG+ runs.  Definitely a butt-puckering dungeon.
 Bethesda really went hard on this POI.
(Waits an anticipation for the guy to climb up there and realize that hell is real)
Threads like these make me see misses in the game even more. 

I wish they had another potential mission board mission like “check out disturbance on planet:(example)” and use that to get all of these POIs in rotation. That way even if you go somewhere with no interior, there could be a terrormorph or aliens running over or different little bullshit quests that give you all the POIs.

As it is I’m not going to enough random POIs as it is unless I drive past something cool while surveying a planet 
L
Ive never seen these. What are they called an where fo I find em ??
Folks… I don’t know if it’s because I’m only level 50 or because it’s on Jemison but that wasn’t that bad I feel like I got robbed, there was like maybe 5 of the swarming sisters and they were max like level 5 or so, did I get robbed? The highest value loot was a bashing maelstrom
This will be interesting. There needs to be more of these type of encounters. Just not exactly the same.
Nothing to see here...


Why are you screaming ? 

Haha
Almost 400hrs & still haven't found one.
Best poi in the game.
I noticed this poi only shows in cold planets or cold areas on goldilocks planets
You. Found. WHAT!
I used to think "I want this as an outpost!"

Now? "Nuke it into a black hole!"
Hell yes
Oooof da mae.
The scariest mob in the game spawns on these things
Reading you guys feels like it ain’t a walk in the park 😂

I should try my luck one of these days 
What does the poi icon look like? Is it a random planet poi or does it only pop up once you’ve landed
I mean visiting a drilling platform at night is really something.
I highly recommend installing a minimun enemy/system level mod, the Poi's just aren't enjoyable when the enemies are too low.
I found my first one in the most toxic planet I've been on. I was struggling to kill the enemies and stay alive due to illnesses.
I have come across it several times, and several times I turn around and walk back out again after entering the door 😆

But last week I actually forced myself to clear it ( yeah I dont do well with horror in games, a bit worried for shattered space )
All I can say to OP is... Enjoy!
i think i encountered a bug at release because i encountered this POI more than any other. i stg i did it three or four times and was like, you know what, i don’t actually need to complete another one. 

but! i haven’t seen a single one in any subsequent playthroughs. weird
It's just a normal oil rig.
How do you guys find these??? Is there some trick to finding good poi? I land over and over only to find crap in lvl 75 systems. Very hard difficulty and lvl 75 myself. What am I doing wrong?
Found it at level 10. I jump off the rig to escape.
Got one at level 5. I screamed.
Weird, these are rare??? I’ve only started one play through and got some heavy game breaking glitches in one of my side quests so I abandoned the game, only had the final main mission to go as well. But yea randomly stumbled upon this and it was quite a battle, but lived only to delete the game later unfortunately.
It's amazing how the landing pad is 2/3 of the whole area
First run, I get onto this rig with not much ammo as it was fairly early in the game. Then the nightmare ensued. I now go into this armed to the teeth.
I wish POIs like this could be found in oceans, forcing your ship to land on it, no real escape other than taking off
Is there anyway to find these in the Xbox platform? Or any recommendations for finding them? Just random land and POI everything possible?
I found this within my first few hours of the game on a random moon. Had no idea what to expect, I was very low level, had barely any good weapons or ammo, it was so tense. One of my favourite experiences in the game. We really need more dungeons like this.
Are these rare?
I keep seeing a lot of people praise POI’s like this and safehouse gamma, but I was really disappointed by both. Safehouse gamma was good at the start, great idea with the sound.

But it didn’t go anywhere, it was just a corridor and a terramorph you’ve already killed a hundred of. It felt like it was leading up to a full on dungeon, then it just ends.
I found 3 so far and I haven't NG+ yet
I’ve only played the game once last October and I found one of these at random.

I didn’t realise they were rare.
My first four poi I ever found in this game was that oil rig.
It was actually the first ever POI I've encountered when first playing the game, I really like this one
They mostly come at night…mostly.
Really wish we could make POI our camps and bases.
I found one VERY early on in my first game. Im on NG+ 6 and have never found one since.
Does it fly? 🙄
Head on up. It'll be great.
Damn. That’s so cool
My favorite reference to the movie Alien in video games. Wait till you find the transport…
Proof the Green Energy Agenda failed. They were fracking even after the planet Earth died.😝
I wonder why they're still using gasoline ⛽️
Ng+1, 114 levels I've only found 4 total. Idk it's just really fun for me. Love this freakin game!
Oil rig!!??
What the actual fuck, are you sure this is not a mod? I have never seen this my entire playthrough
Nice idea ! Become polar explorers of planets and moons.
After 200+ hours I've never seen one
Icy bug monster house.
With there being only like 3 POI's that they copy and paste over most of the map, you have to wonder why they went to all the effort of making this for it to only RNG once.
I popped onto the crane and hard targeted the outside then laid mines inside which helped
High place, sniper rifle or you’re in trouble
Why does this look like the ice map from bf2042
Uh... That's not a-

You know what? Nevermind. Forget I said anything.
I like to mention it, to show that the game hides many surprises, but in 400 hours of play, it's something I've never encountered.

I can add it to my long list of things I've never seen (and still haven't)
I found one next to Red Mile, amazing experience with all the creepy crawlies 'Den mother' 'Queen sister' they were called something like that
I find this POI maybe once every playthrough. Though I've still never found the party spaceship.
What the heck. I thought that I had discovered all of the poi’s in this game. Gotta get back out there I guess.
And here I am, getting 3 cryolabs in a row, while this behemoth is in the pool...

Please BGS, fix this.
Crazy to think their still using fossils fuels 300 years into the future.
Man... still lookin' for one of these...
I'm level 151 on NG+11 and I've never seen one. Guess I'll be on the lookout.
Ze ice is melting at Ze pøwlz
Just found this one as well. Several hundred hours into this game. IMO best POI in this game. Very well done.
Why is an offshore rig on land? Did the oceans evaporate, or did the art designer not understand the concept of an offshore rig and decided to place it where it would absolutely make no sense?
I’ve found several. Great place to get XP.  Found some in 50lvl systems with 100lvl mobs.
Are they NG+ only?
There are WHAT NOW??? (Sure Neon was built on one but are these new???)
Are these exclusive to NG+?
100% the rig from battlefield 2042 lol zipped up that crane cable once or twice
Wait, you can get into this thing? 

How? My backpacks never had enough juice to get high enough.
I never thought about going outside new Atlantis….
I just completed the campaign and I've never seen one
I want to find one now
I havent played for quite sometime. Stopped playing about a month into it. Loved the game, just not as explorative as NMS. May jump back in and see whats changed.
I've only run into this one twice in 6 NG+es. I'm sure I'd find it more often if I actively looked for it, but it's one of the more interesting dungeons.
I didn't even know there was an oil rig.
I wish these abandoned facilities were repairable and operable. I want to be come a tycoon.
Just wait till you find THAT oil rig
Oh, you're gonna have a great time in there, trust me
Is this a new addition to the game? I haven’t played in months after finding tbe game for really boring after maybe 100 hours. Everything is so repetitive. I wish AI could design buildings and structures so in a galaxy like this no two were even close to the same. There’s only a handful of structures and are all exactly the same. Too repetitive. 

I hope with DLC and updates the game ends up being a lot better. I thought it would be the next fallout . The base building system is horrible. Why isn’t there a system to build whatever shape you want as the main structure? Instead they have a few different pods to start with and then just add stuff inside? Ugh. Drives me crazy sorry I just had such high hopes for the game
Veray-specific[ song start to play.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytihRL-DnI0)
That’s a fun one
From the outside it looks big but this is fairly small dungeon
Wait. Reading the comments, is this POI meant to be rare or uncommon?

I ask because I came across 3 of them on my first playthrough. 

None on Jemison though. But one was on the very first random planet I visited when I decided to just go exploring.

In fact, I think I've seen more than 3 around. I just went inside 3 of them, but others I've walked past because I knew what to expect. So I thought this was a pretty common POI.

But looking at other comments, apparently it's not?
I found one just cruising through an icy planet.I couldn’t get on, every time I took the elevator up, then started walking on the platform past a certain point I would just fall down through it and get stuck there. Tried multiple times. Ultimately gave up because I got tired of trying from my last save. This was before I got close to even getting to killing the starborn. Still haven’t even gotten to unity yet. Going around helping adrenja make amends. Haven’t played in 3 weeks, I have just been so damn busy with work.
First one I found was on a cold biome, higher gravity and higher lvl planet.   It was night time, low on ammo, running solo as well.  Saw it and went, “hey, maybe it’s a friendly colonist outpost!”  You know, sell off some gear and buy some ammo.  Yep, was not the colony outpost I first thought it was. . .
If you mostly stick to exploring planets and moons with lots of flora, fauna, and resources, you might never find one. But I got the bug of exploring more and more desolate moons early on, since they were easier to complete -- so I could turn in the exploration reports for credits faster. These tend to be on the colder, more desolate moons.
That’s awesome. Never seen one before or even heard about oil rigs in the universe. Now I want to find one lol. 

What’s the horror about it? Zombies drilling for oil or an Armageddon moment where “Hey Harry. NASA find oil on Uranus man!?”
I never even knew of this
Been there before.
I found one once on a very distant planet, .___. It was hell...
Have bullets... loooots of bullets
That's cool, never even heard of these before.
Oil you said?, load your best weapons and deliver some democracy!

I found that early in my save and was a nightmare. I've found It after NG+ with my supersoldier and cleaned It fast. Love It both ways
What’s in em?
A military nation above and apart from all - the true outer heaven
This game sucks why does it keep showing up on my feed?
850hrs so far and seen it maybe 3 times. As creepy as Entangled without the annoying back and forth. Love it. Funny I feel like the pacifier was made for this dungeon. High capacity, fletchette rounds; solid get out of my face meat grinder gun.
Really? Wow. I found one just randomly wandering mid- game, still need to finish it. 

Guess my RNG just hit earlier
I found one around lvl 15-20 on a new character and was like... Nah, I'm good.
So- can you sell the oil?
On my first playthrough I found quite a few of them. Pretty grueling
I found my first one in my first game at the START I was not, I repeat NOT prepared for these damn face hugger flying squirrel spiders.
Found 3 on my first run, 2 times on an a planet without any atmosphere.... Which broke inmersion. 

But then again in my run I swear in each planet I would find like 10 biolabs with the robot that has coffee
I found one on a low-gravity moon.  The ability to fly around really nerfs the experience.
Shame its so damn hard to find, I'm in NG+11 with 200+ hours played and haven't seen it once.
It's easy when you find the good perches to safely pick them off from. 

It's even more fun when you find this POI on a planet with really low gravity, and you can just float around like an AC-130, raining down death & destruction.
Truly a rite of passage
I’m excited!  I want this sort of experience.  I’m going to peace out and try to avoid spoilers until I can find such a PoI in game!  :D
There’s a really cool abandoned/infested farm that you can find on planets with life-supporting biomes, where the planet’s apex predators have taken it over.

I only came across one on a planet where the main predator was these really cute dinosaur thingies, but I’ve seen it on YouTube where someone find one on Jaffa II and the place was crawling with the terrifying cloaked hunting coral crab things (think Starship Troopers bugs with predator cloaking). Kinda wanna find one of those.
Yeah it really is a missed opportunity. I think most of the POIs are solid but I run into the same handful over and over. There needed to be some system built in to help you experience more of a variety.

I just recently got the achievement for visiting every star system, and apparently there are still encounters and POIs I haven't seen before and that's a bad thing lol
Exploration is never driven by an insight or any  kind of push, it needs to be an answer to a genuine question in the mind of the explorer, something like : what is out there ? 
Starfield certainly does that very well..
I ran into one for the first time this week. I think on a Lvl 65. “Raised Mining Platform” I think was the label. It was full of large white spiders and a few boss spiders. Definitely need some crowd control but not that bad.
Abandoned Drilling Platform I think? I’m probably wrong though.
Abandoned mining platforms. You usually find them on poles of planets or the moons with one or two resources and nothing else.
Awwwwww... yep got robbed.  First time I opened the hallway it was a wave! Explody shotgun saved me. Go explore the outer systems.  Just be careful.  75 means 75.
Sisters ??? Am I missing something ??
oof yea low level on jemison with u already lvl 50…it was always gonna be easy. my first time was on a lvl 65 planet and i was only like lvl 30 lmao
Man there had to be at least 50-70 of those things when I went. It was early on too so I didn’t have shit to use against them lol
Go high, and run far... they are fast and can practically fly...
Planet influences level.

I did my first Abandoned Mining Platform on one the moons in the Maal system (level 60 system) and the swarm sisters were level 70. And the swarmers…. Genuinely *swarmed*. Easily dozens.

Many, many 7.77mm rounds were fired.
I would say it is a combination of both, being Jemison an entry level planet plus your high level for it. When I was looking for it I was visiting the frozen moons and poles of planets on the far right side of the map. At the time I was around level 120 and that swarming was something, died once actually.
Honest question. How the heck do you get in there? Is there an elevator somewhere or something to get up inside it?
Wait until you find one on a level 75 planet. WAY more fun!
Same here, even on the level bit.  Dynamic Universe mod would’ve been nice, but I’m on console and mods weren’t available then…
Yeah dude you got robbed. I think being on Jemison might have screwed you because it was a low-level system. 

For some reason mine was right outside of the Red Mile, I was a high level so it didn’t provide as much of a challenge but it was far better than what you got. Perhaps a NG+ will help you find a better opportunity.
No, because Jemison is level 1-5 so the enemies scale to that level.
OIL?! *loud America noises*
Genuinely a terrifying POI if you're not very well geared.
Just found my first one, it's called "Abandoned Mining Platform" not Oil Rig, though it looks kinda like an irl oil rig. I found it with the Scanner once I landed, didn't see it from orbit. The one I found was on Eridani VIII-b, the moon where Galbank first sends you to collect some back debt from the guy, but it's probably random on planets. The map icon looks mostly white with a cone of black drill bit stripes at the top.
Best advice so far! Add in the Bedlam mod which spawns reinforcements and you have yourself a party!
I think they *need* the Frozen Plains biome feature, which are what you find on polar ice caps and frozen moons.

On top of this, they seem to be more prevalent on planets without a breathable atmosphere. This might simply because other POIs need said atmosphere so the procgen has less possible POIs to generate if you’re on a frozen moon, and as a result are more likely to place the platform.
Lol. This kind of annoyed me in the game, because you can't land on it.
That would be cool. I wish that Volii (the water planet where Neon city is located) had some more platforms dotted around the planet. 

So you could fly to multiple locations, but you're still totally surrounded by water. Also be cool if the water had some dangerous creatures too.
I think they're only on icy planets. I found them just by randomly exploring.

It's been a while since I played, but from memory all the planets I saw them on had snow/ice around.

Also, I think they're usually quite close to bodies of water. 

The first one I saw, I definitely landed near a coastline. Because, after landing, if I looked one direction, I could see the ocean. And looking the opposite direction, I could see the mining platform.

So maybe try and find planets with a frozen surface and aim to land on a coastline. Good luck!
Nope, it's been in from the start. Best POI in the game. Land on lots of frozen moons with no astrosphere and you will find it eventually
Nope I saw multiple on my first playthrough. Maybe I got lucky, but I found one on the very first planet I went to when I went off exploring (not doing missions).

Like every other POI, there are multiple of these in the game. The first time was exciting (especially because I was a low level). The other times not so much.
When you say "RNG once" - are you saying it only appears once in the game, or once on a planet?

I ask, because I encountered this on multiple different planets. But lots of the comments are making it seem like it's a super rare POI.
From memory, the ones I encountered were always near a coastline. So maybe the water levels on those planets had gone down dramatically?
Nope. They're also found in the first playthrough. 

It's weird, I encountered multiple of these on my first playthrough. My first one very early in my game. 

But it seems other commenters haven't seen any 🤷
There's an elevator in one of the legs at the opposite end from the landing platform.
Go [here](https://new.reddit.com/r/Starfield), on the right where it says "about community" click the 3 dots, then MUTE STARFIELD. 

&#x200B;

Congratulations, you now have the power to control your feed. I don't think there is a mute on old.reddit, so I always go to new.reddit to do mutes.
i got lucky my first playthrough as well lol but it is a bit rare
Didn't find the haunted ship till ng4+
Found the American 🤣😂 sorry, couldn't help myself
There is no oil; there is only Zuul.
Actually, they are called abandoned mining platforms, so it makes sense for them to be on planets without an atmosphere.
Try snowy areas on the North or South poles of planets.
I exclusively found this one over and over one day and got so frustrated I quit for a month. Found 6 in a row
Yeah I found this POI to be pretty easy honestly, they don't shoot at you or anything you can just get up high and pick them off.  They don't seem to have great perception either, inside I see them before they see me generally.
Game could use more jump scares. Like the subway tunnels in metro.
So Stalkers from Helldivers? (Still Starship Troopers)
What.

Exploration is legit driven in part by stuff like potential settling and the like.  And gameplay wise if you want the player to be engaged you have to give them some sort of hook of any kind to the real cool places. Starfield's problem is that you have all these unique POIs that are governed solely by RNG and practically never come up. It's actual content a player may never find because there is no reliable way to actually access it!
Only spider things I've come across was when i went with Barret for his quests
You're prob not wrong. Apparently i need to play this game more n longer
Imma look for these tonight
I opened the door, tossed in a bunch of grenades, and closed it again lol
Guessing you haven't found this POI... they're referring to a mob in the abandoned oil rig.
I went to max level systems at level 35 on hard difficulty. Definitely made me have several adrenaline spikes, that’s for sure.
I was low level on an ice planet the first time I found one and it was like that.  I was freaking out the whole time! Now at lvl 300+, not so much.
Yeah elevator on one of the legs I believe
I’ve never seen an elevator on any of the legs. Usually just use scanner and teleport there lol
One of the uc abandoned bases drops three waves of reinforcements once you hit a certain threshold (not sure what it is though. It can get pretty intense lol
Son of a.... Thanks.
I had no idea they were rare, and the one I found was actually really easy
HUH I got that at level 12 😭that’s wild, but I did spend like 3 hours one night just constantly jumping systems just exploring
Haunted ship?
S’true! 😁
Leave ZUUL out of this. He wants nothing to do with those oil rigs. They give even HIM the heebee jeebee's.
LOL!
Anywhere in particular I should check, feel like oil rigs would need you know oil to be possible of existing which would require a planet to have life, or has life at some point.
Well apparently you must love exploring the icy poles of many worlds, as opposed to me who has seen it zero times lol
Whatever the name of the derelict ship is, with the infestation of the same species, is a lot more spooky.
[Sort of](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSodiumStarfield/s/4pJFwY3Nyq), just the hunting variant never drops its cloak.

They’re everywhere on Jaffa II and they’re genuinely fast.
They're similar creatures to those but there are bigger ones too
Don’t worry you’ll eventually find one
Correction: Abandoned Mining Platform
I had no idea what was coming in that hallway, So I went for my old faithful when all hell brakes loose. Hornet's nest on a shotgun clears the hall
I need to find it
Thank you for answering me and not being a typical Reddit dick about it. I’ve never seen that POI
OK, well either way. I appreciate the advice from both of you.
Wait. What? I feel like I've missed something in the game. You can teleport?!
The more the merrier!
I’ve found half a dozen in my first playthrough. Got my first one as my first POI after Kreet. That being said, I’m 350 hours in one universe, no Unity yet.

Getting a night time oil rig directly after the abandoned lab on Kreet and I was seriously questioning if the game was a horror game.
I came across one of these so early in my playthrough that I couldn't figure out how to get into it so I wandered off and haven't seen once since then. I'm level 135 now, sure wouldn't mind stumbling into one again!
I landed near one about 20 hours into my first. Was chaos
Yeah, once you start exploring like that time, it seems to fly by in Starfield
Yeah, my first run hit all the systems. I didn't see it. I found out about it on this sub
👻
I'm American as well so it was easy to spot 🤣 our govt is such a joke when it comes to oil 🤦🏼‍♂️
They aren't oil rigs. They're called abandoned mining platforms. And they're in cold/desolate moons mostly.
They only spawn in snowy biomes, like the second cryo lab where you have to drop down the skylight and blow up the ice to enter.
Yeah it's not that deep. I mean, lore wise you'd think that, but OP found one on Jemison, and you'd think the UC would want to clean up this mess. I've found them all over the place, but only in snow + Pole. But it is also random.
Oh I found that one. Isn't that a reference to Alien/Aliens?
I haven't run into that one yet.
I found one!
Don't read too much about it... going in blind is a great time. Found on ice planet.
No problem, I know it's a fairly rare one to come across
Teleport aka “Fast Travel” lol
I probably got RNG lucky. All spacers and reaaalllyyy low level. 
Haunted ship? I haven't heard of this either. We need to know. Pls explain.
Odd, I've found several of them, didn't realize they were something special
Maybe, it's kind of a generic monster origin backstory.
It's fun, and adds to the backstory of that particular species.  There are a handful (3+ I think) of locations in the game that have slates and recordings detailing the history of that organism.
Yay!
How was it?
What are they called ?
You'll know it when you hail it
lol the experience of it happening for the first time is what makes it so fun. Don’t spoil it for yourself, just keep exploring lol
Seriously.  I have ignored several of these.  Knowing that I'm missing out on a potential pucker-worthy POI is disappointing.
It felt like Barretts questline where those spider things come after you in the mines
There is a mob called The Swarm Sister.
A woman accused of killing her 4-year-old son is arrested and lies horribly in the process.
Child was stabbed 41 times and found on the side of the road.


"I left my son with a friend and I asked her if she could watch him for like 12 months"
“The only drug I use is meth” 

We’ll that’s good. Had me worried there that she was smoking weed or somthing.
This is not even cringe it's just fucked up.
“You have blood on your shoes” - first 5 minutes god damn
Left son with long time friend, doesn't know where her friend lives, no address, no phone number. Terrible liar
She stabbed that baby at least 16 times and she stood there showing absolutely no emotion.

This is heartbreaking not cringe.

[deleted]
i live about 30 minutes away from where this happened and the entire thing is incredibly tragic. everett is known for being sketchy but an atrocity of this sort is quite uncommon. her poor son… my heart breaks for his innocent soul. he deserved so much better. she’s a sick monster and the worst punishment possible wouldn’t be enough. so, so sad 😓
Even with the title, I didn’t expect her to be *that* bad.
This seems heavy for r / cringe, my dude.
Deranged and scary more than cringe.
That beep censoring was fucking abrasive lol.
I’m not cringing at this, I’m super sad and angry.
Wife beating and child killing equaling cringe to posters on this sub is troubling to say the least lmao
Her mother was coming to take custody of her grandson, but rather than let her have him, she killed him, and left him on the side of the road.  The mother had filed for an emergency minor guardianship, saying her daughter had a long history of drug & alcohol abuse, and she feared for his safety.
Wow!!! Geeze poor baby that's disheartening that woman is pure evil!
I'm glad she didn't do the smart thing and say "I'm not saying anything without a lawyer" because this means she's going to absolutely get everything she deserves 
Yeah this is why we have subs like r/noahgettheboat and r/awfuleverything
She actually says she dropped her son off at the fictitious woman’s house. Besides being an utter monster, she’s dumb as rocks. 

Poor little boy. I have a 4yo son and he is the sweetest, cutest little thing who relies on me for everything. I can’t imagine ever hurting him. This woman isn’t even human.
You have to be so brainrotted to think of murder as cringe
I personally caught her at least 10 lies…she verbally contradicted herself about every aspect. Those cops were waaay too patient. Should have been calling her out on those inconsistencies to break her down. She was too comfortable. 

I hope they took her phone and found the messages to her ‘sister.’ Like: ‘I just gave the cops your number and you have to pretend you’re so-and-so and that you have my kid and he’s ok’
At no point in this conversation does she realize the police are there for a very specific reason?
Anyone have more on the outcome here? This is the worst attempt at BSing I’ve ever seen.
Can someone explain this to me:  
Cop: "What's the address?"

Mother: "I don't know you have to write it down."

I mean I know she's being a total liar and redirecting questions but wtf does that mean.
I wish humans would stop having children. We had a good run, leave it to the animals and plants now.
ACAB.
I read this comment before watching the video and thought it was a joke.
i also don't know where she lives but i did drive there and leave my car randomly lol i'm so random
Great friend 
Xanny the Nanny has been out of work for a while. Between Casey Anthony and this woman, she's not very good.
😂😂😂
Yeah. Cringe is embarrassment. This is too unhinged to be in the realm of embarrassment.
More fit for r/iamatotalpieceofshit
“Yea, I know.  My son fell.”

“Oh no…”
Oh and I deleted everything.
41 separate ‘sharp force injuries!’ 

What a total piece of shit.
The attorney trying to bullshit her way out of it is hilarious lol
Had my first child recently, this kind of stuff makes me feel physically ill now.
Youll see a ton of karma-farmers and repost bots posting hate-adjacent and 'extreme' content with violence or gore to subs like this. it normalizes the content and drives engagement and narratives to more divisive things like politics and whatnot.

Some of the biggest accounts on this platform are state actors. Look up the internet research agency.
Normally I'd agree but this video is slammed with amazing lines.
It’s always sketchy near military bases.
What is sketchy about Everett? I only drove through on my way to Vancouver once on a road trip so that have no idea what this place is really like
Very sad.
I skipped the middle bit and every time I skipped ahead it was just more bleeps. 😄
I think the cringe part is her lying, not the murder.
[deleted]
Yeah then I drove here.  Took 2 hours.  Actually no, I left the car.  Took the bus.  Pretty affordable!
"I delete everything all the time."
Right it’s like I hardly heard about horrible things like this before I had my son. Now it’s all over constantly. and I just can’t comprehend how people go through the whole pregnancy process, give birth and then just treat these children like they’re worthless when all they wanted was to be loved and cared for…. Something is seriously wrong that this is happening so fucking much
Me too. Literally haunts my thoughts
Why is that? I have noticed that also
homelessness, drugs, property crime, some gang activity as well. i don’t want to make it out to be an absolutely treacherous, crime-ridden city because it does have a lot of charm and history, but just like any bigger city, it has its issues.
Cringe is the last thing i feel watching this tbh. Disgusted and rage are up there though. Hope she rots.
Ah, good point. It was just sooo frustrating to watch that happen. I’m not ‘pro-LE’ but I would have loved to see her get caught in her lies.
Got it. Seemed like a nice place when I drove through but I could only see so much from the road.
So they really slapped this into the dialogue in the beginning so they could sell it with the collectors edition…
Barrett gives it to you, you open the front door, and it’s never seen again unless you’re wearing the constellation spacesuit…

No where near as impactful or iconic as the Pip-Boy
The occasional “cool watch” catches me off guard
I won’t lie, I completely forgot that thing existed
You have run out of oxygen
And in your room at The Lodge there’s a watch case you can pick up, that does nothing and is just useless junk.
The "Est 2188" is really gonna confuse some archaeologists some day
The watch is: 

1) your scanner  
2) your time/planet details in the bottom left  
3) your destination tracker  
4) your “map”  

It’s the HUD you see at any point. But I do wish they had the animation of you bringing up your wrist like the Pip-Boy…
I was really hoping for pip boy style space-pirate radio channels. This is my biggest disappointment with the watch.
Only time i ever heard of it was my first time through. Something about the watch giving you access to the lodge. Havent heard a peep about it since. Which begs the question... in NG+ how are you able to just walk into the lodge....
I left Vasco in the lodge my entire playthrough & after coming back from the Unity, I started talking to him about everything & he mentioned outposts and stuff & then he goes, "the schematics should be on your watch" or something like that, & I was like "huh? oh yeah, I completely forgot that was a watch" lol.

To me, it's just our minimap compass thing.
Well, yeah it would be nice if it was around like the pip boy but hey its face is down in the corner
I still want it….
Technically it's the only piece of gear you keep after going thru the unity.
It is literally your HUD in the lower left. It's present for the entire game.
It's in the corner of your screen at almost all times. What more do you want?
i mean it gives you an in universe reason to have a hud, i think that’s something
While I agree with your post…

That is a pretty dope watch.
When Barrett says, "...and look, it even fits", or something along those lines.

I mean, yeah...

...it's a watch.

Not a glass slipper.
Also, the animation at the front door of the Lodge is bugged, it doesn't matter what clothes you have, it will show your raw arm
The watch interface is displayed in the corner of your screen pretty much all the time. Yeah... they really "slapped that" in almost every second of the entire game.
It's never seen again?  The fuck do you think is represented by the thing in the bottom left corner of your screen the entire game?
Wait till you see where they put our maps that are coming “soon”
Honestly the case that it comes in is cooler than the actual watch
Looks good on you, choom
I seriously wish that there’s was a 2 second animation of your character lifting his wrist/watch up to the screen where it would become full screen for the player menu. Would’ve been sleek and immersive. I know Bethesda menus get a lot of slack but fallout 4s pipboy was a joy to use as it was immersive, pretty quick, and expressive with lots of animations and fun details (the pipboy games were such a cool extra gimmick). I think starfield has a decent menu but inarguably a step back from fallout 4 in many ways.
Should have gave us an Xbox or some other Easter egg to put in our apartments instead of the watch case.
I love the watch and wish it was featured more in the game. I'm mostly disappointed mine almost instantly broke, and it's been months of dealing with support trying to get it replaced. For such an expensive collectors edition it's been a bummer to not have the main reason I got it.
see personally , i do like the watch both irl and in game

and i also loved pip boy

some people are saying "we cant use it like pip boy" yes that is true to some degree...

imagine being hundreds of years into the future and wearing implants and spacesuits and having visor but still have to LOOK down on your wrist to see your o2 levels ?? cmon

so i think it is good that we have the on screen view (i like to think its some kind of widget on our contact lense retina or something) xD

HOWEVER i still think pipboy was better because you could interact with it ... we cant interact with this watch , cant look at it or make calls with it or set destination for the holographic map the watch pops up for us (it doesnt) ...

so much couldve been done with this watch , JUST like the other things xD
My guy it’s LITERALLY the bottom left HUD. You see it constantly. You also see it in several space suits (Mark 1 off the hop of my head)
Oh, it was in all of the marketing before the game even dropped, there are videos of them from years ago wearing prototypes of the watch, the watch was integrated into the game rather than a real life version being made. The watch is a marketing gimmick, it's entire existence is marketing.
It’s a nice watch. Enjoy!
Gimmick yes. But honestly, been using it like an everyday watch now.
You can have it  as a frame in photo mode, but thats really it.
I wonder if they have a face based on that for the Galaxy Watch.
Still waiting for my replacement.  Mine was DOA..  Bethesda has approved replacing my defective watch but are currently “awaiting new stock”.  I feel like I’ll never see it.
When I first seen the watch I assumed it would be used exactly like the Pip-Boy but was sadly mistaken…
I have one and wish it would connect to the game and show what planet I’m on or something
I just bought the watch face from the Play Store and called it a day.
I personally dig the watch IRL. How much is that sucker?
Looks cooler than the gameplay
The one good thing I found about the watch was that it gets great battery life due to not being loaded with bloatware and adware.  That said I completely regret buying the constellation edition and just haven't been motivated enough to sell the watch/case.
Blows my mind they didn't use it like the Pip-Boy from Fallout. Or at least give us the option, like in 76. Like y'all have the tech for it, had it for years. Just give us the animation! lol. The watch looks sick! Would make it just more immersive. Maybe one day...
I loved my Chronomark!

…when it worked. I reached out to Bethesda and they said they will ship me a new one as soon as more are done being made.
Just like everything else in Starfield. They thought about how to market the game before they thought how to make the game good.
Mine stopped working....
I thought about this too. Was neat when I saw that scene and thought "oh that's cool! Like a pipboy!" And then never saw it again the same. Like you never look at it again on your wrist but yeah it's the UI in the bottom left but that's it.
There's also a kid on uh... Europa? Or some other moon in the Sol system that has a line of dialogue that says "hey cool watch!" first time you go there. It's the first colony in space they made, I think.
I needed to know the time for a mission (weapons thief in Akila City) and was wondering how to see it when I remembered the watch. There is no way to access it! That watch has no purpose at all. Btw you can see the time in the menu, top left corner
I'd rather be able to download that face design onto an existing smartwatch than wear that junky-looking thing.
I bet it wasoriginally supposed to have way bigger role, NPCs  have dialogue about it and all that. Maybe they actually wanted to ingrate some menus into the watchike it was pip boy or idk but well as everything in this game I guess it was left unfinished.
Still smart as fuck
I was really hoping it would be the starfield pipboy
Yap... They could have used it as a pip boy with holographic projector and see the menu but that would be too much work for Bethesda.
It's literally in the bottom left of your screen at all times
I forgot about this entirely. And I'm a watch guy.
Just wait until TES6's menu is built around a magic stone object, and then Bethesda will sell us literal rocks for $150.
They should add a watch face that matches what you see on the hud when on a planet, ie the planet name and atmospherics.
Do you really need them to keep referencing the watch in game to justify your purchase?
And it worked by the looks of it..
It does give you planetary information in game.
Also said "it even tells the time" but it actually *doesn't* in-game.
Yea it’s weird they don’t even just animate it going to your face and use the menu ui so it feels somewhat relevant
I even forgot that I paid for a DLC that I still have zero updates on. Heh
It even tells the time.
It’s also given in the non-repeatable intro mission that you can never do again in any of your NG+ saves.
It's a sci fi game....set in the future....where we have no pets, no email, no wireless communication, no cameras, no television...and yet we have watches. The one piece of technology that humans took with them when they left earth was...watches. 

But, just the one watch. Because no other NPC or any other member of Constellation wears a watch in the game.
It's pretty useless
I actually really like the watch. I use it more than i play the game, lol. Its not special, but i really like the look and minimal interaction that it has. So i look on it as i bought an overpriced plastic watch that looks cool and comes with a space game.
You guys do realize this is seen at all times but it's just the HUD in your bottom left, right? That's why HUD is the way it is. It's just the watch face visible on screen at all times
It’s a pretty awesome watch. The built in temperature gauge and barometer are pretty amazing features for a watch. They’re going for $250+ on EBay (Which is wild because the entire Constellation Edition is $199 at Walmart right now)

If you paid the all time low price of $125 on Amazon for The Constellation Edition, you got a pretty killer deal for that watch.
The circle HUD element on bottom left is the screen of this watch. You are presumed to be using it as a compass, watch, health monitor, and all that other stuff this particular HUD element does. It even does tell the time of day(or rather, sol) in the point where you are, although in a quite obscure manner - the planet in the center displays how the planet is illuminated, with center being your location on it. So if the line separating white and black parts is moving towards the center - the sunrise or sunset is close. 

It looks different on the IRL replica because it needed to be re-done to be functional for IRL purposes, not gameplay purposes
You see it everytime you open the menu...it's your pip-boy in this game....
I think they spent more time making the actual watch and marketing the collectors edition with it than they did any of the actual content or questlines in the game.
Well hey, if you don't want it I'll buy it off ya for five bucks. 

Five bucks means it isn't worthless, eh?
Personally, I think it's a pretty nice watch.
You haven't walked much today.
Could have given it the ability to send and receive brief text messages from other Constellation members over interstellar distances. So it is sort of this mobile mission hub that keeps you invested in the story.

Just hand wave it as some tech they invented that uses microscopic shavings from the artifacts. So it’s impossible to mass produce or make without destroying the artifacts. So they keep its existence secret.
Mods will probably fix that. But i wanted the watch to work like the Pip-Boy. Also, i didn't know that the watch was visible while wearing the Constellation's Spacesuit... It's unfortunate though. I mostly run woth just clothes, and only wear a Spacesuit when i really need it.
It’s literally the pause menu lol
Honestly wished it became the pip boy of starfield. Or maybe had some other function
I thought it is gonna be a bigger deal. Like i thought we were gonna see stats from the watch when we are in first person mod but they didn't want to do anything with it. I loved how it looks when i first  see this watch but now i forgot about it.
Yep. Where we see it a whopping ONE TIME.
I feel like in the SF universe you could have something more than a smart smartwatch. Like a modern PipBoy
Really surprised this wasn’t akin to a Pipboy like in the fallout series. Such a missed opportunity.
guaranteed this was a last minute marketing cash grab. just part of their go to market plan.
Yeah. I think the free passes for Bethesda are just about used up. I forgave Fallout 76, but Starfield and this recent news about New Vegas 2 being rejected? A knife to the back, no more trust for BGS.
Imagine the suckers that bought this.
Starfield couldn't even match Goldeneye, which came out in 1995 lol
Honestly if you didn't learn your lesson with the canvas bag Fo76, you deserve to be taken advantage of with this stupid-ass watch
I literally forgot this was a thing. Yeah this thing will never stand up to the pop boy. Mostly because the pip boy was well planned by writers and devs who cared. This thing is here for the collectors edition
I wanted to like Starfield so badly. I put literal days of game time in, because I NEEDED it to be good. In the end, I decided to boot up Skyrim on a whim. After 15 minutes playing that… Going back to Starfield was very disappointing. I’m so bummed this game is so… empty and boring…
I wish to remind you the "bag" that bethesda promised
This sub will bitch about anything, no matter how mundane or irrelevant.
I thought it would be some sort of pip boy thing but it really just appears for seconds and then never again.
It's literally on your hud the entire game unless you turn it off. 

Agree it's not as iconic as pip boy but I could recognize the layout in a heartbeat after playing the game for a few hours.
I didn't even realize one was in game. I wonder how soon before someone mods it to behave like a pip boy to get to the menus.
Is it at least a good watch?
Personally i assumed our health hud was the watch the entire time now i feel like a dumbass lol it made sense that it worked like a pipboy i mean its a circle exactly like it and has the stamina bar
Sadly I regret having bought the collector’s edition, if the game was at least good…
I wish the physical watch connected to the game.
Right? I thought it would actually mean something in game. Couldn’t have been more wrong and swindled by a collectors edition. Sadge
Could easily be made into the games menu as a holographic interface.
Dude it's super integral, it tells you about the air conditions and freezing temperatures on almost every planet that are completely impossible to avoid even with the best gear.
It would have been great if it was like a holographic pop-up menu like the pipboy just futuristic. Or if you could see it while holding weapons kind of like MW1.
Do you get a loading screen before it gives you the time lol?
That credstick USB drive looks pretty cool too. I wonder how much that is on ebay by itself.
It was a quick moneygrab. As was the Starfield itself, just another moneygrab before they start making their big games. I got scammed, you got scammed, we all got scammed.
Dude these guys making this game are obviously not the same people who made skyrim or fallout. A bunch of idiots must of let them go thinking they didn't deserve the paycheck, and wanted to use their past success to make themselves rich while treating us the customers as a bunch of idiotic video game players. It's clear these new people have no respect or understanding, and are just greedy fucks. Fuck em.
They wanted it to be part of the pip boy idea, but it didn't make any fkkn sense. If you look at the menu it's round and shaped like a watch kinda. They tried to mix different styles together and it didn't work. Modern smart watch with NFC combined with NASA punk analog knobs and switches? Just another example of no cohesion.

Not to mention all the black people saying, damn, I didn't know my arm was white. That only passes QA when you have all white company lol.
I was hoping that it would interact with the game you know? Like it would show what planet or moon in game, your on or tell you your in game status of health.
According to Emil, we shouldn’t criticise this because game dev hard and consumer stupid. (s/)
This is part of the immersion breaker for me. Also, ever notice that the view never changes no matter what your helmet is? It's like you're never wearing one at all. 

Damn, it's like it's a million little things that just take you out of the element.
So did you buy the collector's edition or just wanting to rain on people's parade who bought one? Just asking for clarification.
You see it and use it all the time, it’s the compass thingy in the lower left corner of the screen.
Yours hasn't broke yet?
Wait NPCs say that?
I remember this and legit thought “what watch?” Didn’t hit me until I saw this post.
So did the devs.
I'm kinda surprised it's not on the character model outside of the space suit.

It's way less invasive that the pipboy.

Oh! And hmthe watch is visible ON (yes...) The constellation spacesuit.
Honestly upset that I couldn't use it to tell the time in game...
lol exactly my point
It’s the HUD
Also turning your ship engine low to avoid enemy ships
I was hoping it’d be like the pipboy and when you press B you’d pull it up like a watch. But, y’know.. It not existing at all Ingame works too I guess
Uh, I use it all the time to tell me about environmental dmg!
/s
It’s literally the HUD, how?
Oh that thing. I think they forgot they made a big deal about it in the pre launch material.  You know what would actually be helpful… a surface map that doesn’t look like they spent 5 minutes developing and forgot to get back to it.   Pick any other game and the map is better.  So bizarre.
Its your scanner. Its in the corner of the hud
Same.
I didn't even know it existed
😵
Until you accidentally throw a grenade at it and it flies underneath the dresser and you can’t pick it up anymore.
So art imitating life. We've come full circle.
But you can *decorate* with it
Didn’t realise you get a room at the lodge, I’ll check it out next time I’m in new Atlantis
It's not useless. I mean, it is but if you have the exact same case with your Constellation edition, putting it somewhere in a Starfield home feels a little like breaking the fourth wall. 
The watch itself is a complete trash though. It's something you can buy on AliExpress for like $20.
It’s a unique game item. Far from useless junk
I’m pretty sure the internet will still exist by then. They will probably just google it if they find it lol
YES. I hope the Pip-boy thing is a mod somewhere, or will be made
Yeah I’m confused. It enables the primary info on your HUD. That’s the whole “point” of it. Sure they probably considered having the MC look at their watch everytime they needed to see something but with how often I look at my O2, that would’ve gotten annoying. MC isn’t wearing a helmet 100% of the time so the logic is that the watch is providing this info, not some HUD in the helmet like in Halo.
I think it’s just the map in the bottom left corner. You can use your scanner prior to getting the watch
>But I do wish they had the animation of you bringing up your wrist like the Pip-Boy…

oh sure, and then there'd be 7500 threads about what a time waste that is, and how the devs are lazy, and have no idea how to make a fun game. sure. let's do that by all means..........

i'll also point out that the constellation watch is an actual multi-functional watch; whereas pip-boy was/is an app for a byo phone. so, there's a big difference in developing and selling those two things.

had pip boy, hardly used it. did. not. buy. the. watch. i do however like the constellation skin for the guns. so does sarah. ymmv.
The watch is:

a marketable element to try and cement some iconography in this universe

is it worth criticizing them for missing the mark with this element? probably not. did they absolutely miss the mark with this element? yes.
But couldn’t you scan before getting the watch? Was the UI not there until the watch is handed to you?
**\^This\^**
Yes bring up your wrist to stare at a watch just like FO 3 in tranquility lane. Kinda useless animation to add to check the time in game 😂
I take your point, but isn't really any of those things. Like, they don't show the animation or you engaging the watch to do any of those things. It's just the explanation for why those things exist, sellable, merch form.
It'd be cool if the character actually looked at the watch when you went to the UI. Goldeneye did this in 1997.
You keep your watch from the previous universe...perhaps it just opens every lodge?
Looking at the code it is the pipboy with all functions removoed and a new model
They could have easily explained that as part of your scanner… but they made it a watch that is given in the very beginning and never seen again
Same… I’m not getting rid of it, just wanted to complain
Technically you don’t have it because it only appears in the constellation spacesuit
I think he meant the concept of a watch being on the player, kinda like how the pipboy is an object you see every time you open it up. It’s so forgettable that I totally forget the HUD came from a watch to begin with tbh.
With no meaningful interaction, no animation, no significance other than opening the Lodge for the first time.
THANK YOU!
Yet it doesn't tell time lol
I thought it would be used as some kind of Pip Boy, my disappointment was inmeasurable.
Yeah that’s my point. It could have been a part of your “scanner” that we never see. It’s never mentioned by another character again. The pip boy is constantly referenced by NPCs in fallout, whether uploading a location to your pip boy or telling you to keep an eye on the Geiger counter. It only appears on your wrist to access the lodge for the first time and that’s is
Fallout 4 also had the same similar moment to getting the pip boy in the collector's edition.

I guess gotta capitalize on the hate before people move on to the next game they can trash on.
[removed]
Well an animation for some additional interactions would be nice and make the watch seem more involved.
I mean they could’ve just said it’s part of the scanner that we never see
Absolutely… I’ll make this post complaining about it, but I’m still keeping the thing… 0% chance of me reselling it
Watches aren’t exactly a universal fit lmao
Go put a 55mm watch on your wrist and then repeat your statement. Unless you're Arnold Schwarzenegger or Andre the Giant, that watch ain't gonna fit. 

Watches have sizes that correspond to your wrist size. I like 42mm watches, personally.
That’s funny. My arm was cooked when the animation played for me
I’ve never seen that animation lol
The watch itself is never mentioned again. The UI could have been anything, they probably just changed it to be the watch at the last second, being that the watch is never seen
honestly youve got a point... the case feels SO GOOD
Mine stopped working a month and a half in. Unresponsive, wouldn't charge, wouldn't turn on. I left it off the charger for a few weeks to completely kill the battery, then tried charging it again, and it worked! The watch is sorely missing a hard reset button. I'm pretty sure letting the battery die is the only way to really hard set it and get it working again. Worth a try if yours is having issues.
[deleted]
So it's a highly marketed part of the game and provided to you in protracted dialogue so that you can see the bars in the bottom left of your HUD

they just missed the mark in trying to create new iconography for the universe and thats OK
It’s nice, but I can find little reason to wear it instead of an Apple Watch… it mostly just sits on display in its case
That’s what I’m saying. The HUD is was more recognizable than the watch… the could have just released watch faces for the galaxy and Apple Watch so everyone could enjoy it, and it’d probably be good marketing
It's been out for 3 months mate, calm down 

Most games are out at least 6 months before DLC is even discussed publicly
Except it doesn’t on the UI. You have to open the menu for it.
its on their space suits, but thats it
Desk job 😅
It is, though?  It’s part of your HUD the whole game.
exactly!
Definitely end of leash. Even the backlash and zero nominations and wins don’t get light a fire on their ass? I don’t wanna think about it.
Heh yeah wonder who could’ve done that 😅
i wasnt able to get one of those, but if i did, i wouldnt have cared about the bag... mainly just the helmet
I complain because I care. I hold Bethesda to the standard that they have set for themselves. Shouldnt just blindly follow
I think it's fun to poke holes at something so transparent. We all know why the watch exists, it's a marketable piece of iconography and they already had a similar thing going on with their pip boy toys. What's really funny is seeing how underbaked/underutilized it is, making the entire watch element feel a more artificial than anything else in the game.

sometimes people just wanna shoot the shit and have a laugh
That’s exactly what I’m saying!
That’s my point. They could’ve just released an Apple Watch face that reached a lot more people
creation club for 600 points
Yeah it’s a decent smart watch with some cool features like the magnetometer and accelerometer with 3 axis
It is, you’re correct.
It’s still a good game, just not as good as Skyrim
That would have been cool! The pip boy app was so immersive and instead of building on that, they took a step back
I mean I don’t feel swindled, just a little disappointed
Any plain UI could have done that. It’s never seen on your character unless you’re in the constellation space suit or referenced by any character
EXACTLY! Unless you were the constellation spacesuit, you would completely forget about it
That would be sweet!!
Yea, or tell you how much gravity the plant your on had, or maybe it's atmosphere, oh and then maybe it could have link something link a bar to show your oxygen levels. Oh wait.
I am SO happy view does not change with helmets.   
Like, imagine having your view obstructed where it first wasn't because you changed helmets. Or constant glare effects from the glass.  That's just bad game design.  I absolutely hate it when games use screenspace for effects. Vignettes, obstructing "goggles", oversized huds. Just awful from a design perspective.      

Would have been the first thing I modded out of that was a thing.    
For many obstructing view breaks immersion. Like Metro's breaking gaskmasks, for a lot of people it made the experience less immersive and makes it feel like fighting with a UI instead of enjoying a game.
Personally different helmets affecting my vision would drive me insane. Imagine finding an amazing helmet but your vision is compromised by it. Why would you want that?
try using the broken constellation helmet.
Big this. They missed a lot of opportunity and I can still taste the sourness. I dug fairly deep to look for the good, some the quests held a bit of weight in certain parts but many times just felt lackluster. I've had more fun on indie games and I'm a bgs fan 😅 ah well. Maybe they do a no man's sky/cyberpunk.. although I think their game design actually limits that as well
I bought the collectors edition because I wanted something that I thought would be an iconic part of the game… I don’t regret my purchase, but wanted to voice my displeasure that it’s not featured more in the game… if only the screen is seen all of the time, they could have just made a Apple watch screen for everyone
I baby it
Yeah it's happened handful of times
Also it sits in the lower left corner of the screen the whole game.
Wild, never knew that
Yeah I also completely forgot til this post. I do remember thinking "oh this must be this games version of the pip boy" ...but then it just wasn't. Totally forgot the watch ever existed. Lol.
It's the UI, so I doubt it.
Historically, astronauts have worn their watches outside of their suits.
This watch doesn't watch properly! 😐
It's weird; it *kinda* tells the time but not numerically. The image of the planet that shows as white/black does move in real time to represent the day/night cycle so you can fairly accurately tell the time to a degree but numbers are obviously better.
Watches that don't tell the time.

What's next?  Phones that are stuck on the wall and have no handset for privacy?

Oh wait 🤣
It shows where you're at in the day/night cycle of whatever planet you're on, "showing" you the local time. It would definitely be nice for an exact readout with numbers, though.
Barrett actually says "AND it even tells the time!". Then it can't.
I can't even think of the part in the game where we get a watch lol I have 0 memory of it
[deleted]
Suuuuure
Does this actually work outside of that one quest though? I tried it recently on the Vanguard quest to find the Warlock and he still attacked me when I was about 1k units away from him even though all my systems were 1 pip or none at all.
Yeah I didn't know this was a thing until ng+ and a mission required it or suggested it.
It's still a thing, it's just at your own discretion.
Its never interacted with again. Thats the point. Yes its supposed to be the hud but its pointless and was added just to be merch. Be real.
The HUD isn't a watch though like it was in fallout 3
Relatable
Thought I was the only one, and just bad at keyboard hand placement. So many times I’ve blown up civvies and had to reload so Andreja didn’t think I was a wanton murderer. Or explosively rearranged some poor NPC’s room for them.
So many wasted grenades....
I'm 100% convinced this is a common thing now
I put it in my home office and pretend it’s a laptop
Sorry, my bad. If you talk to Noel she’ll “show you around” and eventually lead you to a room to sleep in.
The safe in there has infinite storage. I'm there every couple of in-game days.
Its literally like the first step in the main mission.. like the first thing to happen how could you not know?
I filled mine with potatoes
The internet might be more fragile than you think
This. I  want my Pip-girl back. 

Yes,... sorry. That was my mod. I mean Pip-boy.
You don't need to explain WHY the main character is able to have a HUD. Most games never explain it. Elder scrolls never explains it, and no ody ever says "why can my character know how tired he is?"
You can’t bring up the scanner prior to getting the watch
Doesn’t Barrett explain that it’s the watch that does the scanner? 

Even if the gameplay doesn’t match the lore, that’s the lore
Make it a settings toggle.  Too long, didn't read all that.
Every time someone has a legitimate criticism or solution to this game one of you sycophants comes running and screeching "THEN EVERYONE WOULD BE MAD ABOUT THE OPPOSITE I PROMISE DONT TRY TO FIX ANYTHING YOU GUUS ARE JUST HATERZ"

Just a pathetic inability to see logic and reason because of a parasocial obsession with a company
>oh sure, and then there'd be 7500 threads about what a time waste that is, and how the devs are lazy, and have no idea how to make a fun game. sure. let's do that by all means..........

It's a literal half a second animation nobody would complay, it's not like the 9 second unskippable cutscene of your character sitting and leaving the control seat of the spaceship, that's worthy of complain and criticism cause it literally serves no porpouse, doesn't hide loading screens or anything, and if it does it's even worse since the whole game would have benefitted a lot from hidden loading screens.
You can't even fast travel without watch. I've tried. I explored the starting area
“Check the time?” 

It would be the menus, like in Fallout games. Inventory, “maps,” power selection, etc
It doesn't have to have an animation for what he said to be accurate. That is not a hard requirement. It's very obviously the watch. How obvious? Very. It looks exactly like it. That's no a coincidence. It's purpose.
Not according to the story. You lose all physical possessions. The only thing that transfers is basically your mind.
A plot hole? In my Starfield?

It's more likely than you think.
Seriously, that’s annoying, would’ve been nice if the watch functioned, even if it was just as a time tool, really annoyed there’s no way to see the sol date
The stone cold truth that no one wants to face is that Starfield is just a reskinned fork of Fallout76 with multiplayer removed.
Yeah I know, honestly until your post I didn’t think of it like that but I do agree with you that it was basically put in to justify the collectors edition, could’ve been the key to our ship or something other than a door key that you see happen once
The scanner is the watch, you just for gameplay reasons xan use the scanner early. Barrett says this.
It's  visible only on the constellation spacesuit. You need it to get into constellation hq.
I get what he was saying, but the pipboy displays all your menus like inventory, player status, etc. It's pretty likely impossible to display all of that information on a watch face. People already complain about the UI when it's full screen.
Are you sure? I could've sworn I've seen it switch to displaying local time before. Can't remember if it's when you have the scanner pulled up or if it just alternates.

Granted, maybe I hallucinated it. But I could've sworn I've seen local time on it.
It is. What do you think your interface is?  It’s the watch.
Yea its an odd choice, as its a watch its under the space suit most of the time.

So like, even if you needed to bring it up to check out planet conditions - you kinda cant?
[deleted]
At least you see the pip boy every time you hit tab for the *rest of the game*

Literally never see the chronomark again. It's never mentioned, you can't see it on your character, you don't see it on anyone else
the watch is the scanner
That’s exactly what they said, yes.
They're usually adjustable, from my experience
39mm Casio A168 my beloved
Right... they commissioned a custom built watch with a custom interface and then changed the interface to be the watch at the last second. That would totally make sense if you don't know anything about product development and production, so I can see why you might think that.
Open the starfield watch app. Go to "Manual" tab. Go to "Troubleshooting" drop down. -> Holding bottom right button for 5 sec soft resets.
-> **Holding bottom right and top right button together for 10 sec hard resets**
Why in the fuck did you buy it then if you weren’t going to wear it and didn’t want it as a cool shelf piece?
On the positive side, you've managed to get yourself some upvotes by complaining about it in a sub dedicated to complaining about the game. Money well spent, if you're into that sort of thing.
What I mean mate is, like the watch, alot of us have probably forgotten about it.

I dont remember buying any other DLC for a game which I had zero information on
If you know how to read the shadows on the planet display, you know what the time is. It takes a second.
My watch vibrated when you submitted that.
It is a cool watch though!  You’re almost out of O2 btw
Who’s blindly following who, though? You’re not pushing back against public opinion in this sub. Your kind of post is easy karma farming and engagement here. Finding new ways to circlejerk and hate on a game you have zero obligation to play or support is wild to me.

Besides, Starfield is new IP and lacks the sort of easily identifiable thing they could make for the collectors edition. A space helmet? They already did that for the Doom collectors edition. People would then just complain about a lack of originality. At least that watch offers some utility. A helmet offers none and would just sit on a shelf. So, yeah, I don’t see where you’re coming from or why it matters at all.
Sarcasm
Can confirm, has happened to me.
Literally was thinking the same thing, they explain that the watch is the hud and scanner
It doesn't even tell time lmao
So what? In most games, UI has nothing to do with any physical object.

I never even realized the UI element was supposed to be an image of the watch, until I saw comments about it on the internet.

Edit: Yes, I'm aware that games have UI of this kind. I have played Fallout, Dead Space, and Halo. I said most games. ***Most*** games, not all games.
It’s one of the least informative UI’s I’ve ever experienced too so they did a swell job.
The HUD doesn't even tell the time...

So they used a watch to represent the HUD, and it shows everything... apart from the actual clock.

They forgot about it lmfao
It makes sense, both in game and historically.

Still weird that the character doesn't wear it... Like, are we to assume the PC immediately attached the watch to his level 1 constellation suit and forget about it?
Tbh it's real hard to use a watch that's under material designed to keep air inside unless you have x-ray vision
It's the one thing I asked it to do
didnt even know that
To be fair, unless you fully start a new save (not ng+) it only happens once, when you first meet Barrett

Edit: I used my characters name instead of Barrett 😅
Dude, the goldeneye 007 pause watch was more immersive than this lol
The pipboy was just a quick animation into the menu, not much better. At least you can see this all the time.
It literally is. That's what the scanner is.
The Warlock was surrounded by plasma turrets with sensors.
One of the very first story missions features it prominently.
there are uses for the ship sneak for sure. Saved my ass a few times.
It's "merch" in a limited amount of Collector's Editions. They make very little money from those editions. It's a neat little thing their marketing team thought to do, that's it. Stop being such a pessimist.

That seems unlikely. It’s probably someone designed the watch, and then they decided it would make Neat collectors item
The HUD is literally the watch face.
😆
Me: Is there a button where I can show respects at this war memorial thing?

Ahh, yes. Andreja, the woman who murdered spacers in her introduction scene and comes from a group of people known for their brutality and harsh ideology, is still just as lawful good as the rest of the companions.
Thats why I equip mines. You just pick them up again. Also, when combined with anti-grav power, you get proximity grenades in whatever flavor you'd like.
She said she was going to show me, but then she just stood there staring at me instead. I had to run around checking all the beds until I found the one that didn't say "owned".
Cheers man🙏
There's a more useful one down in the workshop.
Nahhh and I didn’t know??
In my first playthrough, Noelle's dialogue bugged and jumped right to the conversation about my dad leaving a message and she never showed me to my room, so I had to look for that unowned bed on my own.
It is because, sadly, 90% of gamers now do not read what is going on in the game, they skip dialogue and treat almost everythign as a First person shooter or first person slasher with NPC loot pinatas.

&#x200B;

Its sad.
You'd be surprised how little the average gamer knows unless you breadcrumb trail them to it. The modern gamer is...  


Not very inquisitive.
Not sure wym
I need my pip-broski back
I guess you’re right but nothing wrong with ascribing logic to something in the game. Maybe that was a core part of their initial dev process. 

There are quite a few things where it’s clear they had to abandon some logic for playability but maybe they started with a more logical realistic approach.
Uh.... I mean I know how tired I am at any time.
Are you, like, upset by the fact that they wrote in an explanation for the stylized HUD?

This subreddit is so washed.
right, criticism like... there's a watch and it doesn't come up very much.
um. er. no. totally misread me, and my post. and.. no. thanks for playing tho!
I didn't say it was inaccurate. It's just not really responsive to OP's post. Like, it's one thing to feature the item in the game, a la the pip boy. It's another thing entirely to shoehorn in a 3 second shot to sell merchandise, then justify it by pointing out alleged connections. 

But to your second point - how does it look "exactly" like the watch? Because the UI is vaguely circular?
And ship, and clothes, and...

Not complaining, I just always thought it was a little funny how they were so vague about how the Unity worked, then you pass through and go "oh, so that wasn't EXACTLY what they were saying."

My theory is that the Unity doesn't cause you to forfeit anything you carry/on the ship.  I think the Unity guides you into releasing all of your material posessions but lets you keep the stuff you don't necessarily want, but nneed (watch as a key, suit, ship to survive).
You assume it had a plot to begin with.
Except it still has fallout 3 ,4, oblivion, skyrim and I think marrowind scripts in it to. The codebase goes way back and I am amazed any of it still works
Lmao this is a serious smooth brain take
yeah but you dont have it after going through unity. only the straborn suit
Are you sure? I've never seen it display any time before on the regular display it shows nor the display when scanning. (Also not trying to sound like I'm mocking you by saying "are you sure" lol I just genuinely don't ever remember seeing the time in my 100ish hours or gameplay.)
It *is* but in a way with basically no distinguishing of that concept - compare it to the UI of the Pip-Boy and the difference is night and day. 

I can imagine the Pip-Boy feasibly working and it makes stylised-sense - whereas Starfield's is just uninspired with no design choice indicating you are even currently *using* the watch itself (as opposed to just another menu screen). 

Even digitised icons, the same UI as the watch itself - anything to indicate the fact it's the watch; because the game really doesn't sell me on that fact aside from a lil' minimap that functions strange.
Yes but where as we all were expecting pip boy levels of interactivity we are instead given the one time hand off to activate the hud...
It only appears on the constellation spacesuit, but the watch face being attached to the suit itself. Then for the animation to access the Lodge, it’s on your bare arm with the watch strap
Yes refer to the first sentence of my previous comment. It could’ve easily been there as just UI like the health bar or claimed to be part of the scanner. It wasn’t needed
The watch was clearly meant to be a bigger part of the game/lore/aesthetic, and they struggled to implement it in any meaningful way outside of it being a HUD element. This isn't, like, *bad.* It's just not exactly showing mastery of crafting a consistent universe. Which is understandable, Starfield was a mess up until like, a year ago.
I read this and tried this. It didn't do anything. That is a firmware hard reset, not a dedicated hard reset button. If the firmware is so bugged that none of the buttons work and it won't charge, then the firmware reset procedure won't work, hence the need for a dedicated hardware switch/button.
More money than sense
Space flex
The same reason I got the pip boy edition of FO4. I thought it would be more iconic and a fun piece to wear to show my love for the game… I bet most players forgot what it even looks like
I dunno about you but if a company sold me a game and at the same time or within a few months after said "check out this really nice bit of extra content we've got for you" I'd be a bit pissed that it didn't come with the base game. 

They're likely still working on the DLC and they'll drop some information on it soon enough
reddit notifications on? dedicated
In the trailer they say that they like bringing stuff from the game into real life. Then they talk about how you character uses it to open door and stuff. That actually only happens once. 

I have enjoyed playing the game and I’m disappointed that the watch was not featured as prominently as they made it seem in that trailer. This is a place to talk about the game and this is a point that I haven’t seen mentioned anywhere else.
sorry man i got like 100 people coming for my throat saying the same thing right now...
It kinda does for the planet you're on. The day/night cycle in the center is a clock. Well, more of a digital sundial.
It does tell you the approximation on the local planet
I just learned right this minute.
> In most games, UI has nothing to do with any physical object.

UI representing something in-world is getting more and more common. We always had the Pip Boy, Horizon has the focus, Cyberpunk has Kiroshi optics, etc.
*Sound of lightbulbs turning on*
I mean, fallout…
Have you played fallout? What do you think the Pip boy is lol.
The Metro series has a lot of diagetic UI, to the point that higher difficulties will disable the standard HUD so you have to pull up your character's watch to get certain information instead of it just always being available.
Wait? Really? I was today years old when I learned this.
Diegetic UIs have been a thing for decades.  Some games did them better (has anything topped Far Cry 2's UI) but they're not some new thing that's suddenly fashionable.
So the fact you aren't very observant is Bethesda's fault?
It was a pretty simple concept introduced at the very beginning…
Wow I forgot about that entirely. What a weird UI decision. Why not include an animation where you lift your dang hand up. Also how am I using this in the space suit I'm forced to wear at all times?
It gives you time (daylight/night amount on the planet you're at), gravity, health afflictions and more. What do you mean least informative???
It does give time in the form of showing how much daylight is left.
Especially since it could literally just be a part of the player character skin for the suit.
In the lower left corner is a round circle that displays data about the gravity, atmosphere and (wildly inaccurate) temperature.  Also shows your O2/CO2 levels.

That's the watch.  None of that, including the scanner itself, is available before you get the watch.
I'm surprised you're surprised about this.  This game lacks attention to detail on almost every front.
Meh, the airborne toxins and radiation have no issues going right through the suit, no reason why you can't see your watch through it as well.
It's a space suit. You want to hope it blocks x-rays. 😜
They have FTL technology, I'm sure they could also develop a small transparent window for a watch.

Or put the watch on the outside.
Barrett\*
Right? Armor in blue, health in red, menu options in between. Simple yet efficient. You could think of seeing the status bars flash on the side of the screen as Bond sneaking a glance at the watch while staying focused on what was happening.
wowwwwwwwww its all animation dude
[deleted]
Seeing it all the time is part of the problem imo. Star field can be a gorgeous game and the UI not disappearing or being able to pick what is shown and what isn’t is pretty frustrating for a game released in 2023. The new avatar (blue alien one) game has a better UI than star field does which is a shame. I want to see all the landscape in star field and still be able to see loot when I pan over a box or dead enemy
And then it's never useful or necessary again.
Yeah, but the disconnect is fair. You literally flip the pip-boy up each time you use it and it's visible on your character.

Had they made it visible while wearing civvies I would at least been reminded it's there.
Elder Scrolls didn't have anything to explain us seeing our Health, Magicka, and Stamina bars, nor do most games actually. So no, there didn't *have* to be something for the sake of role playing.
Hud  displayed on your space suit. You can’t see the watch in street clothes anyway so that works just as well as the watch without adding extraneous junk to be merch.
So using that same logic, go ahead and explain why there's a HUD in Skyrim then. 

It's a videogame. There doesn't have to be a literal in game object to explain UI elements.
It's the same graphic but someone new looking at the HUD would have no idea it was a watch
I can understand that, but I think it does fit in with her storyline. She's justice-oriented, truly believes that there is good and evil, and I don't see a problem with her being lawful good within her own lived experiential context. She's not a zealot so she doesn't believe all non-believers are automatically evil.

But I may be rationalizing too much to myself as well. 😅
Same. Bethesda af
She can get interrupted by one of the other Constellation members wanting to chat, and then never resumes giving you the tour.
I used the one in the room to store things I wanted to stash. I used the one in the basement for crafting mats.
I don't think that's true. The hardcore COD style gamers aren't picking up RPGs like this. They're oscillating between the latest COD and Battlefield (and bitching about the combat) and back to COD again.
seems like a bit of a cop-out
A single solar flare hitting earth can completely destroy a massive amount of technology we use every day, and wipe huge amounts of data that is only stored digitally.

The last time it happened was 1859 4 years after the telegraph was invented. And despite there being only a handful of telegraphs at the time it still messed with communications.
If archeologists are researching up artifacts from our time, then I’d think something happened to wipe out the flow of information through generations. I don’t think the internet would survive most of those scenarios
Pips McGee
It's not believable that someone can read the inventory menu on a watch. It is believable that someone can read an inventory menu on a pip-boy. If it doesn't make sense at a glance, don't bother with it.
More like the problem is that they half justified it. 

Like you know it’s supposed to be the watch but there’s no animation for bringing the watch to your face, plus the UI uses far too much screen real estate for it to be plausible that it’s on a watch face. 

Better to just ignore it completely than to make a half assed attempt at giving an in game justification
> But to your second point - how does it look "exactly" like the watch? Because the UI is vaguely circular?

Disingenuous.
Wait you kept your ship and clothes? I was given a starborn guardian and starborn spacesuit. That’s it.
You lose everything. Ship, clothes, weapons, misc items. Then in the new universe you are given a starborn ship and spacesuit, which presumably doesn't include your watch.
Eh. You keep nothing. Nothing at all.
Not really. You are naked underneath the suit and you get a starborn guardian. You have no weapons
No, you don't keep your ship and clothes when you go through ng+
So, since this was entirely wrong, have you not actually gone through the unity? Are you in this sub roleplaying as someone who has gone through the unity? Or have you just forgotten how it works and are now criticising your half-remembered version of it?
Then how do you get into the lodge? Just cuz it's not on your wrist doesn't mean you don't have it.
I seriously could've sworn, but I could be wrong/misremembering like I said. I'll try to hop on later if I have time and see.
It had to be more abstract because of the watch size. If it was still "physicalised" - you'd be reading 1854296 lines of text on a 2 inch wide screen, which doesn't quite make sense. So it's presumed that watch is your player character's interace, but it is shown to you - player - in a more convenient manner

And no they couldn't just make it hologram, Starfield has no holograms
You guys are literally looking for anything to shit on at this point and it's getting REALLY sad.
The pop boy is just better honestly my favorite inventory management system in the game. Or at least was before 4 made it impossible to navigate.
And dear god that menu screen.  
The Pip-Boy just had tabs you cycle through, it was really easy to navigate.  


Wtf is that watch interface
It's not Fallout. The expectation that it would be just like a pipboy is one users like you gave yourselves and then got upset when your assumption was wrong. 

It was never once advertised to be like a pipboy. What a ridiculous thing to assume and then actually say out loud.
Yea, imagine having a central item like the constellation watch introduced during a cut scene and in marketing material to be in the game like, twice.

*lack of design document moment.*
So do that, then?
Ah yes, very awesome letting us use ancient time-telling methods on our super advanced tech-watch xD. But no really I never knew that, I suppose that's kinda nifty.
Yeah but how would you know what minute it even WAS unless you were looking at the watch!?!??
Nice, I'll never learn
Me too!
Pretty sure Master Chief's loadout in the helmet is Cortana/Interior of the helmet tech as well
The pip boy being there is reinforced throughout the game by visibly appearing as you open the map, interact with the inventory, etc. Nothing like that for the watch.
Even the star wars games, survivor and fallen order has it somewhat linked to BD-1. Pull up a map, it is a holomap from the droids projector.

Hogwarts Legacy? It is the grimoire they give you to fill up and use gifted to you by the ministry of magic. Every item is cataloged in that book and it is linked to your pocket dimension. Every map is that book, every information is in the book, down to the spells and potion recipes.
Like arks implant
Anyone know how CyberPunk is now? I haven’t touched it all yet. It was a nightmare on launch. Scared me off!
That's not a new trend, it's just coming back. Most games UI back in the day made some effort to appear at least somewhat diegetic, especially in RPGs. Like your spellbook being shaped like an actual book, or your inventory being a physical space you had to drag stuff around, etc. 

It's not until the late 2000s that the whole trend of having a minimal UI that's completely aesthetically divorced from the game itself took off, for "cinematic value" I guess, but I always found it kind of hacky, so I'm glad devs are pivoting away from that these days.
Fallout doing it wasn't even Bethesda's idea. That came from the og Black Isle games.
Have you read the comment you replied to?

Do you see where it has the word "most"?

Of course there are some games where the UI is diegetic. Fallout and Dead Space are examples. But that's not the rule, and the existence of a UI element certainly doesn't mean there must be a corresponding game object.
Not a fan of the ges themselves, but Dead Space has one of the best UIs I've seen, simply because it's all directly on the character, so you don't have anything cluttering the screen but you still have all the information you need.
Halo's is pretty good, everything is done in the visor of your character's helmet including ammo counters and crosshairs. It's your suit keeping track of everything around you.
> That's the watch. None of that, including the scanner itself, is available before you get the watch.

If that were true, we would not have an UI in NG+ until we met with constellation.
There are a lot of negative things you can say about this game but lack of detail is absolutely not one of them
I know it's popular to hate on Starfield, but this is BS.
BGS is obsessive about details.

Like, if you have a VR headset, just walking around the Institute, the Pridwen or a Vault can show you how *absurdly obsessed* BGS can be with the details, and pretty much every spacesuit in Starfield has that obsession built into them.

It's far more probable the Watch was a last minute addition because Zenimax needed a toy to sell for their collector edition, and they wanted to cash in on "the new pipboy"
quiet memorize scale ring poor recognise chief chop glorious meeting

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
Seriously one of the most blatantly obviously boneheaded mechanics.
I’m pretty sure at that point just putting a clear display in part of the visor to give you a hud inside the helmet would be more economical, , it’s even technology that currently exists and a company called ClearLEDdisplay makes them.
Uh, no. The watch is the the UI in Starfield. You see it the whole time you play the game.
It was cool seeing it for a split second when you opened the menu, but it certainly wasn't part of the UI. The Starfield watch is better in that respect, at least.
It remains useful, just not mandatory.
Sure, the same way you can just blast your way through the whole game, some people want to play stealth though
People complained that the Pipboy was a permanent feature on your character no matter what outfit you wore. People complained that it was unrealistic that you were viewing the world though a wrist-mounted device. Multiple high-profile mods across multiple games were created to remove it.

So Bethesda paid it lip-service and hid it away, and now people are complaining that the wrist-mounted device isn't more visible.

This feels very much like one of those "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situations.
Didn’t even see what they said. Looks like it got moderated.
Your HUD doesn’t appear until you get the watch.
Your HUD doesn’t appear until you get the watch.
There doesn't HAVE to be, but we also don't have to shit on a company for deciding they WANT there to be.
Someone new goes through the intro without that HUD element, is given the watch, and then has that element show up. I'm genuinely surprised even the few people here didn't put two and two together here.
Someone new would receive the watch and know what it was, like all of us when we were new.
Don't get me wrong, I liked Andreja. I just was overly frustrated by how her likes and dislikes didn't seem to match up with her background and personality. 

What's that? She made her living as a smuggler? Well, she'd probably prefer that I let this thief off easily....

Nope. Wrong. So frustrating.
Just keep your materials in your ship's cargo hold, they're accessible from any station from there. I started out doing the shuffle back and forth with 2000kgs of random materials in that chest until someone told me this.
What workshop/basement is this you're talking?
The largest solar flare in years hit a few days ago, radio went out in central and south america for a short time but was quickly restored. It's worth paying attention to but we're not defenseless.
No idea why you’re getting downvoted.
You get a new ship AND clothes every time you pass through the unity. So no you keep nothing but your powers and skills.
Because they forgot the watch existed after the intro.
?? I love Starfield, I'm just critical of it because frankly Bethesda got outshined this year - and nonetheless me critiscing watch UI in a **thread about the supposed futility of the in-game watch** is not needless "shitting" on anything. 

Respectfully, get a grip xx
“You have a different opinion than I do and it’s REALLY sad”
the pip boy menu was called clunky by damn near everyone.

This is full on revisionist history.
I think it is pretty reasonable to assume that BGS would come up with something as immersive as the pipboy, instead of regressing to an out-of-character menu screen that occupies 100% of the screenspace.

We don't care about what precisely they implement how, as long as it is believable, doing something similar to the pipboy would have been perfectly fine because it simply is a really good solution to keep you immersed in the game.

A fullscreen menu opening in an RPG is just never a good thing.  


The shop menu is the same as the watch menu, which actually makes it worse.  


In the previous titles, the trade screen is an intentionally out-of-character type display for quality of life reasons, but it is distinctly separated.  
In Starfield, it is part of your watch and actually lacks proper trading features.  
You gotta sell first and then buy instead of just moving items around and then confirming the trade - wtf, why the needless regression
Actually, thinking about it, it may not be. I mean, where is the time zone and I believe the watch display is relative to your location. So 9 pm could be noon in whatever timezone you are in on the planet.
the HUD doesn't even include the time.

I'd accept the whole pip boy idea, except that they gave us a watch and we can see everything... but the actual time on the watch.
That's why. Time ceased to exist until they saw this watch.
Bingo. All UNSC personnel have cybernetic augmentations - cranial and ocular, to link up with systems, their weapons, etc., to project information on vitals, data on locations and most importantly? Crosshairs.  


That's why so many UNSC weapons don't have iron sights. They don't need them. That crosshair isn't just a game mechanic, it's diagetic, and every Marine has it.  


You can see the neural implants on Lord Hood in Halo 2, and in all the skulls.
The pause screen in 007: Goldeneye for N64 is Bond's watch.
Complete overhaul, masterpiece of a game now. Haven't played the new DLC, but I was so glad I slept on this game, cause when I picked it up for the first time at the beginning of this year it was bad as hell and I spent nearly 200 hours on my first playthrough.
Cyberpunk is unbelievable right now. So is the DLC. Get on it asap it’s a masterpiece
[removed]
Apparently the watch went through the Unity with you.  ;)
at least the sandwiches look amazing
lol
I fail to see how pointing out how detailed other BGS games is supposed to make the point that this obviously half assed game is... also really detail oriented?
I mean, in enough concentration it can kill you, since you’ll suffocate. But a suit should prevent that.
It's almost as if Todd doesn't know shit about science. Or they were just to lazy to bother to develop systems outside of the purview of skyrim/fallout.
Compared to Fallout, it’s literally nothing. A “UI” is not an actual object compared to the pip boy. In Fallout, your character picks up their arm and looks at the pop boy when opening the menu. They also move dials and such as you switch menus. 

Starfield, it’s just a health and CO2 UI with no unique animations or functionality. Considering they marketed a whole accessory for collectors around this, it’s fair for people to expect it to be more important in the game world. Maybe DLC will expand on it, but current stage, it’s kinda pointless and makes no sense.
You are being very intellectually dishonest
The main difference is that the pip boy was an actual icon for the fallout games. The watch in starfield is literally nothing. They could have just not done it in and gave the HUD the watch piece anyways and it would have been fine. But instead they are releasing merch for the watch even though you literally never see it asides from the one 8 second showing.
Correct. The hud can be made to appear whenever they want so they made it come with the watch then you never see the watch again. It would make as much sense, arguably more imo, as the watch to have it on your faceplate and wouldn’t require extraneous stuff that is never seen again.
It’s referred to several times. I was just talking to Vasco about outposts and he mentions that all the blueprints are contained in the watch and that it tracks what materials you have in cargo.
Not the brightest bunch in here I guess
You mean the first 9 minutes of the game?

Yeah, most people will forget the tossaway reference to the watch you get when you also get a spaceship, and a robot, and space hallucinations that lead to Jedi force powers.

Most people aren't obsessing over all the details like their second job is editing the fandom Wiki for Bethesda games.
I’m struggling to remember, but did the hud not exist before barret hands the PC the watch?
I prefer to think that's because she was undercover as a smuggler. It wasn't a lifestyle, but a cover, and then it makes more sense. To me at least.
By the end of my first run I had something like 12,000 kg of just crafting materials in that box. Can't keep all that in my ship!

And I needed every single one of those 12 megagrams too! /s
The one in the lodge. Without spoiling anything. There is a mission where one of the choices is to run through it to escape someone.
When you first enter the lodge in the 'lobby' there's a white hallway off to your right with stairs leading down to a room with one of each crafting tables. In there there's a chest or a box on the table behind the research terminal with no weight limit. You have to grab everything out of there to use it because it's not linked to the stations like your ship inventory is but it's a few steps instead of the much longer run from your bedroom safe.
Same here, seems like an obvious statement.
Yeah that’s what I thought. Maybe I misinterpreted what he meant. I thought he was saying he kept his clothes and ship but upon a re-read it could see it being taken another way.
Wholly untrue. They remembered it when it came time to sell it irl.
Fallout 3 had a pipboy and then skyrim didn't.  No,  it's not reasonable. It's like skyrim didn't exist to you when it flatly didn't do anything you seem to expect by default here.
I just wish there was like a key-press you could do to switch between the sundial-esque visual, and an actual clock with galactic time or some such.
Not that it's a huge deal, but cmon it's a fucking watch lol
I know thats the funniest fucking thing to me lol
It absolutely tells you the local time. It's a graphical representation because numbers don't mean anything when the orbital periods are different for each planet.  So you get an image of the planet from orbit showing how the sun is shining on it (or not).
It does kind of show you the time in an approximate, analog sundial kind of way. Which sort of makes sense if you're on a planet with a very short day/night cycle...but on planets with something closer to 24h day or longer makes it useless if what you need to know is "how many hours until sunrise"
Time literally wouldn't matter in space considering some planets have multiple moons. If the it's light it's daytime if it dark it's night, why do you need to know what time it is? Other than just because want to.
This. In one of the books it's mentioned that the moment Chief picks up a weapon, sensors in his suit's gloves read what kind of weapon it is and how he's holding it, putting a crosshair up on his visor wherever he aims at. The rest of the HUD is canonically also actually things he sees on his own visor. The shield level, ammo count, waypoint indicators, etc.
woahh! THAT'S what those things are on the skulls?! TIL
Props on the use of diagetic, one of my favorites to bust out as well, though usually referencing music!
I think you’re referring to Cyberpunk. 

UNSC use tactical eyepieces when they aren’t wearing a helmet like ODSTs and Spartans. I’ve played the games and read all canon novels and I’ve not heard of ocular implants widely adopted in the Halo universe.
Holy shit. I wish i could play Phantom Liberty again for the first time. Its like Blood and Wine, or Hearts of Stone for Witcher 3. Adds as much for DLC as some games entire campaign.
Thanks! I’m starting to wear out on this. Almost 250 hours on it. At like 10-11 days I think.
But this game does it so badly most don't notice, only to sell a crappy watch to get more money from suckers
Or, it was a marketing stun, is meaningless to the actual game, and that's why it only appears in the first 20 minutes of the game and then completely disappear.
Thing is, they didn't even have to develop anything new. They just had to have common sense. It was fixed by modders really quickly. It's not difficult to achieve within the realm of what the engine can already do, with a single line added to a script. They just didn't, for _whatever_ reason. And I can't think of a good one.
And it moves around if you push right stick. Pip boy was great.
So all the hate comes from not seeing the watch on your character? That's an awfully small issue to cause such a reaction.
okay but I'm not always wearing the suit m8
So you think most people will be blind to a HUD element being added because they also get a ship? You realise this isn't a tabletop RPG and it's expected that most players will be looking at the screen.
CoD players blast through games without paying attention and complain about not knowing what's happening.
It did not
Nope, that part of the UI does not exist until you get the watch.
If you could keep your ship and what you had equipped I'd unity a lot more.
So Barret lies again then. His dialogue should have been " It DOESNT even tell the time."
Wow, that’s great!!! I always wanted a way to tell if the sun was up. What would we ever do without it???
Thank you! I'm a writer, so I'm eyebrow deep in this stuff constantly.
I'm not referring to cyberpunk, lmfao. Go see my other reply here, and you'll see how you are firmly incorrect. Sorry to say pal.
You will love CP. They just had another update.
You’re not always wearing the watch either. Look for it in street clothes.
[removed]
Are you really that simple? Never heard of a sundial and how it tells time?
CP2077...just CP is a little sketch.
Boycott the Unofficial Starfield Patch now, while there's still time.
The author of the Unofficial Starfield Patch is only after making his mod a dependency on every mod that he possibly can. He fixes some bugs, sure. But he also 'fixes' many things that aren't broken in the first place to build his mod dependency empire.

**Mod authors especially, should not have the Unofficial Patch installed or they risk being at the mercy of ONE mod author.**

Look at how many mods are dependent on the [Skyrim Unofficial Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) if you don't believe me. It's well into the thousands. It's not because the author is that good. It's because he's that power hungry.

The [Community Patch](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/a11a0cdf-5abb-4a59-9e12-e261e5aae8d5/Starfield_Community_Patch) is a better option because it is managed by a group, not just one person, whom are all in the modding community.

My 2 cents worth.
Since we know how Arthmoor posts go...

It is okay to be critical, or even attack an idea (in a civil way), it is not okay to attack a person directly. Saying someone has done poor things, or harmed the community, or that content people made did X or Y thing is okay, but just making a comment that is a one off insult is not.

Please remain civil while discussing this.
Everybody talks about how absolute power corrupts absolutely, but nobody talks about how teeny-tiny niche power corrupts weirdly and kinda pathetically.
Worth noting that the Community Patch has more open permissions than Arthmoor's. He seems to still have a vendetta against VR, since he's already specifically prohibiting it being ported to "Starfield VR" despite no such version of the game existing yet.

Honestly, it's not worth the trouble or constant drama of trying to accommodate this guy. He was invited to contribute to the community patch, but refused. This whole stupid division is entirely on him.
> But he also 'fixes' many things that aren't broken in the first place to build his mod dependency empire.

I hate that he does this.
That damn mod broke my game. Lighting was all messed up, open the starmap and it opened the city map instead, and it added lag worse than launch day. I got rid of it immediately.
I've long been a fan of the alternate starts mod, but I ran into a weird issue where if you visit Helgen later, you get an error message in the bear cave berating you for using console commands (I play on Xbox). Like WTF? Does this guy get off on being a massive jerk to everyone?
Y'know I've never actually had any issues with his mods and quite loved his standalone towns in Skyrim. But seeing how he acts as a person has made me never want to give him or his mods the time of day again.
No idea about this guy but the idea of many potentially cool mods requiring a dubious "bug fix" patch sounds like a big problem. Parasite on the mod ecosystem stuff.
Just a PSA, you can block mod authors on Nexus, so you never accidentally download their mods.
Arthmoor is a lesson in why you should never underestimate how powerhungry someone can get when they're a complete nobody in their everyday life but somebody big in a certain subculture, such as modding.
I remember how salty he was both when Nexus reseved spot 1 for the Community Patch and also when the Community Patch released. He was salty because he was late to the party and knew that he can never catch up.

Sadly, here he found an opportunity to weasel in and try to win the competition of Bethesda mod service. And thanks to his verified status (why, Bethesda, why?) he seems to be winning.
[removed]
I'd bet all of reddit karma (that's right I'm putting it all on the line) that dear_Tiger (or something, can't be arsed to check now) is arthmoor or one of his cronies. No ways you can counter literally every negative comment like this, with this level of obsession without some skin in the game 😂
Anytime i try to use this mod it makes my spaceship invisible and my entire crew falls through the planet as well. Without this mod my entire mod list works fine. I’ve tried it in every order that makes any sense. 

So yeah, that’s my take on the unofficial patch.
On nexusmods the [Unofficial Starfield Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/143) has 57 Endorsements and 674 Unique Downloads.

The [Starfield Community Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1) has 5036 Endorsements and 78753 Unique Downloads.

I think it's safe to say that at least on Nexus the Community Patch has "won"

Edit: The Community Patch also has a bunch of required mods listed already. The Unofficial Patch has none.
That’s why I downloaded the community patch instead
If it's AWKCR all over again, it could be pretty damn bad.
I've gone to lengths to play various bethesda games modded without his 'patches' ever since he broke Nuka World for 3 months and banned numerous people from his forum for trolling when we brought it to his attention. I don't even know if I was ever unbanned. Mans a menace and not in a heehee funny way.
It really doesnt matter for those who use it. As long as modders are aware to not rely on it things will work themselves out.
If you need a good reason to boycott it just look at the permissions of both this and the community one.
Starborn NOOOOOOOOO!!!
Redbelly mine....never forgive, never forget
I mean, I'm not gonna download it anyway - so that shouldn't be hard xD
A ‘once’ wise man said, “no one man should have all that power…”
[removed]
[removed]
I agree let’s just hope he doesn’t try and get the community patch banned like he has for all the other games on nexus.  That’s why their ain’t no community patch for Skyrim or fallout on nexus he got them copyright banned some how course take that with a grain of salt cause that’s just grapevine talk but seeing how he behaves in general I can see him pulling that.  Course the worse part is nexus doing his bidding that’s even more screwed up if true which would half to be if people are right about how he got those others banned
I will not download or use ANY mod created by him. None.
Woah, was completely unaware of this drama untill now, is there anywhere to read on what changes he made to skyrim that weren't bug fixes? I always thought that It was a team of people working on it rather than one person but damn one guy having all that power isn't healthy in modding which is naturally a collaborative effort usually.
I don't care about this game at all but god please
DON'T LET THIS MAN IN YOUR COMMUNITY
Spread the word!

I'm the goober who made the post on r/starfieldmods

Fuck the Unofficial Patch, that shit is garbage. Nobody should have everyone's balls in their hands
Is there an alternative community patch?
Bethesda leaves an end-game level exploit in their games that brings you God-like level power if you are clever enough to figure it out.   The author(s) of the unofficial patch are known to patch those intended “exploits”.  That alone was reason enough to refuse to use their work.
I'm a simple man: I see Arthmoor, I avoid it.
Yeah come on, what does he actually “fix” in the unofficial starfield patch that isn’t broken?
Thanks for the info.

I must admit 'dependent mods' are a bit of a nightmare.

I was hoping for something much more stream-lined with the creation of 'Creation Club'.  
Streamlined being -> Less hassle -> Connected!
We need this upvoted 
He’s already Featured
It would be nice if Bethesda simply patched their fucking bugs instead of relying on the free labor of modders.
Any mod author that will use his mods as a dependency should be boycotted too
I had already planned on it.  I stopped using Arthmoor's mods years ago. My load order is built around not using the Unofficial Patch.  Mod authors that use it as master won't have their mods in my load order.  Stop using it as master.
I already went straight to the Community Patch. I'll just straight up refuse to download anything he makes.
Arthmoor screwed my load order many times on Fallout 4 with his ego driven baby fits.


I won't give him the chance this time. The way he tries to make his mod a requirement for other mods and force himself on players is some bullshit.


Pulling mods when his feelings get hurt and Cartmaning home with his toys.


Nah. There are going to be better options for Starfield. Community Patch for the win.
The Community Patch has worked great. The best part is that it won't force you to accept changes to the game you didn't want. It's just for fixing bugs. The way it should be. Changing the game should be left to mods that describe what's being changed so a user can make an informed decision about using the mod or not. Thank you to all who helped make the Unofficial Community Patch. Downloaded, liked, and bookmarked.
I was like "holy shit sounds like Arthmoor is back"

Turns out.
I don't play Star field, been a long time since I played Skyrim or even Fallout, and even I know this dude's reputation.

At a certain point, it's y'alls damn fault for tolerating him.
can someone either tell me or point me to a complete and concise rundown of the mod author, been hearing bits and pieces and mostly that he ain't a great guy and went power mad. Haven't had enough information to formulate my own opinion so if someone could help me out, appreciate it!
Everyone is talking about this guy like he’s Palpatine 💀
Wtf how does mod dependences have anything to do with the mod author I understand that arthmoor isn't the most liked here but this is stupid. Other modders decide to add the unofficial patch because the stuff it fixes are useful when making mods arthmoor isn't setting the dependency or forcing people to do it
Tin foil hats on today!
I read his notes today in his patch. He’s already changing basic things that HE feels need changing.

He lowered the effect on the Bitten Sandwich because it shouldn’t give the same effect as the full sandwich.

By the way you can’t report it for content on the Bethesda site.
Went with the community version and it’s held up well, no crashes or bugs or anything I’ve noticed 💯 would recommend the community patch!
That mod fucked up my sound.
I hate how he doesn't keep older versions of his files up in case something breaks, when you mention it to him he gets all pissy and it's your fault.

Not my fault Bethesda broke the game with their fucking updates
Can a mod here sticky this??
Fair, I was wondering why there were two of these mods on there
Whats wrong with it?
Um... With reference to Skyrim one - UESP does the unofficial. And they are **THE** community group
is this [https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1?tab=description](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1?tab=description) the same community patch  as the one you linked above ?
This is what happens in every mod communtiy with a community mod. You have one guy who has a pet project and he uses the promise of the "community mod" to boost his own projects.
There no "official" unofficial patch for Skyrim VR, instead you need to find in archives old patch for SE version, download it, and than patch this shit with another mod to get it work. And all because this patch needed for too much mods that i want to use.  
And there no support for older versions of the game. Also my game seems so crashing cause this patch, cause its now outdated and mods that i using want the last version.
Never used mods in Skyrim, but I stayed away from that mod in Fallout 4 because (at the time) my laptop couldn't handle the graphics and the Xvox only allows three mods (which is separate from the creation kit upgrade they added later). And since I could only use three, damned if I was wasting a slot on a mod that did nothing but improve other mods. 

Now that Starfield has mods, I need to figure out which ones I am going to use. But I won't be using any mods that require a base mod/patch for them to work.
I don’t know if you’re trying to help or just here to bitch about arthmoor, but his contributions to the modding scene for multiple games have definitely pushed it forward. You don’t know this dude personally so why you ranting like he kicked your dog?it’s like the quote goes, you got a problem with me, text me. You don’t have my number than you don’t know me enough to have a problem with me. Sounds like you’re just recycling the same shit we’ve seen on Reddit since the update. Enough already
How about I just use neither? 🤷🏻‍♂️😂 

I’ve played multiple playthroughs and never had any major issues. Mods are great, but big mods like this that try to fix 100 different things just seem like asking for trouble anyway, in my opinion. 🤷🏻‍♂️
I didn't know where to put my two cents in. I didn't know what a piece of work the dev for the unofficial patch is, and I didn't know he purposely did things to make other mods depend on his just to make himself feel powerful. Uninstalling his unofficial patch for the community one. My dad has both installed so I'll let him know about this stuff as well. Thanks for sharing all this much needed info.
Ill take your word on it but what does the author "fix" that wasn't broken? Im curious
The day i stopped using Unofficial patch for skyrim and fallout 4, was the day 99% of crashes ceased.
i want arthmoor to continue modding starfield only for no one to download his mods
The second I saw him drop that mod I chuckled.  Dude was 8 months too late to ingrain himself lol. Would love to see his mod just not pop off. While the community patch blows up further.
I downloaded the Unofficial patch first because I had no idea about this controversy till yesterday. Already played well into a new save with it and when I went to use the community patch instead yesterday it gave me a prompt saying “this save relies on the “Unofficial Patch” and cannot be loaded without it” or whatever which is weird cause every other mod I can take on and off. So now I’m stuck with it regardless for this play through.
The reason so many mods depend on the Unofficial Patch is because basically everyone is going to have the UP installed anyway, so it is better for mod authors to base their mod on the UP version of the game, because if they base it on the vanilla game, that could cause incompatibility with the UP; and since the majority of mod users are going to be using the UP, it is better to force the minority to use the UP, rather than force the majority of UP users to uninstall it. I hope that makes sense.

It's not like it's some massive conspiracy.
Reminds me of Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines. There's the Unofficial Patch which changes stuff, and then there's the True Patch which doesn't. Then people went back to the Unofficial Patch after the author made a version with only bug fixes, and after people found out the True Patch author is a bit of a cockwaffle.
This is part of why I dislike modding other games like cyberpunk, whenever there’s one mod that’s a requirement for nearly every other mod it leads to the inevitable situation where the game updates and instead of every mod developer working to update their own mod it becomes every mod dev waiting for one or two dependencies to become compatible with new versions until they can start work on updating. It delays mods from up-to-date compatibility and gives excessive power to one individual
I have actively avoided his mods and any that depend on it like the plague. You can build some pretty cool mod lists without the unofficial patches for any Bethesda game.

I stopped using his stuff when I noticed he removed resto glitches and certain perk interactions in skyrim. The devs have released so many updates without addressing those "bugs" that at this point they should be viewed as intended hidden features.
Yup, not touching anything that guy makes.

Community Patch all the way.
You feeling alright bud?
>Mod creator uses SUP, making his mod dependent on it

>LOOK AT HOW POWER HUNGRY AUTHMOOOROROR IS
Can't lie....if I was spending all this time doing something I'd just try to become an employee. Too much work
Abysmal upvote to comment ratio and top comment has 20x more upvotes
Can we also start endorsing mods so that it shows up in the feed. its not even top 30 on any list right now.
Thank you for sharing this.  Will switch when I get off
I'm not downloading it
My game kept crashing on XBox every time I would fast travel with the Unofficial patch. 
Removed it and it stopped.
It was the only mod I had downloaded at the time.
I downloaded the Community Patch and I haven’t had any issues with it. I have about 12 more now with it and my game has been stable for about 18hrs play time.
I'm a little confused on the actual problem here... probably just kinda stupid and don't understand modding (:
I see a small revolution happening here
Sweet I'm switching now
Ergh… not sure if this is related but evidently having the unofficial patch thing mod on fallout 4 keeps crashing your game everytime you reach greentech or in the areas around that building. Have had to start 3 new games after… just deleted that mod and it works.
Wait what did Arthmoor do I’m ootl? I was under the impression a lot of mods required his because of the fixes it does?
So he did it again… and this time he’s trying to one up the community patch instead of contributing to it… that says it all for that person’s motive.
Reminder that Arthmoor added oblivion gates EVERYWHERE, (breaking both lore and reason) to his open cities mod in Skyrim. Zero detail in the description about it and no reason to bundle them together. He got heat for this and in response threw a tantrum. He will sneak in his own changes as he sees fit!
I swear the unofficial skyrim patch bricked my save years ago. Had me falling through the floor and music would loop endlessly. Never trusted weird generic mods again 
Can someone catch me up on this particular drama, from beginning to end?
This guy and the guy that runs nexus are actively ruining the mixing community
Naw, I like the patch.
Besides the community patch is way better
I keep having a bug where all game audio disappears. Only fix is uninstalling and reinstalling
You know I tried the Skyrim patch years ago, took it off because it actually corrected my character. I was able to get her off the cloud without the corruption. But I’m glad that when I was looking for mods tonight, I stayed clear.
Was already planning on skipping it.  Haven’t had any major problems anyways.  This just confirms I won’t.
As someone who has no idea how any of this works behind the scenes, do you gain anything by doing this (making other mods dependent on your own) or just bragging rights?
I whole heartedly agree with you, I have a handful of mods in Skyrim that fixes the "fix" to get the game working as designed.
I don't understand how does he have that power and what does that mean
If this is true, what would someone gain from this? And why would mod authors have to make their mods compatible to his mod? I don't understand this.
Quick question, because I am super green when it comes to mods. I have the unofficial Starfield patch and I tried to load a save without it. The game told me that the save I was trying to load was dependent on said mod; it then asked if I wanted to load without it. Again, very new to modding, so I opted to load it and keep it pushing. If I uninstall the mod, will I lost significant progress?
*Mod dependency empire* is not a phrase I knew I needed, nor one I expected to hear today 🤔
I swear this is was is causing my audio to bug out too, I keep hearing static like someone is holding down the button on a CB radio mic
One mod to rule them all, one mod to find them. One mod to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.
Nice try Bethesda
It's funny that you give all these additional reasons to not use that patch. I agree with you that it's a total garbage patch, I was hoping it would fix the bugged questlines. Which are my biggest pet peeve. Delinquent Spacer. Crimson Fleet quest Absolute Power ( travel to Neon), and the Ryujin Quest, Deal with the Operative in the Well ( non existent NPC )
None of these game breaking quests addressed or fixed. So if I am to take your post as true, which I believe you since that patch disables the achievements. It's another nail in the coffin of crappy stuff Bethesda allowed for this game.
Is this what the entire tea about Arthmoor is about?
Can’t the community come together to create and promote another mod that does the same thing?  I believe I saw a comment about another one that already exists?  No mod is truly unique and cannot be replicated. If someone is creating a mod in such a way to exert dependency on it in order to feed their ego then just get a bunch of other modders to come together and replace it with another version. 
Does anyone know if the Unofficial Patch fixes the Galbank elevators? Mine won't open, which stops all progress with the Crimson Fleet. I need to get in the building to view the archives...
I'm also still missing pieces of New Atlantis (literal floor pieces, you fall down into the ground) including the TA terminal in the Spaceport area.
I was really hoping Bethesda's update would fix this.. but here we are.
Ok, I have no idea what is going on, but I've used the UEESP and now am using the USFP. Looking for information, please. I like informed decisions if there is a reason not to support this mod.
All I have to say is, who? And what? It's an unimportant mod by an unimportant person. Never heard of him. Would have gone under my radar without Reddit.
it's in the name... unofficial, people need to learn the concept of free marketing rather than operating a salt mine
Don't tell me Angel Hernandes is a Reddit mod now....
Also, the Earth Reborn patch messes with your sound.
Uhm…. What’s happening?
Why?
*Laughs in Starfield Community Patch*
Thanks for taking the time to let us know.
The Skyrim one breaks too many quests I quit using it a long time ago. Would not use Starfield one
Why not use both like i do?
Here is a conversation I had with Arthmoor back on June 18th regarding using either the USFP or the SFCP: 

***Me:*** Hello there. Many blessings to you and your team. Can the Unofficial Starfield Patch be used alongside the Starfield Community Patch, or is it a "pick-one-or-the-other" thing? It's been a while since I've played a Bethesda game (been playing Baldur's Gate 3 a lot), and I'm a bit rusty on which mods can coexist.

***Arthmoor:*** It's more than likely going to be a one or the other setup. We'd obviously recommend sticking with USFP.

Now, I have used some of Arthmoor's mods in the past (specifically the Pre-Skyrim AE Update version of Castle Volkihar Rebuilt,) and I am well aware of all the shenanigans surrounding him and his habits. I will say that I thought his answer to my question was rather civil. Do I hate the guy? No. Does he have habits that might need to be spoken about with a professional therapist? Quite possibly. Thank you all for listening. Now, if you'll please excuse me, I'm off to dig the SFCP out of storage.
Found this just as I was switching over as I recognized his name from previous games and wasn't aware of these issues. Back to the Community patch it is!
I swear these posts are beginning to sound more & more like personal targetting at this point.
I only found out about their antics after i installed their mod and played for a few days. I tried to uninstall it but when i tried to continue, it said it required it. Is there any way to decouple them? Or just dont use it on subsequent characters?
I installed it, played 15 mins, and uninstalled because I didn’t like how it was messing with the game and I didn’t want to be reliant on it.
Ok, not very familiar with this whole topic, but went ahead and uninstalled Unofficial Starfield Patch and installed Community Patch instead at the top of my load order.
Good thing I didn't install it. It just fixed pretty cosmetic stuff and not actual bugs. Now at least I know to avoid it.
Thats a dumbass reason to be upset… just my two cents worth
How tf does his have more likes than the community patch?
Deleting that instantly.. thanks for the heads up
Devil's Advocate for a moment: The Unofficial Patch already has more likes and bookmarks in the in-game Bethesda Creations, and this is likely to be true in the future as well.

**Because:** whatever you may think of Arthmoor he is a known quantity and *that matters to everyone*. He may be a prick, but he is the prick that will be keeping the Unofficial Patch going throughout all the Starfield DLCs, all the Starfield Special Editions, and all the Starfield Anniversary Editions. We know this because that is what he did for both Skyrim and Fallout 4.

We don't know the same is true for the Community Patch. I wish them the best but they have no track record (that I am aware of) to fall back on in terms of keeping a singular modding project alive through a hundred releases. And if they do have a track record they should be publicizing it more.

I personally am going to try to do without any patches or mods of any kind for at least another year or two. I really hope the Community Patch succeeds but I suspect the Unofficial Patch will always be the more popular one despite how people feel about the author.
Ha!!! You said Tator. 

Seriously, I get the intent of the warning but this is starting to sound like a hit job. Can’t this person just be reported to Bethesda and be removed from the creators store?

Read *The Power Broker* by Robert Caro.  Teeny tiny niche power corruption can grow into wholesale authoritarianism.  Robert Moses was the head of NYC Parks in the 30s and grew his power outward through the 60s when he was arguably more powerful that the NYC Mayor and New York Governor.  He expanded his purview over roads and eventually had something like 30 different titles over different organizations throughout NY state government.  He was *never* elected to any office ever.
This is the best comment I’ve read on Reddit in a while
Yeah, it's shocking and sad to contrast Arthmoor's public statements during the Giskard controversies back in Oblivion days with his more recent statements. He truly has become the monster he fought against. 

Fun fact, my phone tried to correct "his more recent statements" to "his more recent dysentery."
You mean like Reddit mods?
actually, my grandfather used to say "teeny-tiny niche power corrupts weirdly and kinda pathetically" all the time. 

it was one of several axioms that he used to force us kids to repeat, and if we got any part of it wrong, he'd whack us with a pimento loaf and make us start over. 

it was kinda pathetic.
Once told an irl troll that he let the most base power of being able to speak corrupt him and that's just sad. After he huffed off told someone he is the kind of man to gladly sh*t his own pants if it meant someone else would have to smell it. 

It's a common attitude. Every time someone claims *any* kind of interaction or reaction is a victory, that's what is happening. To feel so powerless that the *rush* of *communication* goes to their head and they abuse it must be harrowing.
I feel like this is a major joke in academia

Huh, you just succinctly described a lot of mods on Reddit (not this sub!!).
Haha, indeed. 
Wrap it up boys. We can close down the internet for today.
A god among worms is still a god.
No amount of power is small enough. You just need to find a person small enough.
We talk about Reddit and discord moderator all the time
That's basically the story of Reddit mods.
Teeny-tiny niche power that also made him quite the bit of money over the years.
Internet forum moderators are the prime example.
It reminds me of discord server drama where the entire thing will go to fucking war over moderator drama.  It’s hilarious
Case in point: Reddit mods.
That's because absolute power doesn't corrupt absolutely, that's just what dickheads with power tell everyone else to make themselves look better. And to be quite honest it's fairly funny that it works, since any halfway decent person has ZERO interest in gaining power let alone abusing it, and yet are eager to beleive the corrupt.
I mean, if we want to be truly philosophical here then it’s actually a fallacy to say, power corrupts at all.  In fact, such an idea was invented by evil people so that the only people with power were evil.

Because if power corrupts then good people will not seek to be corrupted and therefore good people will never have power.  And without power how can the righteous protect the weak or disfranchised?
Are we talking about reddit mods? /j
Reddit.
That describes so many serial killers and cult leaders.
A pretty much spot on description of HOA's.
Brilliant
It’s still absolute power, the scale of what it controls is just small.
Legit question - why is the dude so against VR? Am I missing something? Bc I've seen pple do VR Fallout or Skyrim and honestly it looks mint and makes me jealous. I don't get what there is to hate about it but you're not the first person to mention that this dude hates VR so I'm curious to hear if he's ever explained why he's taken this stance? Seems a tad... Retrograde?
The dude’s brain is broken beyond repair, that’s all there is to it.
Reminds me of the developer of Unepic refusing the let players cheat in single-player because he had a pissing contest with some dude who made cheat engine tables.
Wait is this guy the reason I can never get modded Skyrim vr to work?
Started with boars in Oblivion...
I think... No one loves that he does this. It's a fucked up thing to do
Is that what’s causing the lighting and map issues? I have similar issues and I thought it was something else I downloaded. I’ll try removing it and see what happens
I think the map thing is a change to the base game
So I couldn’t find anything in the mod descriptions on Creations, Nexus, OR the official change log that says *anything* about changing lighting, could we not all just start reporting the mod for inaccurate description?
I had to delete the entire game and redownload on the Xbox because of his “patch”!
I seriously doubt the patch mod did that. Might have been a conflict with a different mod. Or you might have tried it at a moment when a buggy version was uploaded but before the fix was uploaded, which happens to every mod. 
Yeah, Arthmoor assumes that if you reach the bear cave from the Helgen side then you must have noclipped through the rockslide, nevermind that the tunnel may be clear because who knows how many other mods affect the Helgen area. I reported the same issue in the skyrim modding subreddit, and my comment was swiftly deleted by the mod team 👍
Wow fuck that guy
His mods are decent but he is really opinionated on certain things and gets REALLY upset if you disagree.

The "Unofficial Patch" fixes things that aren't bugs and if you tell him he'll get really mad about it. 

An example of this is in the "Open Cities"  mod where he added a bunch of "Oblivion Gates" around the Skyrim map because he thought, lore wise, it would make sense for Oblivion Gates to be all around Tamriel since the Oblivion Crisis occurred everywhere, not just Cyrodiil.

I get his logic, but the devs didn't include the Oblivion Gates for a reason. They didn't want them there... and they also don't make a lot of sense to be there. Like, there is one in Whiterun. If I was a resident of Whiterun during the Oblivion Crisis I wouldn't want to leave the Oblivion Gate untouched... I'd want it demolished. That goes for any Oblivion Gate that gets found.

People asked him to remove the Oblivion Gates from the mod because they were lore breaking and immersion breaking and he got pissed.

Eventually, I think he made them optional... but yeah. He thinks he is more of an authority on the lore than the people who create the games.
I’ve never seen how he acts as a person. Is he rude and belligerent?
That's what sucks the most. His Skyrim village expansion mods are simple, yet unique and irreplacable. Other others tackling the villages go overboard with changes - they redo the whole settlements and give them non-Skyrim feel. Arthmoor's village mods simply expand the towns with a few new buildings, nothing more. Until someone remakes those, I'm stuck with them.

Thankfully I have them backed up on my NAS, so I won't give him traffic on his crappy mod site.
Yeah I was very shocked when I caught up on all the drama after wanting to play Skyrim again.

I loved all the towns and how they filled in the sparse spots.

Damn shame.
I've never had any problems with him, but there is the larger issue of making so much of the game dependent on specific mods.  There was a mod called Dynamic Animation Replacer that was not updated for quite a while when Skyrim AE came out, due to technical issues with the implementation of DAR for AE.  The issue was eventually fixed and the users who used mods requiring DAR rejoiced when the update came out.  This experience was painful for the mod author because of the difficulty of nailing down the bug, along with the incessant complaints from users, many of whom equated modding with using Lego blocks.  This points to the potential of any mod author (even inadvertently) for causing grief within the community for any number of reasons.

This is the issue that needs addressing, not the personality of any modder, which at the end of the day is voted on by every user who chooses to download and use mods.
Since you're not paying him for the mods I really don't think he cares tbh
How does he act as a person? got any screenshots or logs? or is this just pufferfish drama?
The original version was assembled by a pair of modders and incorporated a bunch of fixes to improve game function and enable some mods (in some cases). It was a good idea for modders and players since it put a lot of functionality in one place that was well-documented. It was only later when Arthmoor started managing it and adding undocumented changes it became more of an issue/less reliable. 
It's just a consequence of how the game is built and how buggy Bethesda leaves their games. We'll see how Starfield goes, but for Skyrim, I generally agree with the unofficial patch's fixes and there's a **lot** of them. That means almost every one of the game's data packs get tweaked in some way. If you're a mod author and you're going to alter some piece of the game that is also altered by the unofficial patch, then you're forced to a) make it a dependency b) play without the unofficial patch or c) test everything twice and ensure your changes are compatible with and without it.
This part is understandable.

A lot of fixes may mess with files that other mods use.

Or other mods fix or change things, the same files.

Eventually there's just a lot of conflicts. And many people start to use the patch.



Many mod authors end up making patches or just flat out require bug fix mods. There's no way around it. 


The only issue seems to be that he fixes fun stuff. Or fixes things that may not be bugs.
Despite having a 3 year old account with 150k comment Karma, Reddit has classified me as a 'Low' scoring contributor and that results in my comments being filtered out of my favorite subreddits.

So, I'm removing these poor contributions.  I'm sorry if this was a comment that could have been useful for you.
You can? I've been in there since 2010 and had no idea...
Interesting. I used some of his Oblivion mods a lot (e.g. Open Cities) , didn't do so much in Skyrim and now learn he's considered as an egomaniac by some.

Funny thing to be egomaniacal about.

*"What do you do as a hobby?"*

*"I create empires of game modders subject to the popularity of my own mods, cleverly disguised as game fixes!"* while laughing maniacally.

*"Okay"* slowly backing off into the bushes.
He didn't start that way. And he wasn't really a nobody. He ran and created MUDs back in the day, and has been modding TES games since Morrowind. Much of the original knowledge bases for modding were created with his contributions, among others. His contributions to TES modding and the knowledge and experience he's helped develop are significant. While he always had an ego, it was actually bad until around 2016 when people started reporting a lot more negative interactions with him. A theory I've seen repeated a few times? He got sucked into a certain cult of personality around that time that made him more of an egomaniac.

Ah, the old "reddit mod" effect
Arthmoor is a combination of Eloraam and LexManos from the Minecraft modding community.
We just keep going and spread more news about the community patch.
I find it odd that he puts his patch in every damn category it looks like. It's sleezy.
It appears that anyone who is an established mod creator can get verified, the guy is a dickhead but he is also fairly well known and his mods are generally quite good so it makes sense to verify him. It's not an endorsement from Bethesda to get that checkmark, just means that he's someone who's an established mod maker.

Go look at his comments history, like 90% of them are from him trying to defend Arthmoor
Possibly, but he did call arthmoor a huge nerd which is funny if it’s him🤷 🤣
I've just been giggling at that myself 🤭... Sure looks sussy to go to those lengths online in a 1vMany battle.
I'm only seeing a few bad arguments here, such as people running dependencies on a bug fix mod. 

There's a lot of bugs that can affect certain mods or mess them up. So, they use his mod.


People getting upset over dependencies is on themselves. It's understandable that a bug fix mod can become a requirement for some types of mods.

Some mods shouldn't have it as a requirement.


But yeah, generally seems like a not so great guy.
'eeey, I was waiting for someone to mention that!
It's been so long since I used this I entirely forgot it existed until I read your comment 😭🤣 I think I used it once when I first got fallout 4 on PC but hated using it so I uninstalled
what’s wrong with awkcr?
Yes, the modders knowing is the most important thing. When a player downloads mod X that requires mod Y, they will download mod Y no questions asked. If nobody makes mod Y a requirement and use mod Z instead, then no harm done even if some people download mod Y independently. 
until this discussion flared up this week, I legit had no idea that HE put that damn line in Skyrim!
UNITY? NOOOOOOOOO
I was looking for this comment
Honestly, I felt like everything in that song is epic as hell until Kanye started singing talking about people kissing his "ass hole". It's worth looking into the songs he sampled, like [Afromerica](https://youtu.be/e-dtwySzcQc?si=Pk3jqOoGIOs6Wazx)
ESL isn't a thing for starfield it's different orders of masters,(×
Nobody who has been around is surprised. This post and others like it are meant for people who may not know, as Starfield has drawn a lot of new players and modders in.
How do you copyright something you don't own? Some day he's gonna mess with the wrong person and learn that mods aren't copyrighted, let alone mods that don't use his assets. Would be fun to see the legal fallout of that, let alone seeing a troll have consequences that require him to show up in a court room
Yeah! Only my balls in your hands... 👉🏻👈🏻
The Community Patch.

Linked in last paragraph of OP.
This !
Probably nothing *yet*. But once a lot of mods need his as a dependency, he power trips and does whatever he wants and people can't just stop using his patch because all their other mods need it. 
As far as im aware nothing. But this post is a warning to modders. Ive dealt with mods that add dumb shit i didnt download the mod for before (one mod that added spells in skyrim changed the daedric armor and it took ages to find out what it was to remove it. But removing it was easy once i found it.

Now imagine something like that but nearly every other mod you have needs that shit mod for them to work. That means either you get rid of all those mods (and learn that nearly every popular mod relied on that mod so you have less mods to use) or you just leave the broom in your ass and accept that if you want to use the mods you enjoy, you need the stupid change you didnt want.

Now imagine other modders see this and they release mods that remove the thing you hate so you can keep playing. The dick who added that shitty mod throws a fit and gets those other mods taken down. And says to you smugly “if you dont like it just dont download the mod.” Knowing what i said previously.

So the mod author might not do the same thing for this game. But if he does and its too late, then youll just need to hope youre ok with him deciding how your game will play. The community patch is a counter so something like that would be much less likely to happen.
He'll play nice for now because he wants to trick mod authors to make his mod a dependency.  Once he has hundreds of mods dependent on his mod that's when he power trips.

  
He did it with Skyrim, he did it with Fallout 4, he'll do it with Starfield.
I'm sure he'll eventually convince himself that Oblivion gates are lore-friendly to be places in Starfield cities.
You could argue it's already started; there's two books in the game marked Vol 1 and Vol 3, with no Vol 2.  He changed the 3 to 2.

Before anyone gets to typing about overblowing book titles, I agree this is not big, and might actually be a bug, but it's indicative of the kind of judgment calls he just unilaterally asserts.  In Skyrim, he changed a character's hair to match a description given by another character that she was specifically in hiding from, who she had already changed her name to hide from.  It makes perfect sense that she would also change her hair, and that this other character is working on old information, but Arthmoor 'fixes' with a hammer and does not leave room for nuance.  

He *will* sand off implications and call it a fix.
No one can actually give you a straight answer because they’re all wrapped up in the drama
Also what are some examples of things that the Unofficial changes or adds ? I keep reading it changes things at his whim but they never give examples.
Unofficial patches tend to be dependents because other modders draw on the patch. It's caused problems since forever. New Vegas famously had a dependent mod for patching that was poorly designed. Until someone else pushed it out, anyway
[deleted]
There are a lot of people just learning how to mod. It would be very easy for new authors to unknowingly set the Unofficial Patch as a master. BIG mistake. EASY to do.
That really depends on the the dependency.
If you look, he was the first to upload and DMCA'd other bug fixes. We kinda had to deal with him.
The point of this particular boycott is to inform new modders on the scene, so they can then use the information to decide whether or not they want to use Arthmoor's patch as a dependency. Hopefully, they don't. 

The reason this matters is that Arthmoor's patches were used as a dependency for many, many FO4 and Skyrim mods. This became a problem when Arthmoor starting doing things like intentionally sabotaging attempts to make the patch VR compatible, abusing the DMCA complaint system to have competing mods removed from hosting sites, continuously throwing tantrums about things and removing all his mods (which, are actually a team effort, despite my use of words like "his") from the Nexus, and so on and so forth.
A lot of people aren't mentioning that second, important part of where he messed with patches and whatever. Which, many mod authors are possibly unaware or they've been using him for too long and switching would break current users entire games if they ever decide to update or use the new bug fix requirement.

Having him as a dependency is a non issue unless they're newer mods and can easily switch over.


Plus many mods have tethers and chains made to work with his mod. People complaining or demanding that others not use mods that require his. They're silly.

Rewriting mods isn't fun. Some mods could be fixed or swapped to a better bugfix mod, pretty easily. Others can't be.



Starfield is new. So many people and authors do have the opportunity to stay away from his stuff.



The comments with people complaining about his mod being required as a dependency. Those are mostly people who hate him and don't want to interact with his mods, even if the reasoning for many mods requiring his makes a lot of sense.


I'd say that many people's arguments are flawed or they're not saying things correctly.
Arthmoor has pretty much taken over the USSEP
yep! that's the good one, a lot more fixed in it as well.
He decides to do things that contradict lore and also altered perks to be less fun and stifle build variety. Famously he got rid of a powerful enchantment on a sword cause it was powerful and he made it so vampires couldn’t get full use of the necromage perk. Many of his fixes aren’t technical in nature and arguably just make the game more tedious. 

His unofficial patch is more of a “nanny patch” where he thinks he knows how you should play the game better than you do. He is also hated by other mod authors and has considerable beef with many other mod creators for numerous reasons. 

Mod author drama is nothing new but this guy has a problem with almost everyone, so much so the unofficial fallout 4 patch was created by a coalition of mod authors who decided to work together to bury him.
Anything he didn't much care for or thought he could make better, in his own opinion. **His own opinion**, being the operative words. Then mod authors unknowingly end up making mods dependent upon HIS mod.
?
not a conspiracy, but a problem if the UP starts making changes you dont want in your game
Yes, and the actual fixes are good, he is a skilled modder. But then he makes other undocumented changes that aren't fixes, just his personal preferences. When people tried to make mods that removed unpopular parts of his mod or do similar fixes without the extra changes, he would get their mods removed. If his mods broke your game, it's your fault and you'd be banned from posting. If you're playing an older version of Skyrim after anniversary edition came out, you were screwed because he pulled the version of his fixes for all older versions since "you should be playing AE'. And more... 
Do you have the Enforcer pistol creation? I had that same bug until I removed the Enforcer. No issues since removing it.
These people losing their fucking minds over the unofficial patch changing minor things (which they probably never even noticed until all this bullshit) for game balance, are the same people modding the games to be the most un-lore friendly abominations you can imagine.
anyone can stop modding at anytime. there is no guarantee that either one won't just give up/have other stuff in life.  However community patch, will be much easier for other people to take over
As far as I know he's never broken Bethesda's ToS (his shittery takes a lot of other different forms), so they would have no reason to ban him.
As a former mod of a large-ish sub, yeah it really does. I’ve had so many weird arguments with complete strangers over the most inane shit.
Legit. Subreddit mods are the most pathetic subhumans I've ever had this displeasure to have to bargain with on occasion. No offence to the ones on here of course, I'm not looking to get banned on the Starfield subreddit, the Starfield sub mods are of course very handsome and valuable humans.
Don’t let these upvotes go to your head.
Yeah there's literally dudes here who moderate all of the top100 subreddits at once, at that point they have no connections t all with any of those communitites and are purely doing it because it gets them off
Robert Moses was also a massive racist who made sure to destroy as many non-white neighborhoods in NYC as possible with all the road expansions.

It is so simple but also elegant and assertive, in its message.
Giskard. Now that’s a name I’ve not heard in a long time. It’s a shame since Arthmoors oblivion mods I quite enjoyed. Never really knew the guy had such a bad rep
And the owners of the Nexus site.
History has absolved him.
He is just a hater of anything that doesn’t fit exactly how he thinks things should be… disgrace that Bethesda included him as a creator. I love starfield and have been a fan since day 1 but out of all their poor choices this is the one that makes me very unhappy with Bethesda.
VR killed his parents
> why is the dude so against VR?

At the time Skyrim VR was released, he gave these reasons:

* No one on the team had a VR headset with which to test the mod.
* The team considered VR equipment too expensive.
* Skyrim VR has no *official* support for mods.

That's just what he said at the time.  I'm not making any judgement about it.  I'm just the messenger.
Alot of gamers don't like physical activity 
Not sure on why he has a vendetta against VR specifically, but before that it was mods on console.  Basically any new demographic that could potentially have someone port his stuff without his permission.  On one hand I get it, someone else porting your mod opens you up to endless requests and demands to fix that version of the mod and maybe you don't want the work of others to reflect your own.  On the other hand, everyone relying on your mod as a prerequisite makes it near impossible to have the same modding experience on the other versions of the game so there has to be some middle ground.  Let other mods exist that have the same results.
Because he thinks he's the ultimate arbiter and everyone should dance according to his tune.
I don't remember where I saw it but when SKSE was  originally released Arthmoor said it was for bypassing Steam's DRM to play illegal copies of the game.
Skyrim VR was forked from a very old version of skyrim, which means Bethesda fixed a lot of bugs since it was forked (that they haven't fixed for VR). It means they are two different games now, and  the unofficial patch team would have to support a whole new branch of the patch and re-add a whole slew of bug fixes they had removed before, just for a version that they don't play. Mods are also not supported on VR, and using unsupported means to modify the game is against their policy, because it can lead to more unanticipated bugs down the line. That's also why they waited for the ck to release their starfiled patch (the community patch used unofficial tools to release early). The unofficial patch is a huge endeavour : you have to gather reports, check the bugs, write the fixes, test the bug fixes... Many gamers are dumb and will report bugs with older versions of the patch, older versions of the game, cracked games and I believe they didn't want to add the inevitable reports from VR players using forked versions of their work. In the end they do it for free and I respect that they don't want other people taking credits for their work while multiplying their fake reports count. I wish the community patch team all the best but if they try to support everything on anything, their team is going to spend more time filtering garbage reports than fixing and playing the damn game.
Perhaps he has a health condition that prevents him from using it,like a seizure disorder and thus doesn't want anyone else enjoying it either? From what I've been reading from y'all about him,it fits.
I don't know about him but I've seen people hate on vr is games for a variety of reasons. Keep in mind, I'm not defending these or saying they're good, just what I've seen

Some people complained they felt devs started putting too much time into vr support vs the standard game

Vr is too gimmicky / childish / not serious enough

Health concerns over sessions being too long

Price of equipment and hardware needed for your pc

Flood of poor quality games trying to ride the vr hype train

Vr becoming over hyped/advertised/focus of people's videos and streams leading to both over saturation and people just getting tired of hearing about it

Some people just don't like stuff that becomes popular especially with more casual gamers

Etc etc
Out of the loop - What did he do? The one that bothered me the most was making unowned items owned
I'm sure his fanbase does.
Use the community. Literally no issues with it.
Really do not use that one, use the community patch instead.
>I reported the same issue in the skyrim modding subreddit, and my comment was swiftly deleted by the mod team 👍

Which makes sense. Arthmoor is banned from that subreddit for being a giant douche and all his bullshit in his mods is well known there.

It'd be purely stirring drama to leave that topic up.
So that was that message was (I used a cost free teleportation spell through the hole.)
There are even mines where he has changed what ore can be found in there, and claimed to have made them fit nonexistent veins. As if there are actual geological veins or something in this fantasy game. 


Edit: Arthmoor made me revive my reddit account just to warn people about him.
Right, like it’s been 200 years. Maybe a previous high king or jarl had the leftover gates removed instead of letting a constant reminder of the death and horror the people suffered just setting outside the front gates. Lol
I think not having ruined Oblivion games *is* an oversight, but the problem is that his implementation was terrible because the gates looked nothing like they should, and were in places that made no sense. They should be eroded pieces of rock in the middle of nowhere with a few daedra hanging around, with the ones near cities having been cleared off long ago.
General consensus is that he’ll put in “fixes” and other changes into his patches that people don’t really want, and whenever someone tries to make a suggestion to him he’ll insult you and tell you to deal with it if you don’t like it.
He was toxic enough to get banned from most modding subs back in the day. He also would do shitty stuff like DMCA other people’s mods because they tried to fix issues or patch compatibility—he hates VR and was pretty vicious about taking down a bunch of stuff in the Skyrim VR modding community that broke wabbajacks and other mod lists (including things that patched flat mods to have VR compatibility).
He also will report anyone else who makes an unofficial bug fix patch, in the hopes that their mod gets taken down. At one point, he was fully banned from Nexus mods (dunno if he still is).
Arthmoor is a great modder. Unfortunately, his works are still best avoided for other reasons.
The community does have a responsibility to develop ways to discourage gatekeeping by specific modders and mods.  Best address it now before it gets out of hand on the Nexus and other modding sites.
Iirc Arthmoor was always involved. 
To be fair, if you play Skyrim and you don't use UESP in *some* capacity
The best way to encourage change is to promote to other authors not to make hard dependency on that mod. 

Given the popularity of the other mod it would be odd to use  less popular mod for the community patches.
Usually, in my opinion, a non-arthmoor mod that requires the unofficial patch is probably not worth downloading. Like, even if it *was* as important as everyone says, why on earth would it be flagged as a requirement for a mod replacing *beard* models unless the developer filled the mod with dirty edits. Isn't it a general rule to require only the necessary ESP/ESL files that the mod needs to function and call back from? Like, for example, a mod that changes Whiterun shouldn't have Hearthfire as a requirement unless it calls for Hearthfire assets. 

TL;DR - Non-Arthmoor USEP requirement = (probably) Dirty Edits
With a bit of know how you can excise his stank from any mod. Using "Clean Masters" in xedit can usually get rid of it.

[Quick and dirty video showing how to remove masters with xedit if "clean masters" doesn't work.](https://youtu.be/GJj7ajeJbWk?si=BUzHZTXSuvaqtvXD)
I mean it's simple really, his ego skyrocketed over time to the point that he starts thinking he can dictate what the "true vanilla experience" should be for games that he mods.
The break point was a bit earlier than 2016, he started going off the deep end with the paid mods debacle iirc.
I’ve played MUDs my whole life and people that write code for them develop this exact kind of niche egotism. I’ve commented on it in my MUD for years. So I’m not really surprised.
I had terrible interactions with him early in 2012 trying to report incompatibilities. I later would just read his Nexus forums posts for fun and he's been a massive dick since Morrowind modding when you scroll through his posts. I think the only major change is he started researching copyright law

Was wondering when Minecraft was going to be mentioned...
RIP Redpower. I had so much fun programming in FORTH back in the mindcrack pack.
Or 'update' his patches to use the Community patch instead
Twitter has ruined what the verified check mark should mean by making it a status symbol instead of just an actual verification of identity.

Those are all from today. I think it's just a guy who is woefully undereducated on the issue and likes to get into silly arguments.
But calling someone a huge nerd is like the dumbest 12 year old insult. Just makes it seem more obvious that he’s an alt account or a shill. Otherwise he’d use a real insult
Wouldn’t call that an insult in this culture.
Only extremely non nerdy people would consider nerd to be an insult, nerds just consider nerd to be a description, since we are discussing vidogame mods, I doubt anyone in this space would be in the former camp.
Arthmoor strikes me as the kind of guy who proudly wants to be known as the biggest nerd.  So that makes it even more likely that it's him.
I love myself, but am still willing to admit that I’m a huge nerd.
I had no idea how bad and bloated it had gotten, since I had mods from my 2016 install date, and my 2019 install date... most of 'em required the keyword framework.

But getting *rid* of AWKCR... goddamn, I had to ditch a lot of stuff. However, the game's more stable, there's fewer inventory issues, and I can use ECO/LEO, etc now.
It's a bloated mess, and touches *way* more than the author needed to. 

It used to address a limit to keywords in the engine, but Bethesda fixed that and removed the limit after a while, so it's not even necessary anymore. 

In addition to not being a requirement for the engine anymore, it adds a huge amount of trash items like (armor?) decals and paints, which aren't even guaranteed to be used other than for clutter. The added crafting tables are a crapshoot as to whether they'll even work, and related mods (or those that even just rely on this as a prereq) aren't very good overall, all things considered.

Getting rid of it, I've all but eliminated crashing and don't have to worry about the added clutter and weird changes and (still open) bugs the author refuses to address. Well, he does address them with loads of workarounds in the forum...
Wait what line?
Idk how it’s possible like I said the only way I can see it is if nexus website allowed it so as I said “if” it’s true they helped unfortunately but considering that every other community patch mod has been taken down I kinda tend to believe the claims have some merit.  But that’s just a gut feeling I have
Lolz. Thank you
Is there something like it for Skyrim and Fallout 4?
| To put it mildly, the leadership currently in charge of SFCP don't align with the principles our team operates under

That’s funny af, seeing as how arthmoor is the only one who deals with it
My bad. Thank you!
Probably why his install instructions are to place his mod at the top of the load order, *no matter what*
His Skyrim patch started changing where resources were in which mines because he thought it made more sense for ebony to be in one place etc.

A lot of people thought that went beyond the purview  of an unofficial patch
People always give examples of that.

Most notable examples are of him changing an Ebony mine to an Iron mine. Sure, there is a single piece of evidence that it shouldn't be an Ebony mine, but multiple instances of evidence that it **IS** an Ebony mine.

When killing the first dragon, he added a voiceline saying "Dovahkiin? Nooooo!". It wasn't in the English game before. Other languages have it, but English is the primary language of the game, so it should determine what is right.

One of the NPCs involved in a quest got their looks changed based on a dialogue line... completely ignoring the fact that the quest states that the NPC is in hiding and is diguised.

Or they changed ways to level up skills. Not outright exploits, but some already grind-y methods were disabled, making leveling of certain skills even harder.
Even if your game does end up bugging out, jump through the unity and the whole game 'refreshes'. Starfield is built for modding, and it definitely is the least buggy of Bethesda's games.


Too bad they got a reputation for it though, and some modders will always feel like they're superior for 'fixing', when in actuality they're doing nothing but adding onto the pie that's already made.
I'm a beginner modder but learned from the frustrations of dealing with this him from Skyrim
I'm sure that's news to Daveh
Yeah, one such “fix” was for the Ebony Blade. The swing speed on the Unofficial Skyrim Patch is significantly reduced, the Ebony Blade being the fastest swinging Greatsword in the game is by design, it cannot be improved at a smithy so the higher swing speed and health steal is what makes it a viable, useful weapon.

But the unofficial Skyrim patch makes it the same swing speed as all other great swords. Immediately uninstalled the patch because it was pretty clear that if there were more “fixes” like that down the line I was in for a bad time.
Almost makes you miss the rating system of fallout 4's mods
With what he's changed in Skyrim alone it makes me wonder just what kind of lore facts are actually fake and have been retroactively changed by the changes in the patch alone tbh.

  
the Iron Mine to Ebony Mine thing for instance, eventually we'll get to a point where people just actually believe it was always an iron mine and it is not an ebony mine in the game akin to Oxhorn believing that Obsidian made a lore mistake by having a folder in a building it's not supposed to be in.

  
Only for that folder to be because of his installed mods lmao
What I’m hearing is his mods are quite decent in general (sometimes?) but he’s a dick head to others, shame
Okay yeah he sounds like a prick. I don’t plan to do Starfield modding outside of Bethesda’s content that doesn’t disable mods so thankfully I won’t need his stuff in the future. Don’t wanna support a douche.
I do I will try deleting it
Former mod of a large sub named turtle? Yuh-oh
Its funny that you have to slip that in there so the mods don't get their fragile egos hurt lol
I know reddit love to hate on mods. While some are good, it's just funny to see when mods are clearly wrong or inconsistent and just double down instead of being like yeah sorry you're right.
One example of his shitty racist policies was to design overpasses across roads leading to beaches where the bridges were intentionally too low. Why? Because there would be enough clearance for cars to use those roads but buses wouldn't fit under the bridges. And who used those buses? Poor minorities. He wanted to keep those "undesirables" from the nice beaches so he weaponized the roadways
He sounds real convenient for all those elected white men that came and went to blame when they could have done something about it.
Even Arthmoor's skyrim stuff - including the USSEP - is good quality. Part of why the USSEP is so dominant isn't just because Arthmoor actively stifles competing projects, it's also because even if you hate the stupid editorial changes, it's a genuinely good patch that fixes countless problems, including ones that the average modder generally can't handle, like defective navmesh or complex script problems. 

The problem was the transformation Arthmoor undertook which has eerie similarities to Giskard's descent, albeit with far fewer "mental illness" indicators. He's gone from being someone who supported and advanced the community and promulgated good practices to someone who takes stands that harm the community for the proper of (if his posts are to be believed, financially) benefiting himself. 

If these an opportunity to get an open community patch in Starfield rather than getting roped into "vendor lock" with Arthmoor, I think it would be wise for the Starfield modding community to learn from the Skyrim community's experience and give Arth a pass.
OH IS HE THE PRICK THAT WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO FUCKUP THE LIVE ANOTHER LIFE SKYRIM MOD
Anyone can post creations and I doubt they even know the drama around him
[deleted]
I think any mod author can apply to be a creator. Message them with his belligerent history, and tell them they should not have him as a creator.
See I knew it had to be something like that
Beatsaber ruins lives 🫶🤧🙏
and stole his sweet roll
and burned his village, but could only do it virtually.  so whenever he uses any VR he is cursed with homelessness
and that does make some sense, except he actively prevented \*people with VR\* from using a variant of his mod. Just stick a "use at your own risk" label and be done with it
Sounds like he wants Bethesda to buy him a VR headset, and unless they give him one, he doesn’t want anyone to be able to use it. Like he’s trying to hold VR hostage until they buy him one. Like he thinks he’s too important to not be given one.
Thx I appreciate it! Yeah the factoids summed up are exactly what I was after 😊
> The team considered VR equipment too expensive.

wut

As in, yes, it is pretty expensive in 3rd world countries(going purely off minimum wage and such), but in developed countries it's affordable from what I understand.
Depends on how you use VR, I use it with a keyboard and mouse sitting down and it works pretty good. I like it games like BGS games and games like Farming Simulator, Truck Simulator etc.

As I think of it, I never stand while using VR.
Hilarious..😂 but a tad harsh. Have you ever seen NikitaFajita doing those games on her VR treadmill? It's the only time I've ever been JEALOUS of someone working out in my life 💀. Sh__ looks dope! 😉🔥 plus the idea of basically having a more immersive session on any from the Elder Scrolls, Fallout and not Starfield franchises too just sounds incredibly cool. I want to punch a deathclaw or terrormorph in the face and feel it lol. And some of those haptic feedback body suits for that stuff look truly insane! The tech is progressing so much it's amazing
Hmm. I get the "extra faff" issue with a different medium. But given the dude is literally one of their "blue check" creators you'd think they'd offer a ton of help on those kinds of issues. It's not like he's a solo modder in a basement designing it in isolation anymore? Idk though, obvs I know nothing about the dude's life, and maybe he just wants peace and quiet I guess - it just hasn't sounded like that from a lot of the discussions on the sub recently, he's clearly given others the vibe that he's a power hungry control freak with some of his stuff 😅 and a couple of pple kindly posted links to his own online comments on certain topics and it does look like he'd be more likely to fit the latter assessment rather than my "I want to see the best in people" one 💀Feels like people's biggest frustration came from his initially being good, so good that everyone based their own mods around it, and then they all ended up regretting that choice. Ig to quote an overly-used movie line: "with great power comes great responsibility" (and more people ideally holding you accountable).
That's fair but then isn't that an issue more on the side of BGS not getting behind VR too? It sounds like you're saying it's mostly a ressouce issue. Which seems odd for them. They appear pretty good at taking new/inventive approaches to games, like it's in their dna? I get wanting to avoid bad reviews with a sub-par game, that makes total sense. I'm assuming the main reason they'd be avoiding it now is basically that they think VR is still too much of a niche market then?
Thx :) Yeah I mean I get several of those points lol. I'm old enough to remember the friggin horrible "trend" that was movies all trying to do 3D "bc iz cool". Sh__ like the saw movies sending flying cogwheels "at you" whilst you wore a crap pair of blue and red paper glasses lol... That was BAD. Like: I'd come out feeling carsick  and with a headache kinda bad. It was PURE gimmick. 🤮

But that tech has evolved a ton recently and I honestly think from a health perspective it could be so friggin good (and fun) to be able to punch a terrormorph in the face. A lot of people in office jobs sit on their as- all day in front of a laptop or PC. Would make a ton more sense instinctively if our "fun time" included a bit more mobility than that.

And price wise I mean the Quest is like 200 or so these days? Which is WAY WAY less than the average pc build (that's obvs if it was able to run solo, I know a lot of the skyrim/fallout VR crowd tend to use it linked up to a PC bc of the mod availability and bc afaik right now neither of those run purely on the Quest alone? Someone correct me if I'm wrong bc I might be!). 

So whilst I can see all those points as having been valid once, some of them are kinda moot these days? I'm  *cough* old enough that I remember parents outright dismissing stuff as video game = bad. And I think we've proven them wrong, very much so. So I just wonder if a general reluctance to VR is a bit like that same battle again? I dunno ig. Time will tell! :)
I think Boars were left out of the Creature faction, and the Unofficial patch put them in. Sounds nice and innocuous. 

Two issues: most importantly, this was not, technically, a bug fix. It should have been an optional file.

Second: Oblivion had a LOT of wildlife/creature overhaul that messed with animals and factions. Some of which could have based their position on boars on the imperfect but functional vanilla lack of faction membership. In which case, a patch is now BREAKING mods because it changed something which, while imperfect, was NOT actually broken. 

Patches should FIX BROKEN things. That's it, that's all. If you want to "correct" what you feel are imbalances or quirks, fine. Do it in a second, OPTIONAL file.
So that explains why most ebony ore veins suddenly and inexplicably became iron
Oh that’s why… that little shit
Replaced the ebony with iron at the town north of Riften, when lorewise it should have been quicksilver and iron.


We tried to point to the vanilla quest *with an actual bit of quicksilver* that you get appraised, but nope.
That is probably one of the few arbitrary changes I have to agree actually did make sense, though. Everywhere else refers to that one mine as being an iron one, and there was a quest with people excited because finally the place had something that was not more iron.

But the guy's attitude did not make that an easy discussion to have.
This is like not cleaning up after 9/11
Ugh. He sounds like a real “prince”.
He has killed some of my fav mods so I am def holding a grudge lol
Lost a very long Skyrim VR save due to this situation when it happened. He was using DMCA against anyone sharing the old working version of the mod, claiming it was piracy, that's when i decided i was never going to use any mod from him.

He could literally just have uploaded the old version and made that the official final version for VR, but no...
Hasn't even DMCA'd folks for trying to make their own fix for something USSEP fixes?
He has also had many mods that competed directly against his mods removed.
Given that I'd love to see Starfield in VR, it sounds like he's diametrically opposed to progress.
He stays super active on the Bethesda Discord
I think that poster may be getting confused with the Unofficial Oblivion Patch, which was started by Quarn and Kivan and later taken over by Arthmoor.
Also the changes are not undocumented (you can literally just verify them yourself), just some are controversial.
He learned that stance from someone else, way back during the oblivion scene.
I'm not implying the allegations are false, just that it's kind of an oddly specific way to be disagreeable in a niche community.
The one in the US. I don't want to drag politics into it more than that. 
I wish I hadn't played so much with UCO installed :(
at the start of Skyrim the dragon shouts "Dovahkin noooo" - the audio for this is not played in vanilla, and was only added by the unofficial patch.
If the mods used his own code to patch the game, then he can copyright it. 

If mods want to patch things they need to start from scratch and prove they didn't use the other patch as a reference.

That's just how coding has always been. It's easy to find stolen code base on how people write the code.
Not a problem!
That and his mod is so far reaching beyond just bugs, it's a major dependency. Meaning no other mod dependant on it will correctly load unless it is above those mods in the load order. You physically can't load the USP mod unless it's at the top. It's almost like a prerequisite master to nearly everything besides actually skyrim.esm and the DLCs. It's unofficially an official master plugin. It's that entrenched in everything in Skyrim. And because he used his "weight" to DMCA strike any competitor AIO glitch path mod, it's the only one really standing.
Top of the load order means lowest priority
That's always the instruction for big patches, so specific mods can overwrite as needed.

Honestly, it's way too soon to use either patch. What if Bethesda fixes things themselves, in a manner different from a patch? That's potentially game breaking.
Good. Keep responding about your first-hand experience when the opportunity arises. Maybe we can make a difference.
> The Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch (USSEP) is a major mod started by Quarn and Kivan, and currently coordinated by Arthmoor

From UESP.
It made it so I couldn’t wear a dragon priest mask with my College arch mage robes and broke my battle mage build. Uninstalled it pretty quickly
He "fixed" the price of salmon roe potions, until BGS slapped him silly and said he wasn't to do that. Obviously they wanted people to buy Hearthfire for the roe even if they didn't want the houses.
To add onto what squidtugboat said, here’s a mores specific example:

His Xbox patch for Skyrim, at least at one point, included a 4k retexture for bear pelts. Totally not the kinda thing you’d expect in a patch. That may not sound horrible, but keep in mind Skyrim on Xbox only allows for 5gb worth of mods, and that system is stuck at 1080p, so 4k textures do nothing but hog storage space and degrade performance.

The gist of it is, his “patches” that you would expect to be fixes are more just his personal preferences being passed off as necessary changes.
I don’t know much about his other mods I just know many consider his patch to be antithetical to the vision of skyrim and he is resented by the community both modder and player alike. In my own experience I have delt with power tripping mod creators who thought people thanking them for making something was a insult.
He cleverly mixes decent stuff in with stupid stuff, which is why mod authors adding a dependency on his patches problematic. You can't just accept his decent changes. You have to accept his entire philosophy.
Hopefully that fixes your issue. It worked for me and from a few things I read online it seems to be the culprit.
I’m out of the loop on this one tbh
Well this is awkward
Just don't insult me or anything and we're chill
Well, these are people who devote significant chunks of their life to working for free for a billion dollar company. Probably not the most intellectually honest and intelligent crowd.
I got perma banned in the mass effect sub for stating a fact on a comment and someone getting butthurt about it.  Claimed I was being a bigot or some nonsense.   I appealed it as I was being respectful in my post they claimed was that way and they just doubled down and blocked me from the appeal.  I've found that many mods in a lot of these sites are pathetic individuals that finally got something they could exert power on and they go hard.
Rrrrrright, my god, some of you people.
The elected white men *haven't* blamed him. They don't even pay lip service to the people impacted by his racist bullshit. They just ignore the people who speak up. Same as it ever was.
He WHAT!? Oh hell no. That mod is why I played so many times. F that B.
If you mean how it's coded to prevent people from teleporting out of the room, I dont see that as a fuck up because doing that could potentially break the whole mod.
How'd he get a checkmark? Community doesn't have one :/
Excuses excuses. They shouldn't work with an active bully, who also opposes VR.
Wait. They pulled him? How come his mod for starfield got the blue check mark thing then?
But did it cook them up in a chili and feed it to him? No? Snowflake. ❄️
All it did is make me realize how the game is fully playable and functional without the "patch", and the only noticable differences are the creative changes and the stuff it actually breaks. As of right now, the only unofficial patch that's actually necessary is the Oblivion one, and the game is still playable, but it fixes voice acting mistakes.
 I believe people offered to pay for him to get a headset when he initially posted his reasons, but he still refused to entertain the idea.
Lmfao, that's the funniest post I've read today.
Nah quality VR is mad expensive tho, but I’m a console player so I can’t even afford a quality PC let alone a quality VR setup. Devil’s advocate: maybe he was just saying he can’t afford it?? Lol
He said it in 2018 when Skyrim VR was released and they don't exactly have much in the way of disposable income.
I personally would only ever sit for a sim based game, either flight or racing. Otherwise all standing of my 2400+ hours or VR.
Boars not being in the creature faction when every other animal was was clearly a bug, though, and the unofficial patches made an effort to fix every bug whether the bug actually broke something or not. All of those other mods could have just forwarded the change by adding boars into the creature faction as well. 
He's actually banned from several modding subreddits due to his behavior.
Ironically, he wasnt always like that. I knew him from early skyrim modding and he was plesent. I have a theory as to what might have changed, but cant really get into that.
Mod piracy is, frankly, the most hilarious thing I've ever heard about. Like, you're making this for another piece of software, it's not a standalone product, and you're releasing it **for free**. Stay in your lane, dude. I know Bethesda has a different terms of service, but I know if Sims modders or GTA modders sent DMCA takedowns, EA and Rockstar would intervene and say that you can't copyright something that's not copyrighted, let alone DMCA something that's made to run under their IP
Yes, or things that used names similar to USSEP for people looking for patch alternatives (big issue especially for non-Anniversary Edition forks like Skyrim VR or for adapting some older mods).
Honestly, the changes shouldn't even be that controversial. People get hung up on the mine but that's a stupid thing to blow up a community over. Be angry about how he responded to people complaining about the mine, because that's the real problem. 


And I have no clue where this misconception came from that everything it does is undocumented. It's not on Nexus because the list of changes is too large, but the Nexus page linked to I think a GitHub or pastebin documenting everything. But this misconception being repeated everywhere just goes to show how poorly informed most people really are on it, just repeating the drama they see. 
It goes back further than 2016, to another cult of personality. This one based around another modder who hated nexus, competition and basically any mod his guild didn't create.
Some cut content or disabled content, should probably stay optional or disabled.
Wow.... glad i don't use the patches since oblivion
True. They spent the last year of development polishing up the game. And have continued to work on bugs after release.
Well from what I see he's not on the Nexus for SF so that will make it harder for him to push the UP since most people, especially the newer people, stick with the nexus.
Lol that’s fucking wild. The Morokei + Arch Mage robes is practically a requirement for pure magic characters lol.
Did Bethesda seriously do that? I feel like when the devs specfically tell you to stop, that's gotta be a low point.
Jeez man, if anything 4k textures would make a xbone original explode lmao
Hmm very strange honestly.
https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/14f4rgi/highly_unpopular_moderator_uawkwardtheturtle_has/

:p
Me too…. I have zero idea what’s happening?
🤣
https://creations.bethesda.net/en/creators/bethesdagamestudios
It's not an excuse lol, it's literal fact. Anyone can apply to BGSC. They're not going to examine the community drama around a creator, they don't even know about it.
 It sure why your having a go at me
Nah I'm just dumb he didn't have one for a bit now he does it must have been a glitch
The one notable fix I found was making the argonian Derkeethus not run back home if your house isn't his default spot.
As we say in Persian, "Kose Nanash" , we have lived without him and we will live without him!
Without the patch you'll always get random crashes around Skingrad. A bug that took him a long time to track down.

Oblivion is THE buggiest crash happy fucking game in the series and what's worse.. you need Wrye Bash to fix the animation bug that eventually bricks the game - there was NO fix for the 360.
Lol, maybe he just wants Bethesda to do it.
What would you need "quality vr" for though? Realistically, the platform you want to develop for is quest 3 anyway, because that's by far how most people will run the game. And since it's pcvr and not going to run on the headset natively, it probably won't even matter that much.
You can play pcvr on a quest 2 which is $200 new, probably even less used, for a high end pc gamer running Starfield, that’s not “mad expensive”

And it doesn’t matter if it’s expensive or if he can’t afford it, artificially blocking others from modding it because he doesn’t have a headset is petty and vindictive and serves no purpose.
Oh please, get at least a second hand 1080ti, and a second hand occulus or HTC and for most user cases thats a good setup.

You dont need a 4090 and the newest VR headset to get a good experience.
Na just a quality video card. I got a 3070 instead of a series x and built the rest of my pc open box at microcenter.
I like it for the simple fact, I can turn my head around, dont really need it for immersion.
Should it be "fixed" when fixing it causes more problems than letting it be? It literally does nothing at all to have it in the wrong faction.
It was absolutely NOT a bug. It was an oversight. An obvious mistake. But not a bug. 

That said, I actually don't mind the patch fixing that. But it turned out to be a slippery slope toward an ebony mine becoming an iron mine for...reasons.  And as many of us know, those from the Giskard school of modding won't hear any arguments on "lore friendliness." Whether the lore is real or head Canon, it's their way or no way.
“Trust me bro, I know this guy. He wasn’t always a dick but I know why and I’m not telling”

Sure. And I knew Todd Howard back in the day before he discovered cool leather jackets and made Skyrim 18 times
Was better back in the oblivion days
Rockstar probably wouldn't know. It was filed by Arthmoor (probably) on Dropbox. Bethesda likely has no idea the DCMA happened as a result.

 Not a new concept though. Arthmoor is a tyrant in ways, and he's been doing this for a long time using other means Bethesda can't stop. Mostly he simply whined and complained to Nexus and they killed mods. Nexus being the big mod library means he just needed to kill Nexus mods he hated. They did his beck and call. The DCMA was actually because Nexus killed the mod people needed, and so they went to Dropbox. Nexus couldn't help, so he got creative.

That's the issue though. People have learned to hijack Nexus in a way that lets them run right over anyone they don't like, and arthmoor is the champion of this in Bethesda games. He changed everything, you don't like one thing? Too bad, Nexus removed your mod.

Bethesda only got involved once, and only because arthmoor changed something that would cost Bethesda money. Ironically the change did look like a legitimate bug. If  you look at it, it seemed like Bethesda made a fat finger mistake. They really just wanted to sell more dlc.

But Bethesda doesn't care if arthmoor or anyone else reigns like a tyrant in the mod scene anymore then EA does about the Sims.
It’s literally like going into a museum and adding your own stuff to someone else’s painting. Sure I like mods and use them but I don’t lie to myself about what it is.
I'm often hard on Bethesda. And there's no excuse for the release state of either Starfield or 76. But they have at least stuck around to fix things.

The real toll of their behavior won't be known until TES 6. I'm as diehard a TES Fan as ever was...but I won't even look at it now until the mod kit is out, at which time I'll consider it.
That’s true. But he’s only happy when he’s making others miserable. He can still find a way heavily influence things.
I'm not sure if that characterization is accurate. First, there was good reason to suspect it was a mistake. The alchemical values for Salmon Roe weren't just unusual, but they swapped the normal values of two of its effects. When they reverted the change, they cited "confirmation that the effects were intentional" but I don't know from whom, where or how they said that.
Holy shit! They actually banned me years ago. Very glad to see them gone, they were the most toxic and hostile mod out there
Love this. Honestly I love them bringing modders in and giving them actual credit for their improvements. Of all the companies out there I haven't heard of any smart enough to embrace people wanting essentially a customisable game to that extent, BGS seems to stand out in that regard. So so many are stuck in their DCMA battles over dumb isht that could actually HELP sell their games if they knew how to embrace it (Nintendo I'm looking at you lol.........👀)
WAIT WAIT WAIT. You can mod Skyrim on the qu- nvm now I read your full comment lol. I wasn’t aware the quest could be hooked up to PC’s tbh, my mistake.
Fixing it doesn't cause problems with the base game, just with other mods that used the wrong faction membership. But no mod, especially a patch mod for the base game, is obligated to consider the impact their changes will have on other mods. 


Nothing at all? 


Here's an example from starfield. When you confront a certain NPC in the Freestar questline you might end up in a fight with them. After the fight ends and you head back to the main town, two of the guards will start shooting at you. This has the potential to escalate into fighting the whole town if you misplace your shots or an explosive goes off. The reason these two random guards in town start fighting you is because they're assigned to the same faction as the guards you fight back during the quest, and you became hostile to that faction. Instead of being assigned to the faction the rest of the town guards are like they should be.


In Oblivion, say an ability gave you friendly status to animals. It would do that by making you friendly with the faction animals are assigned to. If one creature was left out due to a bug/oversight it wouldn't function for that creature. 
Bugs can be as simple as oversights. A creature being assigned to the wrong faction is absolutely the type of thing a patch would fix, and that exact bug has been fixed in official Skyrim and Starfield patches. 


I think it's important to remember that no mod is obligated to be made with compatibility in mind for all the other mods out there, especially patch mods which should always come first unless it's between two mods. 



The mine thing that everyone gets hung up on was a bug. The game said, "this is an iron mine," when the NPCs and notes called it an iron mine. One of the village NPCs, in one of the jobs that Skyrim offers, will buy iron ore off you as though you've helped in the mines. 


But it was actually an ebony mine. No explanation was given in-game for this discrepancy. So was the bug that it was supposed to be an ebony mine but the dialogue and writing was a typo and the job was for the wrong ore, or it was supposed to be an iron mine and the ebony ore was an error?


 
Just here to say in regard to programming, that every bug is always an oversight or mistake, no one purposely programs a bug, if they do, they call it a feature.
If I remember right Arthmoor had a mega fucking meltdown when Trump was elected
EVERYTHING was better back in oblivion days lol

New account for ban evasion? /s
Well I'm unsure, they're leading to the support/normalazation of paid mods and are probaby paid less than official employies if so they're like free labor for the developers at Betheada.
Yeah you can play PCVR wirelessly with a Quest/Quest 2/Quest 3, via a wifi router, it works great.  Or plug it in via the USB.

If ya have like a 2060 or up then you can do VR fine with most titles, though a better GPU is always nicer.  I first started VR with a 1060 6gb on the Rift, but the Quests are too high resolution for a 1060.  Skyrim VR ran at a locked 90 on that 1060 gpu though, it was great.  I've upgraded since then, but the mid-range newer cards would all do VR perfectly.
Ahhh...so that's the full story on the iron mine thing. Thanks!

That's a tough one. Ultimately, though, it probably should have been an optional separate file. It wasn't actually broken. And regardless of the fix, it's a judgement call. Judgement calls over things that are, at worst, immersion breaking but functional, really shouldn't go into something as all encompassing as a community patch of this size.

Still...if I'd ever spotted that in my game back them, to be honest, I'd have fixed it. And probably in the same way.
I agree.

But this wasn't breaking games, either
Arthmoor has done plenty that’s worth criticizing in my opinion, but in this case, that wasn’t him. The mod author who suddenly made all his work unavailable right after the 2016 election was Apollodown, who was most recognized at the time for his Civil War Overhaul.
Trump Derangement Syndrome is an annoying right wing meme but in his case it really was that. Pulling mods off Nexus to protest the elected POTUS because *some* users of those mods may have voted for him is insane and throwing a temper tantrum against Nexus for requiring versioning archival for people's collections is even dumber. 

L for Bethesda giving this guy a verification checkmark and priority access to the Creation Kit as opposed to the community team (mostly comprised of people who made Wabbajack trying to ensure Arthmoor doesn't pull similar shenanigans on a new game's community). Favoritism because he's active in the Bethesda discord, the only place where he's allowed to behave as he does.

Bethesda deserves a lot of the blame for allowing this to take place. They're completely disconnected with the community and many of their modders.
'Cept for the graphics.

Yeesh.
Still can't copyright a Thomas Kinkaid with a bigfoot painted onto it since you're making an edit of Thomas Kinkaid's work.
If that's the case that's crap behaviour on their part but I have no idea tbh. Haven't seen anyone vocally complaining about it yet? If that makes sense? Are there actually any modders going "dayum this is unfair" etc after having joined Bethesda?
It's worth noting that the game is fully playable at a good frame rate with an AMD RX 570 8GB, 32 GB of RAM, and AMD Ryzen 5 1600 3.20 GHz if you don't find graphical overhauls like DyndoLod to be "necessary". Also, replace Airlink with Virtual Desktop. It does everything much better
>That's a tough one. Ultimately, though, it probably should have been an optional separate file.

With that mindset though, you don't end up with a coherent Unofficial Patch. You end up with a thousand individual fix mods. One for the mine at Shor's Stone. One for Dragon spawn lists. One to break Alchemy exploit loops. One to fix typos AND capitalization. One to fix typos BUT NOT capitalization.

There's certainly a place for some splitting. Splitting the patch into separate files per main game and DLC, for example, so that users remain free to use or not use certain DLC. Or splitting between files for "critical fixes", "cosmetic fixes", "consistency fixes" and "balance/exploit fixes". But separate files for every little thing? Might as well not have a patch at all, then.

I'll rail on Arthmoor for some decisions / personality reasons as much as the next guy, but some of the takes in this thread are unhinged (not yours, just venting).
I did forget to mention the following info. Part of the story with the mine ingame is that the miners discovered a "strange" ore in it recently, and they have a sample they want you to get identified. The sample is quicksilver, but no quicksilver ore is found in the mine. Now it's possible that sample was supposed to be ebony, but again dialogue identifies it as quicksilver. Imo, it probably should have had a mix of iron and quicksilver veins inside, not ebony or just iron. 


Should it have been a separate file? Possibly. But when the game first came out there was already a separate patch for base game and each dlc, which didn't get merged into one until the legendary edition came out. Maybe they decided against too many extra files. 
Okay my bad, I confused the two

Thank you for correcting me
Yes, i agree.

I actually misread that other guy and thought he was defending Arthmoor.
I think it isn't so much "oooh, free labor" from Bethesda as it's "this clearly benefits is, it can also benefit you" and I'm not mad about modders getting their bag. They could make a Patreon or something, but I don't know how the cut goes of paid creation vs free but Patreon takes their percentage.

If you're gonna be doing it anyway it's good to have options. And even if BGS wasn't taking a cut it'd still be good for them because they can curate talent and use it as an employment pipeline (but they're a business, so of course they're gonna take a little. Nature of the game).
Where exactly to draw the line would admittedly be a difficult threshold to determine. Especially for someone like me, who digs immersion and verisimilitude. 

But you're calling it a bugfix patch. And sharing it broadly. Gotta draw the line somewhere.
Good points.

Personally I've never felt any animosity toward Arthmoor or even the former Engineering Guild. They were...hard people to actually like at times. But I never outright disliked them.

I'm also not sure how much hyperbole is involved in recent claims. I've been out of the TES modding scene for a decade other than using Wabbajack lists and a recent Skyrim bug fix/tweak involving Harrold's horse crashing into walls.

That said, I think it's too early for any big fix patches. There's just too much potential yet for a "counter fix" from Bethesda or a misunderstood function, given the use of proc gen and POI, etc being new to the game, at least as it's used here.
Gta 6 trailer but......
created by : RavenwestR1 at YouTube

I have seen many trailer recreated
(in gta 5).  but none of them is this well made. RavenwestR1 did a amazing job
This is what I was hoping to see in this subreddit and not the hunt for Lucia's model's social security number.
Great trailer, and it really captures some of the differences between GTA 5 and GTA 6. I think some of the biggest notable upgrades will be lighting and ray tracing, character animations, and particle effects. Can't wait!
This is actually amazing 😂 And it really highlights the graphical difference between GTA 5 & GTA 6.
Grand Theft Auto: V 1/2
This is so well done actually. I especially love the girl "twerking" on the car.
gta vi for ps3
Damn I was not expecting it to be so good 🔥🔥🔥
Michael finally got his boat back!
They have no right to make the graphics look this good 😭
That is extremely well done!
Gta 5 beach looks so empty i think i might cry if the population density in gta 6 on the beach is exactly like in tthe trailer.
Finally something hilarious and not about Lucia. Cheers to the creator !
How is this even possible? Damn
Now i gotta go on yt and give it a like. Good shit
[deleted]
GTAV is still impressive as hell.
Damn in comparison to the gta 6 trailer, GTA really looks like ass.
Great post!!!
It's crazy how GTA 5 *still* looks good
Hilarious, props to the creator
Damnn this clearly shows how realistic the character models are in GTA6. Amazing work whoever did this
More posts like this please! Enough of the recycled BS memes and "discovered news"
The jiggle physics difference is huge.
People keep saying gta 5 looks like trash now, but I think it still looks pretty good. Don’t get me wrong, if the gta 6 trailer had looked like this I would have been mad, but it still looks good.
Why does GTA V look like San Andreas when V came out?
THERE AREN'T COUGARS IN STORES!!!!!
Should've used a recorder version of Tom Petty's song.
damn effort
You nailed it. Can't be done better than this. It also really tells you about the significant graphical upgrade we're gonna get.
Mom: “we have gta 6 at home”
If this would’ve dropped in 2013 we would’ve been just as excited
I’d still buy it, lol.
GTA V.V
This is both awesome and an incredible way to truly compare the difference in tech capability between 5 and 6.
This makes me realize how ass gta 5 was
Phew you never really realize the jump in tech until you see this dog shit lmao
The girl twerking is definitely on beginner level. 😂
I always said GTA V graphics hold up even in 2023 until I saw the character faces in this video 😂
Jason's keffiyah 🥶
Wow this is as close as it can get!
Didnt realise the graphical difference was this big.
No way is this the actual gameplay of GTA V.2
This the best recreation so far!
And people say gta6 wouldn't run on ps4
This is some high quality shit
People don't seem to understand how good this is! Wow!
GTA 6 but it’s on PS4
Awesome job.
What is this goofy ahh trailer
Goddamn gta5 is looking so dated now
Why did you download somebody else’s video and post it on Reddit rather than make a link to the vid on YouTube?
Hopefully the gameplay is much better than GTA V. Graphics is just graphics.
Damn, GTA 5 looked that bad?
Console players in 2025: Playing GTA VI

PC players in 2025:
Insane Clown Posse gonna sue Rockstar now instead of that Joker guy
Why didn't you just link the YouTube vid? You literally ripped this from his channel and robbed him of views...
omg, did anyone else get major chills watching the Gta 6 trailer? I can't even handle the level of excitement right now! 😱 The graphics look insane and the storyline seems to be on another level. Rockstar never disappoints! Can't wait to get my hands on this masterpiece! 💥
Trust?
Great edit. Trash game 🤮
looks like shit
I was waiting for LOVE IS A VERY LONG ROAD
So we got GTAVI in GTAV before we actually got GTAVI?
This just reminds me how ugh gta 5 characters were
Damn... They done made Jason right handed.
[removed]
Looks the fucking same game as GTA V really i mean how blind are people. How anyone could be hyped about this commercial shit
I mean this is probably closer to what it's really gonna look like, don't let the real trailer fool you
From the amount of remakes I've seen in the short time since the trailers release, it surprises me that it's taken this long for me to see a V version
Impressive!
u/savevideo
This is hella impressive
This probably took weeks
Crazy well made!!
Tf was that twerking 😭
NOOO TANISHA
**Rey._.** creator did similar too
Damnnn well done!!!!
Nice.
Something seems off. I can’t quite put my finger on it….
I hope the sound efx on gta6 are top notch like dirtbikes sound so good in real life lol
The last time we swear caught me off guard lol
Might impressive!
This is honestly pretty incredible.
This Is the Best thing i have seen today.
This really displays the difference in the graphics so well. Just watching the vi trailer it’s an obvious improvement, but this makes me realize just how big of a gap there is between the graphics
GTA VI Legacy Collection looks great on the iOS.
@1:04

NO DRUNK DRIVING BEFORE 9 PM!

😂
I first thought this was starfield x gta6 mashup
\*slow clap\*
wow that first scene looked oddly realistic for gta 5
Now with GTA SA
“We have gta6 at home”
Okay, but if you showed this to someone 12 years ago, they’d lose their shit from the hype.
It's honestly ridiculous how this subreddit bans all links. This is some crazy effort put into this video, only for someone to have to download and reupload to share it here. The guy deserves the views on his YouTube video.
Trust?

![gif](giphy|GaH2cVp9k9RPKOclLf|downsized)

Trust.
gameplay in trailer vs gameplay after release
Wow talk about A1 content 👏🏾
Get this man a job
Trust.
The best one i have seen so far
Gta 6 if R* really didnt gace a shit about us
Rockstar doesn’t disappoint. But this reminded me of how developers these days produce game trailers then that’s what the actual game usually looks like
This is amazing!!
Smart move not to copy the purple haired, face tattoo guy or he probably come after you too. 😂
This really shows how much better the graphics are.
Now, can someone sync this up side by side with the actual trailer so I can finally see the legit difference side by side?

I've got one upvote for payment...
Wow! This is so impressive.. i can't even begin to imagine how long this must have taken to create. One thing that made me laugh out loud though was Lucias lip movement when she says "trust".
Gta5 was such a huge upgrade from the brown and dreary gta4.
We have Gta6 at home. Gta 6 at home:
This is awesome ! 👌🏻
Looks ass
That's kinda fxckin sick
Cant get over Franklins blue hair lol
aw man not the franklin wit xxxtentacion hair ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
GTA Vi made GTA v looks like GTA III tbh
So you're telling me that Rockstar scrapped 8 DLCs for one huge DLC?
GTA6 for Xbox one and ps4🤣
NOT AGAIN
awesome
Is this pc, 360/ps3, or series x/ps5? They look dated, and especially jarring when comparing to the VI trailer lol
Man… seeing this video just shows how old of a game GTA 5 is. Glad I stopped playing it 2 years ago
Na this is actually 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Final convenience store shot is actually gold though
Damn this is shot so well! The twerking on the car shot had me dying lmfao
This is really terribly done.
That requires some SERIOUS hard work! Thanks.❤
Dang GTAV look like a 20 years old game compared to 6.
Damn, man, why take away views from Ravenwest like that?
They should’ve called it GTA V and a half
I’ve been saying, ever since the GTA 6 trailer release it’s veeeeery easy to tell GTA 5 was released in 2013.
THERE ARE NO COUGARS IN SHOPS
Maaan does GTA V really look that bad?
Great effort man!
GTA6-1
Imagine if this was the actual trailer for 6
Wonderful trailer man, very fun and entertaining to watch. Now that we are way in the future, we can see the huge contrast between old generation and new. Hype for GTA6 as always.
Production is incredible but the lighting here looks off for some reason, like the settings are turned down or something
Not that much graphic difference as people are saying though.

There IS difference and improvement. Just not that much. It's more than 10 years, I was expecting much more. I can only hope they focused more on other things, like physics.
This would be so funny if they actually did this as a joke imagine the dislikes 💀
The title of this on YouTube made me laugh when I saw it “… FAITHFULLY RECREATED” homie was so mad at all the bs versions he made this in response
Backyard Bootleg looking ass GTA 6
Can you now do a side by side comparison of the actual trailer and this?
Looking at this, 6 make 5 look like it was made 20 years ago 😭
😂😂😂😂😂
GTA 5 2: Releasing August 23rd 2043
Holy shit this makes V look like a joke.
Can someone put these on top of each other so I can watch them at the same time?
Man when you put this side by side with gta 6 it really reminds you that that game originally came out on the 360 and ps3
Wow this actually looks like shit
Was this filmed on a ps3?
if apple owned the GTA franchise:
That was awesome
...but it's expanded and enhanced definitively
Damnit son!!!! Now you owe the Florida Joker 5 million pesos
Link to the actual video so the creator gets something out of his work being shared here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KvQrW76CjQ
The only thing that is a misrepresentation of Gtav is that the character models for players are not as good as the main characters of the game and for gta 6 it will likely be the same. That’s not something that can be done to make a trailer though so they did an awesome job. It makes me even more excited for the next game
Shows just how much further we've come
This is what they should of done that would of been an awesome story!!!
Gta W
"Expanded and enhanced the last time we swear."
🤣🤣🤣
It just makes you realize how far we’ve come in over 10 years
florida joker gonna come looking to get paid for this now too lmao
The difference in graphics is literally night & day! But the graphics for GTA 5 on PS3 & into PS4 were amazing for that time period!
*perfect amount of time
 This is dope as hell
Very well made
How did they make this within gta 5?
GTA trailer but its GTA 5 :0
Okay this makes me appreciate the GTA 6 trailer so much more.
I love it, well done
Is that Franklin with the dreads?
Wow!
This was awesoem
Makes me realize how advanced 6 actually is
This is so perfect 👏
It's pretty wild to see how much better 6 looks then 5. This is pretty eye opening after not playing 5 for the past year.
This is probably close to what it'll actually look like honestly, zero chance any of what was in that trailer was gameplay, maybe cutscenes, but no way gameplay
Why did I move here? Bad luck I guess.
Best remix
THERE ARE NO COUGARS IN MISSIONS!
4/5 cos showed Jason as right handed in the stick up scene
That juggalo was the icing
This is the best thing since Boobs.
We have GTA 6 at home :
Really well done but the audio is so off
Amazinggg!!
This shit looks better than the original fuk gta6
The car twerk is my new motto in life "Don't worry about other people opinion and just do whatever you want"
Wow, this is actually really quite good.
Absolutely fucking based
Thrust
where the fuck are the lyrics
Good job 🙌🏾 but this definitely made the official trailer look like pure gold😅 I think we were all speculating that it was gonna look like this
Nice work fam.
Jesus christ this must have taken forever. good job
I have to say, the donk scene actually looks surprisingly good here.
Why does it look better lol
How did you do this, this is so well done!
This really drives home what a massive leap we’re about to take…
Amazing
Wade replacing the Florida joker was brilliant and hilarious.
This looks like no pixel
Not Bad?
I wonder what Wade inspired social media influencer will threaten to sure Rock* after seeing this?
[removed]
Joker need his 5 mil…
I love this movie
Oh my god, it's really obvious now to me that GTA 5 graphics look old
I meannnn…. Id play it😅🔥🔥
This really puts into perspective how much better GTA6 is going tonlook
WOW
I seen this on YouTube 😂 can’t wait for the game to come out. The actual trailer is amazing
wow this really shows how bad gta 5 looks compared to gta 6
Michael finally got a new boat and filled it with chicks.
“Last time we swear” 😂😂💀
"GTA 6 trailer but I was on crack while making it"
That was pretty amazing! Best one I've seen so far
😑tf
I knew sumn was off
Pov : Gta 6 gameplay
GTA VI but for ps3 version
That is not rage 9😂
Could you imagine the troll rockstar would be?
This is legit crazy. Great job.
Beginning should have been " I guess it was the witness protection"
[deleted]
GTA 
Yeah it's really sad how they're hounding the actor like that, just let her live, game isn't even close to being out.
Same…
Where were people doing this? I only saw people trying to figure out who is the actress. Which is perfectly fine.
123-45-6789
Ngl, I think this Lucia looks better
[deleted]
I was hoping for in-depth trailer analysis, but all we get is memes
I'm surprised of the resourcefulness of these motherfuckers on here....using their powers for evil instead of some good
We don’t even know who the actress is tho?
Yeah, the textures look so flat in comparison.
Also twerking dynamics
It’s crazy how bad GTA V looks as a result now. GTA V now looks like how IV looked when V was coming out. Like the realism is there but the game looks a little cartoony in comparison. 

Some wizardry with their developers.
Do we actually know it will have ray tracing?
Still somewhat doubtful the graphics look like the trailer at launch since they'll need to get it running on series s, but we might be getting close to running it at 30 fps on 7090TI when the pc version comes out. I'll just wait for Ultra Mega Anniversary Collectors Game of the Year Edition to be on sale for 15$ anyways.
It's so crazy how your mind perceives shit. I remember the first time I saw the GTA5 trailer and, at the time, I thought the graphics were fucking incredible. Now it looks like shit in comparison. I mean fuck I remember seeing oblivion the first time it came out and thinking the graphics were breathtaking
And it has been two hardware generations in between...it is not quite as rough as seen here on PS4 and PC
Yeah.. someone should do video with both trailers side by side
GTA v look so old now
Grand Theft Auto V: The Search for More Money
use float numbers atp :((((
gta v.v
She's shaking that spine real nice

Of course you do
It's Friday, Friday!
The GTA we have at home.
*Grand Theft Auto VI Gaiden: Only for Nintendo Switch*
refugee raft\*
I know... I've seen others of these and I gotta say seems like they pumped the graphics and lighting for this one.
Simple Native Trainer, Extended Video Export, Menyoo, Open IV and Natural Vision Evolved
It looks janky as hell.
Does it though?
It looks good for 10 years old but so far gta 6 makes 5 look so old
So good I can barely run it on my 2013 PC.
Always kosher to thank Yaweh
MILLIONS TO ONE
Not bad just seriously outdated
If they didn't ten years ago, or even one when the Online update came out, they won't now.
Because rule #4 says no links to others social media platforms, which is kinda stupid tbh.
Graphics and storyline may be good, but gameplay and level design is the biggest concern with GTA VI.
Well you can't remake GTAVI trailer in GTAVII innit?
Read the title
No way you watched the video and commented this
Rockstar takes pride in real time trailers but yes I do believe people will need a really high end graphics card to run the game as shown in the trailer
This makes no sense, so you think that GTA 6 will look worse than RDR2?

It's 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
no the new question quote is "Do you know why you're here?" lol
And that you have to find by watching it.
I'm out of the loop. What's going on with the actor?
Social engineering. When something is free you are the product. Social media and p•rn sites are free and sell your data. Good times create weak men.
What?
that overhead scene with the bikers looks like it's straight outta Saints Row 2 💀
looks like gta online on 360 : P
It’s almost like 5 came out two console generations ago.
And character models ingta 6 are already outdated. No skin surface details , pores,skin hair up close.
*advanced* twerking, at that. The future is now.
in the green truck scene, the side mirror reflects the car, which can only be done through ray tracing. and if im not mistaken, ~~ray teacing was present in rdr2 so it would be weird for it not to be there in gta6~~
GTA 6 will definitely have Ray tracing
Search GTA 6 ray tracing digital foundry on YouTube.
Come back in 10 years and let us know how you like it.
They won’t downgrade all versions because of series S, they’ll just neuter that version. Besides, GTA is about the only game where Rockstar could say “We will release on Series X only” and xbox would have to comply or risk losing a major fraction of their user base.
While I think the graphics look great. There was nothing shown in the trailer that looked like it wouldn't be able to run at 30 fps on current consoles.
If anything, it'll look better than it does now when it comes out. That's what happened with the GTA V first trailer as well as Red Dead Redemption 2.
they’ll probably remove ray tracing and downgrade graphics/frame rate for the release as it’s noticeably the older one. they wouldn’t make you wait 12 years and then not use all of the capabilities of the newest machines
> I thought the graphics were fucking incredible

Because they were
Yeah. As graphics and technology moves on, it spoils the older stuff for you and exposes how "bad" it really looks. I remember I watched the first Toy Story a couple of years ago for the first time in ages. Some of the animation in that looks really clunky and shows its age a bit, because my brain compares it to modern standards (despite it being cutting edge back in 1995).
Man I thought that NFS undercover looked real, and then after that Gran Turismo 5 was top and couldn't be beaten 💀
To be fair the GTA V trailer does look better than this because it was professionally made
I remember I used to play TBOGT all the time and thought it looked great. 

GTA v came out on PS3 - I played it for weeks then went back to TBOGT and realised it looked crap in comparison lol 

And that was on the same bloody console
Tbh the difference between 4 and 5 (both PS3) feels miles bigger than GTA6 vs GTA5 (2 gens apart).

That said, I also don’t care about graphics if the game is fun and loading screens are significantly reduced.
Why do you think they made this trailer in the ps3 version?
Here you go: https://www.youtubemultiplier.com/658d9923406af-gta-trailer-vi-in-v-side-by-side.php
YES
Should we comb the dessert?
Yeah especially the lighting
Which one let's them script cutscenes?
what?
I wish I understood any of that lol
For being 10 years old with some shiny new tape ever so often, yes
Yea it looks janky.
It was a joke...
Ahh okay. OP actually did his best.
[deleted]
It'll be around rdr2
Downvote all you want just don't be surprised when the game doesn't look like the trailer
I know. I was blending the two…
The usual when a semi attractive woman game model is hunted down by horny boys
Oh please. 

You have no idea what social engineering truly is and what are its different uses in Cybersecurity scenarios and it shows.

That's not what's going on at all with the voice actress so keep your hillbilly wisdom for yourself and let us finish the year without having to read such low level bs.
Do you know how stupid you sound right now?
Holy fuck buddy how man Instagram reels you watch in a day to end such a sentence in that
Bruh literally has no idea what he is saying or he wouldn’t have posted this.

People are saying “Hey! Maybe don’t harass women just because they might be in your favorite video game” 

and this dude is talking about “gOoD tiMeS cReAtE WEAK mEn” 🥴

Seriously what the fuck is wrong with people? There’s gotta be some bullshit in the water because there’s no way people are just born like this.

Beta male low testosterone take

“ It is well known that a good amount of exercise can help the libido but can an active libido help exercise? According to research on primates at Emory University, when male monkeys so much as see sexually active females, they can register a testosterone increase of up to 400 per cent.

Much like our primate cousins, researchers from Rutgers University in Germany have suggested that when male humans view adult movies, their dopamine levels increase, associated with a spike in testosterone levels. The study offers good news for all the single guys out there as researchers suggest that you do not need a real-life partner to benefit from increased testosterone, simply having an erection is all you need to spur production. In another study from 1990, Scottish scientists studied the endocrine responses to erotic stimulation. Interestingly, the study showed a non-significant rise in testosterone due to the x-rated images, however it did show a significant rise in cortisolin those who watched the neutral (non-pornographic) film, and a noticeable reduction in the levels of those who viewed the adult material. Cortisol of course, is many bodybuilders’ worst enemy due to its catabolic effects when high levels are present. This change in cortisol levels may be due to reduced prolactin and thus, high dopamine levels. In perhaps the most promising study to date, a more recent investigation by Cook and Crewther examined the effects that different videos induced on participants’ 3 Rep Max squat performance. Participants were shown short clips of motivational, sad, training, humorous as well as erotic videos before performing their 3RM squat lift. The erotic, training and aggressive videos resulted in a significant improvement in the squat performance compared to the neutral control videos.”

Hell, the bridge scene feels like it's right out of ***San Andreas.*** Anyone tell you that *VI* upgrades nothing from *V*? Show them this, and document the response.
Im pretty sure rdr2 didn't have Ray tracing lol
>  the side mirror reflects the car, which can only be done through ray tracing

Yeah, to elaborate on this. My understanding is that this can NOT be done with screen space effects. 

For context, most reflections in games are screen space reflections. This means that they use the image already rendered onto the screen outside of the reflection and flip it for the reflection. It is why in many games, if you're looking at the water or a puddle, and you slowly pan the camera down, as you cut off the stuff that is being reflected, the reflection starts disappearing. If there is nothing on screen to reflect, no reflection occurs.

With the car mirror, we know it can't be using screen space reflections because what it is reflecting is not visible anywhere on screen. The question for me is... does that only leave ray traced reflections, or is it possible they are using some other trick?

Probably ray tracing.
I feel like such like improvements in graphics have slowly started to plateau though we’re not at the peak I don’t see any significant improvements for a while.
I don't think they did, but they must have aimed for a similar look
Y'know, the other nice thing that does is show just how damn good OP's recreation is, too. :)
Gta6 looks like absolute shit compared to gta7, we just don't realize it yet. Clunky outdated and fake in the future.
We ain't found shit
Presumably similar techniques as how all the RP musicians make music videos and how the mod developers make trailers.  

Filming machinima style in private servers with admin tools for cinematic cameras, control over weather and lighting, dev tools to place assets like characters, emotes and other forms of character animation to bring the assets to life.
It would take like 5 minutes of research to learn what each of those is
Not a very good one
You don't know that
It’s crazy how much a person’s libido determines whether they’re hard working or not
Semi attractive in this context is insane manni is gorgeous I honestly expected ALOT more of a reaction but thats prolly cuz shes not white n we all know how video gamers are (racist)
Ok. So, what's the usual in this case?
*Tlou2 Flashbacks*
I wasn't expecting a living fossil to have such a modern take.
You haven’t heard the quote?
Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times. 

Cultures go in cycles. Hard times make men with character. The children of those men don’t have to work as hard. Slowly things get so good with technology that men no longer need to work as hard hence their muscles and mind begin to atrophy. It’s happening right now. Men are even forgetting how to court women because of tinder and porn.
Instagram is dumb. Reddit it the last social media site I still browse. It’s getting old and becoming fb.
Oh there is. Many microplastics and hints of pharmaceuticals also dinosaur piss.
I know. It’s weird how ppl care bout that. Like not even bout their own but actually care bout other ppls downvotes. 🤭
Wow you the plane flew over even the scientists here. Men don’t just watch porn to get elevated levels of testosterone. 🤦‍♂️ They bust at the end which lowers their libido and urge to seek out actual women. This is why ppl are downvoting. They don’t want to admit their weak. Porn addiction is no joke. It’s funny till you try to stop.
GTA 5 on PS5/XSX has it, which means R* is open to using the tech
yeah, you're right.
sorry
There's another way to render a mirror and it's used in Hitman 2 and 3. Super power-hungry, it just renders another lower resolution camera angle on the mirror instead of raytracing.
> The question for me is... does that only leave ray traced reflections, or is it possible they are using some other trick?

Well, it's a AAA game coming out in 26, it should most assuredly have ray tracing. 

But there are tons of tricks that can be used to achieve this effect.
Reflections ≠ mirrors. Traditionally mirrors have been made by rendering them separately but it works only for perfectly flat surfaces (correctly).
Can confirm in a steak chef
Semi-attractive meaning dudes were rightfully expecting Rockstar to come through with an exceptional Latina dime (think Alba, Vergara, Hayek in their primes) and they instead give us a common Latina nickel (Michelle Rodriguez present day). 

**Lucia isn't anywhere near hot enough to be on any previous GTA games map fold-out.**
💀
We’ve heard the quote. You still sound stupid as shit
![gif](giphy|UU1bHu6QWyFxZM63Jh)
My brother in christ, youre the soft man, fyi, youre trying so desperately to make yourself a victim because of rockstars creative direction, something that actually has 0 impact on you, and as a consumer you dont even need to play or purchase their products either lol please keep taking your anti psychotic meds.
just because someone said something doesn’t mean its true, moron. besides, what the fuck does this have to do with the game
So *no*, you dunno how stupid you're sounding.
Shut up you fucking sap.
I'd cover up if I were you, your shit personality is showing :)
I’ve just never seen such a low number that’s all
Another beta male comment, if you wish to quit an addiction just stop surrounding yourself with so many temptations and replace the habit with the gym. If GTA6 is a trigger for you I suggest you quit posting in here and get your T levels boosted by not watching any thing with any females with clothes on. But actually , surrounding yourself with hot women has also been shown to raise T so maybe you’re just permanently stuck as a beta
Gta 6 at 20 fps baby
I don't forgive you
Yup and I think the same effect was used in Batman Arkham Asylum.

You can tell because the lower resolution is noticeably pixelated.
Yep, almost certainly. Just wanted to make a counterpoint to the "can *only* be done through raytracing" comment.
Right. 

I think what you're talking about is when the game just has a fully mirrored version of the room and character on the other side of the mirror.

But I don't think they are going to do that for GTA VI cars' rearview mirrors.

And now, I think with raytracing available, we are not going to see that fake mirror trick much anymore. 

There's not really a point to distinguishing between reflections and mirrors anymore. In Spider-Man, would you consider the skyscraper glass to be mirrors? They are perfectly flat and can certainly reflect a lot. They used screen space reflections and cube maps in SM PS4 but now they use raytraced reflections in SM 2.
The fact u think jessica alba is more attractive than manni is actually insane lmfao
I get it. It’s hard for someone balls deep into sports/games to see that the bread and circuses are distractions. Username checks out.
Not even a proper reply lol. Ad hominem much?
A victim of rockstars? lol I’m getting the game. There’s a thing called balance. I play video games on the weekends if I have time but mostly try and improve several areas of my life first. 

Got my dream job where i get to write, read, exercise, and play guitar while my CNC machine does all the work. A guy here at my job plays Xbox mobile, he even gots a portable internet router to connect too. That’s what I’m trying to point out here; there’s gotta be balance.
Oh shit I thought anything that’s on my phone is the absolute truth. Thanks.
The hell’s a sap?
But it’s warm where I’m at. GTA 6 warm.
Eh I’ve had bigger. I had an account where that was the sole purpose. Lots of ppl can’t see through the satire.
lol you still don’t see the satire? Keep em
Cominf
Yeah and I think some settings get dialed down in the mirror like shadows and reflections within the mirrored POV.
The fact you're debating about that, like poor guys...
**Jessica Alba in her prime is hotter than LUCIA.**

I'm not saying anything with regards to Manni as I haven't seen her.
Yet here you are, using Reddit, using a phone, watching brain numbing YouTube videos or Netflix shows.. yea. Lol.
You think you are an independent thinker but your entire screed is straight out of world’s biggest loser Alex Jones’s mouth. Fuck outta here
This is an irony onion. The central point of the character you're quoting was that weak men can sit around and idly toss moral judgements, because stronger men will protect them. This pretense was used to justify to his grandson why some enemies should be extrajudicially tortured and killed. This is from a dime-store action novel, found in the Power-Fantasy/Circuses section of your local library.
you're in a gta subreddit and set up custom flair
Even the funniest stand-up comedy show wouldn't be able to make me laugh as hard as I am while reading these comments. Actually, this gave me an idea. Why don't you go up the stage and start making some jokes? It wouldn't hurt, right? Cause we are all already laughing at you buddy 🤣🤣🤣
Lol what?
Go wash your fedora.

I hope people don’t hate you this much in real life, must be lonely living in your shoes.
You’re a nerd
What in the shit-fuck are you even blathering about, again it is turbo weird for you to be insisting so much on your own character in reference to your thoughts on video games, you understand everyone reading your comments just sees a person that is so insecure that they look for approval online talking about that soft-men shit like this even over inconsequential and completely unrelated stuff that doesnt impact their life, like a post about a fan made trailer for gta6 in gta5. Its funny you mention men being bad at courting because you give the impression of exactly that dude lol, enjoy the tates pep talks I guess and alienating yourself even further.

I was simply stating that a large portion of the playerbase is racially biased (not to mention gender biased) n this guy is yapping about how shes not pretty enough for previous titles. I was just defending my queen mannis beauty
Mostly use YouTube to learn guitar. And Netflix to see how they are successfully pacifying ppl.
Maybe it is maybe it isn’t. I’m yanking your chain. Keep it coming.
Take it easy on him, we were all 14 and convinced of our genius once upon a time. "Enlightened by my own intelligence" or however the quote goes

You think so?

Right. As if that translates into real life. Reminds me of what a comedian said:

Most dirty comics are amazing ppl of stage. It’s the super clean ones that shit on the dirty ones you gotta watch out for. 

That’s why I’m super filthy on Reddit.
Not if it’s spicy enough. Some can’t handle the heat.

So you pay a big company to see shows on how it's pacifying society? Buddy, that is singlehandedly the most idiotic thing I've read this week. You are literally part of the very thing you're criticizing 🤣 God damn if you're this stupid then I'm surprised you haven't swallowed your own tongue and choked yet
I like the fact you had to counter why you use the exact media he pointed out you use, I guess he got that right.
Ha imagine having to use YouTube to learn guitar. I taught myself when I was 16. You must be a very weak man.
In this moment, I am euphoric...

A MAGA sitcom - just what you needed. 
Apparently this is the product of someone called Janet Porter. Its subtlety and nuance is commendable. 

Edit: For those who want to dive fully into this cringe, here's the homepage. There are, believe it or not, clips worse than this https://whatsagirl.com/
Mom's dating a high school kid?

Oh wait. "In 2017, [Porter] served as a spokesperson for Roy Moore in his campaign for the United States Senate special election in Alabama." 

So, yeah. Mom's dating a high school kid.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Porter
Pornos have better production value, writing, and acting.
God can they get these dipshits mic’d up at least? Also you can’t add a laugh track whenever someone says literally anything…
I thought that was his mother-in-law. Perfect cringe, OP, well done considering it's political, not that I'm a Marxist or anything!
Why is the 70 year old woman darting that 30 something dude? 

Also, what is this, I need more of it in my life.
That is the least funny thing I have ever watched
Yikes. Dollar store Brad Pitt and all.
What the fuck did I just watch 😂
Couple of gripes here from a film editor. 

Audio 2/10 - what’s going on here?  Definitely didn’t use lav mics and it sounds like the boom was way too high. So much room in the audio.  Definitely needs some de reverb love and some compression. needs some EQ as well. 

Video 4/10 - color isn’t bad. Could use a little more balancing. The master shot is framed really strangely. So much head room. Bring that camera down a bit!  This makes sense as to why the boom audio is so spacey since it was framed out 2-3 feet above talent. Also, set design is pretty ugly. So much brown and that cross smack dab in the middle of the frame was definitely a choice. 

Editing 5/10 - decent timing here. I just wish there were some cuts to a close up or some reaction shots. A cut to her delivering the “watch what he’s done” line would help that hit harder. Also, give me a nice tight of the young man’s reactions. He being “schooled” politicly. Need to see those gears turning and emotion on his face. That’s no fault of the editor since it probably wasn’t captured. 

Solid 3.5/10  Would not watch again.
This has got “produced by Christian’s” all over it.
"She has a point"


No, she doesn't

Yeeeeah.....that's the point and exactly why I'm not voting for him 😂 Hey they're right! This show *is* funny as long as you view it as satire!
Let’s just forget the dialogue for a second. That guy is dating her in this world?
But like...the right to life is the right to choose isn't it? Free will and all that?
It's tough to take seriously because of the obvious lack of effort or production value.
Lmao is this on actual real TV? What's the show called?
To be fair, that guy is way out of her league anyway. That frumpy cow should be dating someone who looks like Ted Cruz.
There is no comedy in the Republican. You know what the least funny thing is? Fascism.
"They wanna take your guns!"

"Trump is for liberty!"
literally said he wants to be a fascist

"Trump is for Israel!"
ah yes the country torturing and murdering thousands of innocent women and children a week

Definition of cringe. I had to turn the volume down and change the browsing tab because I couldn't watch it, but even after about 20 seconds, I had stop the audio because I couldn't make it through it.

Can somebody  add an outrageous laugh track?
‘Marxists’. A line written by someone who hasn’t the first clue what Marxism is.
Great Value Wendy McLendon-Covey
Just people arguing with themselves
I suddenly imagined myself in some OAN/Newsmax dominated dystopian future where this was the only thing on television. This feels like a soviet normalization era comedy
“What good is the best education or free healthcare if your dead?”

Me, fully alive in America in 2024, never having any of those things: 🤨
What makes this even funnier is they harp on how Pro-life he is and he just pissed off that block with his waffling in the Florida amendment.
Never would have expected that the Nazis would be so pro-Israel
Was this recorded off a tv?
I love how even in this show the person they’re arguing with just nopes out of there
The fact time and money was spent on this is WILD. This is worse than student project level quality.
This seems like a Tim and Eric show
Even in their own sitcoms, they can’t make friends.
Dating? I thought she was his mother.
Last Man Standing may as well be a Maga sitcom

"I'm sure you're all wondering how I got to this point in my life"
I thought he was talking with his parents
This is just blatant propaganda
Nobody:…. 
Right Wing Conservatives: I love Trump and hate the left.
I went to the website and the episode titles are great. 

Each episode is in the of "What's a girl to do..." With the statement being completed by, what I'm assuming is, the basis of that episode's plot. 

Episode 1: What's a Girl to do With her Ex-Boyfriend's Shirt 

Ok, normal sitcom


Episode 2:" " When Faced With her Ex and his Beautiful Girlfriend

Again, normal premise

Episode 3: "What's a guy to do when he's over his head"
Episode 4: What's a girl to do when her boyfriend cheats in her
Episode 5: what's a girl to do when meeting his parents
Episode 6: What's a Girl to do When Freedom is Under Attack

And now it gets weird

7 "what's a girl to do when her boyfriend doesn't want to make America great
8 "what's a girl to do when attending an 'anti-Christmas' party"


So it seems (judging solely on the titles) the first half is somewhat grounded before completely going off the rails in the end
This is the best find I have seen on this subreddit in months.

  
The levels of delusion are off the charts. Even more so than your average MAGA. Bravo OP.

Like, if they are trying to normalise their viewpoints and bring new people in, they should be telling non-political stories with likeable people. But instead it's so preachy and such obvious political propaganda any reasonable person would be turned off completely.
That woman’s stomach rolls are as large as her tits. She wants to talk about political awareness, where’s her litter?!

Holy shit I tapped out fast
I wonder how much of this was funded by GoFundMe and similar platforms lol
Someone created this to troll MAGA
She's not even acting to seem like a real person lmao. She sounds like the lady who spoke after the state of the union.
At least some people are getting work?
Did they use the camera MIC ? It’s all around very embarrassing , I’ve seen better produced YouTube prank channel
sitcom? It's more of a sit. The parts where they play the laugh track aren't even jokes by any objective standard that I'm aware of. There's no irony, wordplay, or sarcasm even detectable. Like, I'm not saying they are bad jokes; They're literally not jokes. lol
Oh, I thought that was his mother, but if it's also his date then it makes more sense.
That looks like a parody of a "right-wing" sitcom.
Lol this is not a situational comedy, it's just...
Situation.
Holy shit this is bad hahaha.
Ewwwww two of my least favorite things shoved together - this is hell
Dipshit community theater couldn't even afford $50 for some wireless mics, and oh boy, that "acting."

Yes, judge him on his actions. If MAGA did that he wouldnt get a single vote.
Is this a comedy?
Sitcom stands for situation comedy. This is just a sit.
This is horrifying because there are a fuck ton of people that don’t find this cringe.
Do… how… why… 

They talk about abortion as if the opposing side is genuinely trying to abort every baby…

It’s propaganda disguised as comedy. All of these right wing shows and movies end up just being a way for them to stage conversations with people who present straw man arguments.

I hate it so much
Must not see TV. Can’t believe they couldn’t get Roseanne for this.
I’m convinced now. Conservatives don’t understand jokes.

They seem to think ranting over a laughing track is the same as a joke.
Sitcom stands for "situation comedy". So, will there be any comedy or is it just a "sit"?
Fantastic find! I went to the website and watched the preview of Episode One. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse, they add in someone flossing: https://youtu.be/XLJsKx5_HQE?si=9fuZFcBjKSwuT3EH
They just trying to be rebah. We need more shows like that: good writing and good arguments against everything. Not a one sided show. I’m tired of those from the left and we have a lot of them
Charlie needs to review this on the moist meter.
Obviously this isn’t an actual sitcom.
The scene from Billy Madison comes to mind after having watched that.

You know the one.
Im not American, but I don’t really like trump… that being said, except the last scene I found the guy in the coach with a flag being hilarious
That guy doesn't even look high school aged for Hollywood. It still looks like a 30 yr old and a 50 yr old.

Even the background laughers had a tough time laughing. They have one job!
Oh hai, Mark
And sound..
It legit has the same issues as a David DeCoteau movie.
Nice copy/paste of a youtube comment dog.
The laugh track was the best part. Not even the canned laughs thought it was that funny.
For real, tho.  I can't get a good cringe going because I can't HEAR what the fuck they're saying.

Get your shit together, MAGA.  God damn.
Actually you can, take the Big Bang theory for instance…
Have you ever seen those videos that just show sitcoms with the laugh track removed? So awkward! Long ass pauses of silence like every 5 seconds!
It’s the same deal with that New Norm show on Twitter. Every second word has a laugh track. It’s even weirder since it’s animated and not a live studio audience
They don’t actually understand what’s funny, so they take the surface elements they can perceive and think “I’m doing comedy”. Same vibe as a right wing “comedian” who just yells out his talking points and pulls funny faces to let the crowd know when to laugh.
Well to be fair, ya can though.. that’s literally what every sitcom has done launch track inception.
Seriously, what the fuck was the relationship between all three? The guy in the chair looked younger than grandma trying to date the even younger looking guy...what?
Wait now I’m really confused. That’s the woman he’s pursuing!?
I think the dad was saying that to his gay son. Because they’re trying to be all “see maga doesn’t care that yr gay black or whatever flaw you may have, maga is accepting”
It's just such a catastrophic mess, I want more!
Not sure why but “darting” works well in your comment
I laughed out loud when she said "to stay out of politics is to let the marxists control your life"
It depends. I thought it was satirical, and if so, not very good or funny. 

But now I am thinking this is a serious show from a right wingers point of view. If so, the level of delusion is certain humorous.

(with apologies to Martha Plimpton)
Just finished a book about firsthand accounts of life in North Korea, and this shit is pretty much the only thing they can watch aside from “news” that fellates Kim Jong Un and How it’s Made style propaganda to try to fool them that their output and economic system is working
I love that part.

They think there need to be Jews in Israel for the prophecies in the Book of Revelations to come true and for Jesus to return. I think at that point all the remaining Jews would have to convert to Christianity before zombie Jesus eats their brains. Or something like that.
They aren’t. They’re just pro-genocide
I thought that was his Mom :-/.

She looks way older than 50.
Christ Routhe? The steakhouse guy?
No it’s Rusty Joiner. He’s 51.
I thought it was his mom.
I guess the casting pool is quite small when you have to be a certified brain amputee to take part
The old lady produced this, she casted a person that in her mind was of equal hotness, hilarious.
I was thinking the same thing, at least cast people who look believable as a couple 😂
But how are people going to find out "the marxists are controlling their lives"! /S

Lmao perfect example
BBT was filmed in front of an audience though I thought?
"zimbabwe"

*ROARING AUDIENCE LAUGHTER AND SHRIEKING*
and Friends
That’s what it takes to get to 23 minutes
They are filmed in front of an audience.  Those videos are funny but it's not like they'd be better off powering through the scene while the audience is making too much noise.
Typically, humor works when you catch someone off guard with what you are going to do or say. Conservatives just repeat the same talking points and liberal stereotypes over, and over, and over, and, over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over. 

So when I say "and over" for the 20th time, it's not really funny anymore (pergaps it never was), but if you know that I'm making an attempt at humor and you are on my team, you'll laugh because you know it's expected of you if you are on "my team." That's conservative comedy in a nut shell.
Usually they accompany jokes
From what I could gather, the older guy is the husband, and the younger guy is the boyfriend.  I assume it’s a common dynamic within conservative households.
I think there's a daughter not shown in this scene and they're her parents and he's the bf
I think the Trumpets are quizzing the guy trying to date their daughter who isn't in the scene.  But who knows.
I would rather watch whatever darting might be than this.
lol fucking thumbs man. Fucking thumbs.
It’s not even fucking Marxist! It’s a fucking buzzword that republicans use to describe anything they don’t like now they might as well just say boogeymen. Trump and his cult have tried to push America back into the past so much that we are reliving the Joe McCarthy “Red Scare” days of the 1950s.
It’s serious. Which makes 1000% more awful and unfunny.
The Canned laughter makes it worse.
The level of delusion was humorous at first. Now it's just painful

I work with these types and that's pretty accurate for their opinion towards his ego. "you'd be bragging too if you accomplished a fraction of what he has"
Except in this case because nothing was funny.
I work with a lot of them. I think they'd somehow enjoy this.
I know right, "i dont like how he's a rapist pedophile criminal grifter etc etc etc" is just a lot to deal with.

If you watch the other episodes, they all consist of men much younger than her fawning over her. She's in her 60s and wrote this role as if she was in her 30s.
LMAO!

You just happened to write it the exact same way as a YouTube comment, punctuation and all?
Like an episode of That's My Bush!
Thank you for that that's funnier than the show
BA HAH HA HA HA HA HA
After looking it up it turns out while it was filmed in front of a studio audience, a laugh track was added in post production
And he’s a grannyfucker
She also meets her ex-boyfriend. It's basically a porno without the fucking, but with political propaganda.
No, it’s actually the young guy dating the woman. The guy in the chair is the neighbour (who has a crush on the woman). I know this because I watched the other clips (see the edit in the op) and now I hate life and myself.
"Dating with throwing darts" or "Dating with a Dodge Dart"
That’s why they want to nuke the Department of Education. Keep us dumb and you can feed us whatever lies you need us to believe with a lot less friction.

"When you're a star, they let you do it!"
A show like this is gonna get a bunch of reviews from people who care more about "Finally, a conservative comedy!" than the actual content, and it's not popular enough to be balanced out by the larger mass of reviewers.
It must mean it's reaaallly good
lol imagine being a part of this show and excitedly telling your friends and family to watch and leave good reviews online, and even they can’t even bring themselves to rate it 10/10
Based on a grand total of 15 people who rated it. Literally. 

I imagine there were more than 15 people involved in this show's production, and after the producer encouraged them all to leave a review, 12 of those people gave it 10 stars, and two of them who were only working there because it was their first gig out of film school left it a 1 star review. The final review for 2 stars was left by the producer's mom who was trying to be generous but not burn-in-Hell liar generous.

Hey man if it works for you it works.
I don't believe for a second that man would date that woman. 
That's actually Rusty Joiner from Georgia/Alabama.  His cousin grew up in our neighborhood and he would come around when I was like 16 years old.  He was like 25 and had won the Structure model of the Year. And then he was cast in Dodgeball (BLADE) on the villains team Globo Gym Purple Cobras.  He was a local celebrity around Montgomery back in the day. This was like 20 years ago.
No no, it is.
You mean correct punctuation that any moderately educated person would know how to use? Sorry you can’t relate.
Not a high bar.
Because the audience was asleep
That's kind of an admission on their part that they knew it wasn't funny lol
He’s 51, she just looks awful for her age
Thank you for your service
That makes it so much worse.  Christ.  Thanks for the info though.
He’s not even that young, he’s 51. He just looks great for his age. She’s insane for casting him as her boyfriend like it’s at all believable
I don't know.

Any guesses about GTA VI?
I think could be 95-110km2
It’s still so hard to believe that San Andreas is more than twice the size of Liberty City. GTA IV felt WAY bigger than it really is.
How much was rdr2’s map?
Rather than just going bigger, I'd like to see it be more dense and interactive. Maybe have some parts that are more wild then some really built up city parts with building interiors
Let’s be honest about 5’s map though, only 30-40km of its map even has anything going on in it. Most of the other 30km is just barren mountains with nothing on them. That’s why this map got old fast. GTA 6’s map is going to blow 5’s away.
Tree fiddy
120km plus you can visit 60% of buildings
Maybe 200km²
180km²
We know from the coordinates from last year's leaks that the map is roughly 2-2.5× larger than gta 5
7 km
250km
Density is the key.
240
After more than 2 decades, we will finally have a map (km²) in 3 digits.
Doesnt really matter. San Andreas map while half as big as GTA 5’s map is the better map because there‘s so lot to do. The GTA 5 map had way too much empty space.  
  
Also Liberty City of GTA 4 felt so real for it’s time and although I also missed a countryside in GTA 4 I still loved the map.  
  
So the map of GTA 6 can be bigger, smaller or as big as GTA 5‘s map. The most important thing is that it is not just empty space for the sake of a bigger map.
420.69 km2
I need one with the urban areas of each one
I’m gonna go with around 150 km squared. Let’s say it’s double the size of 5
I would say 127 Km²

I really want that size but I really want is density of activities to do all over the place.
Gta 5 was pretty huge especially knowing that it came out on 7th gen consoles.
It would be dope if they made a platform and then released different cities so the world kept getting bigger.
Gta 4 can't really have made the map smaller. Interesting.
Imagine what gta 7 will look like
GTA4 was a downgrade from San Andreas
How much of that 75 km^2 is mountains Lol
looks like it has roughly doubled each new game, so logic would say that if the pattern stays true, we would be looking around 140-150km2
420.69 square kilometers
Maybe I’m crazy but I would love for it to take an actual hour to drive from one end to the other
I think map size of GTA 6 will be 2.5x bigger than GTA 5. 

Especially since we know GTA 6 won't just cover 2-3 cities but "Leonida" is covering ALL of Florida so I expect see a map with cities all over Florida with the everglades somewhere in the middle with a bunch of MASSIVE sized lakes too.
For all my Americans that is

GTA V: 27.92 miles squared

GTA San Andreas: 14.75 miles squared

GTA IV: 6.23 miles squared

GTA Vice City: 3.52 miles squared

GTA III: 3.13 miles squared
not gonna lie, i still think at san andreas map is bigger than 5. i know i’m gonna be downvoted to hell but idc lmao i still don’t get it
100-120 km
139.74
u/Dansol_ please be more considerate when posting metric units. This is an American game, by an American company, set in America, and then you posted onto an American website. Please use miles next time. Thank you!
What's that in American?
7473837373828373738283km⁶⁷³⁸³
600,000 :D
Wow GTAIV is smaller then SA, goes to show ya
What if it’s smaller than GTA III?!?!
Half of gtaV map is fucking empty desert. Don’t know why they thought that was a good idea.
No idea, but it will definitely be measured in miles. Merica!
164 km
I don't care about the size, it just needs to be good. I had hoped they stuck to a GTA V size map and add more cities externally like an updated version of the GTA IV and V map
Too big. Too much area not enough activities
112
I think geography and density make a big difference. GTA V is 75km2, but most of it mountains and empty space. If I’m not mistaken, the actual Los Santos urbanized area is pretty similar in size to Liberty City in GTA 4. If GTA 6 makes more of that space urbanized and fills it up with things to do, even if they only expanded the map size to 100km2 or so, it could make a huge difference.
I'd be surprised if it isn't bigger but I wouldn't mind a similar sized map to GTA 5 if it means it's a higher quality world.

Looks like it'll probably end up being both though.
6296.72 sq.Km :) the same size as Miami-Dade County HOPEFULLY any less and I'm not playing
Don’t care about square mileage. Do care about population density.
420.69 obviously
We need some open space for those Super Cars. And kinda stoked to see a Cyber truck variant in there with that heavy steel. Lol
doesn't really matter how big it will be, if it's boring as fuck to explore, that will destroy immersion.

like loads of buildings you can't enter.

copy paste npcs.

not enough variety in vehicles.

garbage missions.

bad traffic ai.

and so on...
GTA didn’t exist until vice city. lV was boring, V was 75% useless landscapes. San Andreas was the only truly great GTA game. I hope 6 is amazing. It looks very promising.
Around 780 km2.  Going to be around 9-10x the size of GTA5
85 km^2
WHAT THE FUCK IS A KILOMETER 🦅
GTA 4 sucks
120-125 is my guess based on the current “confirmed” map.
Around 100 km
100-120km I say
I would take a small map with lots of detail than a map that's to big. Like gra vice city at the time didn't feel small but if it was like that but you could enter every building and had real depth
125KM
Miles please... It's in the US and we like dumb measurements that no one else uses okay?
Too fucking big to enjoy going from point a to point b so PLEASE ROCKSTAR we need something to avoid all those drives that are more than 4km
My guess it's going to be unfinished, broken and almost unplayable at launch.
Is that area size of SA true playable size? Never knew it was that much bigger than VC
If u take the increase of IV to V and take it to VI, it’ll be 356,36. Incredible, maybe it might be smaller but planes are going to be fun, just look at the trailer.

I hope the rides with side characters etc take such long and have great conversations in VI.
My estimation is that it'll be around 100-110+km. I talked about this a few years ago when discussing the size of South Florida which irl is around 6,137 mi² in response to people calling Vice City "small". Rockstar had more to work with than they've ever had. Most people have no idea. It's gonna be massive.
Well each sequel seems about double the size based on that trend I would say maybe 160 km2. 

Mind you this is likely wrong because map sizes would get way out of hand.
Well, some leaks were saying that the VI map would be double size of GTA V. So, Im expecting something in the range of 120-150km
150-160
150 is my dream

Like 100+ at the very least
It seems to roughly double, so two GTA v maps
6 inches and 4 centimeters
Yeah but 2/3 of GTA V is just empty land
It doesn't have to be bigger than Gta5's. Just look at RDR2's map, it's smaller than Gta5's but still feels WAAAY bigger, that's because RDR2's map is way more detailed. Gta5's map is almost completely empty. So I don't care if it's a bit smaller or if it's the same size until it's more detailed.
Im personally hoping for at least 90km of land mass and more of total explorable sea area with islands and such
I do want a big map but the amount of times I fell asleep behind the wheel when driving from the top of the map to the city was too many to count. 75km I think some parts will never actually be explored
According to mapping with coordinates from the leaks, we could potentially be seeing around 200 kilometers squared, or 80miles squared, so about 2.5x GTA V.
Add them all together, double it. That's the size I'm hoping for.
Hoping for at least triple what V was.
I thought we have already figured out based on the leaks and coordinates that the map is at least twice the size of 5, just based on what we know so far. We don't know how far north it goes and how big that could be. 

 The announcement for 5 tended to refer it to as Los Santos and not San Andreas but the announcement for 6 says "the state of Leonida". We already know there is at least ONE other large city besides VC, if not two as it is rumored there are two others. So the map in all likelihood is more akin to San Andreas in depicting a whole state rather than 5 in depicting just one metro and the surrounding region.

 I don't believe it will be just southern Florida, it will include the north and maybe even roll in part of Georgia/Alabama/South Carolina in that northern area even if it's meant to be within one state. Think how RDR2 depicted a zoomed out version of the southern West-Central portion of the U.S., even extending into the northern Rockies and Yosemite (Big Valley). 5's map depicted a zoomed out version of just SoCal and not the entire state like San Andreas yet it was twice the size of the San Andreas map. 

So considering all of this I think it's gonna be more than twice the size of 5's map. How much more is the question. But if just the part based on SoFlo is itself already twice the size of 5, once you include the Northern  part of the map it could be as much as 3 to 4 times bigger than 5. I know a lot of people will say that there is no way they will make it that big but we will see. 

So I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it will at least be around 250 square kilometers.
I’m hoping for about 150 but a lot more filled, like it’s cool to have some open spaces but when half the map is a mountain that is completely unused ….why even have it
200km2
GTA 3’s map is smaller than Vice City’s map? No way
Dang I thought VC was smaller then III
I think 6 will be 120-150 km
I believe that because of the leaks there is a pretty good estimate of the size of the map. It looks to be close to twice as big.
Wow the inflation over the years
At least three fiddy
my guess is going to be something like 130-140 as every game gott about double the size
I’d say 130-155km^2 based on TGG’s video on the matter.
If I’d have to guess would say about tree fiddy
It’s not the size of the map it’s how you use it
I’m going for double again so 150km squared
I wish gta 5’s map had a bigger Los Santos.
Bigger than 5 but smaller than 7 eventually.
Judging from multiple leaks it’s at the most 1.5x the size of gta 5 map. Which is 30 square miles. So I imagine at least 40 square miles. Disappointing for a game that spent 11 years in development with a billion dollar budget but rockstar has clearly had development issues and cut back on how ambitious they want the game to be compared to previous games.
164.8 km
I’m thinking around 120. GTA 5 was built on the ps3, we are 2 generations newer. I think they can manage around 50km more with more detailed interiors and better graphics with the newer technologies.
I hope it's a bit smaller in scale.  There's way too much useless space in GTA 5.  I'd rather the map be small and densely detailed than to have sprawling nothingness.
It seems genuinely quite large from the trailer and what some people have wild-guessed the map might look like. I would say 1.5x to double the size of GTA V's map.
That would probably be too big, i want a big map, maybe smaller than GTA V's map, but with no watered down details and events
22,000 km2
It will be 150 sq km
I’ll take 50km
I'm gonna say 120
Let's hope it's also full of activities, not just big :)
Map could be about 110 km
511 KM
How big is red dead 2
We are definitely hitting 100
San Andreas is the biggest no doubts
1.45 km²
150...it doubles
Can anyone put this into an excel spreadsheet with a trendline?
7.98 most likely
I'll probably say 100km2
160km
150 km.
160
I hope gta 6 cars count the mileage
190
At least 100km² but I'm thinking, 125km²
Hi, believe me or not, but I am a good friend of someone who‘s dad works at Rockstar Games. He told me that the size of the map is around 50-55 square miles (or 130 square km to 143 square km). Please upvote this so people can thank me and come back to it when it is released. Enjoy ;)
112.43km²
GTA 3 felt much bigger than Vice City. I wonder how much was just an empty beach though.
100km
22.22  km
Im hoping for at least 100km, 2 cities would be cool and i want a lot of country in between. I love the off road and long drives in V, and i want 2 cities that are decently far so i can fly between them(at least takes a minute or two to fly between major airports) or be able to put on a youtube video or some music and have a long drive across the map.
I hope they again let us do the demolition with RC Helicopter mission. People will rage like anything
Florida
Here me out: 
There is a pattern
~8 -> ~16 -> ~32 -> ~~64 
So its gonna be ~128 km^2
Ten Square Kilometers!


.


.



🦐
80
We know it'll be at a bare minimum 9.11km squared 🤪
I wouldn’t be surprised if it totals around 130+. Granted not all of it will be densely packed city areas, but it looks massive.
Gta 3 Liberty city is smaller than vice city yet feels much bigger...
I refuse to believe vice city and gta 3 had only about 9 km²... the maps felt so big when I was little.
Probably around 150 where half of it is everglades type area.
142km2
At least 150km²
No wonder San Andreas is so good.
idc how big it is maybe it will be around 150km but i want to be able to get into 90% of the buildings that’s way less boring than just a bigger map. Gta v map was big enough
314.69 km2
133km²
105.53 km
I don’t care about size as much as density. Obviously it’s impossible to make every building one you can walk in but it would be great if there are a large number of interiors you can enter. Something like that at roughly the same size as V would be incredible.
200km^2
76.34km²
Almost doubles every time. The f that’s the case it could be 150km2
At best 105.37km^2
Between 90 and 160 km^2
It doesn’t need to be any bigger, like 50-75% of GTA V map is mountains and desert. Not saying the new maps needs 0 desert, but if it’s set in a Florida-like environment, that probably means swamp instead. Take all that desert from V, turn half of it to swamps around the map, and use the rest for towns or cities. Maybe the map is 10% bigger, but I think density would be the key word over sheer size.
150
If IV’s map was the same size as San Andreas’ it would be regarded as the best GTA, twice the size just as dense would’ve added so much more gameplay.
SA feels so much bigger, might be the slower cars
Fuck the metric system
It should be massive, i really hope the drive to Keys west from Miami takes 30 minutes at top speed, it will be very disappointing if i could be in Keys West in 10 minutes

If they have a 10 mile or however long the bridge is, dont make is 1 mile
GTA III to Vice City was 10.9% increase, I think it will be similar to this which would be 84.08 km^2
Can we get kilograms to mile?

I say double of v
in terms of land size probably the same as/a bit higher than 5 but people will lump in the area of the water between land masses to inflate the size of the map
"Bigger is better" is an alarming trend. Consider Starfield, for an extreme example.

Bigger is not always better. It's the content that matters.
Total guess, but over 100 km2
I'm guessing 167km²
Florida is big
I just want many/most/all buildings to be enterable.
It blows my mind that San Andreas is small in comparison, but had more areas…I really wish they had included San Fiero and Las Venturas in GTAV
It will be 120-150 square Km, with a lot of water in the middle.
I wanted to find an exponential function that fits these stats but I found a really good cubic that almost hits all the points

y = (x-1)^3 + 8.12

*Theoretically* it could be around 133.12 km^2 if it follows that trend but it’ll definitely tail off, the size of GTAV was a huge jump that probably wont happen again
I hope the map has large wilderness areas, not these 1 square mile national Parks you see in other games.
225km is my bet
81.24km^2
4km
no shit gta 5 is that big ? idk why but i feel sa being bigger than gta 5 it had liberty city,San fierro and San andreas on his map
km? C'mon.
I find it hard to believe that gta san andreas is smaller than gta 5’s map. The gta san andreas map felt huge.
somewhere around 60km quote me on this
I see a trend going on…





Double it and give it to the next person
420.69 KM
This picture just shows that size DOESN'T matter
at least 5
Where is red dead?
Does the map need to be larger or should every house be enterable over time?
Part of me says it'd be fine if it was just the same size as 5 since it's freaking huge, but then I remember how long it's been since they released the last GTA and now there will be no mercy if it's under 150 lmao
Why just not make it the world and you can drive Google Maps Street View?
160km2
900km
Everywhere between 150 and 200
Better be double
236.8km
I hate Chilliad which are toooo fucking tall and traveling take way too long around them.
114 Km2
225 km2   
this is from the leak
I agree with you about a hundred or so
120-150 km2
200km
Like 120 km2
kinda off topic but the game just cause had some huge maps as well, i wonder how they compare
We aren’t ready for the map
150
GTAV might have had a huge map but good lord most was crappy useless desert
rdr2 size?
rdr2 size?
200 km^2
around 167 sqkm


Also people screaming map density is solely important doesn't realise that there is a large number of gamers who just love to walk around the map ...i would welcome a bigger map ...
200
167.38km2
San Andreas tho💀
1 km
Well each new GTA it looks like it almost doubled so maybe this could get a little less than that or close
My guess would be that its bigger then GTA 3 ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)
24km
I can't wait
I wonder who calculates these.Ain't no way GTA III and Vice City are that big, you can download these maps into GTA V and their landmass is only few square kilometers with this game's measurement system.GTA IV's Liberty City too, it's landmass isn't anything over 10km².Entire Algonquin borough for example is slightly smaller than Central Park irl as it's not even 2 miles long from north to south.You can test it too, sprinting from north to south of the borough with Niko takes like 7 minutes imo.
140 to 150 km²
Since they’ve literally doubled it every single time they’re either gonna double it or keep it the same
I’m guessing 95-120km^2
My guess is 150km2
I’m saying about 100
Its because IV's map wasted absolutely no space, like 90% of it was comprised of tall buildings and skyscrapers, whereas San Andreas had massive, empty sections which the player was unlikely to ever visit, making IV's feel like an actual massive city
Same reason RDR2 feels bigger than GTA 5. Denser, more detailed world.
it is cuz it is dense af, compared to relatively empty map of gta san.
What I would give for a full remake with everything just as it was but with GTAV graphics.
GTA III also felt bigger than VC.
Fr, I am replaying IV with some texture mods and it kinda feels like a 2016-18 game. I remember playing it as a kid on a shitty laptop i had and the graphics didnt look as good with mods and max settings.
IMO it doesnt really, it looks big but whenever I drive around it it feels small. I get to my location in seconds or less than 3 minutes. In GTA 5 i know its gonna take me awhile when I have to drive halfway across the map to the desert or paleto bay
It's the scale. 

If you were to extract both game worlds into a physical space, characters from San Andreas and GTA3 would like four inches tall, by this rationale, characters from IV would be around 12 inches.

OG Vice City characters would be 6 inches tall.
Slightly smaller than GTAV iirc
Google says 127km^2
Honestly Red Dead Redemption 2 proved that Rockstar can nail empty swathes of wilderness. Florida is a really interesting place ecologically, so I am actually hoping for a lot of open landscapes
Was going to say the same. Have no problem if they even made it smaller, as long as it’s dense and the place feels alive.

Having said that, the map definitely looks bigger
This would be ideal, I would prefer it to be the same size as V if its more dense
A good amount of building interiors would definitely make the world feel double the size.
Ya I'm playing GTA 5 for the first time and somehow it feels so big yet so small...

Empty is a good word.
A countryside as dense as red dead 2, in that game you can find shit to see or do in every corner
Yeah, I would've thought the community at-large would be allergic to "look we made our map ten gillion miles big! That means our game is good!" claims at this point. So many games have stumbled with "wide as an ocean, deep as a pond" troubles.
I’m nervous about the lack of terrain. Florida is so damn flat I was excited to see a hill when I moved out. It’s the flattest state. I won’t mind if rockstar just makes up mountains for leonida, or if they have missions in Cuba or in South America or something to have some good rugged wilderness in the game.
30-40km is still 2-3 times the size of IV's map. The "filler" to sell the terrain is welcomed by me regardless, it's fun to explore and I wish the missions both on and offline took more advantages with placing set pieces in the middle of nowhere.
That’s the problem with the LA setting. The surrounding wilderness is just scrubland. Just complete nothing environment 

They tried to sneak in a tiny redwood forest in the north but honestly I was never impressed by it, it felt like a small thicket of purposefully placed trees needed for a feature/landmark, instead of a natural set of woods. It was cramped up against the road and mountain.
I hear this a lot, it was a compliment with VC as well because of the beach… I have to say that while I understand this I actually love having countryside. It’s far from empty in 5, in fact some of the more interesting things are out there in the mountains and countryside. It make the world more realistic and alive. Plus it’s fun flaying across the hills sides in a truck.
Very bold of you to assume GTA VI’s map will blow it away. We know very little of it so far, you’re just getting railed on the hype train. Saying the map “got old fast” to a game that has had as large a player base for over a decade on the same map is just peak hilarity. 

Fingers crossed that it will be an upgrade to GTA V in every way, but everyone speaking about it as if it’s a fact are the ones who will pre-order the game, hype it up for two fucking years, then wonder why Rockstar once again opted for live service over quality standalone content.

Edit: This probably came off way more personal than I meant it to, just a bit bewildered by all the people swearing loyalty to the game with hardly any info.
Stop. If these kids could read they’d be very upset
How do you know it's going to blow 5's away if game isn't even released yet?
Free tiddy
60% seems a bit high. Just imagine how long it would take to make all interiors
I don’t think there’s any point in entering most office and apartment buildings unless it’s for a mission. However all businesses should be enterable since the game will focus heavily on robberies.

Also keep in mind that only less than 2% of gta 5 buildings were enterable.
Yea i am hoping its 120 plus
as long as its 120+ and we have atleast 30% of all buildings as enterable, im happy. also hopefully my 2060 can handle ot when it comes out
Why are people obsessed with entering buildings? Genuine question. I’d rather the outside world be perfect than they waste time making the inside of a load of office blocks. By design it’s a car crime simulator.
60% of buildings? Why? Only a few percent of players will explore even about a half of it. It's a HUGE amount of work for devs. Or they'll just copy and paste all the interiors that won't be so interesting.
60% would be crazy 

GTA is a game that works better in open areas

I dont think it makes sense for them to focus so much on closed areas, i guess we will have around 15% of building to visit and twice the size of GTA V map
We already know it's at least 180km² based on the leaks but we don't know how much further north the map extends from what we saw in those. If it's the entire state  then what we saw could be half or less of the total map. It could end up being well over 300km².
i hope. i also wish for more indoor space.
But those leaks didn't show how far north it goes, we just know about the southern part of the map. With the announcement referring to "the state of Leonida" I would bet it extends farther north.
^ this

I’m guessing 200km^2 as R* go beyond for their what appears to be, magnum opus.
Ain’t no way we can fit like 9 liberty cities inside of the game damn

I know a lot of it will be wilderness but still
To this day, GTA V’s map still gives me the impression like it was designed to include San Fierro and Las Venturas as DLC map expansions later down the line. Even the story mode leaves more to be desired. But single player DLC just never came.. :(
It’s really not empty space once you realize all the different things they packed into it.
Ever since Cyberpunk, I’ve been collecting data on open world cities and maps and how they compare to Night City. To me, Night City felt properly big and dense like a city should, but missed the mark with not having gas stations and things like that.

So to answer your question, the city of Los Santos alone is 14.87 sq km, with the total land size being 48.15 sq km, and total playable area (which includes ocean and sea bed) is the 75.84 sq km mentioned.

Night City for reference is roughly 24 sq km in size, with the land mass being roughly 75.42 sq km, and the total playable area being roughly 106 sq km. I say roughly because nobody online seems to have gotten a solid number on that game’s map, and that’s as close as I’ve gotten in terms of what sounds right.

I can take a look at the 3D GTA’s and report back.
You're crazy
they make it seem so much bigger in km
3 cities and it's just a straight up better map which is probably why you think that
true, San Andreas map is the best there is. so much variety, so many different places, so much stuff to do. Gta 5s map cant conpare
now that’s ridiculous
Bro tryna Kill his Console 💀💀
I would hate that. I’m not looking to have to travel for one hour to go see my friend in online who is on the opposite end of the map
It's something only Americans won't understand... Inside joke...
250km
True. I think that’s also why GTA III feels bigger than Vice City. Denser with more roads and three islands.
I dont think big country sections are wasted tbh, they added to the feeling of escale
Lmao i remember playing San Andreas as a little kid and some older kid told me that you can find Bigfoot and if you take a picture of him, you will get something cool (don’t remember what). I remember spending what felt like an eternity looking for fucking Bigfoot
Wut. San Andreas used all of it's space so well. In the  countryside above the starter city was where truth lived, in the desert you had that army base and the big airport, and the place where you find those rockers. And then you have three distinct cities!

I think the map to San Andreas was ingenious in that it seemed like the map seemed bigger than it was, and also because the plot pushed you around the map as you were exiled from your home. Each place in San Andreas was part of the story.
The space in San Andreas only existed to justify multiple cities.
Flashback to staying up all night in 2005 just fucking driving through SA listening to Horse with no Name
> Its because IV's map wasted absolutely no space

Nah, it's because GTA SA had much faster means of transportation. Faster cars and highways, and planes makes it much easier to get round.

> 90% of it was comprised of tall buildings and skyscrapers, whereas San Andreas had massive, empty sections which the player was unlikely to ever visit,

I don't understand this. 99% of the buildings were inaccessible. Did you ever visit the tops of every building? What's so great about driving past buildings that look identical most of the time?

In GTA SA you literally did go everywhere because the game made you go everywhere. There's entire sections of the game where you go to the badlands and bone county(where the "empty sections" are). The only place that has nothing to do in SA is the top left where the boat school is.
I honestly went everywhere in San Andreas frequently
I don't understand this argument about GTA SA and GTA V having wasted space. Just because there is no city everywhere it doesn't and shouldn't mean that the space was wasted. Whenever you see big mountains or desert or plains it does not mean that it is taking away from the space of the city. Instead I am pretty sure Rockstar wanted 2/3 of map to be mountains from the start. 

Also the whole map being City does not mean that it doesn't waste any space. Just because GTA IV doesn't have any countryside doesn't mean that it is the best map. Please stop with this stupid logic.
What the area called? Where CJ meet the  crazy woman (I think she's the woman from GTA III the)  it's in the middle of nowhere, also the mission were you also to do park a tank
Slower traversal helps too. If you're in a fast car, being able to drive the whole perimeter of the island in GTAV in a few minutes definitely makes it feel smaller
I mean RDR2’s map is also bigger than GTAV’s, I think 15% bigger.
RDR2’s map is actually bigger than GTA 5’s though
It's definitely not denser. That's the whole point of gta5.  It's just in blain county there's really not much to do out there besides that one little town whole rdr2 comes post witcher 3 and there are little events and sidequests every 5 minutes.
The scale is a bit out of whack in 3D era, but not that much. And no, people would not be 4 inches tall.
HD era has proper scale (I mod cars for IV and V, they're actual size)
Still feels so much bigger though
And still a better map, large size doesnt mean good
I really doubt rdr2 was smaller. No facts just from experience I doubt it.
The *explorable* part.
No way. It's smaller????
It was 127km2
Whoa WHAT? Really? That is insane
While I'm sure you're a good person there's absolutely zero chance I believe the RDR2 map is smaller than GTA V.
With Google saying that RDR2 is 127km^2, which is bigger than Cyberpunk at about 110km^2, I’d say that GTA VI will be anywhere from 140km^2 to 150km^2 approximately.
Yeah I'm really hoping the world feels as alive as it does in RDR2. 

I'm looking forward to feeding gators bodies in whatever the equivalent to the Everglades are
Yep. If you’ve played or even just SEEN RdR2 then 6 should have you on a different level of excitement.
I definitely want it more dense but I don’t want it as dense as say Liberty City in GTA 4. Like that map just had no real empty spaces. I enjoyed exploring the empty spaces in GTA 5
Can you imagine a map as big as V, but as dense as IV? Like, imagine the map from V, but with everything from the airport to the Alamo Sea just a dense cityscape.
Well that’s wrong, there’s so much empty desert with nothing to do besides ride your horse and shoot at a bird or animal.

Don’t talk it up to more than what it is.
Yea, but GTA4 was basically a flat map. Sure there was some elevation differences, but no mountains of any kind. That game was phenomenal. I think this game will blow everything out of the water.
Let me introduce you to a little something called “Illinois”. Anything outside of Chicago, or the burbs is cornfields and its actually so dead. When i visited Colorado i immediately fell in love.
There’s still a variety of terrain in FL. We’ll have no more mountains and fewer hillsides, but we’ll likely be seeing marshlands/swaps/wetlands, small forests, etc. You can’t really treck mountains as much as those areas.
Kind of blowing my mind here, friend. I never considered FL terrain compared to the mountain/s we had in V. I think they're going to go hard on water traversal and exploration this time around to make up for a lack of hilly regions.
why do we need mountains in a gta game
I mean, there might not be mountains in Florida but it’s extremely hilly in some areas
Come to Brazil 🇧🇷
I seen this argument before but I never felt like VC map was boring just because it was flat. Long roads, driving at full speed, stunt jumps, jumping from one roof top to another, it was fun. Having to ride upward a mountain in gta v was more often than not just annoying instead of fun.
I think a mountain would be cool but I feel like the Everglades will be way better tbh. Not sure if you’ve ever been down there in real life but not only is it beautiful, the wildlife there is so dynamic and different from anywhere else in America. I feel like there will be more to do with the Everglades than there was with mount chiliad when it comes to actual engagement
Florida has hilly areas in the Ocala area. Also near Tallahassee. It’s not a lot but it’s def not flat
I feel like ive seen some hills in central Florida
Just checked. Some parts of central Florida are a hundred feet above sea level . [this](https://en-us.topographic-map.com/map-49m/Florida/?center=27.78764%2C-81.80711&zoom=7&popup=30.46761%2C-83.86963)
Yeah that could have been much better
This take about GTA 5 map being dead wasn’t a thing until rdr2 dropped. That map is definitely not dead and most people saying this have also been playing for 10 years so of course they know it like the back of their hand.
I’m still pissed at Rockstar for never giving us GTA 5 expansions and just milking the shit out of online. But tbf to them they’ve never let me down when it comes to their story mode games. RDR2 for example proved to me that Rockstar still has it in them to wow me with a spectacular story mode.
Rockstar has never let me down (except with 5) 

So the hype is real and will surpass our expectations
Yeah it would take approximately 8 years if u ask me 😂
It’s not like they haven’t had plenty of time. If they started this game in 2018, that’ll be 7 years…which is unprecedented for a single game to be under development.
Narrator: “their 2060 could not handle it”
I’ve never understood the issues with this…I’ve had a 2070 super since it came out and have never had issues with running any game no matter how resource dependent the game is. Could someone explain more in-depth?
Because it gives much more options to interact, specially if the cop ai is better, trying to evade them by going into buildings and stuff
Car crime simulator got old fast to me

I remember glitching into story mode buildings just to set up a mission in there or even just to explore.

I started playing again recently and a lot of buildings have become accessible over time, but glitching cars/ outfits gets old quickly
It makes the game realistic imo. And because the GTA games are becoming more and more realistic this would be a good path to take.
Id prefer them copying interiors to the point that it's very noticeable over having as many enterable buildings as gta 5. And no not only a few percent of players would do it. Many many would. Most likely most players. And sure maybe they won't enter every single one. But being able to enter a big chunk of the buildings is extremely immersive and would add a lot to the game. It's the most obvious next step for rockstar.
Honestly I'm just saying this like a kid writing to Santa I want the game to be huge so I can play it for the next decade , more things to do than any other GTA game more scenarios for regular online players and RP gamers too.

 I want the police to be able to raid houses too, because it was so boring too get home and just wait for the police to stop chasing you.
More random encounters, just imagine visiting a building and there was like a drug deal inside and a shooting starts right there, no need to make it a mission just a random encounter in the city and the next day you see it in the news etc..
They had insane plans for Gta 6, they wanted to include large swaths of north and south America as said by jason schrier but it was scaled down to focus more on immersion and interiors
Why?
I’ve been thinking this. Maybe the ankle monitor is to explain why we can’t leave the state, but that means the whole state is accessible.
I always felt that was the case as well.

Hopefully, if GTA VI is going to be the newest GTA for the next 15 years, Rockstar will expand the map this time.
Dude the metric system is way more accurate. You’re the only country in the world that uses miles and feet. Like you took someone’s foot and said okay his foot will be the measurement lol
waaay ahead of its time. these kids take everything for granted
You know what, it's actually going to be the whole planet. You just have to trust me, my girlfriend's boyfriend who works at Rockstar told me so.
Starfield has a map that's a million times larger. Rockstar has no excuse for having such a small map size when an apparently "outdated" studio such as Bethesda can pull it off.
Technically, VC has 7 islands.

2 main ones and 5 tiny ones. (Leaf Links consists of 3 islands)

VC wastes a lot of space on that ginormous beach area that takes up about 1/5th of the map. Additionally, III has elevation, which also helps make it feel bigger.
Also they felt so chill
The render distance fog was used to great effect. The roads were very winding and long, making the map appear larger than it is. Similarly if you play Elder Scrolls Morrowind and have a no fog mod, you can see the game map for how tiny it actually is.
You should keep looking Rockstar said the first person to find bigfoot gets a tour of the studio
When I was a kid I played a lot of Diablo 1, I had heard there was some way to dupe gold to get rich... My future brother-in-law told my the trick was to talk to Deckard Cain, then run around the well in a circle many times and then talk to the blacksmith Griswold and he will duplicate your gold or items for you.

The amount of damn time I spent going in circles around the well dozens and dozens of times....
That’s what I was thinking
Which is sad because it's on the same level as the cities vibe and design wise. Plus it makes the cities feel even more alive, san fierro used to feel so crazy after doing missions on the countryside for a while
That's because Bayside was a late addition to GTA SA. San Fierro Bay originally had what appeared to be a fictional version of Alcatraz Island, but that was replaced by Bayside. My guess is that the change was to make the map seem just that more full and natural-flowing.
It's not that it was a waste of space, it's that there was nothing to fucking do out there. Most of rdr2 is just countryside, but there were events out there and hunting and crafting and you were going somewhere. It felt like a journey. SA kinda had that, but 5 really didn't.  If 6 has multiple cities and the characters are on the run and the side quest sort of pepper their journey away from the cops, that could be substantial. If it's just a place to drive through, fuck that.
nowhere in the comment did I say that San Andreas wasted space or that IV's map was the best; just that IV's was extremely packed in contract to the vastness of SA's
Exactly, only city means cube size of the mal you can't explore. Lots of them.
Add in the sheer number of distractions and you could take two hours on a two minute ride.
I was only generalizing for the example. The map between 3 and SA is a similar scale, Vice City is larger but the map is smaller, because the assets are larger. 

I imagine everything after IV is on the same scale.
Hey man you seem to know how scale works in gta iv and gta v. Is there a way for me to find out the scale of everything in gta IV and gta v. I wanted to measure the size of the map by myself. Is it possible to do that by myself with simple tools. Or do you know how Rockstar measurement units work.

The only way I know how to measure is using in game distance but sometimes it feels unreliable, so is there any other way.
Cuz you mostly explore it with a 1hp car
That's what she said
I feel RDR2 got it easy with map design due to the time period requiring less buildings and less dense setting. It’s not a fair comparison to GTA V map as that’s in a modern setting with much more things to have in the map and to have it designed within the constraint of PS3/Xbox 360 was amazing.
Yeah. I much rather have a smaller map that's dense and have lots to do
for real, like just the size of area added in rdr 2 feels so massive and rdr 2 gets to cheat kinda by having half the map of the first game
0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000043894543952340794823356132626527820319678592116076617102688528997394674158851770846841501112567525427579747482006000799146810806774893433306115642246637838593788500311334502507073950934697431386889200107150523751645537287146690388800383110633932225968716896425378118792047428004989053882249236748476764093748745111391348367849848873451939793862957673575917818378963308582598998169614583893837945346388014154677093665315890459581901160853829611598383561186631010554922207909099396304950678265460262021 km^2 ????!!!
Even being in the middle of nowhere in the fucking forest was awesome in RDR2
I mean I feel like rockstar was testing a lot with RDR2 and it wasn’t like GTAV or GTAIV that released at the end and the beginning of the 7th gen console generations respectively. RDR2 released right in the middle of 8th gen and took full advantage of their capabilities which was previously only seen in essentially games that acted like tech demos like Ryse: Son of Rome or Killzone Shadowfall. R* tested a lot of new shit with RDR2 that can quite easily be ported over to GTAVI, especially with the wildlife which I think made RDR2 feel alive unlike GTAV.
Yep. I think V had the best balance.
That would be boring.
Well if they include Marco Island they might have some Hill the south part of the island has several but unfortunately it would only encompass a rich neighborhood in gta vi if the island is included. outside of that the only other hills I know about as a Florida resident are man made one in the interior
Florida is actually even flatter than Illinois. The highest point is an old 300 foot tall trash dump. Lot of places in Miami dade can’t even grow big trees unless they pile up dirt into burms to get above the sand and waterline.
Central Florida gets cave systems like Devil's Den too.  Shit there's a state park that's just caverns.

There's definitely going to be some variety.
because going to the top of mount chilliad and going down with a parachute was awesome, also a place to see the whole map from (also tallest building in florida is smaller than Maze Bank real building).
Dirt biking and atvs were great on the mountain trails.
Where is it hilly in Florida??
I'll say this as someone who played through gta 5 for the first time relatively recently (about a year ago), the mountains and the boonies up north felt dead. I explored a little, but without some internet guide, it's far more fun to just walk downtown than meander aimlessly through Mount chilliad. I played it right after I finished rdr2 and the top 2/3rds of the map in gta5 felt as dead as the southern desert of rdr2 did the difference was that the desert in rdr2 was basically an endgame unlock while you were forced to spend a huge amount of time in uninteresting parts of gtaVs map
Honestly i’ve always loved GTA 5 map. Sure only 30-40km of it has actual stuff going on but that’s still double the size of the map in GTA 4 and would match the overall map size of GTA SA which again had tons of empty spaces as well. 

Easy to say the map is dead now when we haven’t had a new GTA game in 10 years.
Yup. Their well-crafted single player stories fall by the wayside when there’s shark cards to be made.
Why did 5 let you down? It’s the best game in the series imo, each installments is usually better than the last honestly.
People really forget about Covid and how much it impacted the general workforce. 

Keep your expectations realistic.
7 years is not unprecedented… there are games that have taken longer than that
Spore, Too Human, The Last Guardian, Final Fantasy 15, Prey, Diablo 3, Duke Nukem Forever. All games with more dev time than GTA VI. Hardly unprecedented.
Bro what? lol
GTA 6 is coming out in 2025, pc release a year or more later. 5000 series cards will be out in 2025. While it’ll run the game it won’t do it optimally and especially not to a higher degree graphically. I have a 2080 super but will defo upgrade for GTA 6.
yh, i hope you are right.
i mean a larger map and more indoor access is what most of us want, no!?
I’m thinking it could lead to “counties” unlocking. So far we know of three counties.
I wouldn’t say the metric system is more accurate, it’s just easier to use. Every measurement system is going to have the same level of accuracy if the rules of the measurement system are consistent.
CANT HEAR YOU OVER ALL THIS FREEDOM 🦅
A foot is a good form of measurement because it’s something the human mind can wrap around. I’ve always thought it made sense
UK uses miles.
I'm in my mid twenties and I'll sound like a boomer here but some kids these days have no idea how great the classic GTA's were and still are. San Andreas especially, best GTA imo. It makes me sad thinking people's first and only GTA experiences is 5 and GTA5 online and they think it's the holy grail
I really hope Vice City in GTA 6 doesn’t waste a lot of its space on the beach again
And the stupid airport. A quarter of the second Island is useless due to that airport.
[deleted]
Yep, driving in those places with the radio was a fantastic experience
Chilliad one may say
Morrowind is still fairly large, especially for the time. But definitely smaller than it feels. I noticed another major contributing factor to that is the mountains that wall off each part of the island, very similarly to how WoW separates zones.
Source for this?
bro got bamboozled
Driving into San Fierro for the first time is still one of my favorite video game moments.
1 to 15 horsepower.
Horses have more than one horsepower.
Exactly
Horses have between 11-15 hp average
Usually I travel at 2 HP, map felt small and underdeveloped 🤓

Edit: obviously this was supposed to be a joke, I do not think RDR2 is underdeveloped
It is much harder to model terrain to look natural then urban environment with predefined shapes.   
Rockstar did unbelievable job with RDR2  and its map. 

I was making some maps for some games and when i was making parts with vegetation it was very hard to make it to not feel generic and repetitive. But when you add for example bench in that environment it instantly become way more believable as bench is instantly recognizable object and you exactly know how to model it to look realistic
I still can’t believe that Rockstar managed to get GTA 5 to run on the Ps3/Xbox 360. That in itself is astonishing.
as someone still slogging through rdr 2 there's no way it was easier, it's got so much attention to detail and things aren't as spread as you think, most "empty" spaces all look unique depending on the area and are jammed with hidden details, once I saw a 50 ft python in a tree, once I found a cabin full of dead people from CO2 poisoning, found a crazy lady in the woods with an army of dogs, sometimes it's getting ambushed by a gang that sends wagons loaded with TNT or a maxim to kill you, or it's meeting the scariest hillbillies you've ever seen. every inch of this game is like a minefield of fun.
Fr
I think people aren’t using proportion in games correctly, you can say a horse moves only 1-5 mph but honestly you have to convert that travel to a gta vehicle at 60 mph basically, the speed is similar it’s just it’s executed to seem normal. If that makes any sense, I’m drunk typing
No, but I fixed it from what I meant to put. Idk how the -150 something got there because didn’t even type that. If I did, it was on accident
I'm really going to miss the mountains, though.  Florida is just flat
Cap
Flatter for sure, ive visited Florida on roadtrips before and it was more enticing than Illinois to me at least. Ig since im so used to it, Illinois is just 10x less interesting lol
Not really.  The mountain was a glorified hill.
I mean you could always just get in a plane
Did that for 10 years buddy. Nothing will stop you from going back and playing GTA 5 to re experience that.
They can always add ramps on building roof tops like in the original VC. Maybe a quarry or something. A lot of possibilities.
Not really. The physics were trash compared to 4
Mt Dora and Clermont
Also the tech. Nobody was saying anything about the map being “empty” until a game that came out half a decade later had a better one. The map is A+ for open world standards TODAY and at the time was considered the greatest open world game (not rpg) of all time.
Yeah but the complaints around GTA 5s map are valid. If you cut out a lot of that forest and desert stuff the actual city of Los Santos may have been bigger and may have had more interiors to enter. I guess either way it may not have mattered due to the limitations of the ps3/360.
Best game in the series? Not even close dude 

The physics and bullet ballistics were all neutered to accommodate the larger map 

GTA 4 was a superior game in every way 

Red dead 2 finally brought it back, and I hope Rockstar expands on that and brings it to 6
Y’all are such simps omg. If R* can’t develop a nicer map with more exteriors with billions of dollars and 7 years…
Sometimes I forget just how much dev time spore had. I wish EA actually did something with the IP instead of abandoning it :(
My pc knowledge isn’t superb and I keep seeing people saying that they’re afraid that their graphics card won’t be able to run a game (not GTA VI specifically but rather lots of games that are demanding or whatever) 

I see my answer got some downvotes, I didn’t mean to come off like an ass or whatever but I got my uncle to buy a rug for me and I’ve never understood what people mean with their cars being unable to run something, like this guy with a 2060, as my card is pretty old but still run games smoothly as I’ve never had an issue with game performance as of yet, so I hoped somebody would be kind enough to explain it to me
Are rockstar usually good at optimizing for PC or no?
Not really.  Right now video game AI has a very hard time transitioning between outdoor and indoor gameplay spaces.

Go back and play RDR2 - the AI shits its pants when it goes into any building.  Same with every other GTA and even other games like The Last of Us.
Not really because not everyone’s foot size is 12 inches. It’s definitely not the average foot size for men just like height, not even gonna talk about women or other backgrounds of people lol. And most of the world are smart enough to know what a metre is etc. I myself am actually 12 shoe size so I do understand your point of you but there’s a reason why science uses the metric system. Even NASA an American organisation uses the metric system.
same dawg, i played the OG trilogy in elementary, 4 in middle & 5 my senior year. 5 is such a downgrade to what rockstar can do. the map is tiny asf when you remove the mountains with nothing on them. i pray 6 doesn’t fuck us on the map by adding a giant lake in the middle of south florida lol
I mean it probably will since Florida has a metric shit ton of beaches lining its coast. However, since GTA6 is probably gonna have a way bigger map, even if large parts of its coast is beach, the rest of the map will still feel massive in comparison.
GTA 5 wasted a lot on just open ocean, and a good portion of the land are impassable slopes that your character will instantly ragdoll on. Thats unlikely to be the case considering geography, but i hope they dont make the majority into impassable alligator swamp
It's literally based on Miami and South Beach lol
I really liked taking a bike (in VCS, at least) and just racing around the airport, though.
>But to be fair the game was developed in 18 months.

9 months.
*All my exes live in Texas*
![gif](giphy|wSkboUv9BfYIgnMVcG)
Their uncle works at Rockstar
Sernando, obviously.
5.7hp to be exact, in the one academically approved test that has been done
It's around 5hp, actually.
Whelp, underdeveloped? How can you be so wrong?
>It is much harder to model terrain to look natural then urban environment with predefined shapes.

True. RDR2 had great environment. Take caves for example. In other games lets say Fallout or Starfield they just feel like regular rooms with rocky walls. But in rdr2 it actually feels like you exploring real caves. 

But I feel like at the same time, it's easier to fill up empty lands with trees and bushes since not all of them have to be placed by hand. A lot of it can be randomly generated. With a city everything needs to be placed by hand in the right place. From garbage in alleys to shop interiors.
I think that’s true to a point. Now that we have begun to reach a point (especially Rockstar) where foliage and rural settings can and do look near photorealistic, as well as dynamically behave in a convincing manner, the script is a bit flipped. Despite the increasing exposure to urban environments, natural environments are hardwired into our brains, and we know how they look, to an expert degree. Natural environments also don’t offer nearly as high an amount of variability as urban ones do. I don’t mean of course overall, as many different natural scenery exists, and it’s extremely diverse. 

But in terms of believability, there’s a set amount of visual aesthetics regarding trees in the south eastern US. They are going to be a shade of green, yellow, brown, or red. They will be at a specific scale, etc. Water pretty much looks and behaves identically, and therefore we know what we are aiming for there (and again this asset has really been mastered over the last decade or so.). Where as urban environments are literally artificial. The sky is the limit in terms of design, texture, shapes, behavior, etc. I think constructing urban metropolises the size of what we see in GTA and Cyberpunk is definitely a massive undertaking. Much more so than RDR2s prairies and woodlands. 

There’s also no expectation of composition with respect to natural elements. They can be scattered and randomly planted by a tool or algorithm and it will appear soothing and acceptable to our brains. Yet we know how exactly how intersections should be laid out. We know what the strip in Miami looks like. We know how a chicks ass jiggles as she twerks atop a four door sedan at 15-20 mph. They have to design TO those standards, in order to maintain the immersion. That takes tender love and care. 

Either way, I’m glad people like you and Rockstar are willing and able to do it. Because that is patience I will never know. Bless you 🙏
It’s such a controversial opinion, especially on this sub, but I fear that RDR2 will go down as their best game. The story, character development, gameplay mechanics, creative and technical decisions are going to be very, very hard to beat. But then again, it’s Rockstar Games for Christ’s sake. Every game that they release seems, literally , a decade ahead of it’s time. I’m sure  that I’ll be eating my words come the release of GTA VI. Here’s to hoping.
It had massive cliffs and could be challenging to drive up lmao wdym
Ahhh disagree. Physics in V were way better than IV especially driving physics
GTA V has a lot more activities, more cars, more guns, more green areas, a larger map, more and better diverse missions, three different protagonists with various backgrounds, stories and missions. GTA 4 was a great game but aside from the subjective physics GTA V improved on a lot of things and added even more.
Look, GTA IV has some of my fondest freemode multiplayer moment and I absolutely adore the style of GTA IV, but lately there has been a huge surge of people claiming how IV was this hidden gem that we’ve all been too blind to see. 

It’s hard to take these points seriously when they all seem to harp on the same small things:

• The physics in GTA IV - they were more realistic in a lot of ways, the Euphoria physics engine was a beast, but if we had this same engine powering V, everyone would hate how big the map was with the cars being too floaty on turns. 

• More accessible interiors - well, of course. The map was so much smaller, it wouldn’t have made sense for Liberty City to have less accessible buildings than Los Santos/Blaine County. 

GTA IV was incredible, but I just don’t think it’s the best GTA, in the court of opinion or in terms of objectivity.
Not sure why you're getting down voted, I thought this was a popular opinion - and I also agree.
Simps for who lmao?
Okay but 60% seems like such an exaggeration. it was like 2% of buildings in gta v that were enterable.
It’s just very possible that the minimum processing power required by GTA VI will be higher than your graphics card will be able to output, leading to issues such as low frame rates and crashing
Yes, but optimization isn’t magic. It won’t make a brand new AAA game on the cutting edge of graphical fidelity run great on a card from 8 years ago (at the time of GTA 6 release). 30fps at medium settings, probably. Maybe more with upscaling.
Not sure what you mean by this? In rd2 whenever an NPC goes into a saloon or whatever they will walk up to the bar/poker table and take a seat without any issues
Do you mean NPCs? Or what AI are you refering to?
Yh i guess if GTA 6 map is atleast the size of the GTA 5 map or even bigger than having a massive beach on wont really hurt it.
![gif](giphy|cegWHQXotzAB2)
*that's why i hang my hat in tennessee*
Wait they have fuckin George Strait in San Andreas??
You did not have to ruin my day by telling this!
Then why is it called a horsepower? Checkmate, blyat.
Maybe I should have ended it with an S/
No they weren’t lmao. 

There are videos with millions of views showing the difference between them… 4 is superior in many ways 

The driving physics were the best part of 4 and they were applauded. Because those cars drove like real cars 

They handled differently. 

The Porsche was rear engine and you could feel it 

The Ferrari was mid engine and drove like a dream 

The Viper was Front/mid and drove like a maniac from the weight 

Just stop dude
Don’t care about that if the physics engine is garbage 

The best part about 4 was driving around and playing with the physics. Watching the bullets impact officers to make them stumble.
Absolutely man, I don't know what is happening. But since last 2 years I have been seeing people claim that gta iv was this hidden underrated gem. And it's not just reddit but various big youtubers who are also claiming the same.

I loved Gta iv ragdoll physics and car collision physics and without the doubt it is the best. But to say that the game is better than GTA V or GTA SA feels very disingenuos and it feels like every one is parroting the same few points.

I feel like the same will happen with gta v once gta vi becomes 2 or 3 years of old.
Yeah lately there’s this weird thing going around about GTA 4 being some kind of misunderstood hidden gem in the series, very weird.
They’re probably 13
No no, I get that. I was just referring to the AAA industry’s inability to optimize properly for PC at all of late. All these new games destroying 40 series cards is kinda absurd lol. Was just wondering what Rockstars track record was.
NPCs - specifically enemy NPCs
Yes I am glad that is confirmed
The OST was really on point there. And Radio K Rose fucking rocked
They sure do !
Learning something ruins your day? You can't be THAT unproductive. Lean more into the nerd part 🤣
Still disagree. The cars drive like shit in 4.
They are giving their opinion on the physics of these games, that means when they say, "Physics in V were way better" they are not arguing which is more realistic. They are giving a subjective opinion. 


Plenty of people HATED the driving physics in 4. Sorry to burst your bubble. There is no need to be so confrontational over a video games physics. Grow up.
It’s not even garbage my man.
I dont understand the hidden gem talk. it's always been my favorite or 2nd favorite, and it seems pretty well liked. I've never heard anybody call it straight up bad.
RDR2 runs decently well on a Steam deck and GTA V runs flawlessly, I think GTA 6 will be well optimized for PC. It will also probably support Directstorage for faster loading, DLSS and Frame Gen for higher FPS and possibly ray tracing /path tracing.
yeah, i always rock k-rose in the countryside and k-dst or radio x in the desert
Loved k rose.
*gives you ah wedgie then shoves you into ah locker* ;)
My comment was supposed to be comical
Yes. Like in real life. Good luck out there.
Then you probably haven’t driven sports cars in real life
Can’t wait for Bully 2 and Bully online!!
Dio fan? haha
Excellent! Ruined your day AND your joke. My day is now made
I am playing a video game not a simulation. Plenty about Grand Theft Auto is NOT realistic. Like being able to pull 30 weapons out of your back pocket.
That’s true lol I haven’t. Luckily we’re talking about video games here and not real life. I also don’t use an Xbox controller to drive my Toyota.
And???
GTA6(V) go fxck yourself
Meme video
It's officially the greatest thing i have seen on this subreddit

We need a trevor in every GTA game. Hopefully there is a version of him in 6
The fact that Trevor is singing the Tom Petty song is fucking mental lmfao

Okay, the blown out singing at 0:40 definitely got me lmao
I believe... Trevor is the real Florida man
better love story than twilight
That voice crack made my throat hurt
Man gta v graphics have become incredibly bland compared to what we have today
Rockstar will never, and you can quote me on this, beat Trevor. That man was the embodiment of GTA as a series.
11/10 You did such a good job!
This is why the internet exists.
Despite it being a meme, it does offer an accurate graphics comparison.
Absolutely hilarious
Gold
10/10 go fuck yourself
You know there are GTA devs looking at this video and laughing their asses off.
Holy shit this is gold
Trevor singing is just piece of art.
Go fuck yourself😂
![gif](giphy|q7Eokbqmg6VSmsulSn)
The singing alone took me out. This is my new favorite thing on the internet.
This might be the best thing on the internet right now. Toss up between this and the I so pale girl.
😂😂😂

So good lol, saving!
That voicecrack lmfao
This is finally the content I was expecting from this sub
![gif](giphy|7rj2ZgttvgomY)
The final scene before the logo is actually pretty fire.
😄 ...I wonder how long this video took to make ?
Better than the gta6 trailer
Hilarious. Cont stop laughing
Lmfaoooo this is actually done REALLY well!
RemindMe! 3 seconds
Lmao Trevor singing is Gold
![gif](giphy|oNKLBehxbnoqY)
Wow.

That’s pretty good!
This is the best thing I have ever seen in my life
We dont need GTA 6. We need this.
TREVOR...MOTHER FUCKIN' PHILLIPS!
Imagine if we recieved this as a trailer

I love it
Pretty good
The punching was excellent

haven't laughed this much since months lol thanks
Holy shit im crying
GTA 5 Remastered: coming 2025
I love how at around 42s the AI doesn't know how to reach the note so it just pulls away from the mic and belts a scream
Is it on YouTube? I need to share it to non reddit people
What a masterpiece!
I've seen a few of these. This is honestly the best one!!
Trevors voice dropping out at 42 seconds is too damn funny
This is GOATed.
![gif](giphy|wAjfQ9MLUfFjq)
Lmfao i love Trevor man 😂😂
![gif](giphy|LOcPt9gfuNOSI|downsized)
My god, the approaching establishment shot on the Del Perro beach looks so dead and pales in comparison to the opening establishing beach shot of the 6 trailer, this game is going to be insane
I pray GTA6 has characters matching these 3 in energy and personality.
10/10
Epic Content
Absolute greatness.
Died laughing at this

This is so sick, congrats dude if you made this yourself lmao
this is top tier content 💯 i have much respect for your efforts
This is a masterpiece
Accurate representation of current American culture 😂
Yo bro who the fuck made this shit bruhh 😂😂
This is absolutely brilliant.
bilibili? go f_ck yourself
This is hilarious what the hell
This Is my favorite thing ever, in the history of the world, i think about It everyday, before waking up and before going to sleep. If It had 8 billions fans id be One of them, if It had 1 fan, that would be me, if It had no fans, It means in not here anymore, if the world was against It, id be against the world
this is incredible
Sir, you are a genius.
The first thing to have made me laugh out loud on this subreddit. Amazing
It is the best thing I've ever seen in reddit
Fucking brilliant.
Epic
Fantastic
Better than the original
GTA 5 (V) you meant right? V=5
I LOVE THIS
Can this get any better? 🤩
Thoroughly enjoyed this...thank you for bringing brightness to my day
😂😂😂😂😂😂
gta vi gonna  open with 'why did I move here' in the biggest rug pull in gaming history
This song is very relatable
Fucking Epic! Love this 😂😂
LMFAO
Lmao
Masterpiece
this is tooooo good !
That’s some good shit right there
Idk why I love this
I don’t see how I didn’t see this before. They just rip us off giving the same game 😒
Gta 5.5: Trevor "go fuck yourself" Philips
Need this game NOW!
Amazing 👌👌👌
Who let BiliBili cook 💀
beautiful 🥹
I knew somebody was gonna do it eventually 😂😂😂 10/10
This is art.
Online character
WTF 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
twerking part almost done right xD
Honestly, the best remix of the Trailer. I have seen many but this gave me the same vibe as the original one.
This is Perfection
YES
now THIS is funny 😂
Man what a time to be alive.
Too good
This is better than sex!
This was sick if I hadn't already seen the trailer for VI and saw this insane you would have had me, GO FUCK YOURSELF!!!
This can not be topped.
Trevor is the most floridian canadian guy in existence.
Pure perfection
FYI, bilibili is known for making Chinese memes videos
Everything about that is unsatisfying and I love it 🤭
Watch out. The Miami joke might need 1-2 mill from bili bili
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
![gif](giphy|R9Zy5wOTzCC8Sd1f1E|downsized)
Wow. Simply brilliant. Long live Trevor!
This is really well done
gTa
It's crazy but after spending so much time recently watching the trailer and videos about 6, it all of a sudden makes this game look basic
LMAO who did this? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
![gif](giphy|ECoYUjfGppfKiwZKXE|downsized)
Perfection 😂😂
Bro used a jet to film the beach shot 🔥🔥🔥
He's a great singer. And this is weirdly addictive.
Curious to know what's written in the news tickers in the end.
Honestly video made me realize how well GTA 5 has aged. Still looks great after 10 years and honestly some things in GTA 5 look better than things from the GTA 6 trailer!
That's fire!

GTA 7 Trailer
I don't know why but it would have been really funny if Michael said "all right when" when Trevor said go f yourself 😂
It’s all downhill from here folks. We’ve officially peaked here.
This is why I'm here. For this.
And the Academy Award goes to...

Go Fuck Yourself, for Best Picture!

That was to great 😂
!Remindme 2 years
😂😂😂 this is the best trailer

The most hilarious too. We really need Trevor moving to Vice City now.
Might be my fav new thing on the internet
Also same
life is good again
HOW MANY 10s. OK I'm gona count. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 25 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40. OK it's 40 10s
It did
Bilibili is the greatest Chinese thing ever.
Replaced with Nightgown Trevor
Go fuck yourself
Yes. AI Trevor voice
I got confused and thought you ment Trevor was communicating in ASL or something lol

*singing*
I want CJs crazy girlfriend to be Lucia's mom.
I now want to hear one with Michael and Franklin singing it (and Niko and Lamar, etc)
Classic Trevor haha
Why did I read this in Gordon Ramsay's voice lmao.
It looked amazing for the time during PS3/Xbox 360 era. Graphics have progressed and come long way in 10 years time.
It's almost like the game is 10 years old or something
disagree. i think it still looks fantastic.
Same question
They've remade the GTA IV trailer scenes in GTA V using custom mods... There's nothing ripped off.
TLDR: Los santos motor gang once again roaming the streets and their leader is Trevor... now go fck urself(beats)

I am now gonna reupload this for the whole world to see
I think they gonna kill off Trevor in the first hours of the GTA VI. remember this comment...
Count again. 7 rows by 7 columns!
Kind of scary how there's tons of emotion in it. AI has already mastered not sounding like AI
you seriously thought that dude or you just wanted to correct his typo? Lol
Catalina?
Lmao I know… but what I meant is it’s crazy how far graphics have come from gta v compared to rdr2
Lol a joke is what I made.
Would love to see that but, the actor hates the character and videogames now so I doubt it

Trevor sucked, gta 5 kinda sucked. Leave all the characters there
Remindme! 2 years
I seriously doubt that, the great thing they have now is the ambiguity that Trevor or Michael died in the alternative endings in 5, bringing them back to kill them again would be a waste of time. and ruin the possible endings 5 had.
RemindMe! 2 years
I remember someone saying that they might actually reference him off handedly like they did with Niko in GTA 5.


Specifically that he died in a drug run or something like that.
RemindMe! 2 years
Maybe they’ll kill Michael or Franklin too
It would be a good plot twist
DAMN IT SOME WERE HIDING BEHIND THE People. It's 65 isn't it.
It sounds like it's patched and stitched together.

Yes
Ok
What better way than this to be done with Trevor once and for all?
Well aren't you the little contrarian
oh yeah, totally forget that lol. It's been at least 8 years since I played the story
Correct. 7 by 7 is 65.
I couldn't see the people that was short as hell. And was behind the others. I counted furiously
You can count the first row and the first column on the left and multiply, all of which you can see 😉

Congrats, I really hope this becomes a gaming article because you deserve recognition for this work of space art
So, you're with MAST. Right?
Captain Harlock is that you ?!
Ok that's awesome. I'm definitely making myself one of these.
now maybe the sea shanty guy will join your crew!
I like the cut of your jib!
“Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.” - Jack Sparrow
Avast ye spacer!
Gives me Treasure Planet vibes!! Well done OP! Be honest, how many hours of your life did this take? Lol
That would be sick if they added solar sails. Even better if they are deployed when in space and when you increase your velocity.
I hate you. Take my upvote
I'll never forgive Disney for not giving us another Treasure Planet
Please tell me you have cannons as your weapons? I need to see them in action
Today’s Reddit winner is!
Bro 😳
Paint it red and it can be the ship of the Crimson Binome.
ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS!  I'm in awe.
But why is the rum gone?
Starfield Of Thieves...
Dude it’s like the ship from Treasure Planet..  epic
*Treasure Planet soundtrack kicks in*
Damn that looks sweet, actually wouldn't be that difficult to tweak that into the Mother Vanguard from Crossbone Gundam.
(Basically a group of "good guy" space pirates that pilot giant mecha)
RAMMING SPEED!!
anyone else see Lost Planet ?
Jackie boy got an upgrade!
Yar har fiddly- dee!
I’m going to need the schematics to this mate.
Makes me think Treasure Planet 🤣
Now go find treasure planet
TREASURE PLANET IN THIS BIH
That's not the Arcadia!

But It is very nice.
Reminds me of that animated flick,  Treasure Planet.
HOW DO I MAKE THIS
Treasure planet vibes
We need ship part mods sooner rather than later so you can throw solar sails on that.
This is 🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥 black flag type stuff.
Oh My LANTA! This is incredible!
Looks nice man!
And now Im gonna reqatch Treasure Planet
Incredible work, love it 🎉🎉🎉
Love it
Arghh!!!
This is so dope!!!
Nice
Slow clap of praise and envy. Bravo buccaneer
This looks so good. I made a pirate ship a while back and still like it but you really went all out
If those sails had auto turrets anything in your sight will die instantly
That's cool af
Don't forget to stock up on orange Chunks so you don't get space scurvy.
I hope you named it the Dutchman
The Astral Sea isn't far off for you
Ah sweet!
That looks like a submarine.
How can you... Sail/travel/whatever with the middle pillard ?
In atmosphere flying would be so cool with that thing. Sail up to POIs and loose the cannons on the spacers
He built that ship so beautifully,  
That now he's the Ruler of the King's Navee!
Mark Watney, Space Pirate!
I'm so glad to see this 😂😂😂😂 when I mentioned it b4 the game came out i felt like I got alot of hate for it but glad to see where its come.
Harlock is that you?
But actually, this is amazing
That’s really fucking cool, nice work!
Wow nice
I can’t believe the game didn’t tel you it was too many items on the build.
Holy fuck, I love it!
I love it
Fuckin' beautiful 😍
Are you Captain Harlock?
Holy shit, that's hilarious.
Treasure planet here we come!!
How's the interior look?
See you, Space Cowboy !

hahaha amazing <3
You win, how can I get this framed? How much?
Major Treasure Planet vibes, love it.
GOD
It's beau..BEAUTIFUL!
That's a proper boat if I've ever seen one
This is so cool wow
I love how you glitched different engines together.
She's beautiful now all we need is a mod that let's us add sails
you did it dude you won the game
We’re whalers on the moon
That’s fucking awesome. Fair play
Crazy that people are still playing this game.
Finally something challenging...
Flying Merry !! :P
Now make Eden Zero in starfield
This is great
🫡
Now show us the view from the cockpit hahaha 


It looks like you’ve got the mast smack in the center of your windshield
ok, you win

Amazing stuff

SPACE Pirates!
This is the best Starfield thing I saw so far
Awesome design. I love it 🥰.
… and then the Darth Vader music from star wars started playing in my head… it fits.
I have nothing unique to say. All I can say is pure fact. This is Glorious
This does put a smile on my face.
Sea shanty time!
Alright, that’s cool
Easily my favorite ship build I've seen so far.
Cute, love it
I wish I lived in the universe where instead of “NASA punk” starfield was Steampunk.

And um was fun too (but we all know that’s asking too much from big B)
Ingenious!
Excellent!
This is amazing, but it feels like the two masts would obstruct the view from the cockpit too much....does it?
Thats cool
This is too much fun… serious question, how come some of the ship modules seem to “wrap” around others? Like eg the engines and modules around them taking the shape of the engine cones? Is this a mod or something?
Oh I like this!!
I don't think I'll ever get bored of these posts. Really cool build, dude! 😎
Aye aye Captain....
What the heil
The perfect ship for whalers on the moon.
I can hear the intro music of Albator ! (captain Harlock in French)
Starrrrrrrrfield
Yar, there be booty in that nebula
How much?
Yes!! 🤩I just watched treasure Planet last night and was thinking about how I could do a build like that.
Thats freakin awesome
Outstanding! Simply outstanding!
So dope hahah 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
We need a treasure planet mod
Aye Aye Cap'n
Yamato!
loving this
This is the best ship I’ve seen yet, wow.
Ooooof clean
SHOW US THE INSIDE
Dope
Attention to detail is 🤌
That is superb 👏🏻
I love this
Ok now i wanted to buy the game
No way!

Edit: pretty sure this is gonna be remembered forever.
Ok where the hell is the docking port and do you have inside pictures
Oh man, love it!
Quick question im new to starfeild and i wanna ask how do you build this cus i kind of wsnted to build sum like this like how much resources n stuff
Dope as hell dude, very Captain Harlock
This is so stupid I love it
the game will be bad until they port it to ps5 😂
Captain Harlock lookin ahh
Hahahha, this is awesome.  As are the replies.  11/10 matey.
this shit right here is straight out of treasure planet
Yarr, it’s a thing of beauty
Bros gonna through Aurora into the Aquila Harbor
It just gave me Pirates of the Caribbean Vibes when I saw the Ship standing on sand 😄
This is pretty awesome, and I want it. 😅
This is the coolest ship ive seen! Really cool design choice! I wish i was this good, my ships looks like a skeleton with mostly habs 🥲
I want to build this!!
If your not singing the intro to Jayce and the wheeled warriors intro while flying this, you're doing it wrong!

That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen. I want one.
Still can’t land in ocean..
First original ship post since week one, gorgeous
You sure? Those masts definitely seem over the hight limit by a *few* layers
Flip glitch? No mods? If yes; I def got to try this!
Wow! What’s the specs? How many people can that thing hold? And how many guns?!
How do you manage to get the ships so big ?

When II try it always says it's too big or too wide.

Do I need to get a different type of build first ?

All my ships are normal ones from the yards apart from I was daft and stole a Starborn ship now i'm stuck with it lol

Would love to build one like that looks awesome.
Specs?
We can't build that high on Xbox/s it's a shame because your ship looks cool we are limited I can do some of it but again the width and hight is reduced for us

Imo, this is just gimmick because why do you need those poles without the sails?  

True space pirates are more practical and not cosplayers.
The USS Constitution seems to have overshot their target
I’m playing Fallout 4 again and I thought of this too 😂😂 ol Captain Ironsides
glad to see ol' ironside finally making the big jump to space.
***Finally***. Fallout canon, meet Starfield canon.
That shit made me giggle
Lmao
Would have been a hell of an Easter Egg
Yessssss
Hopefully they picked up the ghouls in their rocket from Vegas haha
That's not how it happened.

Shut up and take my money 🤣
That would be a great Easter egg random encounter!

I'll admit, never seen Treasure Planet. But with all of these comments I'll watch it ASAP. Nice build.
Just had the same thought 🤣 looks almost exactly like it but has no sails
Dont worry Gamerant AI is working on it right now most likely
The comment is underrated.
This isn't a building tutorial, but it's as good as it gets. The weapon glitch is key; once you grasp it, you'll improve.

It's just a glitch that allows parts to be placed halfway into another part along the x, y, z axes.

Here, building glitches are used: flip, duplicate, weapon glitch, as well as console commands to access all parts, and also to exceed building limits.

Well you can actually build a landing pad on a beach closest possible to the sea level in height… it would be very close 😅
Yes, you’re right. But it’s a weapon-glitch that allows attaching parts like that.
(I found this glitch myself, so it’s probably not well-known now.)

I understand you; there are limitations on GeForce NOW(I playing on) that one just has to accept. However, I built this ship simply to demonstrate what's possible in this game. I'll never use it as my main ship because it's not practical at all for gameplay. So, it's just an art ship and nothing more.
That ship ends up everywhere except the water.
They were aiming for the Atlantic and hit New Atlantis instead
It's Called The RLS Legacy you twat
Never saw that reply and today it’s the second time.

The number of hours I’ve spent in ship builder is ridiculous lol. Would be cool is there was stats for time/credits in just that. A build like this would have taken me forever. I can always picture something in my head but then have to do back and forth to different vendors, running out of credits, juggling stuff around and changing design. Loads of fun though once you finish a great build!
Amazing bro, kinda funny to see how It works
I’m not sure if this is better or worse than I imagined haha. Maybe the negative space can function as iron sights
Cool, seen on a few builds and was wondering because there are occasion where thing fit either almost perfectly but the overlap kills it… do you know if there is a known method to exploit it or just kinda random?
Ohh nice! I learned the hard way that the height limit is lower than you might hope when I made my own space donuts 😂
Forgot to add that this is an amazing build, I tried to make one a few months back and failed miserably compared to this, very well done, might steal it and name it "the spacefaring dutchman" from the razorleaf, for the spacer encounters
Here I thought I knew all the build glitches. I do the only two I know that are the flip and change variant glitch. Building ships using the glitches takes far more patience and vision than doing vanilla builds and This one's def gonna take some practice to master, but thank you!
Right cheers i thought it must have been done in a mode command no wonder i was was getting the red too big notices lol :P I wanted to make a ship like Red Dwarf :O may have to set a day to one side.
Daft question but do you put all this as one cut and paste ?

I did it as that and it came up with exceeds 512 characters ;P 

I'll try and do one line at a time not used to this stuff but love the game, on level 63 kind of finding things more to do lol
Space is like the ocean, but super. That's why it's a space SHIP. They ended up in the water of the cosmos... they finally made it...
🫡🏆
Quality sub, should check it out if you’re a fan of the show. Watched the whole thing like 8 times. Haven’t seen the new season yet, heard mixed reviews on it
"FIRE"
Thanks for the headsup, watching it now!
Yeah, I found this before the article, but there was a link in the article and I wanted to see if it was the same post
Very nice, matey!
I spent more time searching for the right combinations of parts than actually building. If Bethesda made it so that all parts could be mirrored/rotated, it would be much easier and more interesting to build
I accidentally discovered it myself, not sure if it's well-known. Here's a video on how to attach any parts together using the weapon attachment point. [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/foJyBg0kvG0?si=yUShMYJiCjYjUmx6)

I input all the commands into the console at once. PS: These commands need to be entered each time you start the game, as they are not saved.

It's not called The Blackest Sea for nothing.
When I was younger fox in Portugal started to play since season 1 and I saw the first episode on a sick day during the morning, and got hocked. It was a good time watching it all ahah but it was years ago, would like to rewatch it tho
Big futurama fan myself.

The new seasons is shit, not OK, not bad... just plain shit. So disappointing ☹️
What did you think?
Yup, I find a lot of the best looking builds have a combo of manufacturers. I suggested way back at launch that at min your outpost should at least carry all makes.
I watched the video and I still don't understand it.
Ahhh that’s a damn shame. I was so excited when it was announced that it was coming back. So many laughs and cry’s from watching the original show. 

That was its true beauty, complete idiocy for dumb apes like me to laugh at, sprinkled with highly intelligent jokes only Einsteins would understand with a side of tugging at your heart strings. The original to this day is one of my top 3 shows!
Terrific fun. I'm old enough I felt like there were homages to earlier versions and even some Captain Harlock. Great cast.
It is possible to connect two or more different parts, using a common point weapon for them. It makes no difference whether these will be parts with vertical or horizontal points for weapons.

Some parts when moved along the Y axis cannot be lowered/raised to the required distance, then it is possible to use a weapon to move one part along the Y axis by a step of 0.5 instead of 1 as the game does by default (for this you need to bring the part to the weapon, and not weapons to the part).
Glad you enjoyed it. I wish we got the sequel that never made it past storyboards
Oh ok
Starfield was NOT nominated for Game of the Year at The Game Awards.
The nominees are Alan Wake 2, Spider-Man 2, Resident Evil 4, Baldur's Gate 3, Super Mario Bros Wonder, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

Thoughts on this?
I've said this before but I'm saying it again-- it was suspicious how many perfect reviews this game initially got. As it turns out, the 7/10 IGN review that everyone was bashing was almost spot on.
I really enjoy and love Starfield, but not terribly surprised.
The worst thing about Starfield is how much it delayed Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout 5
Not only that, it only got mentioned 1 time, for best RPG which is obviously is going to lose to BG3. I honestly think it was just thrown in that category just to say Starfield was mentioned
Makes sense.
I mean, the game has so much wasted potential, it makes sense not being nominated.
Starfield doesn't come close to any of those games. It's frustratingly uneven, full of half-baked systems and unfulfilling quests. It doesn't even deliver on the basic 'awe' of space travel.

If there was a "Best game overhauled by mods a year later" category, Starfield would probably win in 2024.
**Because it doesn’t deserve it.**
Not too surprised by this. I usually keep a Bethesda game on release installed for 6 months to a year. It's already uninstalled and I'm done. Just didn't quite grab me like the others. Ah well.
I tried so hard to like Starfield, but it was so damn tedious—I got bored. I was excited, I really was. I loved Skyrim and I’ve played through that game three times. However, this was just too much and uninteresting. The only thing I liked was the space travel and that was extremely limited, not enough to keep me playing.
It’s a painfully average game
As an elder scrolls girlie I'm thrilled it's been largely forgotten for GOTY. Hopefully Todd takes a long hard look in the mirror and ups Bethesda's game for TESVI. In the meantime I'll be replaying Skyrim and BG3, 50 hours logged in starfield and I'm just over it
Maybe Bethesda will learn and stop being lazy and refusing to innovate.

Constantly frozen in place with people looking at you with dead faces.

I played Cyberpunk and was like wow, this keeps me constently focused on what the person is saying. When they actually act human.

I doubt they will change though, that would require more money and effort. Just lying and depending on modders who work for free is more their style.
Not a surprise, Im happy Starfield is not on the list, maybe Bethesda realize they could bring us something better🤙🤙💣
Considering Starfield isn’t a great game, this makes sense.
Hopefully this is a wake up call for them. 

The game has great bones, but the trend of cutting and streamlining mechanics continues to kill the immersion of BGS games. The only system with some depth in Starfield is shipbuilding. 

Example: Spacesuit resistance is meaningless, and exploration is lame because there is no challenge with landing on and exploring certain harsh planets. Imagine if a cool power was in a temple on a planet that required you to traverse a challenging landscape before dying. 

They are terrified of limiting the player, and it makes the game boring to me.
The problems with the game have nothing to do with bugs or other technical issues and limitations.

The problem with the game is that it's boring.  You can get away with a lot of flaws if a game is interesting.  We've seen that repeated over and over again.  But if your game is boring, dull, and uninteresting, nothing will fix that.

We've all heard the litany of issues, but for me, the problem was that the story itself was just dull.  I could almost excuse that if the side missions and exploration were fun, but they just weren't. The side missions were okay, I guess, but the exploration side is just sorely lacking.

There is nothing compelling you to explore.  All the procedurally generated locations are cookie cutter and once you've explored one of that type, there's really no reason to explore any further since the next "abandoned mine" or whatever is going to have the exact same layout and loot.  

A locations in Skyrim and Fallout 4, and in all prior Bethesda games had some sort of backstory or reason for their existence.  They were unique and either tied into the story directly or added to the lore of the universe.  There was reason to keep exploring because it was fun to see what was going on at each site.

With Starfield, there is never anything interesting.  It's the same shit at every location of that type.  You can explore the marked locations, but those are a lot less common and very rarely compelling either.

Starfield could have been something really interesting and fun, rather than bland and repetitive.  As it is, it turned out to be an unwise diversion of effort.  People are clamoring for more Elder Scrolls and Fallout.  Instead, we got *this*.  I don't think people are going to be yelling for more Starfield in a couple of years, but they'll still be demanding more Elder Scrolls and they won't get it soon because Bethesda wasted their time on Starfield.

Sorry, I realize I am being overly negative, but to say I was disappointed in this game is probably an understatement.
BG3 has it in the bag anyways.
The irony is BG3 moved release date to avoid Starfield. Next time Bethesda better avoid an entire year if anything by Larian, Obsidian, Nintendo or CDPR launches that year, to avoid embarassment.

I remember a thread earlier this year, here or somewhere else, will Starfield or BG3 sell more? Had a lot of 'BaldEr who'? answers.
People saying it's meaningless don't understand that this indicates a clear drop in quality from Bethesda who used to always win awards with ease. Even when gaming was extremely competitive.   


They've spent vasts amount of resources and years into developing this new IP and AA studio's are pushing out better games.
It didn’t deserve it in the slightest. It’s technically and narratively dated, dragging its game engine around its neck like an albatross. All the nominations are deserving in one way or another. Starfield had nothing unique that made it stand out, especially compared to BG3!
It’s fine. This year is pretty stacked to be honest. As long as you love playing the game, awards don’t matter in the grandest scheme of things. I know many may disagree but I’m just glad it got nominated on the RPG category though we know it might not win there. For all the game’s flaws and negativity around it, I still enjoy my time playing the game.
It’s boring, bland, with the most irritating and janky UI. No, I’m not surprised at all it’s not been nominated.
I'm not even vaugely surprised if I'm honest. Starfield is a 6/10 at best. It's objectively a regression from Bethesda's previous work.
BG3 is clearly the very best game this year.
Reality’s a bitch. 

Congrats to the great dev teams that worked on AW2 and BG3.
Starfield and Redfall have been the biggest disappointments I can remember for a long time. 

I'm in no way surprised that this dreary, bland, soulless menu-fest didn't get nominated. Nothing that was intended to be fun, is actually fun. Bases: pointless, side quests: menu simulator, ship building: actually great, but absolutely meaningless, companions: provide nothing but negativity, exploration: pointless, owning property: again, meaningless.

I went into Starfield with nothing but optimism, but after forcing myself through 100+ boring hours, I'll likely never play it again.

letdown of the year.
Todd Howard needs a wakeup call. He's in love with this Creation Engine when even CD Projekt Red dropped their Red Engine. It's time to move into the next generation. 

He also needs to hire top tier writers to make a story people care about. 

At one point Todd Howard games were great open world games and they stood out but now every damn game does it and some do it better. 

Not only that it's a new day, you're owned by Xbox and people judge Xbox games different because the budget they have and people want Xbox to fail so Todd can't do "decent" anymore
Starfield is OK.  Not a GOTY contender.
Absolutely not surprised, it's definitely not worthy of even the nomination
I just wonder. Is Bethesda completely oblivious, or do they get the message?

I think it's very much justified.
they didn’t deserve it
[removed]
It's literally nothing groundbreaking and had Peter Molyneux-esque promotion. One of the biggest disappointments in gaming for a long time.

Glad to see Larian get nominated for BG3, a game that actually changed my opinion of a whole genre of video games.
If a game isn't finished upon release, it doesn't deserve to be nominated for game of the year.
No shit. It doesn't even crack my top 5 Bethesda games
Duh. 

I'm enjoying it, but it has so many issues. Many being old issues they still refuse to fix.

It's also basically a ten mile wide puddle in depth.
Not surprised, it's a good game that I enjoy a lot but not game of the year. If it came out a bit better then sure
Not surprising. It doesn’t deserve to be nominated
NG+ killed starfield for me. You try to build your character for endgame, only to know its gonna be wiped.
Starfield is like a giant Skyrim mod that puts the whole game in space. That's the best way to describe it. Because it doesn't feel like it was made by a big development team over many years. It feels like a mod for an existing game by a small team. I'm just hoping that mods will give me a reason to come back to it over the next decade. Otherwise I wasted $50.
Did anybody think it would?
All award shows are scams. But I can see why some people would be hurt. 

I think we can all agree that remakes and remasters should be banned from any awards. That doesn't even make sense how RE4 could be nominated.
Disappointed. Literally the only rpg I even attempted to play or beat this year. Had so many good moments that I haven’t had for a while from a video game. 

Hopefully because of the lack of praise they don’t decide to not give this game the love it should have.
"Thoughts on this?"

It wasn't good enough to make the nom.

Simple.

Edit: I will say I'm tired of seeing RE4 on a Goty list for the 9th time.
*sits calm for two minutes, then busts up laughing*
Love how everyone jumped on my ass when I said it wasn't a 10/10 several weeks back.

Funny, how it's not even goty nomination worthy, so it's vindicating to see it get snubbed as all mediocre games should.
Unsurprising because it's not good.
It simply does not deserve that award.

Its an "ok" game. But not outstanding.
I like the game but it's a 6.5-7/10 

Not surprised really. Just not enough depth to give it that bit more.
Sorry but, cyberpunk has way more going on in hand-crafted environments and can hit 60fps on consoles.
Seems correct to me
Personally really liked starfield but its far from a game of the year. 

some gameplay aspects arent thought of.  the many loading screens that pull your immersion from the game. the idea is great just poorly executed.
Don't understand why it would? It's pretty poor overall, the very dated technology and dreadful story didn't help it. Very rushed and a complete mess.
I think RE4 shouldn't be on there and I absolutely love that game. That said, my next game to add would probably be FF16.

Starfield is pretty mid in most ways. It's still really good, but not by any means GOTY. Maybe it'd make the list of noms in a weak year.
Honestly, because it doesn’t deserve to be. It’s a mid game in a year full of bangers
Even with less competition, it’s definitely not a qualifier for game of the year. It’s not exactly beloved either, which is a shame for Bethesda. But you only have to play it to know it’s not a masterpiece..
Only BG3 deserves to be the goty tbh
Is anyone surprised. i have over 5 days logged, But starfield is not even close to zelda or baldurs gate
And we all know who the winner is.
It didn't deserve it, this year was stacked
That's because the game is outdated. The wider gaming world made this extremely apparent. 

Bethesda need to up their game considerably.
Bg3 ftw
Unsurprised
Expected cause the games bog standard imo
My thoughts are that they are all better games.
How can a re-make be nominated?
The Game Awards are utterly meaningless tripe. Even despite that Starfield just wasn't up to par compared to the games on offer this year. Just what it is, you need to round out your game and polish the results better to compare or aim for a different category.
struggled to try and like it for a week since I love Skyrim and fallout 4.
I'm done with the ugly garbage.
they've made the sale and I think it's boring as fuck.
Have you played it ? Or any of the nominees  ?.. 

If you have it should be clear  why,

I enjoy starfield for what it is ,but it is not ground breaking or innovative  and should not get a nominee just because past titles by Bethesda  did deserve their acclaim
How would a game made in 2023 that only gets up to 30FPS on next gen consoles get nominated for GOTY? 🤣 come on man
Yeah, cause it's terrible. And I'm a long time Bethesda fan.
Bethesda needs a wake up call. They’ve been aggressively, defiantly mediocre going back to Fallout 4 and especially Fallout 76.
Not surprised. I still play Skyrim to this day but struggled to play the last few main missions of Starfield. It’s just.. not a great game..
Did it even get any nominations at all?
Understandable. It’s a fine game overall but compared to its competition it wasn’t close. Played until I hit level 40 and realised it was just the same content repeating and went back to BG3
Yeah so many reviewers showed their ass with those 10s. It’s truly insane that a single outlet gave it a 10/10. And I enjoy the game, I don’t hate it. But giving Starfield a 10/10 in a stacked year like this makes it appear especially absurd.
Ya all of these reviewers are just corporate shills. Bethesda pays you for a review and sends you the game for free. If you’re like this game sucks you’re definitely not getting another review opportunity, so there’s every incentive to just say the every game is great
Think it’s at least an 8
Agreed I love starfield and been really enjoying it but I know it's not a 10/10 game and not surprised in the least it's not nominated.

Playing any of the other games they are just more polished and deserve to be nominated... Although I think everyone can agree it's going to be baulders gate 3...

If that doesn't win then I'll be surprised.
Same. Maybe one more year in the hopper and it would have been there. Either a bit more fleshed out with content  or just less bugs and it could’ve been truly amazing. It’s still good and fun but this wasn’t the year to release at 75% baked.
Yea. It isn't bold enough. Things like fuel and base building are shallow. NG+ doesn't fit well for the game.

I'm not a game designer, but there are quite a few things I question the design of.
honestly it's totally killed whatever interest i had left the tes franchise because i played skyrim to death to the point, where i have an ungodly amount of time in it and realised i barely like anything about it at all, like it's not a bad game by any means, but it's not the game i thought it was as a kid that's for sure, all i ever do know is install it maybe twice a year at most play maybe 10 hours of flower picking, bounty hunting and larping as a merchant and eventually uninstall for space, and then they made starfield which had every single thing i slowly grew to dislike about skyrim but cranked to 10 and put front and centre, so i just found the game mindlessly boring, like none of it felt bad, just so souless, i get more enjoyment out of pretty much any game that came before minus the online ones, atleast even though i hated them as a kid because the only one i had was fallout nv and couldn't stand the fact it looked so awful to my small brain, my love for the tes franchise was slowly replaced with the fallout games, hoping i don't play them to death like i did skyrim, plus oblivion is still fucking great
I'm scared for ES6, hopefully Bethesda learns from this release
Then next time they better make a better rpg if the y cant win the title.
Bg3 has endless choice, starfield has zero choice. I have 250hrs and love/hate it, but understand what it is. It's not even an rpg, everytime I tried to complete a quest a different way it didn't work, there was only one option, or another semi option that will make everyone hate you for 10seconds then forget. Zero choice or consequences which is what I need for rpgs.

Starfield is a fun action adventure game with light roleplay elements though.
BG3 winning the award for best RPG is like the most sure thing ever in the history of sure things.
They're lucky they even got nominated for that. Calling this an RPG is a joke, there is nothing RP about it. 

The character background has close to 0 influence to the story line or dialogue option.

NPCs never sleep and shops are open 24/7/365.

Quests/dialog decision have 0 influence on the opinion of NPCs about you.

I haven't been this excited for a game before its release in years and it was such a let down.
And even if it was *somehow* in the running, there’s no way it’s winning. The competition is stiff.
I didnt really see anything new introduced to starfield we havent already seen in Fallout 4. They refined their systems but all other nominees pushed the envelope of what games can do this year. Starfield did not.

Loading...
That's what bothers me the most. It's like Mass Effect Andromeda. You've now used the idea up. And theres so many weird design decisions that make the game shallow.
Imo the game is clearly not finished, many systems needed more things added to them, the UI is terrible, the maps are terrible, not enough random generated POIs, a lot of the quests are a bit boring. And they bragged that the game was finished a year ago and they spent it polishing the game, wtf did they do this whole year? I cringe hard at what the game would have looked if they launched 1 year ago.
This. There is some deepness here and there, but overall it's way too bland. I enjoy it, but it bothers that everything is so sterile, starting from the visuals all the way to dialog and how nothing really affects anything. It has all the pieces but they played everything safe.
I agree. So many features to explore but no real benefit to exploring them. They created a million different things to do to improve your character/play through but you only need to 10 of them to be successful.
Wasted potential is probably the most accurate description of the game I can think of.

I did like it, but I didn't get anywhere close to the 100's of hours I played in the fallout titles. Even fallout 4, that is widely considered the weakest in the series, outdid starfield by a longshot in my humble opinion.
EXACTLY - like an unfinished uncut diamond, there was so much more the game could have been that bethesda just fell flat on.

The load screens/times, the dead feeling NPCs, the lackluster combat, hideous traveling mechanisms, etc.
dude dont get me started on the fast travel simulator that is space. 1-5 perks revolve around your ship, and you can sink dozens of hours customizing it.....and then do nothing with it.
Bethesda is the only studio that can release an utterly mediocre game and have people be fine with it because other people will fix it.
Brutal but true tbh
Wow this subs attitude really has changed since it came out.  I do agree with you, it didn’t make any strives forward.
I can say the game is ok and so far I haven't stalled out.


Game of the Year? Hell nah
lol say that on twitter and you’re destroyed by xbots
Finally, someone said it. The fan boys can now sleep tight.
It's the first BGS game I've just uninstalled without even making an effort to make the most out of it. Ran, I think, 60 hours or so? Had some fun here and there, but was overwhelmingly disappointed and bored most of the time. 

Which is saying something because I've got old dad gamer brain. It doesn't take much to activate my neurons.

Saw that my game drive was getting full last week, so I started moving some dusty game files to my backup drive on my NAS. Got down to the "S"es, which included Starfield, had the passing thought of "well I haven't really finished it yet", but ultimately decided I didn't **want** to finish it. And even though I had plenty of room on the server for the game files, I just uninstalled and opened up another 120 gigs to be used by something that's actually worth the disk space.
It feels a lot smaller than skyrim, content-wise.
Yep, same. 

- land on planet, explore one of the dozen copy/paste ruins

- loot all the exact stuff in the exact places

- find a planet that’s interesting and full of potential

- immediately be let down by how shallow the storyline was,

- play the same shitty mini game and kill the same shitty enemy for each power

- find all the artifacts

- reset all your progress in NG+

- repeat
Yeah same! I still have Skyrim installed but because it’s small game size I keep it installed “just in case”
I was shocked by how bland it is.
Glad this sub finally seems to be coming around to that.
It was a lot of fun for me as a gamepass player, but if I paid $80 for it my opinion would be drastically different.
I swear if BGS fucks up TES6, then this company is truly dead. It's my favorite franchise and I love the lore of Elder Scrolls.
[removed]
That feature bothers me so much, why did they do it. To make people nostalgic for Oblivion? In oblivion the face tech was actually impressive for its time
Let's not forget Bethesda wanted to ship starfield 16 months ago when it had even less content and polish a d Microsoft had to step in and deny them.

Bethesda doesn't give a fuck.
No, they won't. 

They could have learned with Fallout 4 when they lost GOTY to Witcher 3. They could have learned with Fallout 76. I really doubt that they'll learn with Starfield too.

They need to fire senior devs like Emil Pagliarulo & whoever is in charge of the character department at a bare minimum. However they won't.
Damn straight. They have been getting away with being lazy too long now. About time they get called out for it.
[deleted]
Bethesda needs to know that they *could* have made a game the deserves it - all the pieces were there - but they chose not to.
Im surprised how dratic opinions changed about this game. I remember this sub for a week straight just praising everything about this game. Then the huge negative downpour came 1 month after of straight negativity to the point that the mods essentially banned most "review" posts cuz most were negative lmao.

&#x200B;

Opinion seems to have stabilized and it seems people seem to accept that starfield is a pretty mediocre with tons of modding potential.
All starfield does is limit you. All of the quests basically have one option you should choose, and it doesn't really matter anyway. Everyone is essential, even unnamed guards in certain places. I've done all the faction and main quests multiple times. Everytime i tried to get creative with how I completed a mission, I had to backtrack and do it exactly the vanilla way.
I agree. Makes me think of Subnautica and how you had to research new suits and vehicles to get to some areas (e.g. deep areas or lava zones). I wish Starfield had stuff like that.
For BGS there is no 'wake up call' possible unless Microsoft manhandles, disbands and reorganize them. They live in their own very sheltered world, regardless who the owner is. See the recent Nesmith video interview, it's quite revealing about their design process, vetting, Todd veto-ing EVERYTHING, studio culture. They don't take 'lessons' from anyone, or else they would have improved a lot of things after Fallout 4 or Fallout 76 criticism. 

The fact that BG3 stole their cake and ate it this year will have the same 'motivation' effect as Witcher 3 butchering Fallout 4 many years ago: zero.
BG3 losing would be the biggest upset in the history of the awards.  It wasn't even the game I had the most fun with this year but I know a masterpiece when I see one.
Everybody was glazing all over BG3 like it was the second coming of jesus and I was yeah sure whatever. Bought it on a whim to see what the hype was about and after about 3 hours I was like yup this is the best RPG I have ever played.
Well think LOZ will put up some competition cause lets face it its nintendo and there are more nintendo fanboys than you realize also it is a pretty good and finnished game. But in the end think BG3 will win yes
Had the same thought a few weeks ago. It's really ironic that both Larian and CDPR somewhat carefully arranged their release dates to not get squished by Starfield. But in reality, both BG3 and Cyberpunk 2.0/PL only emphasized how aggressively mid Starfield turned out to be.
>The irony is BG3 moved release date to avoid Starfield

Do we know that for certain?
Also, remember how Skyrim was featured at basically every Bethesda announcement conference thing for over a decade? Starfield won't be featured like that, and it's because the quality isn't there. There are dedicated fans, sure, but that doesn't matter if their game can't appeal to the masses like Skyrim did. That game was truly revolutionary in terms of how rich it was. Starfield is poverty Skyrim.
Honestly I'd say it's less that Bethesda dropped in quality and more that they haven't improved. Graphics aside, Starfield feels like a game that would have been an easy GOTY if it had released a decade ago. 

But it's not a decade ago. It's now. Standards have risen.

Skyrim was so popular that it caused Bethesda to be cursed by their own hubris.
Thank christ, someone saying how it is it's about goddamn time I've been scrolling for 5mins, all I've seen up until this "its an alright game but its not goty" no, if its unplayable for a good chunk of the players bc of bugs then it's not a good game
No GOTY edition for you!
It manages to be inferior to Fallout 4 in many aspects...
I feel the exact same way. I booted up Fallout New Vegas after all these years and am loving playing though it again. Glitches and graphics aside, there are so many fun dialog options and choices, the world feels so much more alive in a game released in 2010 versus Starfield which feels so lackluster.
OmG!!!1!! Did you even put in the hours??? Let me know once you reach 1,050 hours, that’s when the game starts!!1!                     /s
i thought so too but man, the production quality of alan wake 2 hit me by surprise. it is REALLY good.
Redfall wasn't even that big of a disappointment. Idk how anyone thought it would be good at all.

Ppl were somewhat or quite hyped for Starfield. Then they released a very mid game with nothing to do. Sadly, 99% of it won't get fixed. Even modding can't fix everything, which takes time and, currently, only on pc.

When you play CP77 and BG3, you realize how mega oudated Starfield is. It's like they are playing catchup with the gaming industry
I love to shit on CE as much as the next guy, but consider that Mass Effect managed FAR more compelling narratively and, well, role-playing, with a FAR more limited engine. 
Sure, it's not the same style of game, but it shows the impact of strong fundamental narrative and game design. Yeah, sure the presidium is actually a tiny gamespace, but hell if it doesn't *feel* like the seat of galactic power.
The better writing and quest design is what needed most for Beth imo, doesn't matter if they changed to UE5 and we still got the same dude that think going through lights to get power is acceptable.

Just look at what Obsidian can do with the CE in New Vegas, Beth need to up their game
It's cute that it only got a nomination for "Best RPG"

Gee. Good thing no universally praised industry defining RPGs came out this year.
they are rolling around vats of Microsoft buy out and starfield pre-order money... i doubt they really care
Bethesda does not care about Reddit or TGA. They care about how much the game is selling and moving Gamepass. Which it is
And it wasn't even close
"the biggest most epic space game you can imagine" or whatever. Todd's always exaggerated but he really liked the smell of his own farts on this one.
> Many being old issues they still refuse to fix.

Don't forget the issues they'd solved in the past but then regressed on in Starfield! Investing in vendors to increase their cash, removable mods for weapons and armor, mods for melee weapons, arm and leg slots for armor, the ability to track individual resources instead of highlighting all of them that are used in whatever you're trying to craft, the ability to craft ammo, bottomless storage at outposts, two-way links between outposts, the ability to store building pieces to use later instead of deleting them (or selling them, for ship parts), the ability to scrap things, a survival system, companions moving when you run into them so they don't block tight passages (thank you video at the top of the sub this morning for reminding me), perks that let companions be immune to damage from the player, the ability to modify robot companions...

You'd think that the one advantage to upgrading an old engine instead of moving to a new one would be that it's easy to implement mechanics from your past games, but apparently not.
so, like the water in starfailed.
My stance as well. I love the game but I'm the *exact* target demographic, and even I've seen too many disappointing or underdeveloped features.

IMO a GOTY title should be a paragon: a near-flawless execution that introduces a new industry-defining innovation or level of standard to the genre or industry as a whole. And it needs to be that at launch, not months/years later.

Starfield is none of that, not in its current form.

(Tangent but by my own standards Spider-Man 2and RE4 should be taken off the list. TotK is debatable as in some ways it feels like just a v2.0 of BotW, but it also introduced a ton of innovation between Ultrahand/vehicles, the Sky, and the Depths)
> Starfield is like a giant Skyrim mod that puts the whole game in space.

It even keeps most elements.

- Dragonborn -> Starborn   
- Shouts -> Powers
- Guilds -> Fractions

I still like it, but creative is something else.
I haven’t played it yet but it seems like Alan Wake has a lot of heart, too. But it certainly won’t win. I think BG3 is going to win, I hope so at least. It might be the most impressive feat in gaming history, especially coming from an indie developer. It’s a truly wonderful game, and the guys at Larian really deserve it.
They're gonna sweep and they deserve it
RPG
On my second play thru and I’m still finding totally new stuff in BG3 I never came across. The game is wild
What the game needed most was focus. It’s great to get a wide selection of activities, but they come across more as content fluff when they’re not fully realized. The game has the first two ingredients in about a dozen different recipes, but none make a meal.
>Maybe one more year in the hopper and it would have been there.

I disagree.

The problems with Starfield are fundamental design decisions such as the dated dialogue system (dialogue checklist vs an actual conversation), the use of procedural generation (same buildings copy/pasted), the lack of meaningful exploration rewards due to that generation, and the lack of seamless planet-to-space exploration etc.

No amount of time in the oven was going to change these things and these are what was criticized by the media and players.
Honestly, I'd be winning to argue that Starfield did release as a fully finished package, it's just that what was finished in that package simply isn't up to par with what was expected.

A fully baked hot dog bun isn't going to win in a French baguette competition.
Amount of content is honestly fine, it’s the depth of the content. Starfield is very tame and as much as I love Bethesda, their games are getting more and more tame.
The amount of content isn’t the issue, it’s the quality of the content
Idk, a lot of the issues with Starfield come down to core design imo.
Idk I think they could have designed the side missions and companions a lot better. I put some good hours in but got pretty bored after a couple weekends. Not sure if I’ll come back
Hard to say. The writing and the overall senses and types quests in this game are some of the worst I’ve seen from Todd Howard games.
Grand theft auto 6 may be in the running next year? I’d imagine that’s going to be stiff competition.
Nah. A year or two more in production and it would have looked even worse against its future competition. The game often looks like it came out in 2016 already, so having it release in 2025 without completely redoing it in a different engine wouldn't have made it any better.

The Creation Engine is just far too outdated.
One more year and they would have dodged 6 amazing games. It would have more to do with that than anything. There are even better games than Starfield that didn't make it.
It’s like they focused on the wrong things. The way objects look in orbit, the planet cycles, the lighting… these are all really cool and polished and most players are never once going to even notice as they fast travel from location to location.

Meanwhile the minute-to-minute gameplay? Basically the same exact loop as Fallout 4 but with less incentive to explore.

The story? Half-baked chosen one narrative with some rudimentary philosophy and many worlds theory thrown in to make it feel smarter than it is.

The faction quests? Take famous sci-fi movie, strip out all the unique characters and elements, lengthen the plot to cover multiple quests. Alternatively, take a Skyrim faction and reskin it to be “In Spaaaaaace.”

The world building? It’s literally just Firefly but the Browncoats won and there are (unintelligent) aliens.

The level design? Ripped straight from Fallout down to everything outside of New Atlantis feeling empty and decrepit as if it all got nuked… except it didn’t all get nuked! So it shouldn’t feel empty and decrepit!

It’s all shockingly derivative, and not in a fun winking kind of way, in a “We honestly didn’t think about this much beyond making a generic space game” kind of way.
That's the best to way to put it. It's a great game in its own right, but compared to some of Bethesda's recent titles and the goty contenders this year they really wound down the scope of the project. For something that took this long to develop and was so hyped up it felt like they could have gone a touch further in places. I feel they're keeping the good stuff for ES6.
I think the game was originally intended to be significantly more hardcore, which is reflected in the existence of a lot of the in-game systems.  Then at some point into development they shifted focus to make it more casual, without removing the skeletons of the hardcore systems.  Now we have a bunch of shallow mechanics that are basically meaningless.  I wouldn’t be surprised if they continue to build on these systems and mechanics and eventually release a significantly difficult hardcore/survival mode.

I foresee a game where you slowly move around the star systems.  Must build outposts to obtain resources (fuel) to move onto the next star.  You won’t be able to jump multiple times in a row to get across the entire system.  Environmental effects that actually impair you and require proper gear in order to traverse without immediately dying.  Things like that.
Or just come out in a year with no good RPGs
A rpg would be a good starting point, to be a nominee.
The whole "NG+ lets you go back and do things differently!" thing really fell flat for me when I realized most quests don't have the option for you to do things differently.
I did the ryujin quest quite late when already committed to Andreja, and failed the persuasion check to get a key card, couldn't see another way around it so I figured I'd try putting a 4 inch hole in his head with a starborn weapon before save scumming to pop a Hippolyta.

It worked but Andreja was incredibly upset with me, dropped me as companion and ran away for all of 2 lines of dialog, I promised I'd do my best not to vaporise anyone's brain again and then she went back to "Do you want me to say you make me deliriously happy? Because you do".

It really needs just a little bit of inertia on that negative interaction with some extra dialog and some better options than "promise I won't brutally murder anyone in cold blood again maybe"
>Bg3 has endless choice, starfield has zero choice.

Could you imagine them even trying to program The Grove questline into the Creation Engine
Tons of RPGs don’t have choices. Final Fantasy is an RPG series, and it has always had less choice than Starfield does.
> Bg3 has endless choice, starfield has zero choice

Yes! This is exactly what drove me nuts questing in Starfield. I save scummed a few times to see dialogue trees and they never impacted the damn outcome. ZERO choice.
Hell of a year for games. My poor wallet!
Let's be 100% honest, it's a race for second, BG3 has taken the gaming world by the balls the same way Elden Ring did last year.

Spider-Man 2 and Tears of the Kingdom MIGHT have a snowballs chance in hell to make it, but both of those games were carried by hype and underdelivered in a lot of areas.

Whereas Baldurs Gate 3 came in with a steel chair and took the internet by storm.
Weapon modification was actually worse in Starfield because the mods can't be removed into your inventory for later reapplication, like you could in FO4.
>I didnt really see anything new introduced to starfield we havent already seen in Fallout 4.

They took away the companion wheel and the ability to swim and made the gun modification and outpost system somehow worse than Fo4
 Lot of em don't even feel all that worked on, base building has got to be the most pointless thing they kept from FO4.  The most impactful thing I've noticed has been the gunplay, which feels great in Starfield when I'm not getting lag from scoping in.
I really hope it will be a wakeup call for Todd that it is not 2011 anymore and games need something more to offer than big world
It could be argued that a lot of systems are worse than FO4
Mass Effect Andromeda was exactly what I feared when they announced starfield.

Space is such a hard environment for a sandbox style RPG. It feels like you're either forced to limit the zones you can explore, so you can properly build hand placed assets and do environmental story telling; or you have to do large procedurally generated worlds.

The first option done improperly makes the exploration feel restricted. 'Why can't I make a base over there, why can't I land on the other side of this planet'.

The second option usually results in big expanses of cookie-cutter type environments. Here are the same 20 PoI's on different worlds. Why do all these planets even have buildings, Who's setting up all these mines, where do the resources go.

Ultimately, I think space doesn't play to any of bethesda's key strengths. I *like* starfield, but it's not game of the year worthy. I don't think it would beat out Skyrim or Fallout if compared against them, and it's definitely not GotY this year with such a stacked list of great games.
That's probably the best example by far actually. I don't have any hopes for the next Mass Effect game either
I personally had a much better time with Andromeda at launch than I did with Starfield. It may have been a shallow imitation of the previous Mass Effect games, but it also unironically had the best gameplay and combat in the series.

Yeah I was surprised when after I put down Starfield I was craving Fallout 4.
I dream of a mod overhaul that centers around survival, and makes you fall in love with your ship because you've been through the shit with it. Performing surface repairs in an ice storm, cleaning the windshield (idk), struggling to stay fueled and hoping you don't drift infinitely into space, it goes on. The relationship between the pilot and the ship should be much more special than is currently let on in Starfield.
It's funny, I've heard people downplay this aspect but this really, really seems like such a fundamental mistake. I could honestly get most of what I want out of a game like this just through the simple act of flying my ship from planet to planet
Shoot space ships and loot them just like any other npc by pressing E! The space sim aspect of Starfield left _a lot_ to be desired.

Eh this is different. Every BGS game from Morrowind through Fallout 4 was pretty good on release. They then became great with mods.

Starfield is unfortunately just mediocre on release.
It has the illusion of depth. For the first 10-15 hours, you think it's deep and it feels like you are just scratching the surface of what's possible. Then you quickly realize you've already seen what's possible and already tapped most of the fun out of it, except there is still like 30 hours of repetitive storyline and gameplay left.
This game has **A LOT** of cool ideas, almost all of which ultimately aborted mid-way, delivered as-is. Mix-in piss-poor polishing **across the board** and you have coal in-lieu of what could have been a gem.
It actually went backwards. The 1000 planets bullshit made it feel like Daggerfall. Mile wide, inch deep.
I'm glad that it has shifted. People need to take their Bethesda fanboy/girl goggles off. The games have been getting watered down since Skyrim, but nobody wants to call out the issues as dating that far back, just more recently with Fallout 76 and maybe Fallout 4.

This is coming from someone who's spent 100's upon 100's of hours in every main Bethesda title since Oblivion, not including 76. I've spent 70 hours so far in Starfield.
The stages of grief

Coping > acceptance

Or something like that haha
Honeymoon period is over. All criticism was downvoted heavily on release.
It does a great job of hyping itself up and then under-delivering.  It makes such a big fuss about exploration and discovery… and then dumps you into a universe where literally every star system already has a human presence (and has clearly been there for some time). I was excited to finally get to play a proper space exploration RPG… only to discover it was Fallout 4 in space with some gameplay elements brazenly ripped off from *No Man’s Sky.*
Because it is. Starfield, despite being their most vast game, has less unique quests, locations and NPCs than vanilla Skyrim.
Content aside, the size of this game feels almost claustrophobic in comparison to Skyrim. I know that—on paper, at least—it’s way larger than Skyrim, but it never actually felt like that to me. There’s only ever something going on in like 0.01% of the game and so I always felt intended on keeping me in that tiny sliver of what Starfield had to offer. In Skyrim, I love how you could head North, East, South or West—from pretty much anywhere in the game—and arrive at something interesting. That felt like a real, natural world to me; whereas, in Starfield, I never felt like I could leave New Atlantis for the same reasons. Instead, I felt like I was forced within these selective regions that were separated by what essentially felt like corridors (traveling in your ship).
I didn't even get any of the powers beyond the first one.  I looked at a guide once and realized I was on the last mission of the main storyline.  I stopped and played a couple faction storylines but they just weren't capitivating.  I never built a ship or an outpost because I never needed to do it and I thought I was just at the beginning of the game.  The main storyline was super short and the rest of the stuff that you could do in the game became pointless after I beat it.  I went back to BG3 and Zelda.  It sucks because the game could have been a lot more.
The ol' just in case games have saved me a few times when my internet was out for a long time.  It's amazing what becomes a first string game in desperation.

"aw sick, solitaire comes with win11" -4th day with no internet
I just got so bored of loading screens. Made it to level 30 and got bored of impulsively checking my phone out of boredom every few minutes
It's undoubtedly one of the games of all time.
Me too. It was almost violent to say otherwise in the beginning.
I will always defend the game against people who have never played it lol. But compared to other bethesda games, I will take the worlds and lots of elder scrolls and fallout games ANY DAY over Starfield. I bought the deluxe edition and wanted this game to be everything everyone told me it would be, it was just not. It looked pretty good, and definitely had better shooting and combat that I look forward to seeing in future fallout or elder scrolls games, but everything else is meh
I don't have much hope they won't fuck it up.

I think they've lost sight of what made early TES games good.

Nobody ever played Elder scrolls games for the combat.  They play them for the crazy setting and lore.  But their past two major releases (FO4, Starfield) very much emphasized smooth combat but had generic boring writing.

If the trend continues, TES6 may be stuffed full of boring half baked fantasy writing and smooth but still not actually fun combat.
I would have been happy with actual conversations instead of someone you pass just randomly spouting something to you, "They say Jim-Bob likes to get down with the Sickness during the hours of.." 

Something Cyberpunk did pretty well is people having actual conversations, hell, even Spiderman 2 had that.
Zenimax must have been so thrilled to sell them to Microsoft.
That was their "just buy an xbox 360 if you don't want always online with the xbox one" moment lol
Honestly that was the comment that made me give up on the game. The performance was atrocious on launch, and there's seemingly no good reason for it, with games that look way better and are more seamless performing 3-4 times better on the same system. Pretending like it's not an issue just makes them look completely clueless.
The next stage of acceptance; mods aren't going to save this.
Limiting may be wrong way to phrase, they are terrified of locking the player out of content. It’s most dumb in this game with the NG+ mechanic
It did before launch. But it was a brutal experience so thry toned it down.
I think the scale of the games has simply eclipsed their design process. Todd cannot manage the entire game. The regression of mechanics is most worrying. 

FO4 did settlements and crafting much better than Starfield. Quests were better too, you have to actually choose a side, and get locked out of others.
This so much. Honestly I don't expect everyone to consider bg3 the most fun game they've played all year. Everyone's got different tastes, and bg3 is definitely catered to a certain audience. But I think nobody can deny how unparalleled of a project it was.
I did the same. Didn't really know anything about dnd, but  saw the trailers and it reminded me of dragon age origins, so thought I'd give it a try. Now 200+ hours into this game, about to start a 4th character and still not bored. Best game I've played in years, maybe ever.
Actually they said that they moved the release date so that people would have time to also play Starfield and Phantom LIberty
Well 2 answers. Absolutely, yes - it was. And no, Larian would not publicly say that - so we'll never be "certain".
Yeah " from the studio that brought you Starfield" has a different ring to it post launch.
The quality of Skyrim compared to past titles is debatable. The game mechanics and lore became a lot less complex but the freedom and arcadey fun was cranked up to compensate.

Everything post Skyrim has been a pretty clear step back though, imo.
Don’t worry, Bethesda will still find reasons to re-release the game 5 times
And Skyrim. I put over 1000 hours in console Skyrim. One playthrough doing all quests on Starfield and I'm done, but the game is supposed to encourage NG+ play.
New Vegas is so much more fun and engaging than Starfield. Better characters, better writing, and a lot, LOT more player choice and freedom.
Not surprising since Obsidian and many former fallout 1/2 devs worked on new vegas. Shows what bethesda games could be with better role playing mechanics and stories
But the thing about BG3 isn’t that it’s got great production values or it’s a truly great RPG. It is. 

BG3 goes a lot further, it’s a game that will define a whole generation of its own genre, a masterpiece that can’t just be emulated. 

Not until someone else spends $300M without putting any limits on the writers. Alan Wake didn’t do that. BG3 is like ten different games all at once, it’s flabbergasting to experience. 

It reminds me of the first time I played Dark Souls and I could feel in an instant that gaming was about to change.
Woah there's an Alan wake TWO!? I've been living under a boulder lmao. I'll have to give that game a gander.
Redfall was purely based on my love for Arkane, but that was an utter disaster.

What you've said there, hits the nail on the head. When you compare it to the competition, it's not even close. 

99% of people commenting here are saying "it's alright, but...". I guarantee you no-one talks about BG3 like that. 

It saddens me that this is what they served up to be honest. I was really excited for starfield.
eh, im sure the higher ups are in hot water pete hines got out at the perfect time lol, Dude said i want no part in the shit show that will be TES6.
I hate the writing and quest options. everything is barely pg-13, even the sex innuendos are worse in Disney movies. There are no alternative routes for any quest, everyone is essential in a mature rated game, most of the dialogue is weird out of place exposition for the character, which ruins the immersion because all the npcs don't seem close to actual people. Fo4 at least had schedules to walk around and do stuff.
Well it won't win that.
Can’t agree enough with this statement. It doesn’t matter if we can go to all those systems and planets if there is very little to do there. 

Mass effect gives you multiple planets to explore in depth with their own stories. Bethesda giving their twist on that in terms of scope would have been beneficial
The central story is just underwhelming. It felt like just another one of the faction questions.
This is a common issue for Bethesda, more focus on broad scope and scale, less on depth.
You know how some people will order a pizza with everything on it and the pizzeria will just give you a supreme or something? Starfield feels like they actually threw every topping on there but only half-baked it.
Agreed. 

Ironically the game would have been better if they shrunk the scope.
Instead of 1000 empty planets, we could have had 15-20 planets filled with side quests that are the quality of the main cities.

Maybe the procedural generation will pay off for years with DLC, but for now it holds the game back from GOTY status.
The generated buildings is what got me. I love exploring and finding old buildings and reading the lore there. I love finding lore. The buildings didnt have anything in them but a few leveled enemies and some random low level loot. Not to mention there was only like 5 buildings over and over which also killed exploration. And with no quick way to move around the planets and vast nothingness between anything of interest there was just no point. My first playthrough i managed to look past that as i was obsessed with the ship building but you didn't get to keep your ship so there was just really no point after that
[deleted]
Yeah, I fear, if not outright presume, all the main flaws are baked in. CK isn't going to fix this. Those that like it might like it more, but it's fundamentally flawed from the ground up.

Required mention that I was a fanboy from the day it was announced, and then I played it.
Agreed.

The fundamental problem is the game design and system themselves.

It’s not a matter of needing more time. They just missed the mark.
The same buildings copy and pasted is the *opposite* of procedural generation, unless the procedure is just glorified coin flip. Procedural generation would have random hab modules connected by hallways with some randomized content types and simple rules to avoid dead ends. This would have been both easy to implement and much more fun.  This is done in any number of open world games and it's baffling that they didn't do it here.
When they announced procedurally generated planets my heart dropped. I absolutely hate that type of game and it being introduced into starfield was just a huge blow. I tried to stay positive at the beginning but as I sink more hours into the game it started to show it's true colors.
Funny you mention the dialogue checklist when the likely winner, BG3 has a far more dialogue check list then starfield. Starfield simply doesnt hold up to other rpgs that well. The writing is sub par, the choices to play how you want are even more restrictive then fo4, the whole procedural generation stuff while cool in theory led to massive empty areas. The quests themselves are boring. Almost all of them are just go fetch x. Receive award.
Nailed. Where is the weird stuff? Where are the insane things. The real creepy stuff. The funny stuff.
> Starfield is very tame and as much as I love Bethesda, their games are getting more and more tame.

Makes me think of concerns about creative outlets noted in the past.

Fahrenheit 451, Captain Beatty:

>The bigger your market . . . the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did.

>It didn’t come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time
Gotcha. I haven’t played a BGS game since Morrowind on Xbox so my opinion is skewed a bit. On the bright side if o go backwards now I apparently have a lot of great games of theirs to play, lol. 

But yeah the GOTY snub hopefully kicks them into gear as a wake up call that gamers want more.
Nope. It's both. When you explore dozens and dozens of planets and see the exact same cookie cutter abandoned listening posts or robotics labs, with the same loot and enemies in the exact same rooms, it gets old FAST.
It's both, honestly. Starfield has less unique content than vanilla Skyrim, and the quality isn't anywhere near as good either.
Same here, and then decided to go try BG3 due to all the hype (despite never having been into that style of game) and the difference was stark. 

Love Starfield for what it is, but it's just not GOTY quality.
Truth be told, after my third playthrough without getting into the boring NG+, Starfield lacks quality in the writing of the main mission and the development of main characters. As for the cast of companions, Bethesda didn't want to take any chances and didn't even bother to offer a companion with characteristics with a gray moral alignment, for those who wanted to follow the pirate line.
Considering Rockstar’s past release schedule GTA 6 is probably not coming out until early-mid 2025.
That would be crazy if it comes out that quick after announcement. Honestly if devs across the board knock it out of the park two years in a row, I won’t be mad one bit. 

I’m not sure I’ll ever catch up just with all the stellar games from the past couple year. I haven’t gotten to play Eldin ring, BG3 or Armored core. :(
1) They outsourced about everything.

2) Greatly increasing the size of the studio in a short amount of time is a management and communication nightmare .

3) The engine is probably a huge bottleneck. They probably lost tons of time because of it.  

TESVI is compromised. I'm expecting to get a meh-tier game.
I don't think it's the graphics that really held it back. In my experience the gameplay just wasn't all that fun.
Intricately rendered 3D designs of every single inventory item that serves absolutely zero functional purpose, yet inexplicably takes up 50% of the menu screen? Hell yeah!

Functional menu UI that allows you to efficiently access, sort, and manage your inventory? Fuck no!
Honestly I think not having star trek style alien races hurt starfield a bit.

The promise of a game where the complex geopolitical and religious disagreements vary along alien races is perfect for a bethesda game, especially since that's just elder scrolls plus spaceships, which is basically star trek.

Instead we got two kinds of cults, space atheists, pirates, Space UN and Space not-UN. All of them being human.

Yeah there's alien artifacts, but these are basically just macguffins with what I assume is a multiversal twist at the end (which worst case scenario is just an lore excuse for new game plus)

I might have lost interest in playing but I do want to see where they take the DLC.

If Skyrim but in space is too expansive a scope, maybe they should've just set a game on an alien world instead.
They might be doing that but sadly this game has left me less excited for ES6.
I have my doubts about ES 6... even more so if the creative team is the same.
I'd say Starfield has some good mechanics but is underbaked in just about all aspects. The quest design for 90% of the quests I've played was completely one-dimensional and predictable. The planets have no depths. The points of interest that are really good can be counted on one had. The soundtrack is... fine. The graphics are a mixed bag, amazing in some places and just really bad in others. They have spread their butter to thinly on too much bread.

They should have done one solar system, with well designed places you could go. No need for random generation, give used fixed maps in certain places and make them interesting. (and don't even get me started on the followers)

Starfield doesn't feel like a living world.
Keeping the good stuff for ES6 seems like a terrible idea when you could just make a massive new IP
Yeah this was actually confirmed in an interview. They thought most players would think it was too tedious and not enjoyable, so they changed it pretty late in development.
Ah the ol Dragon Age Inquisition method
Or just come out in a year with no ~~good~~ RPGs
I like how you get a starborn text option that's basically  "yeah yeah I know all this" and the NPC stills goes through all the quest dialogue anyway
Seriously.

NG+ was the perfect vehicle to enable endless replay value, and yet the game itself seems *adamantly opposed* to the concept.

* Choices are almost entirely non-existent, and even the ones that are there barely affect things.
* A big chunk of the game is in crafting custom starships, outposts, weapons and armor...and then NG+ throws all of that in the trash. No reusable blueprints, no saved ships, no nothing. All that work down the tube.
* Then there's the whole planet/resource scanning thing, which is *unbelievably* tedious and for some ungodly reason *doesn't* carry over between resets. I can somewhat get it from an in-universe perspective, but no amount of lore makes it worth doing once, let alone more than once.
Yep, they basically give each faction quests two endings to try and make things feel different, but it doesn’t make up for the fact >!your character has memories of every single event that happens!<

It would have been cooler if there were NG+ exclusive faction endings.
What do you mean? You GET to repeat everything all over again 10+ times, how fun is that??
I played SF fresh off completing BG3, every time I got what I thought was a choice to make, I looked it up afterwards. With only one exception, the answer to what the choices mean was either absolutely nothing, or picking between which item you want as a reward. 

The only remotvely tangible consequence was to the crimson fleet finale, which was just picking which space base you wanted to stick around.
My favourite irony is the universe where you, have become a lunatic and murdered all of Constellation.

It's ironic as YOU can't actually do this due to NPCs being non killable...lol
The companion stuff drove me absolutely nuts. Stupid Sam Coe getting mad at everything. What shit characters.
Is it an engine limitation? Past Creation Engine games had some quests that had multiple pathways and altered the world. It does that a fuckton of staff time I bet.
There's nothing so complex about the Grove questline that the engine couldn't handle it. Would it be difficult? Sure. The Skyrim Civil War was notoriously messy.

But even outside of that, Bethesda games have always had quests with choices that permanently impact the world. The problem is that the impact is always *small.* A tree is bigger or smaller. A city has blue banners or red banners. X is in jail instead of Y. And that's not a mistake, it's by design. Bethesda is terrified of locking players out of content.

They know that telling players "If you want to be the Archmage of the College and the Harbinger of the companions you have to make two saves" is a **big ask** when each save file is meant to last like 200 hours.

BG3 is not afraid to have these branching paths that lock players out of certain things. They're not afraid to have really awful consequences for the wrong choices, because they know most players will load a previous save, and the few that stick with it will embrace that change in the narrative.
This isn't an engine issue at all Bethesda's quest designers/writers are just talent less and awful.
**crashes immediately**
"during the raid all named NPCs are hiding in their houses that you cannot enter for the timebeing and after fighting like 5 guards Zevlor runs up to you calling you a Monster for slaughtering almost everyone and asks you if you are here to trade"
The thing that made me stop playing Starfield was exactly this. I played Bg3 before Starfield, and honestly the amount of choice is incredible. I stopped playing once I realized that I don't really have a choice in Starfield. During the quest where you are pressed into service to infiltrate the Crimson Fleet, I was kinda already very powerful. I got a bounty on accident pretty late game and didn't realize it. So I was already a bit pissed about it. The fact that this dude was trying to dictate and threaten me felt really absurd. So I tried to murder everyone on the ship. And realized that it didn't matter. I only got more bounty, nothing really changed in world.
Game Pass saved my wallet this year. I spent a total of 12 bucks in games so far.
Settlement building, too.
Worse.  Hardly anyone has noticed but a really big sign that Bethesda fucked up during development is the way that upgrades no longer show on *anything*.  They simply used the upgraded models to instead create the illusion of more weapons/armor.


What do I mean? Look at the helmets. Notice the military helmet with the physical plating covering the visor? That fits the description of the armor shielding upgrade. The other variations of that helmet fit the other upgrades as well. Those helmet models were clearly designed to visually show upgrades, but were repurposed to artificially bloat the very limited item list. My theory is that Bethesda didn't have anywhere near enough content for the game so they cannibalized everything basically at the eleventh hour. It's why the POI's all suck, why so many quests are so short and dumb, why the big "faction quests" all correspond to a starting origin, and why you can no longer visually customize armor or weapons.
The companion control and AI feels closer to how it did in skyrim to me than how it did in Fallout 4 which is frustrating cause that was one high point for me in FO4, the better companion AI, storytelling, and the commands
And for us that love base building, i wish they've just copy pasted the system from FO4 and fo76 instead of this subnautica style bases. 

It's a straight up downgrade with the ecxeption in the free camera
Hard to even say Starfield has a big world. More like a bunch of hubs you fast travel between.
It feels like they don't understand their vision. They couldn't decide between Space Sim and standard Bethesda RPG. I was really hoping for a game like X4 but with a more compelling story and voiceovers. It feels like they were going for that too with some of the systems, but they got cold feet and stopped half way.

Edit: a word
> 'Why can't I make a base over there, why can't I land on the other side of this planet'.  
  
The problem is not answering that question. The problem starts way sooner when they decided to have free outpost building.  
Why is it needed? Not every story in space needs to be about settling or building stuff. Why does it have to be free? Not every location in space warrants a settlement in the first place. Heck, you can even combine that with worldbuilding and explain why the settlements we have are where they are and why creating new settlements is such a big deal that is caused the setting defining war. But its Bethesda we are talking about. Neither of those aspects is fleshed out.  
  
The current Bethesda formula is building theme parks, playing it save. No real world building, snippets at best. Every region, every quest stands on its own. If we visit another world, it is carefully cordoned from interfering elements. The game is deliberatly designed to be played at short intervals. Investment in the setting is not rewarded, thus freedom ultimatly can not be rewared. As you do not build anything within the setting. All you do is fundamentally seperated from each and every interaction, quest or event.  
  
They wanted features first. They did not check if those features were warranted or what kind of game they were going to make and if those features would make sense there. Its is merely checking a box on a list, not because it would benefit the game, but because "space games" as they understand them seem to have stuff like that and it makes great bulletin points for advertisment.
Andromeda had so much potential. And the story does have intrigue. I just wish you actually felt like you were settling the new galaxy with an unknown threat more.

I have played the game and the atmosphere and plot are such a solid idea. Then it just kinda falls flat and was a buggy mess.
Or Dragon Age :(
Mods can do A LOT.

I've been getting back into Skyrim with the Wildlander pack, based on Requiem.
It's a much more enjoyable experience for me because of exactly this. Vampires and dragons are fucking scary. You actually use potions.

But, the fundamentals of the game are still there. I don't see, even with mods ten years from now barring some huge mod breakthrough like ai that makes games, it being great. Maybe decent. Maybe good. But, its so fundamentally mediocre that I have little hope for it.
Exactly, I played through Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim and New Vegas without mods. Only years after my initial play throughs I did I start using mods to spice things up. Somewhere around the level 35 mark I just couldn’t anymore with Starfield and I rushed to the end, something I had not experienced in Bethesda games before this.
I never dropped a game so hard like Starfield. I was totally enjoying it. Was thinking "I will be building such a cool base, but first sell all these weapons and upgrade my ship..." 

Then I did upgrade my ship...finished the questlines...and then there was no reason to keep playing. I had unlimited money, most of the time was waiting for the store to have money again, I had my ship upgraded, all my weapons...and around 60% of the planets not discovered, because even *now* I only saw repeating POI's and zero reason to explore. 

So much wasted potential, so fucking much. The artists nailed it, everyone else sucked.
I would have been much happier with 20 (or 10?) huge unique planets with their own biomes and story content than this “1,000” planets bs. The game still could have been gigantic. Like you said it’s all just an illusion when in fact it’s pretty shallow. I will say I played about 50 hours so I feel I got my moneys worth at least but it was still a major letdown. I think any long term viability it may have will fall in the modding community at this point.
I just hate the way npcs talk and behave. The zoom, the unnatural faces, the 🧍‍♂️pose. And even a lot of the voice acting is utterly phoned in. I play these games for the characters and this completley fell flat beyond the core cast. PG13 stunted rubbish
The sheer number of cool ideas it has is exactly why I'm not surprised by 100 hour+ reviews that don't recommend the game.

I'm one of them. I spent those hours quite enjoying any chance to shoot but pretty much waiting for other mechanics to develop as I went on.

And then you have a *hard* drop-off as realization hits. I've loaded in once or twice to meddle with ship customization but I haven't touched a quest in weeks.

Haven't even done the main line once, let alone NG+. It's so tedious.
It also feels like it’s too sanitized. No blood, no dismemberment. Bullet holes don’t even show up on bodies which makes no sense.
It's been going on longer than Skyrim. Oblivion was a step down from Morrowind in terms of quests, dialogue, and magic/enchantment design. Skyrim was a step down from Oblivion in terms of quests, dialogue, and magic/enchantment design. The RPG elements have become slimmer with each reiteration of the game. Fallout 3 to 4 is simultaneously less and more obvious, primarily because Fallout 3 only really had two iterations on the same ending and Fallout 4 offered four different flavours of the same ending, i.e. the Mass Effect 3 approach.

For real 

But now I have a million replies from these delulu kids being like “tHiS sUb WaS aLwAyS cRiTiCaL” like no dude this sub was tongue-punching Todd Howard’s special starfish for a solid month after release
I love all these comments like "the game is meh but I still love and defend it." Lol, why tho?
> I will always defend the game against people who have never played it lol.

Why? is your ego so tied to a product?
Fallout 4 might’ve had generic, boring writing. But, at least everything else was fun. Exploring, settlement building, combat, etc
Don’t forget the trainwreck that was FO76. After that mess, I had about 10% faith left in them making a good ES6. After starfield, my faith is at about 1%. I mean, FO76 was absolutely annihilated with reviews upon release, and it doesn’t seem like it made a difference with Starfield. I just think Bethesda got too big and too corporate. The old Bethesda we knew and loved is dead.
Cyberpunk somehow made getting quests interesting.
I’m legitimately tired how often people go “I’ll just wait for mods” or “mods will fix it!” As though that’s an excuse to install this 140 GB dumpster fire. I’m sorry, I only mod games if the base game is deserving. 

Anyone saying mods will save Starfield is just enabling Bethesda’s sloppy handiwork
Exactly this, they are terrified of allowing the player a choice that prevents them seeing an aspect of the game

In Morrowind, if you chose to align with a great house it meant you were locked out of the other great houses.  Even joining a local guild would change the disposition of people from rival guilds

In Skyrim we see early examples, nearly every path would compel you to join the college of winterhold at some point.  Brynjolf  will *always* walk up the player saying they've never worked an honest day in their life.(I played a lawful redguard paladin type my first go around...so that threw me)  And you HAVE to be the dragonborn (even if dragons don't spawn...word walls)   

But at least in Skyrim it was wide enough that you felt like you could swim to another side of the pool and have your own adventure...Starfield...I have no idea...it's like they thought everything was cool, and the player should be able to see it every time (even though the whole NG+ aspect perfectly allows a player to lock themselves out of content and still see it the next time around? WTF??)
"Also have time to" is A+ promotional speak.
They do so many things right
They said both: "This means the PC version of Baldur's Gate 3 will be released at a time where you'll have more time to play it" and " holding back the PC version when we knew we’d be ready felt like the wrong move in such a busy launch period", which is basically admitting that they released it earlier so that the players had more time to play the game before other games (starfield) launched. Honestly, this is Larian pretty much publicly saying they are moving the game to not compete with starfield without saying it extremely explicitly (but still pretty explicitly).
Didn't happen with Fallout 4, only Skyrim got that treatment. 😂
> the game is supposed to encourage NG+ play.

By taking all your stuff away from you. Bizarre decision. At least let me keep equipped weapons and money.
I love that you can just go full on evil if you WANT. Join Caesars legion, kill NCR etc. Become vilified with otherwise friendly factions for your evil choices. Starfield let's you sort of join Crimson fleet but it has no real negative repercussions to other factions, which is so lame! You can choose the Va'ruun religion in character creation perks but there is no faction quests where you can be some murderous Va'ruun fanatic. Hopefully DLC down the road? At this point I can't say I care too much unless Bethesta pulls a Cyberpunk2077 and makes major changes.
Despite that remedy made something unique that only remedy could make.

You could see the amount work and passion placed into aw2 specially through the live action segments.

They basicly created a signature. Which gives me high hopes for their future games.
It feels like they got too caught up in the implementation and never stopped and asked "is 100s of empty planets fun?"
This is absolutely correct. So many planets but little to do on said planets. And everything you can do is literally the same thing you can do on all planets. The only thing I enjoy now about Starfield is shipbuilding.
I would have taken like 5 or 6 planets ranging in stages of development from Morrowind/Skyrim to Fallout to, well, Starfield. Treat them almost like the various Vaults and how unique each one's situation was. Some lifeless planets and moons in the systems for filler since there's a limited "habitable zone", but locales to purposefully explore, not just fart around in the procedural landscapes.

If the point is to explore space, spend more time actually flying around with some interplanetary activity rather than "fast travel, follow beacon."
Not the first person to make this observation but the UC Vanguard quest feels more important/consequential than the actual main quest
Also just like progression. I found a spacesuit like 6 hours in that I'm still wearing 40 hours later. I haven't found anything better. That's insane. 

You pretty much have your combat skills maxed out by level 30 or 35 too. So leveling after that doesn't really make you feel much more powerful either. 

That was NOT the case in fallout or Skyrim from my recollection.
I felt an overall cohesion to the worlds in Fallout/Skyrim. The missions felt connected to the mainframe of the world. With Starfield, I didn't feel that. Most missions feel like those cheap repeater missions you get from a bulletin board, where you just go to X location do X thing, come back. There's a few dope quests for sure, but everything else is just so bland and uninteresting.
Exactly. I remember Skyrim getting the same complaints back in the day, first time I heard the "wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle" argument early on. But Starfield? Holy crap does this game live up to that description.
I’d argue that they got the important things right before Starfield. Which is exploration, fun quests and NPC’s and a general feeling of freedom.

Starfield is missing 2/3 of the core things that makes a Bethesda game. So what stays is the random BS ment to be fun extras.
A mile wide and an inch deep.  With Skyrim, though, I truly enjoyed just wandering and picking up flowers, rocks, and bugs.
Honestly this, but inexplicably basics like pepperoni are missing to make room for an exotic type of tomato that’s on one slice for a single bite and kinda tastes like shit.
100% agree with this.   I felt the game was too front end loaded.  Nearing the middle of the game you realize how empty is actually is.  It’s so massive, it’s empty.  I put it down for now to wait for DLC and more content.   I still enjoy it for what it is, just wishing for more.
Originally they wanted about two dozen star systems but once they figured out how to get to 1,000 planets Todd went all in. I wish they stuck to fewer but more consequential planets than copy pasta systems.
Or we could've had 1 solar system with lets say 8 planets. That were all different. Starfield is such a disappointing entry, i cant imagine how they came up with it. Imagine interstellar. Out of those 8 planets, have them insanely varied. 1 Planet with insane mountains that are unfathomable on earth. And another planet with a flat surface that's covered with thick clouds. They could have had a ship you find floating,  you get on and everyone is murdered. You start a side quest figuring out what happened. Then you find a alien on board. Like just some alien vs predator stories. Starfield could have been so interesting. Such a insanely missed opportunity. Modern Bethesda sucks from a story telling perspective.

And if we had a smaller 1 solar system to explore we could've had actual space exploration. Not a stupid loading screen for a game.
Yes, every time I visited a quest-related area (like Sarah's planet or the Rangers' quest area in Montara Luna) I felt the thrill of exploring an interesting place. Rarely did it feel so in the empty void of procedurally generated planets (maybe plateau biomes were the exception, and even they get old).

The game should have been focused on three or four systems: Sol, Alpha Centauri, Sirius and Akila, tops. Have Mars, Akila and Jemison be heavily handcrafted places with the areas surrounding the capitals feel like real capitals. Cydonia, New Atlantis and Akila feel like hamlets or Fallout settlements. Not future towns. Have Neon, Red Mile and other places be also locations in these worlds, so that they don't feel empty and terribly lost in the wilderness. 

The game was a victim of its own design philosophy. It will be some people's jam. It wasn't really mine, and I wanted it so badly...

Half of my hour time on Steam is building starships though. That was cool.
And procedural generation wasn't even a bad idea, honestly, the problem is that the Poi's aren't procedurally generated they are just procedurally located. It's the exact same POI with the exact same rooms, enemies and even loot just placed 850 metres aways from your ship instead of being placed 2 kilometres away.

BG3 is definitely not a dialogue checklist, I can't even imagine why you would think that
The big reveal that >!earth was destroyed from testing warp drives!< is mentioned and literally never plot relevant again. Like, what was the point of it then? Just to have a big "wow omg" moment in the game?
Morrowind was peak BGS when it comes to RPG design and player agency. Only thing better you'll get is New Vegas, but that was an Obsidian game.
Me today:

Finds new planet…”Ooh, spaceship wreckage, that’s cool.”

Traverses 500 meters only to find…an ammo box and nothing else.
This is such a critical fail I honestly don't know how they thought it was acceptable. Similar places would be ok but actual identical cloned locations permanently ruins your suspension of disbelief and turns it into a mediocre video game.
There's also no progression on the locations

There's no extra large end game areas filled with real dangerous enemies and high end loot so you're just cleaning the same easy places over and over again 

When I found the oil rig it was cool because it was the first PoI with an actual boss and new enemies and goes a bit into xeno warfare but that's literally the single only one in the game the rest only spawn one of the 4 raider groups
Oh certainly, that’s a huge problem and one of the biggest reasons I stopped playing the game.  But when you look at the actual amount of content, it’s huge.  There are tons of quests, locations, enormous amounts of dialogue.  More than previous games.  Which is why it’s baffling to me that they still went with so many copy pasted, barren planets with the same dozen locations randomly strewn about.  I’ve found Scott muybridge dead body like 5 times already.
I've never played DnD, never played anything by Larian either. Got BG3 a week to do after Starfield. I've probably sank like 80 hours or so into BG3 and haven't touched Starfield in a month or more lol
The difference in the dialogue is insane. Not just the context of the conversations which is significantly better in BG3 but the actual dialogue system itself. Starfield conversations are just checklists, hit all the options and move on. BG3 conversations are... Conversations. You can't go back and try another option, you say something to the npc, they react and the conversation continues
I was the same with bg3. Never been into them never played d&d, but the hype was too big to skip over. Stopped playing when starfield came out, need to go back when I have time. Too many games I want to play this year
Adoring Fan is the only cool companion in that regard, and his inclusion is more of a joke then anything. I love that man  😍
Haha the fact that Gta 6 even exists still doesn’t even feel real yet, let alone a year away.
Agreed.

What's a new Rockstar release without a 18month delay 3 months from release.
Their financial report suggests that they expect to make a ton of money at the end of 24 so here’s to hoping for a Holiday 24 release.
> That would be crazy if it comes out that quick after announcement

Remember when Fallout 4 was first announced and then released 5 months later? I wish this happened more often. Announcing games years ahead of release is wack
I hate that I think you’re right about TES6 😭
Yeh, my expectations for TESVI are low-to-middling, but with higher expectations that the modding community will end up completely overhauling it in the end, so I'll probably get it a couple years after release, and be better off for it.
I’ve said this before, but I think Starfiled is the last time Bethesda will be able to release a “Bethesda RPG” as we know them. The formula is done. It was a helluva ride, and I loved all of it (including Starfield) but the genera has changed to much. 

Starfiled definitely needed more something - or maybe “better” things that it does have. I’ve put probably 40+ hours in, but I don’t feel like putting any more in to even finish the story.
Peaked with Morrowind, everything since has been progressively less of an RPG and more of an Action/adventure game
If elder scrolls 6 is on the same engine the games already cooked in my opinion. Idk if there's any actual information about that yet but the engine seriously limited this game and 30 fps on console on an fps gunplay based game is atrocious, on top of stuttering and frame drops on even the most empty and dead planets.
It's time for new blood if ES6 will be anything special, Starfield gives me the distinct feeling of being made by people with very little desire to innovate or create. Take some creative indie developer and give them the director's chair, this is what they do with films.
I agree totally to this. It’s somehow I can’t stop to think that this random generated landscape is some old Todd Howard fever dream that he wanted to go back to. And frankly it’s one of the dumbest decision design wise they’ve done with this game.
Agree. They used canned story plots that were shallow and stereotypical. All characters were underwhelming. There was also too much pandering to the do-gooders who dont allow fun. 

The ship combat was abysmal. The talent system was horrible. 

Gunplay was much improved over prior games but very limited based on the game design for missions. 

I did not enjoy the mission boards that required 5 fast travels to kill a handful of enemies. 

The ng+ ran the story rather than the story being compelling enough to replay.  0% replay value. 

All in all, i put my time in and it was OK. Very disappointed though.
It's hard to stay in the game when the characters themselves talk and look like they don't even want to be in it.

Without spoilers I'll say this, when X character death happens I thought people would be more reactive to it. But no it's just "I can't believe his gone, I need a moment" and then x character sits down like nothing happens and everyone goes about their lives when x character died like 1mnt ago in your faces.
Thanks, I was not aware.  I’ll have to try to track it down.  Do you know if they hinted at eventually implementing any of the systems?
> Ah the ol Dragon Age Inquisition method

That's a weird claim.

Shadows of Mordor, Stick of Truth, Divinity Original Sin were released in 2014 with DAI.

And depending on what you're classifying as "RPG", Dark Souls 2 (was nominated in 2014's Game Awards for best RPG) and Banner Saga also released in 2014.
Yeah I wish it just let you skip through at least SOME quests or some parts of them at least.
The core question of the game is "do you want to chase the tedious grind for power, or stay in a rich, wonderful world for the long haul?", and it's almost like them admitting that they couldn't decide which game they were even making so they half-assed both. The whole game is fundamentally compromised by this duality.
100% agreed - pin this at the top and shout it to the heavens.
*actual different universes* would be amazing. I know it's a cost multiplier to make, but holy crap it would be cool. Imagine one where >!the FC won the war, there are mechs everywhere, and the UC has been forced to relocate to a new system?!< Or barring huge changes like that, just small things like making a fetch quest go somewhere completely different with a new minor NPC and dialogue. Or having a different set of main outcomes/minor consequences for major quests.
The ryujin faction storyline where >!you install the internal neuroamp!< makes no sense in installing it again in ng+ as i should already have it in me! I was thinking they would be surprised to see me in possession of it already but nothing lol!
And how they didn't even tie in the actual crime to the dialogue so you always get "I'm so mad at you, you know what you did!" like a daytime tv drama.

If cold-blooded murder gets the same response as accidentally punching someone in a firefight the response is meaningless.
I have never hated companions more than I did in this game. I made an outpost in what was Saudi Arabia (The Empty Quarter) and left [them with a desk](https://imgur.com/05rxnNA). And then just dropped all my junk in one of [their rooms](https://imgur.com/vUnFJPy) lol
These are seriously maybe the worst companions I've ever seen in a game. The only cool one is the robot and lets be real, its still a pretty generic robot character
That's why I only roll with my boy Vasco.
Despite having a lot of linear quests FO4 also had quite a few with branching choices (or at least binary options) and the faction decisions you made (and outcomes of some quests) did leave an impact on the gameworld in some ways. Each of the four main factions feels pretty different to play through, too.
If it was an engine problem, SureAI wouldn’t have been able to make Myar Aranath, Arktwend, Nehrim or Enderal. The last two I’d argue are better than the games they were based on.
Yeah like fallout new vegas had a few side quests where you are presented 2-3 different options and every main quest had a few different options for how you handled it (you can deal with benny like 7 different ways). Plus most conversations had extra options depending on skills/special so I don’t think its the engine.
No, people just don't understand what the "engine" actually does. You're right, its just a labor/effort thing.
No, people who don't know what they're talking about just like to give shit to the Creation Engine when they have no other scapegoat.
Agreed and to add on to your point-

In most Bethesda games, replaying the big faction questlines don't offer that much difference with how they end up. They know that players aren't going to find that much value replaying them. In BG3- there's concrete differences and choices that really make replaying a game worth it. Not to mention all the dialogue and worldbuilding that exists.

Sure, you might replay Skyrim or FO4 every couple of years, but I know myself and a lot of other players immediately started a new run of BG3 as soon as we finished. Or even had multiple runs simultaneously going with all sorts of differences.
Visual Studio uninstalls itself
Don’t forget broken perks and skills
Ship building too, I love it but it's tedious and unnecessary expensive because you can't just store the MODULAR engine, reactor/hab etc. you already bought but have to trash it.
Feels like it.
Also probably why there doesn't seem to be any barriers to joining every faction in one playhtrough, there should be some sort of consequence for becoming a Pirate or working for both Freestar and UC
>The companion control and AI feels closer to how it did in skyrim to me

Skyrim gave you the option to tell companions to attack or move or use lockpicks to unlock stuff, Starfield doesn't
My understanding is that you aren't too far off.  Supposedly Starfield was going to be a lot more complicated and harsher, but they decided to tone it down and made things like environmental hazards more like "flavor text" than actual gameplay.
Yep, it seems like they were heading the X4 direction but took a sudden hard turn away from it at the last minute
I even enjoyed the builds and combat a lot in Andromeda, but it felt like I never had enough battles or large enough fights to really use my full kit.

The two things I remember from Andromeda is the sweet infiltrator dodge, and driving around a lot.
I still sunk over 100 hours into it though!
> I just wish you actually felt like you were settling the new galaxy with an unknown threat more.

This was my biggest problem with Andromeda. I remember meeting the friendly aliens, whatever they were called, for the first time. What could've been a cool interaction with the translators not understanding their completely alien language was basically nothing more than meeting your new neighbors. So much wasted potential, and also it just made no sense.
I think Andromeda got a bad rap because it followed one of the most successful RPG trilogies ever and a lot of people wanted it to live up to that entire trilogy.

Also the bad guy/empire were kind of silly more than sinister, but hopefully it would have gone down that route as they captured and turned more of your former allies to enemies.

That said, the combat was nice, so were some of the decisions if they played out in the next game or something, but the face-to-game problems it launched with and then some bugs really caused Bioware/EA to abandon it.

Now we're back in the milky way which is blah.
Dragon Age is in such a weird place.
Origins was a surprise masterpiece, 2 and inquisition spent all their time trying to reinvent the wheel when what they had was already perfect on the first try.
Mods can do a lot, I just hate modding a Bethesda game when they are so fresh, constantly receiving updates and dlc, mods break, some mods will update, some not, then your save doesn't work or gets corrupted....it's just a pain in this ass and a headache
I remember seeing a review that mentioned the repeating POIs and I thought "oh so they're all really similar. Eh, that's fine! I like just exploring and seeing new random stuff."

No, he was completely correct. You see one POI, you've seen it forever. No variation, even the placed loot is in the exact same spot every single time. The same skill magazines. The same terminal messages. Everything. I would've genuinely preferred randomly generated shlock. But instead, I saw the exact same Pharmaceutical Research site with the exact same people working in it four times in a row and realized this game was horribly shallow.

It's an incredible shame. The game was beautiful, it felt fun to play, but I realized I truly had seen literally everything already. Anything more was just aimless routine.
Totally. I love the OST and the art, but almost everything else feels half baked. I mean, I can see the potential in lots of features, but none of them is fleshed enough.
Yeah I always laugh when any game mentions scale like that. Can you imagine an open world game as big as 1/1 earth size. Star citizen creates the illusion better but the planets are tiny compared to an actual planets size.
I'm not even sure what mods can do for it tbh. It's fundamentally just not interesting to explore and that's always been the core hook of Bethesda games, at least for me. Yeah they can pump out combat overhauls and QOL fixes but unlike previous titles there's no engaging world to wander round so what's the point of improving the experience of wandering around?
vast detail rich fall distinct fragile heavy payment plate wasteful

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
Watch when they get up out of a chair to walk away.  It's almost painful.  They stand up stiffly, stare off for a second, then turn to walk stiffly in the direction they need to go.  

It's painfully weird.
The hundred-hour mark is exactly when I hit the wall. I had so much fun for the 2-3 weeks I played it but I just couldn't bring myself to play anymore. I had the same thing happen 30-40 hours into TotK.  
  
When I got bored with Starfield, I picked up Baldur's Gate. 130 hours in, now, with no end in sight. The only other CRPGs I've ever enjoyed are Dragon Age: Origins and KotOR.
This. I was obsessed with it for about 80 hours, because everything was new. 

But then I got annoyed with base building being tedious. And base storage transfer being broken or badly designed. So I stopped doing that. 

And you need to hoard a thousand items to modify your gear. So I didn't do that.

Weapon and armor making is tedious. So I did not do that.

Shop building needs too many perk point investment to unlock, so I didn't do that. 

A billion different items to loot but the biggest trading corporation in human space has about $3.50 in their register every other day, so I can't sell my loot. So I stopped looting. 

Discovery and exploration doesn't bring shit, so I stopped doing that.

Every barren planet is full to the brim with structures and settlements. Rare, neverseen before temples are in earshot of random settlements that never looked that way. So it's not credible. You don't feel like actually discovering anything. Ever.

And like you said, one day I saved and quit for the very last time and never came back to it. It went from obsession to not caring about it at all. I can't even motivate myself to rush the main story at least. I got to the point where we did the deal with the old man on Neon, got the artifact, received a call from someone to stop trying to assemble the artifacts, immediately sensed where the story was going and completely lost interest. And from the spoilers I acridentaly read here and there, it seems the story goes exactly where I thought it might.

Starfield is the most 6.5/10 game I ever played.
I’ve heard this too, and I’m genuinely wondering where all this handcrafted content is? What exactly are they measuring it by? 

As far as I’ve seen, there are maybe half a dozen main hubs to explore, and a dozen other smaller hand-crafted locations sprinkled around various star systems. The rest is just a bunch of uninteresting copy/paste fluff. You can even find colony war barracks 50 ly from UC or FC space, ffs…

Worst part is that those main hubs have practically no interactivity in them. Paradiso and Red Mile are probably the two biggest offenders of this. These places should be hubs with minigames to kill time in, but as it stands right now… nada. Zilch. You go to them for one or two quests each, and nothing else.
It may be a factually true statistic based on some metric that only BGS really knows about. But that also makes it pretty arbitrary.

It's a very, very small example, but just look at, say, Belathor and his general store compared to literally *any* vendor in Starfield. 

Belathor has a bunch of stuff on shelves, he has a personality, his store doubles as his house and has multiple rooms with furniture and food and it looks lived in. You can get into his store through two different doors, and he actually sleeps, so the emergent gameplay of robbing him at night is possible.

None of the vendors in Starfield sleep so far as I'm aware. And the vast majority of their stores amount to little more than a guy behind an empty counter. You might argue that in the more futuristic setting it make sense that a shopkeeper would live someplace other than their store. But has anybody found the Terrabrew baristas appartment? Or the galbank guy's house?

Like I said, tiny example, but I think it's a microcosm of the game as a whole. There may technically be more hand placed vendors and stores, but I don't think it actually represents a higher degree of hand curated content.
In Skyrim you could walk past a group of bandits caging animals in the distance, you'd have the choice to engage them and free the animals or continue on your journey. There's hardly any of that in Starfield.
Straight up

Yo, could it have been bots? By Bethesda even? Is it blasphemy yet to even mention such a notion.
Fr I enjoyed tf out of my FO4 playthrough before starfield and was AT LEAST expecting that type of Bethesda fun from starfield. I thought there is no way they could make it worse, FO4 is atleast playable and has the basic elements of a bethesda game

Well they did lmao. It’s worse
The problem is they put out a shitty game and still make a billion dollars, which for a company like this is basically "OK, mission accomplished." Reviews, Reddit sentiment, and how much fun people have doesn't fill their coffers. Sales of the game do. As long as you buy the game, there's not much incentive to care about anything else beyond "will a million people still buy our next game?" My prediction is TES6 will still sell extremely well by the time it comes out, even if it ends up being terrible too. So it's kind of like, what incentive (besides personal pride) do they have for going the extra mile on anything?
"Mods will fix this" is the Bethesda game version of "640k ought to be enough for anybody!"

Like yeah, maybe? But I don't think so, man. Not this time, there's too much just *not there.* But hey modders, prove me wrong^please^I^want^to^be^wrong.
That’s my biggest complaint. The games went from feeling like a living world, to a bunch of set pieces with npc’s waiting for you to show up so they can say their lines. 

It feels so similar to Westworld with all these planned out “adventures” where they put no effort into hiding the curtains.
Haha, yeah - I meant it in the objective definition of explicit. But agree with what you said.... You could even take it a step further and infer that Larian was targeting Starfield with some other actions: Specifically saying they were waiting on the Xbox release so they could 100% hit 60fps and moving the ps5 release to be on the same date as Starfield. Their marketing and business team were not holding back, lol.
Well tbf, Skyrim was literally one of the most successful and highly praised games of all time, even before it's first re-release.

Fallout 4 did good, but not \*that\* good.
Elden Ring understood that NG+ should be like a victory lap through the game with all your big toys
Starfield never really gives you any real player choice or freedom. You can't really be evil apart from joining the Crimson Fleet, and even that has almost no consequences
100s of empty planets would be fine if there were more concentrated hubs of content.

The 100s of empty planets need to be there so that unknown alien temples can be found that aren't less then a KM from the nearest farm/ mine/ weapons planet etc. Pirate bases can genuinely be a secret etc. And explorers can actually head out and explore.

But the UC and FC controlled systems and their immediate surroundings Really needed to be rich with settlements, space stations, towns, cities etc. As it currently stands the terrain immediately surrounding new Atlantis is little different to a backwater world out on the fringes of the settled systems.
They probably realized it wasn't fun, but didn't have the balls to yank it after using it as a main selling point in all the teasers.
Which apparently is what happened to Mass Effect Andromeda
Ironically I always wanted there to be a large distance between POI so I thought starfield planets would be good for that. I wanted skyrim but with a large map so you could wander the snow for a solid couple minutes without hitting anything. But starfield ended up actually worse because there's nothing but random generated junk so you just land and immediately go to your destination and don't even bother exploring because everything is just copy pasted crap.
IMO that's because it actually feels like it's taking place within the universe of starfield, the main quest basically has this earth shattering reveal that people are capable of wielding magic and these magic users are among us and some of them are good but some of them are evil, but also you can wield magic too if you seek out these temples, and one magic guys goes on a one man terror spree in the major city of the UC.....and nobody cares, literally has no impact on anyone anywhere outside of constellation. For me it feels like someone on the Bethesda team went hey we should have like a dragonborn system again with a mechanic to unlock powers etc etc. completely ignoring the whole quasirealism tone the rest of the game is going for, Bethesda had a massive tonal problem with this game where it feels like they couldn't make up their minds, lets make a game universe where ftl tech and the tech style is somewhat realistic, but lets add magic as well, lets make a destination that's dystopian and blade runner like, yeah but make it comically stupid as well, lets have a faction of ruthless pirates, yeah but also make them a bunch of wise cracking misfits. I find it weird because I like the general style of the game, I like the setup of the UC/FC/Verunn even though Verunn is criminally undercooked , in fact there are loads of individual elements of the game which are good, but at the same time some of the world building is fumbled so badly it ceases to feel like a joined up game.
Level 30 or 35? I'm at 256 and at that point you merely pick up the emissary and the hunter, shake them real hard, and they come apart in your hands. Well, almost. It's probably not ten times stronger in terms of straight up combat than I was at 35, but it feels like more than 5 times. Of course, I still haven't gotten around to doing any of the melee related skills--they messed that up pretty badly, although I expect they will fix it, eventually.

Suits don't seem terribly important unless you are bothered by planetary environment debuffs (injuries) overmuch. I currently have stealth 4 and concealment 4, chameleon suit, chameleon helmet, and chameleon pack, along with the quest apparel that gives +25% to stealth. Seems better than high armor ratings. Even running and gunning I don't take more damage than my medpaks can easily overcome, and, of course, that 70% slowdown when you are aiming while boosting really helps, too. 

Used the freeze time power once but it got stuck on and I had a devil of a time getting it off, so I avoid that. The only power I use hardly at all is the sense life forms thing. Even hot keyed it's too much of a pain switching between them for the benefit received.
For such a big world it feels so empty
Yeah, at first it was like "Alright, feels like a Bethesda game" but after a while it was "Uh, is this all there is?!?"  And then I had to clear one of the assets used for random procedural generation as part of a mission.  That's just lame.  Even if you're going to use procedural generation, *none* of those assets should have to be used for anything that's actually scripted in the game.
Not to mention the insane amount of loading screens in order to travel. Even inter system.
Hell I'd settle for 2 planets if it was actually a fully realised hand-crafted map of the entire surface.

Procedural Generation is an interesting tool, but not a fun gameplay mechanic. Right now it feels like you could fit all of the handcrafted locations in the game into a map the size of Skyrim.
Imo, they would.have been substantially better off with 1/4 of the systems and releasing quadrants as main DLC expanding the universe by 100% the first time, 50% the second, and 25% the third with a story line that narrows in on the origins of the starborn process.
And stuff like the Great Serpent cult. Such a cool idea, where is the faction quest that lets you finally get a glimpse at an extradimensional serpent-shaped entity coiled around galaxies?
That whole plot point was just created because they likely didn't know how to handle a fully populated earth in a game you can land anywhere you want on planets.  I will guarantee you earth being destroyed was a design driven plot point. How it got destroyed was never meant to have any huge relevance to the game.
Yeah, for a game that relies so heavily on procedural generation for it's content, it's crazy that they created such a lazy proc-gen system. There's so many relatively little and simple things that they could've done to mix it up, but they just straight up copy/paste entire outposts all over the map and call it a day.
Poor guy keeps getting cloned and killed.

If you squint hard enough there's a certain story logic in having easily manufactured and deployed prefab buildings when creating outposts in the frontier, but the illusion sure breaks fast when you have the exact same computers with the exact same messages connected to the exact same caves and the exact same dead scientists in the exact same position and your companion makes the exact same comment about it over and over.

Starship debris is the same crashed ship broken in the same places with the same two drink packs and the same combat knife in a chair with the same little "days marooned" sign.

For a game about exploration it's punishing to see the same couple buildings and outposts repeated over and over.
I played D&D in the late 70's and early 80's.  I was also a DM.  But over time I had forgotten most of the spells, equipmet, etc so I am happily relearning it.
I miss Morrowind’s system. I know it’s harder to do with voice acting, but being able to ask any NPC about their job, advice (contextual to the NPC’s background), or rumors felt immersive. In important conversations the hooks were hyperlinks, letting you build a conversation off of actual things the NPC said (oh you mentioned Balmora? Tell me more about that) rather than a list of responses that may or may not relate.
Could be from opening up preorders in late 2024 for a mid 2025 release?
It also gives way too much time for players to over hype, which I believe is a short term gain, long term loss scenario
Compared to Baldurs Gate 3 where Sven insisted that the designers make act 3 as seamless as possible - they went out of their way to remove loading screens in the city, increasing their work immensely but it paid off.
I think Bethesda games have been trending towards shallow for years now, but I also think Bethesda’s game design ethos simply doesn’t match a space setting, at least not without major changes that they didn’t seem willing or able to make for Starfield. Exploration in their games hinges on environmental storytelling and the impact that has on roleplay and immersion and due to the way they set up POIs and exploration in Starfield, that environmental storytelling is almost entirely missing from the game. Part of that is down to the setting, space is simply more desolate that Earth or Tamriel, but they could have worked around that if they did things differently.
I don't think Starfield was a "Bethesda RPG". It's too watered down. Fallout 3 was a world full of suffering and with small glimmers of hope. Oblivion saw you hunt down and murder your dark brethren to root out a betrayer. Starfield.. has what? At nearly every opportunity it's like they decided to go mild.
Yeah and I think Starfield is a good sendoff for that formula. But you gotta advance when others do and occasionally do something impressive. I think at the beginning of the year people were talking up Starfield like it was gonna be a GOTY sweep. And I'm pretty sure BG3 released before it because they were afraid of getting stomped out of existence. But it doesn't seem to have downright wowed people. In a market where there's a lot of competition and a lot of games living up to their hype or exceeding it, you gotta keep stepping up your game and at the very least your fans you are catering to most should be impressed.
I really hope you're wrong, because if anything for me Starfield isn't Bethesda enough, especially in the exploration aspect, and that's it's only real problem. I Absolutely don't want Bethesda to do a radically different type of game, especially not one that sacrifice the sandbox for better presentation /narrative for Elder Scrolls 6. 

On the other hand if we can be done with the pure repeatable infinite quest that are here just for xp and money and have only handcrafted content, i'm all down for that.

But i truely think you are wrong, Elder Scrolls 6 will be probably not that different overall, i learned since a long time that companies don't really change a formula that sells, being Ubisoft, Rockstar, Fromsoftware or Naughty dog, they all have their formula of game, and Bethesda is no different.
Fully agree, as much as I enjoyed Oblivion that was the start of BGS RPG'S getting dumbed down and it's only gotten worst with each new release
I don't even mind how Skyrim plays, and after Oblivion came out I was excited to see where they were going with faction quest lines, but it just feels like they write a middling tale that has no impact on the world and say "good enough". The faction quests in Morrowind aren't really anything to write home about, and I think Skyrim did have way more interesting stories littered everywhere. Like their environment all storytelling has become really good, it's just that the main tentpole stories have just become less interesting and thought out over time. 

I've come to accept this about Bethesda games, and appreciate them for what they are, so when I found out Starfield was basically just faction quest lines and procedurally generated things to explore, my excitement and enthusiasm for the game went down a lot. Like the one thing I actually think they do better than anyone else, the randomly stumbling upon something interesting or weird or funny, is the part they cut for this game. It's like they sat down, thought about their strengths and weaknesses as a developer, and decided to go all in on their weaknesses.
It would be better if it also had random bases and structure layout. Raiding enemy compex "C" for the 9th time is stale.
I think Dark Souls 2 and Banner Saga would both classify more as RPGs than Shadow of Mordor in anyone's eyes...
DAI won the easiest GOTY of the decade if you think otherwise you have no idea about gaming in general
It does?
I was looking forward to the ng+ mechanic based on how everybody in this sub had hyped it. Instead it ended up being just differences in the lodge intro scene. And the ones with huge variations don't allow you to do the main quest anyway and you just do the usual fetch quest which is a snoozefest to play again.
That would be amazing. It could have worked if the game was smaller in scope (maybe six planets total) and the factions were shorter overall. Then they could encourage you to do three playthroughs for a ‘true’ ending.
See that's amazing or a galaxy wu5h terrormorphs everywhere. The scope is endless so I'm not sure why they half assed the whole multiple dimensions thing. Could've even got away with releasing a few new universe seeds each year. The game would be playable for a long time then
Wait, did you forget about the alternate universe where Sarah is a plant? Haha, she's a plant! That's hilarious! And so different! As if she didn't already have the personality of a fucking plant in the first place.
oof, that's a miss :(  


Little stuff like that goes a long way
Lmao, yeah, that is a silly oversight.
And we know they can track these things because Skyrim does it. 

Assault someone? You can maybe yield and pay a small fine. 

Kill someone? Guards are now hostile and you get a large fine. 

Skyrim even had companions with more varied morals. Some would kill innocents for you while others won't even steal anything.
The worst part of Andromeda for me is that in a brand new galaxy, there is ONE new sentient alien species

And we lost the Quarians
unpopular opinion: I really didn't like inquisition. And i have no idea why. I have tried to get through it so many time and I fall off almost immediately every time. I loved origins. i probably beat 9 times. I hated 2, but more because it all took place in the same city than anything else, but inquisition? I should like, everything is there to like it. I don't know? I just felt like an unsatisfying poop.
I think 2 would have been okay if it could be the 1.5 it was clearly meant to be. The characters were pretty cool and it would have been a great setup for the sequel but then Inquisition came out and it was just so meh.
I remember when we all thought Skyrim had got its last update...had been a couple years. Everyone had their insane modlist working perfectly. And then...

Steam News: Skyrim has updated to 1.6.2....

Fuck.
I cannot for the life of me understand why Bethesda thought the repeating POIs were a good idea. Like, the same exact terminal entries on different planets? Is that actually real? Why tf would they do that? That’s the most immersion-breaking, lazy game design I’ve ever seen 😭
Agreed. I think the only game that has planets of proper scale is Elite Dangerous. Rest are maps disguised as planets.
They are imitating tiktok videos imitating skyrim npcs.

*Need something?*
You meet exactly two children in the game that I can remember and they look like clones of each other. Hand crafted my ass.
>I’ve heard this too, and I’m genuinely wondering where all this handcrafted content is? What exactly are they measuring it by?

So the way Skyrim works, is that you have around \~24 unique assets for each dungeon type. If you look really close, every 4 corners or so is exactly the same corner. This allowed them to create a ton of dungeons really quickly, but by playing with lighting, clutter, combos of (mis)placed rocks, the player never really notices unless you start up the creation kit or pay attention to it.

In Starfield, I think the quest  "dungeons" are all handcrafted. I might misremember, but most rooms/hallways in f.e. the mantis dungeon is unique and I haven't seen them used elsewhere. However, every other "dungeon" is just exactly the same dungeon. A research lab is a research lab, a hangar is a hanger. The second time it gave me a deja-vu, the third time I know the exact layout already. They where even too lazy to mirror the "dungeons".

Also don't forgot that you have a ton of ship assets which are handcrafted as well. Cities are also unique, instead of the same 3 longhouses repeated ad infinitum. So in that sense, it seems that there are more unique assets/3D models in this game. However, skyrim really used its limited assets well, while starfield is wasting them.

Those first few weeks of constant “I’m a middle-aged dad” posts definitely raised my eyebrow on more than one occasion.
This is 100 percent correct. Someone like Todd Howard may see the criticism and complaints, but he turns around and see the sales numbers and shrugs his shoulders, then continues as before.

People never seem to learn this, they keep falling for hype and then pull a surprised Pikachu face when the rug is pulled out from under them.
Yep, they don't make simulated fantasy worlds anymore. They make theme parks for you to walk around.

Just remember, you're not allowed to interact with any of the attractions!

Compare that to morrowind where the quests were objectively simple but it didn't matter because they were just a chapter in your own much larger ambitions/story. How you completed that simple quest was what made it interesting. Linear quests are worse than no quest at all imo.
Thats a great way to put it. Give me consequences for my actions dammit! Lol. Even if you shoot up a town and piss your followers off, all you have to do is pass a speech check and they like you again.
even then the CF feels weak. You never really do pirate stuff. It's just a lot of diving into abandon ruins looking for audio logs. 

I wanted to kick in the door waving the 44 while shouting "give me da loot! give me da loot!"
It's the procedural generation that's the issue. A billion planets would be fine if the procedural generation was more complex and comprehensive.

They sacrificed something they are historically very good at, which is curated world design and environmental storytelling, to chase a system that relies on procedural generation to populate the game space. But they didn't invest enough thought or resources into the engine that generates endless content so we **do** get ancient alien temples literally next door to science labs that have no idea they exist, on planets that are all exactly the same.

Games like Starbound and Rimworld can be built on endless procedurally generated content because their procedures are robust and fine tuned. If you are going to go that direction you **must** make those systems to robust and fine tuned or else they will feel like grey mush. Because they are.

Imagine for a moment how Starfield might have been improved by having far fewer POIs on every planet (which were discoverable from orbit), but those POIs weren't tiny copy pasted locations. What if they were Daggerfall sized dungeons. Sprawling complexes or cave systems, built using a robust procedural system that could stitch together hallways and rooms and fill the thing with loot and enemies. This would even alleviate the pain of loading screens without actually doing anything to that travesty of an exploration system because spending an hour or two or three clearing out a Daggerfall sized, randomly constructed dungeon is going to result in far fewer loading screen transitions than a 10 minute cursory inspection of a POI youve seen a dozen times on 10 planets.
For a space-faring civilisation, there sure was a lack of civilisation. Sure there was a huge war between the factions, but the fact that both factions have a handful of quite honestly small cities snd however many outposts is insane imo. New Atlantis barely feels like a city and more like that holiday destination that I forgot the name of. A large military structure and a few skyscrapers, along with a  large mansion and an underground area. Not to mention, TWO LANDING PADS. You're telling me 2 landing pads in every city is enough, especially if you think about potential logistics for the city.
I understand that there are limitations to what games can achieve, and that's fine, but even if it just looked bigger, where I couldnt deep dive explore the city I'd be happy.
Not just that but it had too many empty planets while also being not enough. Cause in andromeda it takes place in a single star cluster rather than a whole galaxy like the first 3
Maybe?  But I found Andromeda to be quite fun, and really didn't run into any significant bugs in it.  And I played the pre-release \~6 hours, and immediately after release.  

And true, I haven't seen any show stoppers in starfield either....

But Andromeda had me quite involved in the game, starfield not so much....
ME:A has 5 planets, 2 of them pretty small, but all of them have tons of PoI on them, areas that only unlock later in the story, massive quest chains, side stories etc. The complaint wasn't that they were empty, but a bit too Ubi-fied.
I never use the magic powers. So far they have been unnecessary for me.
Yeah This sort of thing happens when they use Radiant Quests in Major Faction quest lines. They really need to stop using Radiant Quests like this.
I don’t think it would even come close to filling the skyrim map. That’s actually the problem. Think about it. There’s like 6 outpost bases. There’s Neon, New Atlantis, and Libertarian Shitholestan. Theres Red Mile. There’s a few stations. None of them are large. Compare it to Cyberpunk. All of Starfields actually hand made elements would vanish inside one neighborhood of Night City. 

They made like 25% of a game and then relied on procedural generation to hide it and hope we wouldn’t notice.
>Hell I'd settle for 2 planets if it was actually a fully realised hand-crafted map of the entire surface.

The only way that could be even close to feasible would be dwarf planets smaller than pluto. Pluto itself has as similar surface area as russia and a game the size of russia would be unbelievably massive.
Or a reveal that there was no Big Bad Evil Krampus snake...
I completely agree with you, but the whole idea was so half-baked. They don't explain why the grav drives destroyed Earth but not any of the other planets everyone lives on, and if there's some way to use grav drives without destroying planets why did they have to sacrifice Earth then? Absolutely, none of it makes any sense! I mean, if you have to try so hard to get it all to work, why not just say an asteroid blew up Earth or something instead of twisting in knots?
Yeah. It is strange that that old text-based dialogue system made me feel more immersed than the fully voiced characters in all of the later games. I really enjoyed being able to show up in a new town, looking for someone, and being able to ask everyone in town for information. Having all NPC lines voice acted these days vastly limits the variety and depth of the conversations you can have with them.
Preorders for shark cards, too, I bet.
This! Its like they made a big first person shooter and at the very end they were like "shit! People are expecting Skyrim in space?" And tacked on a few BGS RPG mechanics
Starfield has plenty of dark edges. It's a story about a shrunken husk of humanity which isn't really thriving making its way through a cold and uncaring galaxy. Most of humanity died because of the sheer arrogance of one man who knowingly threw them and earth away for the chance at seeing the stars. The difference is that Bethesda consciously (1) wanted to make a game with a different tone after how grim and bloody Fallout and The Elder Scrolls can be and (2) were in a partnership with NASA which obviously limits where they could go content wise.
I hate that I keep finding the exact same slate called "Opportunity!" with the exact same text about how this particular cobalt mine is going to really turn around someone's whole life. Instead of adding to the life and complexity of the environment, it reinforces the feeling that Starfield is just some pointless simulator designed to teach a set of combat skills rather than give you access to a unique and strange universe.
I wonder if they did originally intend to have a randomised structure, but couldn't proc-gen the usual Bethesda decor clutter well enough without restricting movement, leaving the random dungeons looking like a 90s bare corridor game. I just struggle to understand how they thought they could make a game with 1000 planets, but only 30 repeating dungeons between them. Even if the procgen didn't work, the CK system is simple enough that you could train an intern to churn out variants of dungeons using premade sections of rooms and corridors, to at least mix up the layout. 

For me it's the most painful thing about the game. I was fully expecting the landscapes to lack the handmade touches of previous games, but there's just no reason to go roaming when the POIs you find are all the same.
No it doesn't. It lets you skip only the main story, all the faction quests are played out the same with a few additional dialogues that amount to nothing.
once I beat it and read up on how NG+ works I uninstalled lmao I'm not playing the same drab campaign for the hopes of one of the few different universes. another game done in to me at least by the love of releasing incomplete games
My small detail like that was hearing everyone talk about how great BorealUS' music is on Aurora, so I take Aurora to slow time down... but the music doesn't slow down or change at all.
Not liking inquisition is a very popular opinion.
Doesn't seem that unpopular to me, haha. I think the DA community sort of splits on whether they loved the CRPG style of DAO or the Action Adventure RPG style of DAI. But it seems pretty clear that DAO is the better story, at least.
Inquisition suffered from getting packed full of empty full content. The maps were too big and some of the mechanics were just completely pointless or horrible.

The characters were great, the story was great, the lore is still solid, the combat was fine, but every MMO aspect and the inclusion of the REAL WORLD TIME WAITING PERIODS TO DEAL WITH THE MISSION TABLE *really* shit the bed in terms of delivering a solid game.
It appeals to shareholders and executives that simply don't play many/any games. Advertising your game as having hundreds of explorable planets does sound impressive if you take it at face value, afterall. And if some players do end up exploring that ankle deep content, then the business people get to brag about the  higher average of time spent in the game.

From a cynical business standpoint, shit like this still works. That's the sad part. Look how many people here still vehemently defend the game's exploration like their life depends on it. Most of them probably have sub 50 hours in the game so the illusion still hasn't been shattered yet. But that's all that matters: you make the game seem much more vast than it actually is.
Three actually
Oh I know Skyrim had a hundred variations of the same nordic ruins everywhere. Dungeons and draugr. Caves and draugr. Cemeteries and… damn draugr!

I guess the point is that, at least there were a hundred variations, and not just the same half-dozen dungeons copy/pasted all around the map. Starfield absolutely has fewer unique locations than their past games.
I’m about 40 hours in and honestly navigating that map is such an unpleasant experience. I feel like there has to be a better way to get around but there’s not. 
I could also be dumb.
Sometimes fast travel immediately puts me where I ask to be, other times I’m back in my ship and have to navigate 3 loading screens just to continue on…
Go back and see how many of those accounts are now deleted. The botting is definitely real
Common shill tactic that happens in most subs of all these blunder games. Sticks out like a sore thumb. I wonder which agency employs these people.
Yep and the war even gave them a lore justification why much of the areas surrounding the big settlements could be less advanced/ still in a rebuilding phase, or that there isn't a lot of money going into re-building because despite the peace both sides are putting heavy funding into their militaries so as not be caught out in the event of another war.
That was what they did to get it out the door.  But a large portion of its devtime was spent making this vast explorable galaxy with hundreds of procedurally generated worlds...and then they had to switch gears when they realized hundreds of essentially empty worlds wasn't fun.
Honestly, the problem for me is that ME:A was even an open world game in the first place.

The original games had open world sections (of varying quality), but for the most part, each location was either hub or a one and done location.

Sure, you could choose the order you visited them to an extent, but for the most part, they served as a stage to tell the story. 

Limiting player freedom meant the original trilogy was able to tell a much more engaging and immersive story.
I tried it on my first playthrough but I also ignore them, much as I did with Skyrim.
Exactly! It’s spread so thin.
> They made like 25% of a game and then relied on procedural generation to hide it and hope we wouldn’t notice.

Some early game journalists asked if they were concerned about how people might view content and they said modders would add whatever they felt like. Sure, modding is good, but being THAT reliant on consumers to finish your product for you speaks of being either creatively bankrupt or so over-managed they couldn't think outside of direct orders.
The point wasn't that they game isn't grim dark, there's just very little drama. The writing often shys away from allowing choices or creating stories that could have broad implications. The planets are particularly disappointing--take a look at the concept art, they could have gone a little more sci-fi with it and made some really cool places.

What makes you think humanity is a shrunken husk that isn't thriving?  Really curious here. EARTH is a husk, yay, but there's very little sign of real struggle except bandits and the dangers of colonizing new worlds. Even the Crimson Fleet are basically puppy dogs. Even though lore-wise we only ever seen.. what.. 1000 npcs? Supposedly there are fully populated cities and colonies across colonized space.

I dunno about any partnership with NASA, but if that means you gotta keep your game PG then it wasn't worth it. They could have called it something else and lost essentially nothing.
There has to be a story behind it. I can't imagine a AAA dev thought repeating POIs on 1000 planets was ok. 

Something has to happen during development where they went "fuck it, this is all we can do with it"
You meet at least 4, The Coe kid, the two in akila, and one from the Sarah romance quest
Hell the 1st game could have told them that.

Driving around in a mostly barren landscape in the Mako is terrible
They are heavily imbalanced too;

Antigravity field lets you kill anything in the game once you get it if you can just kite the enemies while on cooldown. It’s OP as shit.

Then you have ones that sound cool but actually do nothing; the one that lets you see the path enemies will walk. Sure I could use the power; or in the time it took to open my menu and slot the power, I could have just observed the route the enemy was walking.

It seems like there was a brainstorm of cool power ideas, and they they were added and never tested.
So thin that it is kinda hard to find said cities by just exploring. Need someone to send you there
Space is vast so I figure you would always need directions but there’s so little to do once you get there and no reason to open explore, no reason to capture other ships, no reason to create outposts.
and that is the problem with exploration.  The game will send you everywhere there is something interesting.  While you CAN stumble upon things, There aren't may interesting things you HAVE to stumble across to find.

I would also like to know the logic behind random encounters and shit.  I've played the game a lot and there are still random encounters I've never had but have had a number of others multiple times over.  Yeah, yeah extended warranty this stopped being funny 10 encounters ago.
I find it really hard to believe that the feedback about walking large distances was never given in playtesting.
Todd Howard said the lack of vehicles was "intentional", but for the life of me, i can just not see how anyone playtesting planets in this game did not complain or even simply bring up the walking distances. 800meters 600 meters 400 meters. Its simply boring. You start to wonder if there is a culture of not voicing negative feedback during playtesting at Bethesda. They said that they used to use fuel until playtesting....so? whats the deal here. do they just listen to some feedback and not others?
What's interesting is that the distances are too far and also *not far enough.* You should not be able to stand on top of a civilian outpost on a desert planet in a backwater system and see a spacer base and also an undiscovered obelisk and, oddly, the same civilian outpost all between you and the horizon.

These distances should be vast. You should need a rocket buggy going 100 mph to get between them. Instead they're just close enough to be immersion-breaking and just spaced far enough away to be tedious to travel between.
"We're in the future and exploring planets!"

"Cool! Can't wait to drive my moon buggy!"

"Erm..."

"What? You can't??... Ah well, I guess I'll just land my ship closer to my objectives."

"..."

"Motherf-"
I feel like a lot of the time anything that's said to be a "creative decision" is just a way to ass cover for something they did badly. 

Forgot or couldn't get ground transport working properly? It wasn't a failure, it was on purpose from the get go.

To be fair, maybe they couldn't get the horse movement programs working when they applied them to rovers or something.
Maybe they did and Todd just told them that the lunar astronauts had to walk long distances or some shit like that
Todd said they have AI running though the quests. So yeah... thats that.
Either Todd or Pete (I don't remember which) said the choice to exclude vehicles was to control the pace at which the player experiences exploration (or some version of that.) They were trying to frame it as "we want to make sure you take it all in" 

My guess is that, in practical terms, everything on the planet breaks if you have a vehicle. Imagine seeing dangerous fauna; you whip donuts around it while it tries to get you with its two attack animations until you get bored and go park on top of a mountain to snipe it. Or you lob a bunch of grenades at a spacer base then go drive to the opposite side and rush in while they're all looking for you. Or hell, just run them over. I bet it becomes really unimmersive really fast. 

It also demands additional AI, attack animations, enemy vehicles, etc. 

ALSO, It's always possible that the game just can't handle the player going any faster than a jetpack assisted hop.

They say "intentional" and then they're vague about the reasons, and I think that's because the reasons are practical limitations they don't want to admit to.
I think they were given all the time in the world and energy drinks. Sure the game is OK if you got alot of time and nothing better to do. The game fails to deliver meaningful content within 2 hours of play unless you are grinding story or faction missions for bugs
As much as I have enjoyed my playthrough. I have to agree about the lack of POIs on most planets. Worse yet is the stuff that pops up are exact cut and pastes of others, even down to random loot and junk locations. Couldn't the engine muster a little more randomization?

Edit - typos
Emile said he doesn't give a fuck about your criticism.  He ignores it, so chances are he didn't care what the playtesters said.  He is going to do what he does, and that is make poor game design choices
People will defend it saying the engine can't handle vehicles but jeez. They started the games production  7 years ago on the skyrim creation engine. They KNEW they wanted huge open worlds and the ability to fly to many difrent worlds (earlier concepts were bigger in scale) they KNEW from the start the engine could never handle vehicles! But they decided to just modify it instead of spending the time creating a modern robust engine.

The Game feels lazy with allot of effort put into the wrong areas. Like oh wow, allot of wp-content and worlds into places that's boring to explore. "It's meant to be borring. The moon was borring in 1969" atleast we brought a buggy to the moon!
For so many issues it feels like it started out as pure "Space Simulator" and features were cut again and again because they either didn't work or as a knock on effect when some other feature was cut and a completely different thing stopped making sense/working.

I know Bethesda should have done a better job, but honestly I'm so excited for the mod kit, because while they didn't make a very good feature rich game they did provide us with an excellent blank canvas.
Couldn’t care less about land vehicles, have no issue walking long distances. It’s just that there’s nothing at all interesting encountered in those long distances
I wish I could fly the ship I spent hours customizing.
The fall of Bethesda came hard and fast with Starfield. They were my favorite game studio for the past 15 years and now I’m just so so so disappointed. 

It’s not even that they fucked up with Starfield, it’s that I have not heard one single acknowledgment from them about the state of the game and all the things they could improve on. Their response as far as I’ve seen has essentially been “it’s the fault of the players if they aren’t having fun.” Like WHAT?!? The game low key blows, stop pretending it’s a misunderstood masterpiece.
Honestly this reminds me of the First Mass Effect game, there were empty planets that took up a large time to explore and the second game got rid of them because people did not like that aspect of the first game
Tinfoil hat theory that I have no hard evidence to backup:

I imagine a lot of testing done in-house is about interactions, scripts, etc. Making sure that things trigger when/how they should, etc, so function not fun. It wouldn't surprise me if while doing a lot of verification, devs were running around with "player.setav speedmult 350" for efficiency/productivity. 

>!For the curious, the number I picked is about the limit of sprinting between POI on planets before "hangs" started to become noticeable/frequent on my hardware. This would be a fun speed for a compact/light hovercraft for exploration. Even 250 is fine if they wanted to be safer with movespeeds for older hardware.!<
I'm fine with the boost pack. I just wish it gave more of a thrust. Just make it faster or use less fuel per jump.
Todd Howard is an idiot and needs to be fired.

No vehicles works in fallout because there's something Round every corner. The planets in starfield are huge and empty.

Also, give me a fucking working compass Todd. I shouldn't have to wander around lost while trying to find the ocean I purposely landed next to so I could scan some stupid water creature.

This game is so frustratingly bad in so may simple to solve ways.
Honestly it wouldnt be nearly as bad if the worlds werent that boring. Yes there are some nice landscapes but overal its not fun to explore them. They could have added like tiny randomized details.
Because we're all stupid and will buy whatever they put out there. It's written between the lines of their responses to the negative reviews.
Maybe Todd just did Todd again.

He was adamant on the fact that not having NPC in Fo76 was the idea of the decade, the community told him he was wrong, but he went anyway because he knew better, then he said he wasn't in charge of the game and let the team fixes his mess ...

I'm pretty sure the lack of vehicle was intentional, and I'm pretty sure BGS received a lot of feedback about it during the playtests.

\\o/.
Most of the feedback was given in playtesting for sure. They obviously ignored it and disagree. Same reason they are arguing against people’s dream reviews.
Never have I once hit an invisible wall, and I've seen many landmarks further than 1000m away that are marked when you bring up the scanner.
The lack of vehicles is intentional the same way my lack of exersize is intentional.

I don't want to do that shit, they didn't want to make that shit.
  Todd Howard irritates me.  It's tail wagging the dog. Cart before the horse. "Walk because I think you should", instead of "throughout time, humans have searched for and invented making locomotion easier. So yes, we have space scooters ". He's so flipping arrogant.
Running out of fuel sucked if it stranded you.  The only answers for that were, "screw you, start over!" Or make fuel so widely available in each and every system it just becomes a menial chore to keep playing.  Dealing with extreme environments or ailments spices up gameplay if you're unprepared, but it wouldn't softlock your game, so it sucks those were neutered.

But on ro the main topic, the problem with walking distance isn't necessarily the lack of rovers, though it hurts.  The problem is the lack of anything interesting while crossing that distance.

There are no spacer camps, no special rare beasts, random crashed habs or orbital debris, etc.  There are many "minor" PoIs dotted across planets, but almost all of them are some abandoned mining rig, gas extractor, spherical or cylindrical silo, solar array, material shed, etc.  I don't want vehicles/mechs to traverse the open world faster, I want these things so I can intercept spacer vehicles/mechs on planet surfaces, maybe a kaiju?  Maybe for bounty hunters to repel down from a small hovering ship and actively hunt me down for a change.

More PoI variety would be nice, vehicular transport would be welcome, but making planet surfaces more interesting is imperative.
Starfield was not play-tested beyond the main questline.
I loooove when you get given a quest at an outpost, to go find an injured civilian and escort them back to the outpost. They typically end up being 1800-2000m away… and you have to walk, not sprint back the entire way.

Too many damned times ive sprinted ahead so the npc woukd actually pick up the pace.. only to have them aggro a mob behind me.
It just works
I can't say if it's the case for Starfield, but a lot of games can't have your character move any faster due to technical reasons. Bethesda's engine is held together with duct tape, so I wouldn't be surprised if that's actually the reason though.

An example is Dragon Age: Inquisition. Horses had a sprint animation, but they didn't actually move any faster.
Look at what happens when people voice genuine concerns of the game, you get Bethesda employees making excuses and defending poor choices rather then taking the criticism. Imagine now if this was an employee making those criticisms.

"Mr Howard, these long distances are a awful and make the game boring"

"You little shit do you think Neil Armstrong was bored on the moon????"
There are times I love walking and exploring.

There are times I would sacrifice a 1st born for an electric atv.
Todd lies. A lot.
With a great jetpack mod, the distance is not an issue for me. What is though, is the fun factor a vehicle would bring. Sometimes I just wanna drive around a planet. Come to think of it, though, maybe they left out vehicles because the planets have limits and a vehicle would make planets feel small. Perhaps they wanted to avoid that as they guess people would get bored even faster than they do now.
Having vehicles bug out on the majority of rough topology is not going to change your opinion about the planet survey gameplay loop lol.
Bc I can guarantee you the people making those kids of decisions are the corporate fat cats who have never written a line of code in their life. So they get Todd to be their mouthpiece, I'm sure there were concerns but the fat cats didn't care. Just shove it out and make us our money peasant
I mean, you literally have a jet pack, and even that at full rank is still not a useful vehicle for crossing vast distances. It would be the perfect fix for this problem.
Because they probably typed commands to teleport wherever they needed to be.
Once I discovered why "skip packs" have that name it didn't bother me nearly as much.  

For those who hadn't realized it, if you sprint for a few steps then jump, you will keep your running speed through the jump.  If you ALMOST touch ground but instead boost with your jet pack, you will get a second jump in without touching the ground.  The key is that you only pay the O2 cost for sprinting while your feet are touching the ground.  This means you will be able to move at a sprinting pace for a very long time before you need to stop for a breather.  This kind of "skipping" with your boost pack can allow fairly rapid traversal of the landscape.  AND you can skip right over ruts and ravines that would probably wreck a buggy.

Now, as to why I can't land closer to a POI, or for that matter, blast the holy hell out of an enemy outpost with ship's weapons?  I have no excuse or explanation.
Some of the worst are when you find an injured explorer by a POI and they ask you to escort them to their ship... 1.5km away... in the opposite direction of where you were trying to go...

Now I'm just a horrible person and ignore them. Sucks to be you, buddy. At least you'll be with your friends soon....in the belly of that lovecraftian horror over there. 🤷‍♂️

If I'm feeling particularly evil, I'll pickpocket you first. What are you gonna do - bleed on me?

Aw crap. Sarah didn't like that. 😕
PC + console commands FTW.   Pick one and suck it Todd.  ┌∩┐( ⇀ ‸ ↼ )┌∩┐
Lol what play testing?
Nobody played the game... Marketing did a wonderful job
fck this game is so boring. first time i uninstalled a bethesda game after 10hrs of playtime. so disjointed and immersion breaking
It's intentional because the creation probably can't handle vehicles on planetary surfaces.
I hate the janky fett booster pack nonsense. Give me a vehicle I want a dune buggy to do big jumps with and have fun getting to different points quickly.
For better or worse, Todd wants people playing the game for long stretches of time. Vehicles or less spaced POIs would dramatically shorten the content that Starfield boasts. Seems to me to be a disconnect between valuing time played and the amount of fun experienced for the time played. Todd wants the former, not realizing that the latter is all that matters.
I love walking long distances on planets with abundant life
They only acknowledge the feedback that validates their laziness and lack of passion. Anything not fitting that was ignored. Anything critical sounding was ignored. This is what people do.
Another thing in the subject - how come almost every planet and moon (even remote and pretty much uninhabitable ones) have a shit ton of bases, mines, outposts, labs, etc? I really hoped to feel truly alone and lost at least on some planets but it turnes out that even the worst shitholes are civilized in some way. This breaks the immersion and I feel like even pretty old game like Mass Effect did it better with its uncharted worlds. Sure, most of them had some sort of settlement but usually there was only one in the huge area (and often it was implied that this part of planet might be the only one with something worth investigating)- in Starfield there is something manmade every 500 meters, wherever you land. It's just ridiculous.
Haven't you seen all their responses to people who complain about the walking distances in their steam reviews?

*"OH but its soo beautiful!  We didnt want you to miss the beauty of it all! Dont you think its just all so beautiful!  You should spend more time enjoying it!  ...and besides, we gave you a jetpack to wear so you hop and fly!"*

Well... uh.  No, Bethesda... I don't, think its all so very beautiful... I think its all very repetitive and somewhat bland... and frankly, boring.

...and I put that, in MY .. lengthy, steam review... and I'm waiting, for some Bethesda person to reply to it.
I think vehicles would be fun and from the sounds of it, necessary for some people. Also, if there was just a little bit more to do or discover.  Adding some secrets and more cool discoveries could change the narrative!
I assumed they were downtime for loading
I think needing fuel would add a bit of a challange. Needing to have credits to pay for fuel, and actually spending fuel when going places without free fill ups. I like the game, I love playing it, but some things like a vehicle, or needing fuel to add a somewhat of a challanege would be nice. Like actually needing to plan routes and not just flying back and forth wherever you want.
In this game you walk more than Sam and Frodo.  With all this technology, you can't have a dune buggy to explore the new worlds easier?  After scanning one planet to near 100%, I'll never do it again.  Walking 900 Meters to a cave with a bunch of bugs in it only to find an ammo box is ridiculous.  And don't get me started on the NPCs "Can I talk to you when you have a minute?" Dear God, please not with another life story.  The space flights and combat mechanics are excellent.  All in all, I like the game.  There could be improvements though.
Would it be too hard for them to make a quick hover scooter? Take the vehicle framework from power armor, add in a new animation for hopping in, and make its running a smooth and high speed glide over the surface. Make a ship module to carry it and deploy it whenever you don't land on a landing pad. Maybe let us buy/customize it to have storage capacity, weapons, better speed, etc.
Land vehicles would be awesome but there has never been anything I wanted to check out less than 2 minute walk away.
Yeah when I tried Starfield, I landed on two random planets, took a stroll round to see what kinda content is there.

Noped out immediately after the second planet, it's actually insulting how the devs think how little we value our time.

"hahah these dicks will walk around for 20 minutes on an empty planet with the same bit locations, right? hahha of course they will, they're dicks"
It was intentional because that can’t figure out how to implement it properly.
It's true that it's boring walk for 400 mt. But I've to say that if there was some king of vehicle probably the speed would be the same. The only change would be press W to move the vehicle instead of press W to move character. The run speed it's pretty speedy and give you the chance to use boost pack, other ways you don't use it and less scan probably.
why you need to walk there? I mean if there is a good reason walking in the game is nor big problem. If there is not - don’t do it. Or walk for a pleasure of space vistas.
I’d be interested to see a game based entirely on playtest feedback. I think it would look a lot like that car Homer designed.
I really get the feeling the game was unfinished.  I bought a couple ships that have ramps and stairs.  
Why put in a ramp if it won't be used, especially when stairs are included.
I suspect they intended it as a journey, not just a constant-gratification simulator.  Some folks will vibe with that, and some won’t.
having vehicles would have helped this game to not feel 15 years old at launch . star field sucks
I'm pretty confused by this post. It's entirely possible they had people give feedback saying the walking was too and they still intentionally went without having vehicles. 

>do they just listen to some feedback and not others?

Not acting on feedback isn't the same as not listening, lol.
With Amp and Personal Atmosphere it's no big deal.
Or, do you find it hard to believe that people enjoy planet exploration as is? Because I do. I enjoy the emptiness. I enjoy the realism OF the emptiness. Space is empty. Like, HELLA empty. It reminds me of the Capital Wasteland in that aspect.
It’s a gameplay feature, not a problem.
Just take some AMP
Todd said in that first interview video that having no ground transportation was a conscious decision. So I guess they did think about it, and decided against it for whatever reasons.

I'm not sure I disagree. I kinda like jet-packing around, and I'm good at it now. 

Anyway, it is what it is.
Adding vehicles, even just a simple rover, would be a much bigger deal than you probably think. If they added a purely land vehicle then they would have to make the decision of whether to allow it on all planets or not. If not, people would complain so let's assume they decide to have it on all planets. Now they need to add modifiers to the proc gen system so that the vehicle is actually usable. This means they would either need to make everything flat so remove all the mountains and craters and crevices, or theybwould need to program in that a path is always available meaning on worlds with a dense forest that is supposed to be largely uninhabitated would have weirdly clear roads for you to travel on.

This would limit how much exploring people would do because if they saw something off the path then they would have to leave the rover to go to it and since people would complain if there was no enter/exit animation they would have to sit through the 2 seconds of getting out then getting back in and we all know gamers these days don't have time for that.

Basically the game is already basically the foundation of something that could be amazing but adding vehicles would have required taking away from the already basic systems we already have.
I don't feel like it's that different from Bethesda's other RPGs. A minute or two of overland running between waypoints with occasional enemies or random encounters is pretty similar to a lot of road journeys in the older games.

And if you just want to get into some trouble, bounty missions and POIs you can see from space involve a lot less running.

My guess is that people who didn't like running around on the surface of these planets mostly just chose to skip it. Or they did it while scouting, which adds more to do instead of just sprinting from waypoint to waypoint.
Meanwhile there's a whole group of people complaining that things are too close together on the planets. They feel like it's not fair they can see another place from where they land. 

They literally cannot please everyone. It's gonna be stuff that is 50/50. 

Yes I would love the option for a vehicle PlanetSide, it gets boring for me to walk that far. Plus I'm a packrat rat, and by the time I get to where I'm walking I can't loot there caise I'm full up. 🤷‍♀️
The lack of vehicles ruins the immersion for me. I can’t believe in the settled cities people aren’t using a type of scooter or a bike to get around. Hoverboards would have been so cool.
It's either of two things, desperately trying to force you to be as least likely as possible to hit the zone barriers because they didn't really put planets in the game.

Or endlessly ignoring feedback because they're just so convinced they're in the right.
My thoughts are that, realistically, it was left in place so you could still have planets that were procedurally generated but saved in place in your game file.  It quite possibly could be that if you walked every planet to its fullest, that the save would eventually corrupt or crash due to the size of the file.  Adding vehicles would increase the opportunity that this might occur.  So it’s likely they made the decision to allow saves of entire planets but left out vehicles to minimize the chances of this occurring.  This point is also backed up with the idea that most game Save info is reset/erased in each NG+.  Just a guess though, I haven’t heard anything to back this up.
The real reason is because there's invisible walls on the planets when you land. On foot, it takes about 9-10 minutes at a full sprint in one direction to hit it from your landing spot. Most people aren't going to venture that far from their ship. Hell, I never hit one until I intentionally ran until I found one. If they had vehicles, those walls would be *way* more apparent.
I don't believe Bethesda listens to any negative feedback. Just look at their comments to the negative reviews... it's everyone else's fault, not theirs. We're apparently playing wrong.
In 25 years of production they couldn’t figure this out
This!  This is one of the things that’s been bugging the hell out of me but I couldn’t quite figure out how.  Settled areas are individual POIs from one giant universal pool and placed close enough to be on the same map, instead of the settlement being a central defining feature and generating a new landing site map for each settled area from curated settlement-specific POIs.  Each landing map should be defined by a central feature - ie, Settlement, Temple, Wilderness - that sets the theme for everything around it on that map and determines what other POIs can spawn in that map instead of “blarf, here’s terrain and options from all the POIs.”  You could *almost* see that happening with the Temples - the weird floaty shit doesn’t spawn unless there’s a Temple on the planet, for instance - but it didn’t prevent anything *else* from getting placed there.  If they had procgen infrastructure placed that connects Settlement-class maps through Wilderness-class maps and serves as a loading buffer between maps A and B, vehicles would make a hell of a lot more sense.  Hell, that’s basically why we invented vehicles in the first place.  Have the settled systems actually be *settled* and give each settled planet a handful of hubs you can drive out from and then radio back to your ship “hey, come pick me up” to move it to that map.
If they contend that it would have resulted in more loading screens - I know the engine can only generate so much terrain - then I'd posit it would have at least been less painful if it had a system like Fallout 2's world travel. Take the player out to the terrain map, have them pick a destination, and then have time accelerate while their little pip moves across the landscape. Heck, allow for random encounters too, just like F2 did. Then when they arrive at their destination, load into the new instance and return to first person. At the very least it would've felt like you were exploring some absolutely huge map, instead of just wandering around the emptiness on foot.
one of the things that bugs me, there's no roads, there's no paths, nothing. You see a settlement, and there's out buildings and support structures like extractors and stuff scattered around, but never a sign that anyone ever uses them, or maintains them. No one goes into or out of these settlements. They have 4 people. No landing pad, no indications or signs saying where you are or where to go. Just a couple buildings, you can walk right in.
They really just needed to turn up the chaos on the maps and make them really mountainous and blocked off.
I just wanted to plop a base down on mars like in the Martian, alone with nothing else around me. Instead I literally cannot find a place that isn't cluttered with stuff. Yet at the same time it's really unpleasant to walk between said stuff.
>  Instead they're just close enough to be immersion-breaking

me when i found a mining outpost full of dead miners less than 1000 meters from New Atlantis and one of them having an audio log mentioning how they can't get out or whatever and he wishes he had spent more time with his family and hopes that the message reaches them in New Atlantis.

so apparently these people were killed or had some sort of accident right outside New Atlantis and nobody knew? and apparently they'd probably be undiscovered for quite awhile? like the message was acting as if he was on a planet in another system thats super far away be he was like 5 minutes away from the city and his family
I feel like late in development someone turned the "point of interest spacing" parameter down by a factor of 100 when it was realized the only transport system that was ready to ship was walking.
Take a run through New Atlantis and tell me the game engine could handle a rocket buggy 😂
>and oddly the same civilian outpost

Thats the other big thing: the “landing area” cell its procedurally generated but the random points of interest are neither procgen themselves nor in a large enough pool of potentials to avoid immediately noticing repetition.  Seeing two adjacent settlements with random layouts makes enough sense to fit into suspension of disbelief (especially if they’re thematically similar, like two mining camps) or be justifiably explained.  What doesnt make sense is seeing two science settlements and thinking “this is occupied by hostiles, outside are two guys at this window, four in that room, a master lock here, an aa-12 gun rack there, interior hallway leading to frozen stairwell, this door is blocked that hallway collapsed, dead scientist with this name in the back of that vent holding a data slate for this specific blacksite project” and it being *exactly the same* not only between both labs. but **every other cryo lab you will ever encounter on any planet anywhere** except that it’ll’ be black/red/blue suits occupying.
Agree 100%. They want to convey the emptiness of space, but there’s stuff built everywhere, even on the most random planet. And unfortunately, the exact same building plan was used for every structure. And research facilities are the exact same with people in the exact same places. All relay stations are built the exact same, over and over.
> You should need a rocket buggy going 100 mph to get between them.

If you use console commands to walk 100mph, you quickly realize why the only transportation mode is walking. The engine is a hot mess and anything higher than a 1.25x speedmult results in loading locks and popping. 

It's not that the game lacks vehicles, it's that the game is _too slow to support vehicles_.

There's a reason all the takeoff scenes point upward.
And this is exactly why the game was doomed to get negative reviews from the start.

Jam them together: people complain about immersion

Spread them apart: people say the worlds are empty

Vehicles don't solve the problem either. They are fun at first, but then it's going to turn into an annoying feature to have to rely on them fast.

It doesn't matter how your arrange them, what vehicles you add, or what fast travel system the game uses, people are still going to be upset about any outcome. I've never seen a space game that managed to pull it off, and I think that such a game isn't possible. Planets are boring, and I say that as someone who has spent my degree studying the geology that would appear on them (not directly the planets, but the principals of earth apply to them).
best critique of a feeling i couldn't put into words; thanks a lot
I just landed 1km away from a PoI I could see from orbit but can’t land closer to. The landing spot was only 300m from a randomly generated structure full of pirates. wtf BGS?
There’s also nothing in between these POI’s that capture your attention. 

In their other games you may come across something handcrafted but with starfield there is nothing interesting except more materials or a creature not worth fighting
It would be great to have a speeder bike, or a surface shuttle pod or something that doesn’t have wheels to make the exploration smoother. SOMETHING. 

When I do go exploring I setup a hot key command to set player movement speed at 300% normal and another that takes it back to default. At first I was ok with modding out every element I disliked or changing some values. Then I realized when I was describing the game to someone who would have to play on console, I could never play vanilla version of this game ever again.
Exactly, and most are not worth exploring. The planet version of worthless desk clutter.
Mass Effect Andromeda got this right and comparing Andromeda to anything favourably shaves years off my life.
This was especially jarring to me when I visited Luna hoping to find the original lunar lander by referencing official NASA maps against the render in the game which uses those same maps, and instead found hundreds of the same structures filling up every 100m area of open space where the lander should have technically been. I get that from a lore standpoint humans would have built a lot of things on the moon once space travel became trivial, but still.
Its not that the distance is too long.

Its that there's nothing to do between them.

RDR2 is a good comparison: yes you have a horse, but it's not super fast. The main difference is that there's always something that pops up between your POI
Or to just be able to fly your ship in the atmosphere of the planet
I dont mind seeing another Outpost, what bugs me is that POIs are not grouped together to form village like structures. I would fully expect Mines, Outposts, Factories etc to be grouped together in a much smaller distance to give the feeling of an Outpost being there that does something. This would ofc require for POIs to also have working versions. The only things i would expect to stand alone would be natural, Military Bases and secret research facilities as there main purpose is to be remote. Obelisks and Temples are a problem on their own because there is no way they would be missed and the way they are added into the game is simply illogical.
Also the fact that a large portion of abandoned locations are not ''shocker'' abandoned, because the resident Pirates, Spacers and Mercs just happened to have moved in sometime before that.   


Now I don't like an empty bland location, but it doesn't always have to be named abandoned, why not \*'faction claimed (insert location type here)' instead.   


And why not a few cool surprises., like companion robots and creatures, or a fleet ships to be flown by employable mercs/robot etc, that you can add to your faction instead and send on assignments (similar to crew).   


Just seems like (with many Bethesda games)  opportunities are presented but completely ignored. And with starfield they have a lot of opportunity.
Last sentence sums it up nicely.
This is exactly how Star Citizen has done it.

You can visit one outpost, and see nothing... for miles and miles and miles...

You DO need a buggy, or vehicle or ship... to travel between planetary outposts.

Their Planets and Moons are so vast, and their vehicles are so fun, that players have started an annual event called [The Daymar Rally](https://www.daymarrally.com/), that the Developers have now endorsed... 

The Daymar Rally involves teams of Drivers who have to race their vehicle across the surface of the moon Daymar and the length of the race is so vast that it takes a full day (real time) to complete.   

Its a "survival" race, because its no holds barred, weapons free Race.   Pirates and Griefers (real players) can attack you along the way.... but the race promoters also have hired Security (also real players) on hand to combat those.... its become such a huge event that it takes months to plan and organize each year... many of the Race teams are even sponsored by real world big businesses and organizations and such, and they live stream their team during the Race.
Completely agree. Honestly if it were me I would’ve embraced the empty space and survival mechanics. I wouldn’t put automatic and random points of interest everywhere on the planet. I would get rid of making every point of interest in the UI also. Instead I would make the user have to solve clues to get to a specific destination. If you want to find an outpost with space pirates you have to get a clue first by intercepting a ship or extracting info from someone in the city. Maybe even scanning the planet if you have good sensors. That clue would point you in the right direction and then tell you where to land. Then once you land maybe like the other commenter was saying rather than fitting 5 points of interest on the map, just make it one and leave clues on how to get there. Maybe there’s a satellite dish you have to hack or something to tell you where the base is. Maybe add a way to use a scope or something. 

The whole concept of Skyrim in space was bound to fail. You can’t populate a galaxy with thousands of points of interest. The closest you can get is No Man’s Sky. Instead make it about survival and solving puzzles and using clues to find things in the vast empty landscape, thus leading to a sense of reward when you reach your destination. The problem with my approach is it’s a very specific niche and won’t be for everyone, but they got themselves into a mess by designing a game for everyone. 

That being said I think Starfield is a pretty damn good game and people are being overly critical about it.
I have one pirate base that is so close I can snipe the pirate standing guard from my outpost.
I kept trying to land my ship on different parts of earth, only to wind up not even close to where I intended.
I wish they would even have phones in the future. "Hey, I need you to go and deliver this message to another solar system because apparently all we have is Starware computers and you cannot send emails, and we don't even have phones. So please jump into your ship and go deliver my message"
Honestly. The inability to fly around in the upper atmosphere is mind boggling
Todd Howard must have a religious intolerance for moving vehicles. Been wishing for a drivable vehicle since Fallout 3.
I think this is probably the case with many things. No land vehicles? Prob because it would require some system for docking them on ships, issues with rendering terrain and the explorable area size, maybe their engine doesn’t really have the ability to do them well. All things that could be fixed one way or another but the resources required did not make it seem worth it.
They couldn't get elevators working.
Even they had a buggy, didn’t they?
they feel like they were written by AI
They had that but they also had every single Microsoft QA tester for several months
They should train AI to analyze the game code and fix those fucking bugs that have been there since Skyrim and were never fixed.
Well when all your quests are just ad libs then you can certainly create a bot to solve them with ease.
They’re a small indie company give them a break! This is their first IP in 25 years! /s

Where did he say this?
The game struggles when I sprint in cities lol, it def couldn’t handle vehicles
As far as travel speed goes, just going as fast as the PC sprints would be enough. And there's already an asset in the game that would serve the function. They could take one of those four-legged robots, remove the gun on its back, and put a seat on top of it. It would essentially just be a robot horse, but it would serve the purpose.

They could even require you to have a module on your ship for carrying it to be able to use it.
My series X choked on The Hunter’s attack on New Atlantis. NPCs running everywhere along with all the Starborn animation at the Spaceport. Could you imagine dealing with that at every POI you visit?
I mean it's not like most of the areas you explore are that large or dense to be honest. I think it's really just you'd be able to haul ass to each temple easy and they couldn't market play time as easy if it could be shortened.
I don't buy the excuse they gave. I bet the engine just struggled to keep up, so they decided 'no vehicles'.

You do raise valid points about the required changes in gameplay though. They could mitigate that by keeping the vehicles slowish, just a bit faster than sprinting. 

Low grav planets would probably open up a whole other physics-related can of worms though.
Tbh I don't think it's an engine problem, I think it's a way to artificially inflate the length of content while acting like it's a feature 

There's very few cases to compare this to in development but we have 1 public scenario to look at. World of Warcraft and dragonflight did the same thing for flying mount speed, they reduced it to 80% in older areas because it made distances "feel trivial" 

So if we assume starfield devs think in a similar way, then with starfield they had the mentality that trekking and hiking across proc gen terrains are sort of like the new kind of "puzzle" to be solved during the game, an upgraded alternative to the twists and turns in skyrims dungeons or fallouts vaults

Which it obviously isn't
The repeated POIs mean there’s only one planet in the game. All that changes is the background and colour schemes. What colour do you prefer while you go and complete the same activities over and over again. Whoever thought this was a good idea sincerely ruined the entire game. They also completely ruin immersion because you’re constantly finding “undiscovered” natural formations next to active farms and abandoned factories. I guess those people are all blind.
When did he say that?
This is what I cannot rationalize lore-wise. Primitive NASA could get a buggy on the moon in the 1960s but Nova Galactic, Deimos, Trident Staryards, Stratton, or Stroud-Eklund cannot manage it in the 2300s yet can build ships that warp space? The hell?
I agree with the blank canvas, I started making mods for Skyrim and while fallout felt really limiting in what mods would fit the genre starfield feels like I could make just about anything I want and it would fit. I can pretty much guarantee that we will be seeing full Star Trek and star wars conversions for starfield soon after the ck drops, I mean modders can literally make their own death star moon if they want!
70 bucks is a lot to ask for a "blank canvas". Especially one that's frayed and stained.
This might be a very unpopular opinion but I hope the modding community doesn't touch this game. I hope this game dies so Bethesda can maybe realize how unacceptable their games have become. They know the issues they just rely on "well it's a Bethesda game hehe" for sales. Skyrim and Fallout 3's success has followed Bethesda much too far. Fallout 4 was good but nothing special and ever since Bethesda has been flakey and unreliable. 

I am honestly surprised at how long Starfield fans held on saying "No no it's actually good you have to play for x hours before it's fun" no, Starfield is just mid.
Sure.   But all the best modders in the community have already given statements that they won't be making mods for Starfield.  Because they don't feel the game can be saved with mods.  

They think the game is too boring and one dimensional. No matter how much they tweak things.  Nothing can make up for that. 

If you're excited for what starfield COULD be.  You should instead look into Star Citizen. Or for a more flight centric approach.  Elite dangerous.
I'm worried, because some of the biggest Skyrim modders have started saying they aren't gonna even bother with Starfield because they don't think it's worth their time
That's my take when he talks about intentional choices. It's intentional cuz they just couldn't do bigger and better.
Or... hear me out... or you could just play a well designed game that is fun, works, and has actual thought and care in its development. I don't understand these Bethesda enabling mental gymnastics that people perform. It is mind-boggling. Why does this game company feel like a cult follows in its wake?

Skyrim was great and the older Fallouts were grand, but those games are long in the past. Bethesda has been putting out leather jacket backed turds ever since, and, oddly enough, Starfield is the most milquetoast turd of them all. It is an absolute clunky, cumbersome, tedious mess of a game with lackluster story, characters, combat, and exploration (which I feel is a supremely strong word for the fast travel, cutscene mess that it is).

This mentality truly baffles me. Well, they took ten years to put out some substandard barren trash, charged us a premium for it (stole our money considering the grandiose promises), but by golly gee wilikers, I think we can put in the labor to make it bearable. It's like Stockholm syndrome or something. Bethesda is abusing the trust of their exceedingly loyal fanbase by promising lofty goals, not delivering, charging a premium, and then expecting the public to do their work for them. It's almost criminal. I feel sorry for the developers who actually put effort in their work at Bethesda to try to deliver something great; but be it poor management, abysmal creative leads, or just a general lack of vision their efforts were for naught. Well, I guess I'll go do another Returnal run.
NakeyJakey made a point of this in a recent video. Skyrim has a lot of walking around as well, but Skyrim has tons and tons of random encounters and structures in-between for you to be infinitely side-tracked by. I'm not sure how Bethesda have regressed in that regard.
I saw three of the same random encounters with a dude who wanted me to escort him back to his ship. That's all I saw in like 80 hours of gameplay.
I hate to break it to you but the writing has been on the wall for years now when it comes to Bethesda becoming worse. They've had a slow fall from grace over a few games now exactly like Bioware. It's eerie even how similar the two studios are.
This is what realy bums me out. I really liked them, from Morrowind to Call of Cthulhu, and I do enjoy Starfield and want to see it succeed as a series on the whole, but I also feel really uncomfortable even writing that because I dont want Bethesda to think that a lot of what has happened with the development and release of the game is even remotely acceptable from a studio with as much clout and experience as theirs.
It's gaslighting. I genuinely feel as if I've just realised I've been in an abusive relationship for the past ten years.

On the one hand they claim Starfield will be a playground for modders; on the other hand, changing their file structure so it's actually HARDER for modders. 

Gaslighting.
Did you fall hard and fast from the dizzying heights of Fallout 76?
Atleast you had a VEHICLE
I didn't mind driving around in the janky mako really, it was kind of fun and shooting enemies with the cannon was fun.  One good thing Andromeda did was bring the mako back and also make the exploration more fun in it.
This is a simple fix that would go a long way.

Also they need to make the "forward jump" accessible on Xbox.
A skip pack goes more horizontal than a basic, balanced, or power version. It helps a teeny bit, esepcially on low G planets
I'm doing a lot of planet surveys and modded mine. I don't think it takes anything away in giving more distance horizontally, or even giving the player a slider in settings to modify it.
Are you aware that every boost pack has two fire modes. Up yes, but also forward?
Produce/procure Amp and set it as a favourite. Use it every time you’re about to take a hike, and you’ll get there at a much faster pace!
[deleted]
Or a map that actually shows the ground instead of dots. Seriously! they could take a jpg of the area your landing on or something?
There's a rudimentary compass, but you can't see it when you have your scanner pulled up.
After you scan that stupid water creature, there isn't even a menu where you can look at your scans. No Man's Sky had that at day one iirc
I'm fine with no cars, hell, without roads they might be impractical on the interesting planets anyway. But mechs exist in-world, why the fuck is none ever seen in use? Why can't we pilot one?!

And yes, I know they're contraband. They did that so they could have mechs in lore but not let you pilot one, it's dumb.
Needs a lot more unique landforms to break up that 'generic wavy procgen terrain'.
It reminds me of Blizzard's development of WoW between the Legion expansion and late Shadowlands - a lot of 'we know best actually' because they'd inherited a golden goose and been told how to 'feed it'. Doing the same stuff with a superior attitude did not work out, and thanks to introspection and a shakeup of management, they changed the development philosophy entirely. Now WoW is good again.

That's a lesson Bethesda ought to learn from.
there's even more you can see further away than that, they dont get marked until you get closer.  there's plenty of room
Oh ya, thanks for reminding me of my other complaint: ailments.

You know what's not fun? Combing through an inventory list for the item that fixes a particular ailment.

Remember in fallout how you can take rad away or a stimpack from the status menu?

Let us do that in Starfield's status menu. You are suffering burns? Show me the item that fixes that, how many I have in stock, and then give me a button to apply it without having to find it in my inventory first

Simple solutions Todd. Fucking clown.
>But on ro the main topic, the problem with walking distance isn't necessarily the lack of rovers, though it hurts.  The problem is the lack of anything interesting while crossing that distance.

That's exactly the problem. POIs supposed to be distraction points for player while they go their main marker. That was how they designed everything in FO4 or Skyrim. But in Starfield, POIs are the "main" target somehow. And there is nothing in between. That's not exploration. You literally *explore* that segment in 5 seconds after you land on that planet and scan around 360 degree. 

Most random event is ships landing to surface (which is not random, just a fixed POI that appears after animation) and even in that case they land miles away from you, and you need to run like a fat kid in a football match to catch it while hoping that it won't take off from the planet until you reach it
For the problem of getting stranded, they could have put a check in that would prevent players from jumping to a system if they didn't have enough fuel to jump back to a refueling station.
Or just not making fuel a mechanic at all
I'm with you on some of this. I'd like to see the settled systems tightened up and more unexplored planets with hostile life. The evidence of a planet not needing to be surveyed has been on every planet I've surveyed. There's derelict out of place industrial outposts, all apparently made for planets with breathable atmosphere, literally everywhere. Is the entire map the settled systems? If yes then why are we exploring?
[deleted]
You don't have to walk back. Just quick travel.
[removed]
I mean, we've all driven a Warthog by now. Everyone knows how much fun they are. Hasn't Halo been around for like 20 years? Adding something like that to Starfield would definitely make it more fun. Plus we could have moon racing.
With a laser on it, just like NMS
Deus Ex: Invisible War is one such game.
absolutely this - here's to the journey!
Jetpacks are fun, but they don't save you any time. Especially when half the game is running miles from the ship to the POI/temple. Their purpose is to let you move quickly while you let your o2 recover, but sprinting with personal atmosphere is way faster.
Was that the lex freidman podcast? If so I remember him also saying they didn't do it because he didn't think Bethesda fans would care enough about it lol
I think the best solution is to buff jetpacks. Let them be faster, use less fuel, make a new kind of pack, something. Skip packs exist but they're not great. PC has access to a forward jump which I've heard helps, but why not make that available on the Xbox? Then you solve the problem of not having to use ground vehicles but give the player an easier way to traverse the landscape.
Well, in Skyrim for example, you encounter all kinds of interesting things. In Starfield, there is NOTHING. All that space for nothing. Just another copy-pasted factory or research lab etc. In skyrim there was so many interesting locations, buildings, you name it.
Pretty similar to Skyrim road journeys? That’s a piping hot take you wild animal.
It’s both. The zones are both too small and too large. Just large enough to make running between POIs tedious, but just small enough that a vehicle would make clearing the random zone too easy and fast.
sounds like bad design if everything's both too close and too far away. no ones ever said anything like that about any other previous bethesda game. that's not people being contrarian and unreasonable, it's a fundamental design error.
> Meanwhile there's a whole group of people complaining that things are too close together on the planets. They feel like it's not fair they can see another place from where they land.
> 
> They literally cannot please everyone. It's gonna be stuff that is 50/50.

I'm not sure this is actually that much of a dichotomy. 

The complaint about things being too close is a realism-based complaint about ***distance***. (^(Personally I don't think POI density needs to be reduced, because rolling multiple for each landing site helps find rare POI more often. I'm still looking for you Abandoned Mining Platform grrr!))

The complaint about running between POI is a quality-of-life-based complaint about ***time***

If one does the math, this is solved by adressing ***speed***. In Witcher 3 you have Roach, in Elden Ring you have Torrent, in Mass Effect you have Mako, etc.
This guy designed a better planet system in 5 minutes than Bethesda did in 10 years. Absolutely nothing you said is particularly difficult from a game design POV either, simple rules and logics around assets use, and a slight redesign on the landing system to prioritise landing at settlements, and I refuse to believe that vehicles are too difficult to implement, and I'd bet my copy of Starfield that vehicles will be a part of a future update/DLC as a "we listened to the fans" reframing of Bethesda's omission.

People in this sub wonder why so many of us are so down on the game... This is why. Everything, every single thing in this game is touched by a lack of care or effort to varying degrees.
There's already been a mod out for a month or more that assings a ship summoning function on a hotkey. It even involves a visible liftoff and consecutive descent of your ship.

It's baffling that this is not a default function, or at the least a tech skill you can choose to spec into, or a device you can choose to install via the ship builder.

There have also been mods for the (native) dragon riding in the Skyrim Dragonborn DLC for YEARS. Could they not have allowed our ship or a smaller shuttle or hovercraft to do the same?

It's fine if we hit a cell boundary for the game to do either do a loading transition into the next cell, or give us a message that we can't go on (in-universe explanation could be that our exploratory craft is too far from the main ship to maintain comms or whatever).

It'd save so much wasted time jetpack-skipping to every next POI that just happens to be 500feet away. 

Give the exploratory vessels some mining lasers or weapons and you can even collect materials or raid pirate bases with them. Have enemy vehicles roam the perimeters of bases so you can have some cool vehicular combat as well.

They can easily limit the speeds of the vehicles so we don't outpace the engine's asset streaming capacities nor reach the cell boundaries too soon...

It's so obviously missing it's kind of grating they defended their choice so vigorously.
Can we get them to hire you? 

Honestly, you are so on point. Sarah Morgan stranded on a planet, she clearly didn’t see the derelict mining facility swarming with Crimson fleet 600 metres away. I was walking with her to the crash site, and another ship literally landed about 500 metres away, and a load of random NPCs just got out to take a stretch. 

I’ve actually not landed on a planet and felt like I was the first one there. The map is always littered with random turbines, farms, outposts etc.
I would actually take this. The sheer lack of variety in random encounters would need to be addressed, but that would actually be interesting and maybe give you more of a reason to use certain items if you could contract injuries due to an incident while traveling or something.
It feels like so many solutions will be derailed by “it would result in more loading screens” well maybe that’s a big freaking issue that should finally be addressed! It should’ve been addressed for fallout 4. They had 8 years
Dude Skyrim doesn’t have loading screens in the overworld…
Just saying
So... much like the ship travelling mechanic in Mass Effect 1?
This is one of the worst parts about the settlements, and doesn't even have a technical excuse. Roads on procgen maps have been around for at least a decade now.

It's not that the lifeless moons are lifeless, but that they're superficially smeared with poor imitations of life
Even settled worlds are anemic. Take Paradiso for example, it's just one hotel (with a handful of floors) on a planet with a tiny beach. It was quite disappointing to visit the first time especially after all the hyping up NPCs do of the place. I was expecting vast rows of beach chairs, umbrellas, tons more people walking around (see gta6 trailer for beach furniture example done right). Guess the game engine can't handle this. Which doesn't make sense because it loads each planet landing zone as a fixed playground so there's nothing else to render.
That's kinda explainable by ships being abundant and able to land pretty much anywhere.

Still, manmade structures should feel more connected with one another.  If a civilian outpost and a farm and a mine and a science lab are all next door to one another, then there should be people going between them, trading or commuting or just saying "hi" or whatever.  If there's a pirate base nearby, the pirates and colonists should occasionally attack each other, possibly calling in reinforcements from the Crimson Fleet or from the UC/FC militaries (respectively).  The areas around New Atlantis and Akila City and Neon and such should be jam-packed with suburbs and farms and laboratories and factories, all with those above-mentioned interconnections with people commuting between them.

I'm pretty confident modders and/or Bethesda themselves (more likely the former) will eventually implement this, but until then it's one of my few criticisms of a game I otherwise love.
There should be no pirates or abandoned POIs on Jemison. Expecially not right next to New Atlantis, that's just ridiculous.
Yeah I agree. I think they started with "seemless space adventure with fully open world planets where you can fly on the planets". Then they realized they couldn't get performance with a planet-sized planet, then they realized there was no point to vehicles without seemless planets, then they made points of interest more cluttered rather than have less of them or encourage exploration up to the border.
It's amazing how technically obsolete this game is under the hood. Compare it to any other open world game, GTA IV, GTA V, Cyberpunk 2077, Witcher 2 or 3, etc. In all those games you have no issues jumping in a car or horse and ride quickly through the world. Starfield can barely handle too quick running. I managed to crash the game few times on a planet for advancing too fast (+30% running speed + personal atmosphere). And sometimes few seconds total freeze. And it's not about the hardware. It's just lazy game development.
There's a damn good reason the NAT never actually moves.
New Atlantis was my first taste of seeing the reason they went 30fps max and no FoV on series X. Still bugs me a huge studio could not deliver basic current gen features but at the same time see it was the right choice. Also bugs me they will probably try and sell us xbox players a 60fps version of the game in a few years. And then a few years after that a remastered version for the next gen of console....series XX. Starfield with all DLC for 100usd.
I feel Mass Effect did it fairly well.

Land on a planet, drive the Mako around, find an enemy base, hop out and fight
Probably not possible as a big studio game meant to appeal to the masses. But for a niche game I could see more realistic scale working. But then the problem becomes if the small studio has the resources to make it work.
Well they could have thought of a better way to balance the two. That's how good game design works. And they are either lazy or don't have the talent and brilliance to know which course of action they should approach. 

I'm not going to suggest what I think is the best decision. Players like us shouldn't either. We're not game designers. This just shows the average game designers at bethesda is just as good as the common casual folk around here.

Heck, a guy from above made a much better proposal for how to tackle this. Does that mean that even casual players are that much better than this game's designer?
There are other games that do this better than Starfield does. You can't make everyone happy, but to pretend BGS just couldn't have done better because literally all choices would result in the same amount of discontent is just silly. It's naive at best, and willfully ignorant at worst.

There is no reason Starfield's planets, a key feature of the game, should feel as soulless and tedious as mass effects random planets. Only worse because you have run everywhere and you don't have a mako.
you should look at dyson sphere project
One of the issues is that no planet design we can come up with really holds a candle to Earth. Level design is a separate thing entirely, I’m focusing on how the most fauna you’ll ever see on a single planet in Starfield is 10 or so, and maybe 4 or 5 biomes. To generate a galaxy system like Starfield and try to have unique, intricate planets in it? It’s just unfathomable.
This was my experience too. I landed on a planet, found a good spot about 250m away to build a base, then tried to move my ship closer, only for it to land in the exact same spot 250m away
[deleted]
Forget interplanetary, there are literally missions where it’s “go upstairs and talk to this person for me, and then come back”. Like, are you fucking kidding me? 

Besides that, you would think in an organically developed economic environment that, given the speed of light as a limiting factor, you’d have unmanned, grav drive-equipped courier drones that could shuttle messages and small parcels from one planet to another. Or am I seriously expected to believe that every single interplanetary message or Space Amazon package is personally delivered by a human freelancer that you don’t even contact with Space Postmates or something, but have to wait until one approaches you and asks if you need anything? Game design is game design, I get it, but the entire premise behind the activities is ludicrous.

It always irks the shit out of me when these “far future” games don’t have basic stuff we have now, like cell phones or saving your home address in your GPS. I can do that with literally a single button press right now.
Any inter-system communication would be limited by the speed of light, so ships jumping to a different star system would inherently be faster than standard comms. If only there were some kind of science-fiction based communication system like quantum entanglement, or sub-space relay communication.
Yeah this is interesting to me. Like obviously digital communication even with the best amplification is gonna be limited by the speed of light, but couldn’t they figure a way to transport radio signals through a warp of some sort using a grav drive? Seems like communication would be pretty important when colonizing the stars.
Or just frickin' radios that are small enough to be carried, so people 300 meters away can send you messages instead of you having to walk there and back for literally every communication.

In the Ancient Days of Yore, there were e-mail systems that would relay messages on a schedule by dialing systems at given times and passing them on (FidoNet, for example). Ships could make a small bonus when they travel by relaying encrypted messages.

Really secure stuff could still be done in person.

All that would allow you to have something like a PDA in the game which could, for example, keep a log of the stats of planets you've scanned.

Just shocking about of Really Basic Stuff missing.
You'd think they'd have little automated drones that fly between systems and collect ground based signals, put them in memory, and jet off wherever they need to go, then beam them from orbit. It's like nobody ever thought about any of these things for more than 15 seconds
Yeah, and then when you get there the quest person tells you to go back where you came from and deliver the response. Seems to lack imagination and creativity.
This one makes sense. Deleivering a message to the same planet annoys me. Even in the same system it makes sense since that would be at least a few minutes to close to a half hour at times.
I see this criticism a ton, and it's the most *against* the realism of the game.
  

You barely have **intra**planetary telecommunications, and it still can take a minute to even talk to low earth orbit. These are limits on the speed of light, not the technology.
  

They demonstrate advanced data transfer and communication capabilities all over the place. But there is no world where you can best the speed of light and call up grandma on another planet. Couriers and relay systems make the most sense.
  

And keep in mind the only magic is the grav drive itself, which gets around the speed of light issue by transporting matter. Which means there is no means to teansmit/receive through that medium. You Re just instantly physically somewhere else.
Imagine if in Cyberpunk every time you wanted to talk to Panam you’d have to drive/fast travel all the way out to the badlands
Their engine just can't do it. Even when they needed trains in fallout it was just a giant NPC with a train for a hat walking under the map.

If their engine could manage the physics of a moonbuggy they would have given us one, but alas.
He looked at Star Citizen and said fuck that!
They were also on the actual moon, which absolutely counts for something. This game doesn't even have the feel that you're the first person to set foot anywhere.
Yes, but they were forced by NASA to use it, they wanted to walk for the random encounters.
Look. Todd doesn’t need to make sense
And Starfield is more than a little buggy so it wins.
Starfield had a buggy too. The game itself
It’s duck mating season
They have typos like a bad AI script, no less.
Definitely not, Ai writes way better than that. I feel like a lot of people who say stuff like that have never actually used chat GPT or talked to the CharacterAI. 

They could unironically run circles around any of the Starfield companions
The same ones who made moving a table or image in Word such a seamless experience?
Didnt the modders fix it? That why they dont pay them for!
"Don't bring me into this." - ChatGPT
He didn’t, this guy is full of shit.
Yes you're right. Being able to move indefinitely at sprinting speeds on a vehicle would be a game changer
Extraplanetary vehicles with exactly one robo-horsepower. I love it.
Yeah this is what I'm talking about; they're inching right up to the edge of what modern consoles can handle so I think it's likely you could hit hardware limitations if you were zooming around procgen planets. Obviously all the actors in NA creates a heavy processing load but if you got a herd of hunting trapjaws attacking a spacer facility with a bunch of those interiors that are on the surface cell and the player zoomed up to it in a buggy I bet it would make the engine cry
Yeah. It seriously ruined the immersion. And about Temples as well... I seriously don't know what they were thinking.
My favorite? The cave POI that has a bovine skeleton in it. I love finding that on planets with no atmosphere. Or you know, our own fucking moon. Twice.
Yes! You got it. It ends up with the same feeling of emptyness as original no mans sky, because the only differences between planets are cosmetic. 

And it's not even particularly hard programming to vary planets more. Link certain POI only to certain planet types better. Use the context of that planet to determine what can appear on it. I think they set a low bar, cleared it and that was that.
He/she probably refers to recent Emil's twitter post.
If modders care about the game enough to dedicate the time needed to
Yeah but skyrim was a good game to begin with. Stanfield is mediocre
There are Star Wars mods already
> if they want!

That's going to be a big IF this time around... modders only bother with games they love, nothing less.
This is the reason, I think, as to why there are so many half-baked features in Starfield

“Should we add ground vehicles?” “The modders will do it.”

“The UI is clunky.” “Modders will fix it.”

“These random POIs feel too similar.” “The modders will fix it!”
At this point I’d rather give $70 to the people who mod the game and just let them make their own damn game.
Except calling it a ‘blank canvas’ is a pretty silly exaggeration
I feel like if from the beginning they just went like "hey we're making a proc gen platform for modders to fill out with some existing story and gameplay" and charged 20-30 bucks I would have no problem with it
Massive over-exagerration. It's really weird how the discourse around this game is just getting perpetually negative. It isn't great by any means, and in some cases isn't really even that good, but it's a little much to say it's a "piss-stained canvas." Like, come on. You must not play actually terrible games if Starfield is that bad to you.
I agree. They don't even deserve the Best RPG nomination. Starfield should serve as a wake up call for them to update their engine and game design for Elder scrolls VI.
I am aware of the Starfield/Skyrim Together mod author mentioned he was planning on working on the mod or anything else. Who else made a statement?
I feel like looking at Star Citizen is the "see it's not so bad" view there.
What you really need to look to is the Indie Game Empyrion Galactic Survival. It's a small studio but they've done some pretty amazing work.
And ED is the epitome of sparse and barren planets. Youre lucky to find anything but an interesting crater or single settlement, but on the other hand, you can land and drive a rover out of a garage built into your ship, or depending on the size of your ship, you just drop into the planet like a rock and have to deal with trying to not crash.
I was also halfway through starfield when I came to a cave that I apparently had never been to before, and yet it was identical to a cave I had visited previously. I’ve never encountered that in any RPG that I’ve played from what I recall, which is honestly depressing.

I think you’d describe it as immersion breaking, but to me it made the entire world of starfield feel less real, if that makes sense. Once the immersion breaks for me, i start to hyper analyze the game, which in turn makes me hate it more. I did that with cyberpunk, hogwarts, and now starfield. 

I never did that with RDR2, despite it having the longest story out of the previous games mentioned. RDR2 is what I consider to be what a RPG should be. Skyrim as well, its graphics are just outdated and its world is kinda small imo compared to new games.
When I first played Skyrim, I didn’t even know you could fast travel until I was halfway through the game. I didn’t mind though, it was so interesting just going through the world because of the detail. 

Walking in starfield to a location after landing is atrocious because the sites appear closer than you think, but then you end up walking for 5 mins straight.
That's the difference, and problem, with space and planetary exploration in Starfield. 

In Skyrim, you were constrained to one overworld map where locations that would be reused in bigger quest lines were connected by roads and separated by environment that could be traversed and explored. 

In Starfield, the proc gen maps basically have one-off POIs with a bunch of empty space between them. You're not walking from New Atlantis to Akila *and then* encountering an Abandoned Cryo Laboratory. The Lab *is* the destination now and there is nothing random to encounter in between your ship's landing zone and the POI. 

That is why things feel especially disjointed in Starfield. All of that random encounter stuff is there but it's squished into one of nine settlements, and then sometimes throw you out to a POI on a planet or in space to complete a quest. All of which unavoidably requires some form of menu navigation for travel. 

I personally think the way they went about trying to capture the random exploration and encounters from previous Bethesda games and place it onto a Starfield multi-layered universe is a bit lacking, but I can absolutely see why it's *more* difficult than in previous games.
Most of the time when I played Skyrim, Fallout 4, and RDR2 I would intentionally NOT fast travel because finding things on the way was the main fun. Sure, eventually I saw everything and ended up fast traveling more, but not until much later in the game.
The author of xEdit said something interesting that stuck with me, where he said that initially, modding wasn't even a thing at Beth...and it was in fact the case modding was more of a happy accident, when Beth realised they could get the community to make mods by releasing the tools. Whilst it's something we will likely never know the truth, facts are Beth is now all about paid mods, and making more profits for the shareholders in the face of an increasingly deflated reputation.
I probably already know the answer but you can’t use KBM on Xbox in this game? 

I see no good reason you shouldn’t be able to. I really dislike devs sometimes when they make boneheaded, non-forward thinking decisions. 

FOV is necessary in FPS games, but they just “forget”.
Not if you're on an xbox.
I still find the skip pack to be underwhelming. Still not enough ground coverage
Is this only for PC?
Can you elaborate on that? Is there a button combo for the second fire mode?
Not if you're on an xbox
WHAT????

140+ hours in and I had no idea.
They actually don't. On PC you can bind secondary keys to do the same thing, you guys are just mashing the jump button by using 2 keys.

There aren't 2 fire modes for the boost pack, you're just button mashing and getting good timing for the second jump.

You absolutely can do this on xbox, you just have to have decent timing.

Most of y'all can't do it without the Alternate Keybind because you're holding spacebar for too long in the first place.
I mean there is combat boost pack training. But only the 4th skill is any good. I agree being able to blast around like a mandalorian
There's a pretty nice mod that renders the map.
Which is exactly when you need it. Fucking joke.
\> you need to run like a fat kid in a football match

I broke down.
Nah, thought of a smarter idea - charge credits for a tow, even of it puts them in debt.
Haha. “You won’t be able to come back from this jump. Continue?”
If the grav jump required fuel honestly that would make the game a bit more fun for me.     Run out of He3? Gotta land and find a local settlement to refuel or build your own mining expo, or even flag down a passing freighter to see if they have any to trade.        You shouldn't need fuel for the same system.   Just anything with a tiny bit more engagement
I dont get the fuel inside the ship. When you grav jump or whatever it jist replenishes automatically
Efficient solar panels, it's the future after all.
Yeah I've played the game. 

Could have been 5 words tbh.
He posted an opinion, get off your high horse and sit down you spaz.
It warps the npc too?
I lost my civilian on one like that. Nearly a 2,000m walk through a hostile landscape withsemi dense foilage. It was awesome, till the civilian died after 10 minutes of us walking back towards the outpost.

I murdered every life form in a laaaaarge radius after that lol
Maybe not the too far and too close, but that just goes with not being able to please everyone no matter what you do. Perhaps you haven't paid attention to the complaints on previous Bethesda games? This game specifically gets shut all over for no good reason. It has no worse issues than any previous Bethesda game, but somehow before it was even released it was being shit on.  That set a prededence for people to immediately try to find all the reasons it's shit. People who have never even played the game saying it's shit because they read someone else saying it's shit. Most people aren't capable going into something looking for all the reasons it's not shit when all they have heard is how shit it is. 

Personally I have been playing the game for a while now.  I'm about 150 hours in and haven't even finished the first 5 main quests. I've been playing the game as I play every single Bethesda game, and I very much enjoy it.  As I said, at times I wish I had a vehicle on planets because then I could beeline to locations instead of running along mining and killing things and looting along the way, ending up with a full weight capacity before I get there.  So far my biggest complaint about this game is that they didn't make it easy enough for those of us who are hoarders to offload our hoarding without it taking ages to do.  I've yet to find what I need to build transfer containers for my outposts. I really hope that happens before I've finished the main quest line because I get bored with games when the main quest is finished. But as of now, 150 hours in, and haven't gotten very bored at all. Talking to every NPC to gain story as I've done in every Bethesda game. Reading every bit of lore I can find, and it's not in the form of books on this game - it's breaking into or opening computers to get it instead. Going through the museums as if I was a real patron there. Picking up a and finishing side quests as I get them, doing everything I can while on a planet before moving to the next mission. 

No it's not perfect, but it's definitely not shit. It's the first game in a new Bethesda world and I wouldn't expect it to be Skyrim or FO4 in nature because of that.  I imagine the next game in this world will be loads better. And I imagine the DLC will also add 100's more hours on for me.
Here is the Summary for a MOD called Desolation

>Starfield is a game full of POIs to discover, however they are everywhere. This leads to players constantly running in to them, leading to repeats, and nonsensical worldbuilding. Barren moons have seemingly a population in the millions, mostly Pirates. This mod aims to make the worldbuilding feel more realistic, while maintaining the POIs for players who like to grind.  
>  
>The first change is to restrict POIs with human habitation to planets either inside the settled systems, or with breathable atmospheres close by. As there are over a hundred breathable planets in the settled systems, it was odd that anyone would choose to settle on a barren moon far away for settled space, unless there was a specific reason to do so. This leaves most of the galaxy empty as it should be according to the lore, and make settlers decisions make more sense. This massively decreases the amount of human POIs you will find at random, while still leaving an infinite amount to find in the core worlds. The only human habitation you will find outside the core systems is handcrafted, or radiantly generated for a quest.  
>  
>The last change is to decrease the density of the human POIs that show up, so when you land on a planet you aren't surrounded by them, there will only be one or two. This means that each one you see feels more special. The amount of the change depends on how far from the core worlds you are, Jemison is densely populated compared to far off worlds.  
>  
>POIs generated for radiant quests are unaffected, so there are still an infinite number to find, and each is more unique, as they will all have a context behind them. Locations you find on planet scans will also still show up, meaning each habitable planet still has some life, just not an infinite amount. As an added benefit, the Crimson Fleet is no longer the largest faction in the Settled Systems, with hundreds of bases on every planet.
“Nesting-doll procgen design” is basically how I’ve been filling in the blanks of worldbuilding for *years,* and ironically that’s in large part *because of inspiration from Bethesda.*  I’m a mediocre artist and programmer but I can design modular kits of mapping parts that anyone halfway competent at programming could probably implement.
And laziness. A lot of it feels like laziness trying to be hidden behind smoke and mirrors. Except the laziness part is so overflowing that the smoke and mirrors can no longer conceal the utter laziness behind of it all
It's like they created a framework for what could have been, and then let it down at every turn. It's simply astonishing. The only thing I can accredit it to is that they want us to frame it for them. They want to use us as quality testers to decide what kind of features they need to implement to give us the game we want.
All the people that worked on Morrowind and understood why it was magic left Bethesda Softworks. Ever since the remaining devs have been trying to disect Morrowind, slowly removing more of it in Oblivion, then even more from it in Skyrim and finally when they had taken all magic out we are left with Starfield.
Here's a thing as well vehicles people assume wheels but they could be walkers, the robots throughout the game already have skeletons animations etc. in place and the engine will easily support a mounting option, so take those skeletons/animations combine them with the mounting option, model stairs/ladder and cockpit and pretty much you have SCifi version of horses from Skyrim for Starfield.
Really feel that another game was made with care then at 90% ready, a complete gameplay overhaul was made to make it a boring Skyrim.
Maybe it was engine limitations why they didn't implement vehicles? FO4 didn't have vehicles either right?

It's a little hard to believe they first play-tested the use of vehicles and then pulled them deliberately at the last minute.
> and I refuse to believe that vehicles are too difficult to implement,

Oh god. [Callback to this abomination.](https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-whats-happening-inside-fallout-3s-metro-train/)
I think it's less lack of care and more just... stagnant game design. I legitimately think Bethesda is just a little high on their own supply and spent so long on their development cycles the gaming industry completely passed them by, and they just didn't notice. 

They're in a weird spot. Microsoft bought them out and gambled big on Starfield and the "Bethesda pedigree," and by most accounts, it seems to be backfiring a bit. I don't know what Starfield is doing money wise, but general feedback and player retention seem universally low, and that doesn't bode well. 

On the plus side, maybe Starfield is a wake-up call, and they'll sit down and reassess their approach to TES6. But then, I think the reason why Skyrim was and is still such a powerhouse is pure *atmosphere.* It created a really strong foundation for molders to build on. This is something Starfield lacks, even in the hub areas. There's nothing that makes you feel like you're in a real, lived in space. So maybe the Bethesda approach to game design can still work in 2024 and beyond, it just *needs* to be drenched in atmosphere and detail first and foremost. 

It's possible that if hub areas were dense and filled with rich detail and activities, it might make the vast emptiness of space feel more intentional. Everything you interact with feels very clean and sterile, with no real rhythm or routine like the towns of Skyrim. Just clumps of unamed NPCs milling around continuously in bland looking cities. Cyberpunk, for all its faults, spent a LOT of time making the cities at least feel detailed and grungy, with trash and steam, neon, and grit.
Literally could have just looked at how No Man’s Sky did it for reference. I do like the planets in Starfield more overall, but in NMS you can literally circumnavigate the planets and end up back at your ship, outpost, or starting POI like the planetary archive structures. All without the game becoming unstable. You can also fly your ship around the planets in atmosphere, drive a rover or hovercraft, pilot a mech, or use a submarine to explore the oceans on them, and can re-enter orbit then move to another planet or a station without a single loading screen. And that game has been out long enough that someone at Bethesda has to have played it.
Skyrim doesn't generate terrain. It's significantly more difficult to dynamically load and unload portions of the map while you're still creating all of them.
That’s another good comparison, yeah. That style of navigation certainly didn’t seem to hurt its chances at becoming an award winning title and “one of the best video games of all time”, nor its 91/100 Metacritic score.

Not saying this would’ve propelled Starfield to the same level, of course, but the point I don’t think it would’ve made it worse at all. Eliminating/smoothing a grindy game mechanic is almost only ever a positive thing.
legit. I found a weapons vendor on a lifeless moon, in a barely inhabited start system. No landing pad, he was like 2 km away from my landing point. That's not storytelling. It's not an interesting POI. There's no amount of assumptions that make sense here, unless the poi is a small settlement with actual people. 

They said the universe would be empty, and yeah, it's devoid of life. But there's plenty of NPCs
I mean, transport tycoon had better proc Gen and that was made in like ‘94
In terms of procgen technology, Starfield is very out of date.

There is a heightmap, and some flora scattered around, with a terrain paint depending on biome. 

Thats it. 

Ive worked with procgen code before, from a hobbyists perspective, and I sincerely think I could get better and more natural looking results, and im a mediocre coder. ( well - my art assets would be far worse but nm lol )

There are all kinds of algorithms and methods for naturalistic creation of terrain and features and roads and rivers, even for better creation and placement of settlements and constructions.

And none of that wouldve been a problem for the Creation Engine as far as I can see, its baffling to me how conservative and unambitious they were.
right? They built a tiny resort by our current standards, and then in the quest line involving it they start talking about how they can't share the planet. like, you've got 500 people here my dude
Agreed - the connectivity of manmade structures/factions within reasonable proximity would certainly improve the game - especially in relation to outposts you build. It would be entertaining to see how the proximity to local POIs affects your relationship with the NPCs in those POIs (for example, if you set an outpost and the nearest POI is a hostile base, your outpost will be continuously raided). It would finally give me a reason to build outpost defenses. Also - has *ANYONE* found use out of outpost defenses? They've been 100% cosmetic for me up to this point (about 200 hours in) and don't make sense, as none of my outposts are ever attacked.

I'm not a coder (and don't know how it works), but this would be a change that would add a lot of additional entertainment and thought in the outpost-creation side of the game, which I believe is too shallow of a feature as-is.
Maybe they should’ve just made major POI scannable from space, so we could jump between them in our ship with a little cutscene?
Actually it is. It's the game engine that is just utter plain as shit, full of trash and full of outdated antiquity. 

I dont know why Bethesda remains stubborn on this piece of fucking shit engine called Gamebryo. It's the worst damn game engine I've ever seen in my 20+ years of avid gaming. The fuck is wrong with this stupid engine it stutters with bad frames despite no impressive world rendering, and lousy limited gameplay features that can be expanded on and can't even run proper animations expected of modern games. 

Dont give that excuse of "b-b-but modding!". Any other game dev could make their own Creation Kit too like Bethesda does. Modding isn't some stupid specialty of Bethesda's engine and I hate how Bethesda keeps using that as an excuse for their outright laziness
I have seen random references to Magika when poking around in the console, which gives a hint as to why this might be. They really should have built an entirely new fork of the original engine and removed a lot of old stuff instead of trying to just add more to it. Magicka in space!
You know it's kinda humiliating for Xbox when their flagship exclusive game turns out to not even be able to deliver proper 60fps.
I mean I’ve been gaming since 1991 so a lot of the games’ flaws don’t bother me much 😂 but I get your point
That'd be because, from my understanding, a planet's map is split into sections and each section has a designated landing spot where you'll always land unless you build a different one.

It's an illusion of an open world on planets. You land and you're locked into the section you landed in unless you re-land in a different one. Venture too far and you hit an invisible wall. That's why there's no planetary flight or wheeled vehicles.
You have to build a landing pad in your outpost
People love to dog pile on SC but there's clearly a reason they are 10? 11? Years and going in development. Starfield clearly has suffered for reheating the same game engine even longer with minor upgrades
If you pay attention, there are 100s more things that would irk you, in term of shallow game designs.   


My biggest problem is ... the stupid watch doesn't tell time.  I have to hit Tab into the big screen in order to see a tiny time top left corner of the game.
So many quests of this game had me annoyed and thinking "This could have been an email"
Starfield is really showing how outdated Bethesdas game models are,
> Forget interplanetary, there are literally missions where it’s “go upstairs and talk to this person for me, and then come back”. Like, are you fucking kidding me? 

Bethesda has always been artless, tasteless, incompetent in this way.  Sometimes in Elder Scrolls I get a quest, and I'm like "oh, go see character XYZ?  Surely this will be a nice little road trip, will have to find XYZ maybe miles away, in some town or remote location."  Then the person is next door.  Quest done.
Have a courier system. Upload all the emails fly to another system info dump and rinse and repeat
And yet if I knock a pencil off a desk on some backwater planet the UC in Jamison knows about it before I even get back to my ship. Tell me again about inter-system communications.
I think in Outer Worlds they get messages from other systems through relay. One of the quests you have to fix one of them before a planet passes between the relay and the communications centre
Ok, but why can't we email from orbit. If not that, why not Zoom once I land?

Why can't I text?
Yeah I think that concept was core to Traveller the tabletop RPG that was part of the original design of Starfield. I like that basically there is a galactic delivery service (often, you) instead of subspace FTL comms.
Anything. It doesn’t have to be based on real physics. Like grav drive. What else irl can ‘fold time’.
Like something that could generate a hyperpulse to send information to the next system...
That makes sense. What doesn’t make sense is if I commit a crime in uc space 15 ly away from Jemison I get a bounty and shot down in all of uc space
I miss having a radio playing music.
Little tiny drone ships that buffer data and grav jump around the settled systems with messages.  Too slow for real-time communication but good enough for email or 'space text messaging' that sort of thing.   Get a hundred thousand assembled by an autonomous factory and let them zoom.  Perfectly 'good enough' interstellar comms network.  In my head anyway.
The only way it would work in universe is having relays jump back and forth constantly to relay messages. Grav tech is based on alien tech after all. It tracks that they couldn't space magic their way into ftl comms.
At least having it be acknowledged by there is only lightspeed comms because sending information through a grav drive corrupts it or something would be great.
If Hello Games can do it, why can’t Bethesda.
It bugs me so much when I land on a planet with a temple, and there are POI structures 500 meters away. Yeah thanks Vladimir, we really “discovered” something here!
Still disappointed when I went to Mars and left no footprints behind. So fucking lame.
He just needs to be sexy
RABBIT MATING SEASON
WABBIT SEASON!
ooof you're lethal
Literally leaving it the hands of the mfers who managed to break the dynamics of a word doc gotdaym
The OG way of sending something into orbit; placing an image next to it in MS Word then moving said image by one pixel.
The same ones who made clippy. Just as old too.
Evidently not. The bugs I'm talking about are still there, even in heavily modded Skyrim. The bug where a killed enemy will get up and walk in place, while being dead and lootable. The one where corpses spaz out like a poltergeist's nightmare. The one where fish swim up onto land.

They all made it into Starfield.

I realise you were being glib, I just wanted to specify the bugs I meant.
But Starfield doesn't even look that great. It boggles my mind how this game was locked to 30fps. Is it a CPU issue? Is it limited by the GPU? I'm unable to pinpoint that out. I think their outdated game engine is at play here.

Or maybe just Xbox in general? Seeing as there wasn't much groundbreaking exclusives it has unlike PS5's Spiderman 2? I mean Spiderman 2 is a much better game than Starfield design-wise and graphics-wise. Windows have interiors, large city, NPC density, and being able to load and stream assets at breakneck speeds while swinging. So are you not wondering how this game "pushed the console to its edge" when other much technical looking games are out there?
Oh, you don't care to do the exact same uninspired and boring "puzzle" a simple 240 times?
Why couldn’t the temples be ancient alien dungeons? WHY?

They literally did that in Morrowind, Oblivion AND Skyrim.
I actually like this game. But yeah the Temples are dogshit and partially ruin the main quest. They also highlight the major issue with the planets and the exploration gameplay loop. Copy pasta with no substance. Not even proper procedural variation on top of the copy pasta, just shameless pasta.
I just can't believe developers' would proudly turn this in. I would be so embarrassed to turn that in to my boss knowing this is a *major* game element. It's so bad that the only conclusion I can come to is that Bethesda has a middle management/culture problem right now. It's the only thing that makes sense to me with some of these decisions.
Welp can't see his recent X posts since he already blocked me for criticizing Starfield.
This!

Everyone is on their knees for the Modders to fix the game. The Mod community was so strong in previous titles because people LOVED the games, they couldn't get enough, they wanted to keep the magic alive forever.

If I was a Modder I wouldn't touch Starfield, F that I'd just keep working on Skyrim and FO games I actually loved from the start.
Yup, but I meant conversions, ie full systems with planets/enemies/fauna/flora the whole works not just separate armor/weapon/ship mods(though nothing against those they are great)
No kidding. If it was just Bethesda fucking up this year I'd understand. But you have Redfall, those Game Mill abominations, and other titles that are just terrible at launch. Starfield isn't the worst to be fair, but they aren't in good company.
Modding and actual game dev are very different beasts. Most modders couldn't begin to work on a game flat out.
Yup. That stain is pee. Old smelly cat pee to boot.
Or at least labelled it early access.
I've gotten FAR more than my money's worth out of the game... But the level of missed opportunities and carelessness in this game is STAGGERING.  I kinda hope they  take a page from Star Citizen and use the proceeds to continue development.  Right now, the game is a mile wide and an inch deep, but it totally doesn't need to stay that way.  Procedurally generated quests can have a LOT more to them.  They can always add more stars at the edge of the map.  They can always craft more content.  I DO hope they keep at it.  I can see why people are upset by what the game isn't, but I have such hopes for what it could be.
The post was full of comments from other modders stating that they find the game too boring to bother with.
SC...the $600 million+ ponzi scheme designed as a game...
I love ED for what it is.  

Pure starship flight sim. With excellent ship to ship combat.  And a 1:1 procedural recreation of the milky way.  

I've never played Microsoft flight simm.  I have no desire to fly a commercial air liner from New York to France.  

But Elite just scratches my exploration/space combat itch. Dog fighting is the best I've ever seen. Especially once you master turning your stabilizing thrusters off and are constantly fighting your own inertia for a sliver of extra performance. 

The ability to look at your star chart and see a gas giant in system with rings.  Letting you know it will be a viable zone to mine the ring rocks for minerals. Leading to a variety of activities ranging from protecting the miners there from pirates.  Being the pirate and extorting miners for a cut of their cargo or straight up blowing a hole in their cargo and trying to scoop it all up before the authorities arrive. Or just bounty hunting. 

Deep core charge mining for diamonds. And that's just one POI type.  

Only 0.3 percent of the galaxy is mapped after 10 years. Even if all the plants are barren. The process of exploration keeps you entertained in a way that click on a system and watching a loading screen doesn't.  

Planning your route around star types you can scoop for fuel.  Managing your heat while scooping and looking out for hostile ships laying in wait to ambush refuelers. Spinning up your FTL and warping to the next system. The scanning minigame is serviceable. I like feeling like I'm at my science station looking for frequencies. Triangulating the coordinates because my map is empty as this is a new system to me.  And then manually navigating to that signal curious the whole time as to what you're going to find.  

The idea of getting a taste of this and then realizing you're gonna need a lot more money and reputation to afford the kind of shit that makes 10 hours worth of exploration take 10 minutes when fully outfitted and reaching for that goal.  

The paths you can take to get there. Keep on the science path? Mine and sell ores? Get your combat legs under you and take bounties to support specific factions in combat zones. 

All of these systems would be cool in a stand alone game that only offered one of them.  It's very cool to have a game that offers all of them.  But what makes it great is putting it in a world where you have to manually navigate from one type of content to the next. 

I'll never play euro truck simulator.  Sitting on traffic or highway driving aren't activities that grip me.  

But manually piloting from one space station to the next in Elite is pure joy. Manually doing the gravity wells of plants.  Calculating your deceleration to not overshoot.  Air/gravity breaking on planets. 

You're constantly stimulated. I feel like I am a ship captain making a living on the frontier. I can dip in and out of activities and the only limit is my ships ability to keep up with the content/other players. And my willingness to invest the time to participate. 

I could gush about elite dangerous for days.  



...we don't talk about space legs.  Space legs don't exist.  Space legs can't hurt you.
The Size of the Sandbox is irrelevant If the narrative is good and its packed full of context.

I think this is where Larian got it right with BG3, Its a very Linear Story, Tiny Sandbox as far as Sandbox RPG's go but the amount of content in it is HUGE, you can play the game multiple ways and get completely unique experiences each time, yeah there is an over-arching narrative that doesn't change much but the path you take to get from A-B can be done a hundred different ways... 

This is what Starfield is missing... the whole 1k planets thing was a joke... nobody wants that...
Why did the immersion break in Hogwarts and Cyberpunk for you? And when? Just curious
What do you mean? Theres only one kinda boost pack or its a glitch? I've never heard that before, thats interesting in a not good way
Yes. It requires binding an alternate jump button, which afaik can't be done on controllers.
I'm on PC so I can't say. But I assume it's on both.   But you do have to set it up in your settings.  It's not turned on by default.  

There are two jump modes.  The second jump mode needs to be assigned before the booster works.
No. A bunch of people with bad double-jump timing have convinced themselves that if they use a different button to also press jump to activate the boost pack that they are somehow moving faster when doing it.

It's the exact same thing as the default jump button, just assigned to anoter key on their keyboard.

It is wholly a placebo effect.
You just have to bind it in the settings.  

There are several settings that don't have a keyboard binding by default.  

It will be right under jump. It's not called boost.  It's called alt jump or something like that. I don't have the game installed anymore to check.
That's because it isn't true.

On PC you can bind secondary keys to do the same thing, effectively they are just mashing the jump button by using 2 keys.

There aren't 2 fire modes for the boost pack, just button mashing and accidentally getting good timing for the second jump.

You absolutely can do this on xbox, you just have to have decent timing.
Shouldn't have to mod in a basic feature. I'm sure the mod is goid, but that just speaks to Betheda's failures.
The mechanic was removed before launch since it wasn’t “fun”, this is also why outposts are basically useless, they were supposed to be made to help you get from one system to the next but since you no longer need fuel~
fuel determines how far you can grav jump without needing to stop at a planet.
[deleted]
Yes.
You contradict yourself right at the start. "no worse than any other previous bethesda game".

You're right... But we forgive Skyrim its 12 years old ffs.

Its 2023 and we waited 8 years for this watered down crap that if you blind tested it you would think it came out a year after FO4. 

Its just not good enough. for the money they're making/charging.

I'm not being ungrateful, I'm fully aware we could have nothing at all, In fact I'd rather that... and all the Staff at BGS that are actually competent were working for Dev studios that are passionate about making good games.
Sound like an excellent mod of how the game should have been.
Reading this made it super apparent the whole American Wild West frontier concept played way too strong a part in all the settlers “striking out to make their fortunes” on desolate moons.
Still want to use Desolation, but I honestly don't know how well it would work in conjunction with Deadly Hazards. Deadly Hazards fixes the space suit protection system as well as planetary hazard traits, so traits are now actually deadly, and extreme hazards don't instantly delete your protection. With so few POIs, in the early game especially running Deadly Hazards, you really do need every POI or smaller proc gen structure you can get in or under. From radiation to extreme temps and down to now having limited oxygen while on airless planets, you need to regularly find a place of respite. Either getting underneath some mining vehicle to block out harmful UV light from the nearest star (if you are exploring an airless no magnetosphere moon during its "day" cycle) or find a dungeon to give your oxygen supply a break and find new air cannisters from enemies.
> it was odd that anyone would choose to settle on a barren moon far away for settled space

I had the Four Families quest come up in a system that was almost entirely barren, and Lopez's 'farm' was on a moon with no atmosphere. Like, bro, I think LIST did you dirty here man!

Edit: Also, took me a moment to realize this was an actual mod, and not just an idea for a mod, lol.
I like how they made a mod respecting breathable vs unbreathable atmospheres, and the game itself doesn't give a single fuck whether the atmosphere is breathable or is a 1000 degree pressure cooker. Stepping outside on a high-gravity, high pressure, high heat, corrosive radioactive atmosphere planet puts you at a *moderate* risk of getting a booboo on your elbow. Ouchie.
Modders are fixing things so fast it really makes me wonder what the hell Bethesda has been doing all these years?
Do you wanna know the one single thing I said "Bethesda absolutely cannot afford to fuck this up?" is? 

Procgen. In a bit of terrible foreshadowing, I was discussing the upcoming release of Starfield with a friend and talked about the procgen, specifically the terrain and planetary environments.

I explained how every space exploration game before now has had awful, shitty procgen for planets that leaves you with a big nasty bowl of boring procedural oatmeal, that developers in the genre are aware of the problem, and that surely Starfield--which sold itself hard as a next-gen space explorationn game--would address this well-known and oft-doscussed problem in the genre.

How terribly mistaken I was. The procgen is some of the worst I've ever seen; quintessential procedural oatmeal. We can now point to Stanfield as the perfect illustration of it. No Man's Sky looks bespoke by comparison.
I just stopped playing it because of all that. I am not going to walk for hours and hours. I pick it up once in awhile and regret it! What a shame. I have been looking forward to this game for years. It really is so sad. There are a lot of parts I really really enjoy but again, that walking! I even thought about the paperweight to place on the Walking Key! While I am doing something else.
Its crazy how an island like Morrowind still feels significantly larger than an entire network of solar systems does now.
Starfield is the ugly, defective child of Skyrim & No Man´s Sky. Todd took away everything, that makes those games good and left in all the bad.
For that matter why not horses on breathable planets? Or rather creatures that can be ridden like horses? I find it hard to believe that not one single soul, in all those years, has taken one of the peaceful creatures and started turning them into something that can be ridden.
Nope, there's an expansion like mod for new vegas that has vehicles in it, with physics that are quite decent surprisingly. So if modders can pull off something like that, in an ancient and janky version of creation engine, there's no excuse for Bethesda.
This comment has me cracking up
That was seriously a "wtf" moment. They have one frigging beach that is not very big. A medium sized hotel with what, maybe 50 people in it and the the planet is otherwise completely empty and they don't have room and couldn't take few humans who have travelled hundreds of years. But hey, please be an errand boy and find all those missing items. Paradiso was such an disappointment. Storywise and visually.
You have the powers (aka spells) and they have a power bar (aka mana or magicka).

Under the hood you have magic. I wouldn't have renamed that in the engine.
To me it just feels like every section of the Planet is basically a Bethesda ‘interior’, all requiring a loading screen to enter or exit. Same with ships. 

I can’t think of anywhere (except maybe places around the main cities) where it’s fluid going from one place to another with no loading screen.
You actually can walk into another biome and not notice it. I was walking from a Desert biome, for which I still had to scan one bloody critter, and next thing I knew it said Biome Complete. Walked back towards my ship to test and the Biome Complete marker went away.
StarTile
Wow... This game kinda sounds like ass, actually
| ... an invisible wall


JFC, a game about space and exploration, where you can't explore because invisible walls because the creation engine cannot handle it. Unbefuckingleavable.  You cannot make this shit up.
Doesn't work for me, it still never lands on my pad. I have to go into the ship editor and back out and then it magically teleports to the pad. Then rinse and repeat every time you leave the planet 

Bethesda Magic (tm) at work folks
Jokes on you. It still lands 250m away and leaves the pad empty.
Totally realistic to land 400m away when there is a perfectly suitable clearing right next to the outpost.
For sure, but the Sci Fi stuff is what always rubs me the wrong way. Guys like William Gibson, Walter Jon Williams, Mike Pondsmith, Isaac Asimov, Phillip K Dick, and so many others put so much detail into their extrapolations of what we have now into the future. That’s why we love them.

Meanwhile, and I don’t wanna sound unappreciative because it is a cool feature, but we JUST got a portable music player in 2077 and people are acting like they cured cancer. I had a Walkman in 8th grade, man. I have to hunt for the Olympus system on the map to find my Dream Home in Starfield. My car from 10 years ago can do that in one tap. Cell phones, mobile shopping, virtual reality, 3D printing, holograms, androids, AI, and all kinds of other stuff that we have right now, but half the time a new space game comes out, suddenly it’s an analogue for the old west with FTL travel. Why? I know the comparison has been done to death, but somehow 2077 feels more futuristic in a world economy hampered by constant war than a game that’s supposed to happen more than a thousand years down the line.
which is especially frustrating given that Barrett says “it even tells the time” when he gives it to you. No buddy, it does not.
>My biggest problem is ... the stupid watch doesn't tell time.

My biggest problem with the watch is that my character isn't fucking wearing it. The marketing around that watch was like it was going to be as important as the Pip-Boy and yet it's not even on my arm unless I'm wearing one very specific spacesuit.
It does tell time via how much of the planet you can see on the watch face. Like our moon cycles and we get quarter half etc. 

Would still prefer to see two times on it though (UT and local)
This is how it worked in the Gap series by stephen donaldson. They used courier drone relays which recorded any messages broadcasted to them, then fired off a drone through the titular 'gap' towards the hub systems to disseminate to relevant parties.

Was still a cumbersome system because message delivery depended on physical objects arriving where they were needed, and if you were sending a message from a remote location to a remote location it could be weeks before drones would travel back and forth. But it was still a hell of a lot faster then beaming it in real time.
This is how mass effect does it
Like how it's done in the expanse, they have relay satellites that will basically pop to one system do a burst communication, wait to receive any outgoing signals and pop back over.
Exactly, boom another job or quest path. 

I don't think in the future outposts are going to be waiting endlessly for some random to show up to help
As we say in the biz “never underestimate the bandwidth of a truck filled with tape backups…”
Yep, and in Skyrim the only living creature within a mile radius of the bandit camp I just exterminated is my own horse, but the dark brotherhood are still going to be coming after me.
Sorry, I disbelieve that Traveler was part of the DNA of Starfield.

I've created three characters, and not one of them has **died** during character creation.
No wonder I want to like starfield so much, I loved traveler table top. So rare to run into anyone that even knows what that is.
Which is incredibly unrealistic, as you could just load up a drone with emails and send that instead of an entire ship filled with people.
Creation Engine 2
Hello games set out to make a game, which on the merit of it's quality is profitable, Bethesda set out to make money, at all cost
My favorite is a couple of the story missions where you're coming upon a place where a survivor is stranded and it should feel isolated and desperate. Only to see random poi stuff like 500 feet away.
Agree and to help with that, the mod Desolation -

https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6812?tab=description
Yeah i know and you are 100% correct its a joke we as gamers just accept this lavk of quality control... Jank being part of the game isnt endearing
I think this goes doubly for the inevitable paid mod scene for Starfield.

The people seeking to profit from their mods aren't going to be invested in making a mod for Starfield if the audience isn't there, because they get paid based on the number of sales.

Starfield is already lagging behind both Skyrim SE and Fallout 4 in player counts, and that gap is likely to widen.

If fewer people are playing it, there's less incentive for modders in general to make something for it. For the ones looking for money, there's no one who will buy it, but even the ones doing it for free are less likely to put the work into it because what does it matter if they make an impressive mod on a game no one plays? It's not really going to get them the recognition or let them build a portfolio or turn their work into a career if the content they're making drops into a ghost town.
Sounds like it would turn out about as good as Starfield then. 🤷‍♂️
Well. They are making progress to achieve their vision. The problem is it will take more years while Starfield will be able to do what it's trying once the mods mature for the game.
It would have been a much, much better game had they had 10 interesting planets with a huge amount of focus put on them. I mean you can still have the 1000 empty worlds, too, but the alien worlds feel so weirdly overstocked with the same copy/pasted aliens.
Hogwarts Legacy is immersion breaking right at the whole premise - in the game, you (as a student) kill hundreds and hundreds of people (no way about that part), **(spoiler alert)** can learn and use the unspeakable curses and use them very openly without anyone in the world caring about it, but the one time in the story another pupil does it, the whole world goes freaking bonkers.

I literally used about 15+ unspeakable curses in the fight right before the time the NPC did it, while other NPCs were watching me, but they simply ignored me. 

Then there's some elements in the level design and quest architecture that are just very, very "game-y" in design (which is usually something people can ignore), but the whole "life simulation" of Hogwarts simply does not work. 

Sure, there's tons of background characters walking around, but there's no actual "life" with them - you never meet or interact with anyone in your dorm room, there's no walking to / from class together, the whole "school" part of the game is simply relegated to cutscenes - add to that that it is shown that Hogwarts students are meant to be under tight scrutiny when and if they are allowed to leave the castle, and you simply do as you please. 

Hogwarts Legacy is by far the best Harry Potter game to date, but it's still a very much game at heart, and you can't really lose yourself in the world as easily as you could in e.g. RDR2. 

Speaking of RDR2, the only thing I really disliked was that even if you tried to be a comparatively good Arthur, as soon as there is a main story quest that has you e.g. rob a train, you have to go in guns blazing, no chance to avoid it.
For Cyberpunk, it was when the cops spawned out of nowhere in front of my eyes. Hogwarts was more of it being extremely underwhelming. I’d want to go through every year of hogwarts if I’m playing a Harry Potter game, not just randomly join in my 5th year with a story that I don’t care at all about. I only played hogwarts for 3 hours until I refunded it though.
Xbox doesn't have an alt-bind option. Just the primary one.
It is not on console
Controller players don't have an option to set that second binding.

I'm on MnK but this makes me vicariously frustrated.
That's an alternate Keybind, not a second "jump mode"

You're just assigning 2 different keys to doing the same thing.
Yes of course but it's not and we can wait on Bethesda to add that feature in, until then I'll be using the mod.
They probably should have left it as an option for those hardcore players. In No Man's Sky I ran with free fuel on my first save because I couldn't stand having to get fuel, but a lot of people played differently from me.
It wasn't fun because imagine how many more loading screens you'd need to go through to get where you're going if you had to stop and Re-fuel. Nothing to do with the Refuel mechanic, that part is immersive AF... doubling the number of loading screens... I'm falling asleep.

The game should've been Fallout in space... Maybe only a handful of systems that we've colonised 7-8, All in a relatively close proximity (relative to the infinity that is space), 1 system for each faction and 2-3 that are "no mans land" where you're at risk of pirate/spacer/merc encounters... Grav Jump is limited to one system at a time and then you need to Re-fuel... but there are no loading screens to fly around the individual systems, Grav jump is a loading animation and so is landing, None of the planets are Procgen all handcrafted in a passionate BGS manner and landing also has a loading animation...

Boom, you've got a decent game...
You don't really understand opinion or how ppl talk......time to grow up buddy. We are allowed to think whatever we want and there isn't a single thing you can do about that. Sucks to suck
Gdi…
Which is, as we have learned from the top guy himself, by design. Bullshit.
Welcome to playing Bethesda games, first time?
What's funny is the disconnect it causes.  


Striking out, by colonizing barren moons...  


yet leaving the actual Main planets compeltely uninhabited and on a single "City". Technically not, but i mean. ITS A FUCKING PLANET. This point really strikes me so much. Entire planets left barren except for pirates while the entire population spread out all over the place randomly. its makes zero actual sense lol. It makes sense, if they game took place 50 years after the left earth but its been 200. they should be all over a world in a mix of industry and settlements. instead its mostly abandoned and occupied by pirates.  


To the point that you wonder why are they pirates and not instead an occupying nation because they outnumber the cities by several orders of magnitude. Id say 6000 to 1
Oh yeah Its from an actual mod lol

Also yeah his "Farm" is on a barren rock, and no bigger then a fenced in shed XD  
Watcha farmin there buddy lol  
at least the Freestar women you go to on the Ranger quest Actually has a farm, sure its more like a moderately sized garden plot than... a Farm but its way more a Farm than his lol. No wonder he as to resort to... less than legitimate means to stay in business'. buddy doesnt even have any greenhouses.
Making sure Todd's stage attire looks good enough for the next time he is on stage. They pick out the leathers themselves.
And on a good system you can seamlessly jump from any place to any other place without loading screens. 

And that's only vanilla morrowind. The DLC and then all the mods, the content never ends. 

Bethesda has to rediscover it's soul. It it really cares it should start working on a remake of Morrowind. The creation engine 2 fails for space stuff but would probably work really nice for Morrowind.

Here is what they could do 

- replace very written line of dialogue with voice actors using a two tier system. Main characters voice actors, side characters could be AI. Artifical voices like elevenlabs have the quality to make this workable. A combination would be a good balance between two much of a scope and to much artificiality. 

- Take the best assets the community has created and redo them in 8K to get astonishing resolution on everything.

- Ad an optional AI system to the game that can turn audio speech from the gamer in  to text , a combination of local processing and online processing already makes this possible in almost real time. But nobody has integrated this flawlessly in to a game. It will not be easy, they will have to build new technology to make it work at scale. 

- Then the second step after speech to text   is to have the AI integrated with a large language model. No, not chatgpt4 that won't run in real time and then your game seriously depend on your internet connection. They would have to take a base model and retrain it specifaclly with TES lore. Then they will have to figure out again, a combination between a model running locally and a model running online. That way they can seamlessly move load from local to the cloud and back depending on the situation. A gpt  3.5 quality system with every character a system prompt and the morrowind lore trained in to the system. Oh my god.

- Then the final step is text to speech, again a mix of local processing and cloud.

You would now have a super big morrowind world in the creation engine 2. The dialogue system is now audio based with a mic and you can go off script and talk about anything! 

Why stop there!

- driven by AI a select number of NPC's could be given more freedom then a NPC has ever had. They could have a core identity that is a system prompt, they could be taske with something. Some quest, something they try to get down. They could be given the potential of having as much power as a human player if they level up. It would also be like playing online against other humans but not quiet. So we could have 5 or maybe 10 super NPC's that act almost as if they are another Morrowind soon to be hero.  The human player would be given the choice to make allies with them or enemies.  



There is so much more to do with Morrowind and a dungeon and dragon's type RPG now that we have this new AI technology.

Bethesda could redeem itself, absolutely. They could innovate again.
I feel like they might be trying to do what NMS continues to do where Sean basically keeps releasing entire new DLC packages for free on a near monthly basis and adding in completely new systems like the Freighters, frigate fleets, underwater base building, expeditions, etc. without realizing the amount of work Hello Games has to do to maintain that, not to mention how rare it is to turn a game around that much after release.
>Bethesda ‘interior’,

Morrowind Map is practically this way where the region is simplified into cells. Whenever you move into another cell, the game will start loading. 

However, the illusion of open world works there since you don't need to get back to your ship, jump into outer space and select the coordinate beside you to move into another cell.
One simple little thing they could do to make ships feel so much more immersive instead of entering another instance is have the doors to the landing bay be able to be opened and closed like any other door.  And I think the airlocks should load you into the actual airlock where you then have to open the door on the other side.  It doesn’t mess with the instancing but it adds that extra layer of control that makes you forget all about the momentary black screen
It feels that way because that's exactly what it is.
Yes men like to say "the load screens are only two seconds" but the fact that they exist at all and in the quantity that they do is pathetic in 2023. Every other developer can figure it out. Cyberpunk 2077, for all its faults, had it figured out in 2020.
Biomes aren’t the same as the landing sections. You can have multiple biomes in one section, but you still can’t leave that section.
Noticed this for the first time two days ago after 300 hours of playing
It is, wait until it's like $30 at least
To be fair, exploring most planets fully would be insanely boring. The majority of the experience would be walking through absolute desolation for hours and hours before just giving up and calling your ship in. Even on lush planets, it'd just be miles of procedural generation with nothing new to see. I've played games that go for scale planets and open space with no boundaries, and the best way to describe them is a mile wide and an inch deep.
It’s the ship in a bottle episode. We are on a holodeck…
The amount of computing power required to load a whole planet would be what is truly unfuckingbelievable
Clear the landing zone by landing at 5 other places at this planet..
Always works for me. Build a landing pad, fast travel to my ship, take off into orbit, land at outpost, ship is there.
Build the pad closer to the center of the outpost.
I didn’t program the game. Merely giving a solution to his problem.
Thousand years? Starfield is only set 300+ years in the future.
Have you played Fallout?  Fallout is set in a “retro sci-fi” category.  That’s because it picked up real world history until around 1930 where things went off tangent.  The player wears a Pipboy that is a gigantic watch, a smart computer with less computing power than my solar powered calculator.  

So even Fallout 4 sets 270 years in the future, that is 270 years the Earth was baking in radiation as the aftermath of a global nuclear war.  Most of humanity was dead or living their post apocalyptic life.  So the stuff we see in 2000s real world would never come true.

I don’t want to drop any spoiler here.  But remember how Earth became inhabitable in game?  Some year 2203.  It would be a mini-apocalyptic event (probably not as violent as other disaster horror movies).  So old world tech companies like Google and Apple may cease to exist.  Or even if they do, they would morph into something else, like space ship enterprise.  Because, let’s face it, next day delivery Amazon, digital music, Google search… they would take a back seat when humanity had far more concerns about survival when settling into new planets.  

It’s like Europeans discovering America all over again, with space ship and laser gun instead of musket and horse wagon.
And still faster then by courier. Hell You can Put those relays on couriers who travel on fixed routes.   


Since most people live in the main planets a Courier that makes a ring through the major cities delivering packages Doesn't ever need to actually even leave the starports at most. they land. The moment they enter orbit their ship is already offloading digital messaging. and the entire time they both land and leaving they pick up more messages due for the chain.   


At worst you dont need to LAND on Neon to complete a mission you just need to be In the system. Now if you have to pick up a reward why is there not a station at the starport you can pick up packages from?  
Not everything should require you make a personal visit to finish.  


Imagine in cyberpunk you had to make a visit to the fixer to both pick up gigs and complete them every time. It would be terrible.
And random ships landing nearby constantly.
Making enough progress to sell people ships for hundreds of dollars in the meantime.
That got me about RDR2 as well. I was being a good guy and then had that mission where you have to save that jerk from jail. He starts murdering the whole town and I almost immediately tried to kill *him* instead. Game wouldn't even let me fire my gun at him. It makes sense given that character's role later on but it would have been nice to have some kind of choice other than mass murder.
I'm kinda a noob tbh, even though I've played a bit im not up to date with how certain systems work in the game. How does the alt bind function affect the boost pack type? Is it like equipping grenades and nullifying the reload speed skill?
Assuming Bethesda even bothers to add it in.
[deleted]
Bro, go back to high school English class and learn the difference between a normative and positive statement.
No, i've played all of them, there used to be a journey and things you discover along the way instead of having to teleport everywhere.  
It's incoherent, it's trash.  
The one thing, the primary reason Bethesda was always beloved is gone now.  
Instead we now get a bunch of dots on a starmap you click to teleport to places while waiting for zoom in/out animations because the game cannot stream map data fast enough.  


It's impossible to get immersed in the game world, if you want to actually get anything done you have to avoid your spaceship as much as possible.  

Assuming it is one of the stations you can FT from (inconsistent nonsense)
Just a quick breakdown of your options if you go from a space station to a shop to sell some stuff and maybe grab some ammo:

**LOADING SCREENS - RIVETING GAMEPLAY - MAXIMUM IMMERSION**

This is just unacceptable, has anyone played this prior to release?

How do people think this is a good game?
I like aspects of it, i enjoyed some of it, but it is objectively terrible.

A flat list with every teleport location would have been better.

And this is just the tip of everything wrong with this title.
This shines with the Paradiso settlers... it's a whole planet. You got like, 50, 60 people tops on that ship. And the captain complaining that they want a place for themselves to grow... uhhh, it's a planet, with 1 city on it.  Simmer down
If we think about it though...

The "Wild West" in North America actually didn't happen until the 1800's.

Some 200 years after "settlers" left Europe in 1620 to settle "The New World" .. North America.

So even in the real world, 200 years after leaving to settle a new continent, people were still very sparsely spread out on the same planet... with large settlements in one area surrounded by nothing, and outlaws everywhere.
On my first playthrough, when I went with the dream home trait, his farm was on the same planet in the Olympus system as my home, so it hadn't occurred to me that it was a random location, because it was on a farmable planet.

Also note: never taking Dream Home ever again. It's too big to fill with the super expensive Ikea furniture (can we really not just go and BUY this stuff?)
Starfield really would benefit from a Scroll of Icarian Flight. Also, as a developer who has been specifically working on a verbal conversation app that uses GPT-3, I can say that it actually could be feasible to integrate into a game, especially if they used a fine-tuned model specific to the game, rather than a full generalized model.
Bethesda with its innate inability to fix their own buggy games will never pull Hello Games NMS, despite being larger & with larger budget.

Todd will rather ask modders to fix it for him, than do the work by himself. Then, he will take stand in front of a camera and manipulate, shame & gaslight all players into thinking, it´s all their own fault and not his or Bethesda´s.
That's also how Skyrim, Oblivion and the other Creation Engine games do it. They too have these boxes that preload (stream) when you come closer. This is both exterior and in dungeons. In dungeons (Skyrim) it's actually visible for some rooms where you only see black when you approach an open doorway. Then it slowly reveals the interior once you get closer. That's a really smart and unintrusive way of waiting with the preload until the last moment (especially when Skyrim was still like 2G maximum memory).

Aside from putting boring tiles into a map procedurally, I am fairly sure that this is also exactly how they are doing it in Starfield.
Ok, fair enough.
You wouldn't implement it like that anyway. You'd do something like Level Steaming. The entire planet would never be all in memory at once. You just load and unload sections as the player moves. To the player it would feel and play like a continuous level.

Creation Engine is apparently not capable of this tech though.
...or by creating a second outpost right at the landing area, then deleting that second outpost.
This is stupid. Why should players do this? Oh wait, it's not bad and lazy game design... It's a feature
Just wait till he finds out certain ships can’t even land on your pad
Never got into Fallout, unfortunately. My brother is a big fan, though, so I’m at least somewhat familiar with the concept, setting, available tech, etc, and I can see where you’re coming from. 

That said, a lot of the tech in Starfield is contingent upon other tech that MUST exist for them to even have what they have in the game, and a ton of those intermediate steps are missing. You have laser and particle beam directed energy weapons, but not laser communication that takes way less power? Even your average schlub can afford a ship capable of traveling at some appreciable fraction of the speed of light, but that tech isn’t used to automate resource delivery in a society that revolves around colonization of multiple planets in multiple systems? Ships can calculate point to point routes that avoid other massive objects in space or orbit, but saving frequent destinations is off the table? Any non-ship travel is by foot or a shuttle system? With physical directories in cities like you’re at the mall? How the hell did they even build and maintain all these larger colonies without this kind of stuff? 

I can understand your point about prioritizing survival and technologies that assist in that, sure, but a computer that can calculate hyperspace jump routes can absolutely display in-city route guidance or allow a store to process transactions and access their bank funds electronically. The easy answer here is that they thought that things were “good enough to sell”, and here we are. It very much seems like a “our fans will buy it anyway, so why do more?” situation, and it’s made worse when they pop up to respond to all the negative reviews with “no, you’re wrong”. It’s insulting.

Yeah, same. I think my Arthurs Bodycount outside of missions was really low in comparison (random bandits etc. excluded) because I always tried to help people if I could, and I was really low on the robbing stuff. 

But some of the quest missions that just had the whole country gang up on you so you have to murder your way out of there just felt wildly out of place - even though they were awesome to play in the moment.
On an xbox, the boost pack moves you up, not really forward. So, assuming you're sprinting, the difference between a power boost pack and a skip boost pack is 1 long 45⁰ boost arc and a bit of a short one on the way down to not injure yourself (depending on gravity) from the per pack, and 3 or 4 shorter 45⁰ arcs from the skip pack. 

Alt binding on a PC activates the secondary function of the boost pack... like the forward thrust from a skip pack.
Lmao you are taking a passing comment way to seriously. Save your  investigations for something that is worthy, your seeing things in the trees but it's all a mirage. In fact, try applying your same logic to the op and have a conversation.....kind of the point of reddit eh? Or is it a social credit system simulator for silencing ppl that say things you don't like? Can't have it both ways man, that's the part about growing up I said previously. You sound fun at holiday dinners, it's not worth making enemies over.
Nice insult, maybe learn from those high schools and get better ad hominids. Nice try covering up toxic behavior, now I know nothing you say really matters. Good job 👍
While I do agree thr length and amount of loading screens is high, many of them can be skipped. If you aren't encumbered and walking about a planet and want to go elsewhere, open the map, click or open to the galaxy star map, and select a planet to visit. Unskippable loading is getting up to access your ships cargo, arriving at a planet, and landing. Every airlock is an annoying load screen effectively too even though everything has already been loaded. It would be great if you could access your cargo from the pilot seat or landing bay and immediately land on a planet but arriving first gives you a chance encounter that could be interesting. You can also skip dialog with escape/enter.

Its more sad that I spent a lot of time trying to figure out an optimal way of avoiding animations and load screens rather than rewarding my time spent.
Great, I'm not going to read all that. I had fun with the game. Is it an amazing game? No. Is it a subpar game? yeah, I had fun none the less. It's worth the price of admission for gamepass. I do feel bad for the people who paid full price or God forbid for the deluxe edition. Feels bad, man.
even if you account for bethesda scaling which IIRC is usually said to be 1:10 scale.  


using your numbers for example, 600 people is Still to small. The average cruise ship Carries more than 60k people(Crew and passanger).
This only works if you assume they had the same travel troubles. But startield doesn't. Space travel only takes Minutes at the most not months or years. That why you have pirates at the fringes. And new factions only 60 years after.
There's likely no real reason why it couldn't be added, but the walled off areas are very large and I've never come across the wall. Still big enough for a rover imo. And consider that in some biomes a rover wouldn't even work. So some on foot exploration would be required imo. I am totally for a rover limitations or not.
Other Beth games use grids of cells to load around the player. Wouldn't that be the same thing?
or by playing a better game

I completely get your points.  But I just want to bring out a few more things not said in game (or not set obviously enough).

While I was signing up as Freestar Rangers, one of them revealed there are only 10-20 Rangers around, in the entire Freestar Collective.  Rangers are like detective as Security for patrol cops.  For comparison, there are 7500 detectives in London, for a 8.9 million population.  

This gave me pause.  Human population over Freestar collectives may be 2-10 millions, if that.  And UC can’t be that much bigger (since they are more solid and stable).  Say 20 millions?  Tokyo is the largest city on earth with 37.4 millions.  Just 1 city.  

I guess a lot of humans didn’t make it out of Earth.  So you can see how easy it is to join the Rangers or Vanguards.  They just don’t have thousands of people fighting for a job.  

The lack of population and the distance makes automated services a lot less feasible.  

But, pay attention to your Interstellar Cargo Link.  They are flown by ships with no pilot.  So that is evident of automation right there.  

When things go beyond Earth, things get a lot harder.  You can’t operate satellite for phones and gps because humans are so spread out in not just different planets but different systems now.
What's the name of that series? That sounds right up my alley.
Oh god, there was one burglary I tried to lure them out of the house with fire and the dad came out shooting. I shot him and looted the house and the son was in there crying. I picked up the trading card and the kid was like "please, that's the last thing my mother left me" or something like that. 

That broke me, had to save scum back before I tried to rob them.
I appreciate the information, thats really helpful to me as I play on PC. I've never used the skip pack tbh just read the description. Thanks for taking the time to explain this to me
Hello, have you read the table above in which I outline side-by-side how you are forced to fast travel everywhere through the map because the immersive way contains 5 loading screens and several unskippable animations, making it even less immersive?

I don't know about you, but i'm here for a space rpg, not a menu navigation simulator.

I've never managed to forget i am playing a game while playing this, because you are interrupted with some terrible menu or a loading screen every 5 seconds.

Edit: You can access your inventory from the pilot seat with the inventory button, you can also access your ship cargo with this.But if you want to transfer something from your inventory to your ship you need to switch to ship inventory, switch back to your inventory - now you are in transfer mode.
I feel bad for me too, don't worry. 

Play Starfield they said. It'll be fun they said ...

I'd rather be a rogue in BG3 rn.
Early on someone measured out how big each square is. It's large, but like a fraction of the size of Skyrim, for example
It would. So I guess Creation Engine is capable of it. Lol
This
Come on dude... just apologize and be done.
why are you deferring responsibility for these bugs? Just apologize to the fan base so we can move on.
Why didn’t you spend more time programming some depth into the economy?
That’s interesting, I hadn’t actually paid attention to those numbers, but yeah that’s a serious downscaling of the population. That said, unless a bunch of this tech was developed on Earth before the collapse, it just seems off to me. Who’s developing, manufacturing, and maintaining all this stuff with such a shrunken down and fragmented human population? 

Maybe I’m thinking too hard about this, but it just seems a little incongruent to me to have colonies with such a relatively low population count but with all the fruits of advanced industry, and yet they’re missing a bunch of intermediate technologies that would make that job a lot more feasible. This is after fighting some brutal wars that undoubtedly cut into their respective numbers as well. They may be above the waterline as far as colony collapse goes, but maintaining a place like Neon? Unless everyone is a trained specialist in some technical discipline, and everybody works, it just seems like they don’t have the manpower to keep these big colonies going in addition to a space program way more advanced than our own. Not with what we’re shown.

To me, again, the easy answer was “it’s enough to get the point across”, and so they eschewed adding further details. It’s more a sketch of the universe they intended to convey, rather than a full painting. At the end of the day it IS a game, but like, if your marketing hype is all about “hard sci-fi” and you hand wave away a bunch of the logistics… just seems a little off, is all. The part of it that actually bothers me is when it affects gameplay. Cargo links are nice, but it seems like it was just a solution to that particular “how do we make this work?” gameplay situation that has no effect on the rest of the game. You can’t use them to, say, shop for supplies from your ship. Maybe I’m nitpicking, and the new patch with “additional transportation options” sounds promising, but like, there’s no way they got these colonies to a stable state without ground vehicles, drones, long range comms, and a bunch of other stuff that is currently nowhere to be found, and in fact the game seems designed around deliberately omitting.
Expeditionary Force, I’ll caution that while the author includes a lot of interesting sci fi considerations like that(career aerospace engineer), it does lean on the campy side as most problems end up solved by highly improbable tech/circumstances bordering on magic.

But, a fun serial if you’re looking for lighthearted adventures in space written by the kind of author who would have included a whole act exploring physics paradoxes from FTL travel and how hyperdrives work had he wrote Star Wars

It has my favorite alien species in fiction, the Jeraphtha, giant warm hearted beetles who are swindlers to the core with a biological compulsion to gamble that drives every facet of their society. They’re said to like humans because all the corruption makes leagues like FIFA fantastic for betting action
Yeah I read it but the game you want isn't going to be both immersive and expansive simultaneously. The distances between planets is so vast, you're going to want to fast travel (though you can technically fly between planets in a system, its just really far away).

They could make it better by eliminating load screens by pregenerating planet content, removing airlocks on breathable planets, giving you minor QOL improvements like animation skips. The point I was making is I did the right hand column you listed for like the first 5-10 hours. The rest of my 300 hours I skipped it all and never thought about it.
Im playing Rogue Trader RN. its Also a CRPG, this one is Pathfinder based.

Definitely NOT as solid as BG3. much smaller dev, But

40k. so space. 40k space, but still space.
Why should he apologize? At least he's TRYING to be helpful. You're just being a jerk.  Take your own advice.
Im not a fucking programmer? The absolute fuck? Im answering a fucking question to a fellow player
Why don’t you program yourself a personality?
Thanks for the suggestion! I read a bit of it today and think it will be a fun read.
GOD MADE TRUMP
This has got to be the most bizarre and insane video he has ever posted. Also he definitely does not go to church every Sunday lmao
wait, he posted this? it's a Trump gaff greatest-hits and the narration is hilarious. Does he think this was made seriously as a pro-trump video? I mean... wait, was it? Most of those clips are him being an idiot. Trump pushing past the prime minister of Montenegro at NATO, him getting laughed at when he took the stage in front of other world leaders and claimed that he'd done a lot of things since he took office, his weak attempt at saluting a troop, him missing Kim Jong Un's attempt at a handshake, these are all clips that make him out to be the idiot that he is... and now he's posting it like it makes him look good... wow.
Probably most insulting is the insinuation he "woke up before dawn" and "did a full work week, then worked another 72 hours".

Trump notoriously didn't start working until late in the morning and took many vacation days.
"God needs a soldier who can wait until the first lady finishes her lunch and then tells her friends to come back real soon"  

What the fuck
If this is true, God is a fucking dick.
This is some North Korean level propaganda.
this is fucking unhinged
God needed someone to call in to Howard Stern’s radio show and talk about all the women he paid to crawl on top of. So God made Trump.
Didn't Trump spend more time playing golf than Bush and Obama combined?
fight baddies   
save country  
up before dawn  
fight with soldiers  
win wars   
save economy  
eat supper  
solve crisis   
discover land   

lmfao
God made trump like I make Taco Bell shits. 

I hope that narrator got paid actual money rather than trump bucks, good for any of his bankrupt casinos.
This is just a rip from Desantis who im sure ripped it from somewhere else. Classic Trump plagiarism
This election cycle is going to be brutal.
This isnt a parody?
>"I need someone strong enough to wrestle the deep state, and yet gentle enough to **deliver his own grandchild**."

*spit take*
God made Trump eat all those Big Macs.
seems stupid has never been so dangerous recently
This has the quality of something Entertainment 7-20 would make when Jaen-Ralphio was still in charge.
Anybody willing to argue maga is not a cult has become even more ridiculous
Holy shit this is unhinged
According to religion,  God made us all. Why is Trump so special?
i don't want to live on this planet anymore.
God also made Hitler and Stalin 🤷🏻‍♂️
I've never visited "Truth Social" but it's hilarious that they just copied twitter and replaced the word "tweet" with "truth".
You can’t trust him to run a McDonalds for fuck’s sake.
"God says.. I need someone with the courage to step foot into North Korea... So God made Trump."

So God thought that BEFORE making Trump? Even though Trump was born 2 years before NK was even founded? I dunno man, I get that God can do magic and probably see into the future but I ain't buying it.
Full 40 hours by Tuesday noon… that’s only 36 hours if he started at midnight Sun/Mon and worked non-stop. 

He isn’t counting Sunday as the start of the week either, as the video claims he finished the week on Sunday by going to church.
Goddamn America, remember that half of y’all voted for this wing nut..!
What in the fuck. Would be hilarious if it wasn’t so terrifying.
God made Trump and Trump made a poo poo diaper and squandered his vast inheritance. Along the way, stinky attempted to subvert American democracy.
[deleted]
"somebody who can shave an axe"?
Sloth love Chunk
If it weren’t for the electoral college this whole America thing woulda worked out pretty awesome.
This video gives real "born on a mountain top" vibes. I bet he doesn't shit either. Gross.
Could someone edit this, but change the audio, to the Devil made Trump, slapped him with the 666, which is under his bad comb over and instead talk about how the Devil wants Trump to destroy the Evangelical hypocrites and destroy the world, with references to Grab them by the pussy, racist and sexist remarks and how he'll cause Armageddon and then repost?
Counterpoint : If I were the devil...[Counterpoint :If I were the devil](https://youtu.be/FoX9pCG0j28?si=hwPVC6PHFuAgxi8c)
He actually does this more than most might realize, I saw a post not long ago that he shared and the image was him looking at the eclipse... probably because he's a textbook narcissist
I bet you 5 whole dollars he wrote it himself and had AI narrate
The narration, and even the whole theme, is lifted almost entirely from Paul Harvey's " And God Made a Farmer" from 1978.  

https://youtu.be/ZRDaPEaDJ7E?feature=shared
At this point, it's literally impossible to tell the difference between satire and serious material based solely on Trump or his supporters liking and sharing it. If he's in it, they assume it's complimentary. He has inculcated his followers with the same lack of discernment that he has when it comes to stuff like this. His excuse is medically significant narcissism. Theirs is gullibility / sycophancy.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s\_law
"Came home hungry" is the only true line in the entire video
Played golf 298 times during his single term, costing the taxpayer about $144 million.

TFG does not even know the meaning of the term "full work week".
Only thing he ever 'works' at is devouring McDonald's cheeseburgers.
He also notoriously stayed up late. But they're still conflating simply being awake with actually working. If that were the criteria, I'd be one of the hardest working people alive. lol
It’s ridiculous. He was known for starting at 11 and finishing at three with an hour for lunch and then leaving for FL on Thursday afternoon. We’re kinda lucky he’s so lazy. Less time for him to screw things up.
Literally the most insanely fascicle thing in that entire whack job video. Everyone knows Trump is the equivalent of a window shopper when it comes to working. The idea he’d put in a 100 hours a week on anything other than a golf course is comedy gold
Be Best - The Melania
This looks like something written by ai 5 years ago
"I barely know my wife"
Right?  What in the actual fuck.  Trump had to have written that.  Holy fuck.  Is this a fever dream?
Actually, that would explain so much.
Sounds about right.
God is a bullet. Have mercy on us everyone.

https://youtu.be/pI8TFb5Gqoo?si=E4QvXV_pE69ZkbG2
It’s ripped from a commercial from the SB like 10 years ago. “God made a farmer”
Trump himself posted this video on his Truth Social profile along with several other videos made by the same people
At first I thought no way, he is a notorious germophobe and would never be anywhere near a birthing. But then I realised he might be referring to Ivanka….
So many hamberders.
Not really. Wasn’t close to half. Sadly our system works by gerrymandering and elector votes, not popular vote. If popular vote was all that counted, republicans would never win anything but Montana.
This is probably the second or third post I’ve made on this sub ever. If you actually watched the video and don’t think it is cringe I honestly don’t know what to say to you. Anybody who posts a video like this is a laughing stock, Trump or not
Are you genuinely saying that you think Trump posting this video about himself isn’t cringe?
It's not really a case of agreeing though, is it? Trump objectively does not do all the great things that this video describes.....unless you actually believe that he does and that he's been chosen by God? Because believing that would be weird as fuck. It takes a special type of narcissist to post something like this about yourself. And, it takes a special type of bootlicker to defend this bizarre behaviour like it's some form of valid opinion.
Cringe is cringe. This is more than something people don't agree with. It's off the chart cringe for someone running for the highest office. The fact that you choose to not see that is just embarrassing for you as a human.
There's no way you watched the video if you're saying that
shape
I would absolutely take that bet. There’s no way he wrote anything. That would require work.
It’s not satire because trump himself posted it
*berders.
Indeed he is said to have watched hours and hours of TV every day. And of course he spends a lot of time posting on social media.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnOIrkqmlDk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnOIrkqmlDk)

Thanks for remembering! It's straight-up plagiarism.
The SB commercial was based on a Paul Harvey essay " And So God Made a Farmer from 1978

nah i didnt watch it, just funny how trumps mentioned on here more and more recently, and biden who has actual hours of cringe clips hasnt been posted on here once this whole year
Oh, ok, sure, like he could do either.
Deal!
Yeah but he didn't make it.
Ok, I just asked him. Turns out that God actually produced it. Pay up.
Lmaoo I believe that
Yeah, I mean, not like he ever lies. so we can definitely trust that. Anyways, I’ll send over my Venmo.
I CALLING IT NOW! NPC'S WILL FILM YOU COMMITING CRIMES AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR CRIMES IN A TRENDING PAGE OF SORTS
And that's how you'll get "followers" lol 😂

A replay of sorts of your gameplay
im shooting anybody pointing cameras at me
My guess is just like Bonnie and Clyde the attention on the duo will be their downfall

And in the later part of the story the authority probably put two and two together: a high profile couple flaunting their wealth and a mythical criminal couple who became legends on TikTok, what a coincidence. And they will be more easily to be identified by cops and the public in a crowded area
Maybe they'll work in some honor system like rdr by your good or bad actions being recorded online.
I think you're right with the NPCs filming, could be like the witness system in RDR2.

In the leaks >!when Lucia enters the cop car, it says 'full vehicle description' or something under the wanted stars. !<

Maybe if people film the crime, and upload it, the police will find out more details and your wanted level will slowly raise. Like there's levels within each star.
I feel like Jason and Lucia are going to go on a crime spree across all of Leonida and all there exploits are going to be on TV, the radio and on social media.
That would be wild. Could you imagine flipping on a tv and seeing a news report of a crime you committed while just free roaming?
My guess is you become a viral story about a couple robbing banks and as you commit crimes and they get posted the more notorious you get. I wonder if you can make posts and depending on whats going on will determine the engagement.

And then what if they actually integrate that with real life.....
What I wanna know is what if you go on the in-game app and see that someone is live streaming (like the 2 girls in the trailer) and then find where they are on the map and just interrupt their livestream by shooting or hitting them with your car
icky lip encouraging screw boast nutty voracious head ten ossified

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
Personally doubt it. You might see NPCs recording you but you won't see your crimes from random free roam shenanigans 

What I see happening is there's going to be scripted events from missions that "get recorded" that affect the story.
I remember they did something like this in Watch Dogs 1 and 2
Let me tell the thing that I am most  excited about after seeing trailer is NPCs with good NPCs game feels real i am damn  too excited 😆😆
this would be sick. RemindMe! 2 Years
I cant fucking wait man wtf😭😭😭
"film that shit"
Imagine you're watching a video of yourself stealing a car, and suddenly the npc filming does a sponsored voice over. 

"Whoa, that dude's stealing a car.  Never have your data stolen with vice vpn"
Man I can't wait to see this scene when the game comes out. It looks something straight out of a movie
The game might honestly have its own social media platform like Twitter or YouTube.
Would be an interesting system
I already had a hard time chasing and killing every witness in RDR2. Think we need nukes for this game..
NPC will film you commiting crimes in GTA V too but you won't be able see the footages.
I can see this happening. Because NPC would ring the cops to squeal 🐷 on you in The Warriors ♥️ another R*🟧 game. The leaked diner scene showed CCTV alerting the Dade County Sheriff's Dept: but they had a response time. So hopefully if we're quick. We can get in and out before the cops rock up. 

The use of Social Media in the trailer. Tells me people are going to film you. Will this bring the cops? Or just our crimes appear on Weazel News. Would be cool if a Weazel News Maverick (filmed the Triathlons in V) will show up. So you have to lose the News chopper before the VCPD Maverick shows up. Could we steal people's phone then hock it @ the Fence (from RDR2). Adding insult to injury to snitches 🐭.

Something else I thought of is Chinatown Wars: had CCTV cameras so maybe we can take them out to increase the cops response time. I wonder if there will be a safe we can crack or blow open w/ C4. Like in RDR2 (There was a safe in back of every store in Saints Row). Also RDR2 had back rooms. If the game has a Taser we might be able to zap clerk ⚡, zip tie them, crack the safe then get out before the cops rock up.

Just had a thought if 6 is like Saints Row 2/The Punisher on PS2: then we can take hostages. Use them as bullet shields or a bargaining chip (Rainbow Six Siege: another example of excellent destructible environments). In IV cops would arrest suspects. Cop chasing a crook, we punch 'em. Watch 'em get arrested: Good citizen bonus $50. This is Vice City 🌴🩷. Hopefully we can get brass knuckles 👊: POW! Right in the kisser.
I don’t think GTA could have an honor system as WD1/RDR2💀

It doesn’t fit the game. We all know that 99% of the players just go out and make massive shooting
For some reason, I doubt you will be able to see playback of whatever the NPC's are "recording" (because they won't actually save).

BUT, I wouldn't be surprised (or at least I *hope*) that there is the ability to switch the cinematic camera to the NPC's camera angle in real-time. Similar to how you can switch to the dashcam or chopper view of the cops chasing you in GTA V.

And I would be surprised (and also hope) that when you are wasted, you can potentially see NPC's reacting to the scene, especially through their phone cameras. That would be incredibly surprising to me if included. Would be very hard to pull off and kind of a pipe dream for me, but yeah....
Yeah I’m assuming it’s gonna be like rdr2 witnesses and we also have actual functioning security cams recording us in certain areas.
Same with the security cameras!
Cameraman ~~never~~ WILL die.
Every in-game day, there is a new video of me driving over the people on Washington Beach
I’d love rockstar to release an actual app for your phone so we can have a true GTA 6 social platform in real life.
I wouldn't be surprised if Rockstar creates their own social media app for the game.

Not on my watch!
Remindme! April 20, 2025
And then we hunt them down hehehe 😝
I'm gon be famous then
That was part of GTA V already but it wasn't visible that NPC's filmed stuff but you could find jobs back in the news and online.
Replay feature in form of social media post. That would be sick.
💯 

Some will film you, some will run away, some will just faint, I think some might even join in 👀 

I really hope this isn’t going to be another Cyberpunk where we all get excited and it flops

The good thing with Rockstar is they don’t disappoint
RemindMe! 16 months
This definitely adds a complexity to the wanted level scenario. I wonder if the cell phone will also be gps locatable by the authorities. I'm curious how deep rockstar will go with this concept. So much to be seen.
That's a good mechanic. As others have said, take out the person filming you to keep this from happening, but I'm sure there will be so many instances where you can't take out everyone filming you. There will definitely be at least one instance where that doesn't happen for the sake of the storyline. Because the cops or whoever is the bad guy will have more info on you. I imagine things would get harder in the story for the characters if they are constantly being filmed. If this won't be a game mechanic, it will be sad because it is a brilliant concept.
Wow. If your theory proves true, this would actually make me buy the game I think. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses)
I guarantee that they have a fully fleshed out virtual smartphone instead of the menu that was styled as a phone in GTA5 which we will use for contacting other players and you know it will be full of functional parody apps. So if this is a thing, you know the NPCs will have access to "Instaspam" and "Z..formally known as tweeter" as well as "Red It" lol. You can probably take NPCs "phone numbers" in the game and text them and be texted funny shit. That's why a GTA done at this level and scale is worth the wait and the investment. It's been in development about as long or longer than Star Citizen. It's crazy to think about just how much ridiculously fun and interactive stuff Rockstar can pack into a game at this point in their life as a company. They are richer than ever and have more creative people employed than ever. They have what amounts to a limitless pocketbook, so I really expect an in-depth experience that blows 5 outta the water. That's saying something, too.

He's definitely filming, at first I thought he was shooting at them 😂
Lol
Image fighting off citizens is harder than police 😱 not until the military shows up of course 💣
Don’t say it so loud, they might read your idea and push the release date back so they can add it into the game
Im calling it now, GTA 6 will have its own version of social media. A tiktok or instagram parody. Based on your gameplay, you can become viral or not. Would be crazy to hunt down npcs doing wild stuff. Alligators biting people and stuff
Hopeful thinking. I think it'll definitely recall your missions but in free roam I'm doubtful.
This was already in the leaks bruh
I just realized I don’t remember an NPC ever pointing their phone at me and taking a video in any other game. Anyone else?
And so begins the overhyping of the game. You guys are setting yourselves up for disappointment. It's GTA. It's going to be GTA 5 with reworked RDR2 mechanics and graphics. Hype as hell but don't start doing this. The same thing happened with RDR2. One of my most upvoted posts on here was about an alleged feature in RDR2 where Arthur would button or unbutton his shirt depending on the heat and humidity of the area he's in, and that ended up being fake.
[deleted]
Of sorts
I called it first.
This is actually a dope take. Haven’t thought of that
Moment they make gesture for the phone I'm spraying.
RemindMe! 2 Years
Now this is a theory I can get behind
!remind me 2 years
Literally will just be videos of me taking out those groups of bikers with a semi. Lol
i am also calling it now if i saw one fucker recording me without my permission.  i will be running my car over him/her/them
I actually said this few days ago in a comment 💀
I thought the opposite where you can potentially set up scores and gather evidence based on content from social media
Would be awesome if the 1 star could stay for day/days, so if you commit a crime your location could be detected with License plate technology or cctv, and bot just random police following you 
The more realistic the better
There’s NO WAY they’ve spent all that money on developing this game and not done something super cool like this!
Legit thought this too with all the social media and news being shown off, even thought they will probably allow you to see yourself on the news when you finally walk past a tv that is already on or when you sit down in your own safehouse, probably somehow built in a recorder and replay that goes on in the background that you don't see until the news is on.
Don't think it would work. Maybe in cutscenes but definitely not a game mechanic. Console/PC has to save the video clip somewhere and it would eat up your storage. As much as I want it to be true (Me falling face first off of a bike and then randomly shooting the dirst guy I see and driving off again) It's just too impractical.
I wouldn’t be shocked if they had that little Watch Dogs thing where they will call
the police and you can stop them.
probably this is the new "witness" mechanics like in rdr2
That's for sure 💯!
Least overhyped gta6 fan
Honestly I hope the parody of TikTok won’t be too much of an essential game mechanic. I couldn’t care less about TikTok irl I won’t care about it in game lol. It’s a really cool extra feature but I’m not sure I will like it if it plays too much of an important role in the plot
I already had a hard time chasing and killing every witness in RDR2. Think we need nukes for this game..
RemindMe! April 20, 2025
i cannot imagine people recording us doing crazy shit.. if this happens its really gon be cool
Joooo fr😨😨😨🤔🤔
Now this is an epic feature 😂
I hope we can see body cam footage of police chases and of when they arrest the player
That would be cool as fuck
Nice, but my similar post was deleted 🤦‍♂️
probly a hands off animation after or during a mission this scene.
I guess something like an improved honor system from rdr2 will be in play, affecting your interactions and social media in game.
RemindMe! June 1, 2025
Itssssss Showtime
CCTV plays a part in this game. It's featured in the leaks and the trailer.
That would be crazy. Filming me is one thing but uploading it on social media and being able to see it, would be astonishing
Can’t wait
Rock-Gore.com
I fucking love this idea. Small petty crimes like auto theft have more viewers based on location, or if you have a knife in a convenience store or something. If it’s more severe crimes like 5/6-star speed chases or mass shootouts they start reposting news stories/articles from helicopters following you etc


One hidden gem about V was how after major storyline missions (like the heists) they’d play segments after on the radio talking about it. Same thing as watchdogs or so; a reputation system that actually means something valuable and affects the world around you substantially
Maybe an rdr2 style witness system. Where you threaten to delete the video or destroy NPC phone otherwise you will be on wanted list.
an npc snitching would be my final straw
mmm yes can't wait to be an inadvertent TikTok star inspiring children to hold up gas stations while buck-naked
NPC's doing gameplay video for u
That is my theory also.
I hope they make it realistic tho, which means it will depend on the severity of the crime. For example, mass shooting would cause mass panic. And, brawls in public would cause attention to the public which will make them film you and try to call the police. Robbery (If there is, but I am sure there will be.) would be the calling of the police. Accidents and fire, they would call an ambulance and fire department while filming the place of the accident, like an exploded car in the highway spreading fire.

This is actually a good addition to the game/series, especially the previous GTA where they only call the 911, GTA V should've had this. Good thing Rockstar North is actually following the change in our times/era.
Plausible, but cant see it storing every single crime you do due to storage space. maybe 1 or 2 a day that get deleted after a set period of time? Otherwise I could see lot of HDDs getting full quickly.
That'd be insanely cool
I think its the opposite.
Or. Hear me out, I know its hard to belive. This is just a mission/cutscene.
Realism simulator
Is it 2025 yet
Wow
Didn't know I wanted this until now.

Great idea.
I could actually see this being a thing. It’s almost like they began testing the mechanic all the way back in IV when they had the record feature that let you play back and make movies.
I need it in real life tho. Too many people for crimes to go unnoticed in real life.
Yes
this my favorite part of the trailer, the music syncs so well when Lucia’s raises her arms
The npcs in gta 5 screaming "film that shit" will actually film and upload it in gta 6 lol
I thought about this. Instead of everyone fleeing the scene, there will be a handful of people with their phones out recording. Or even some fleeing as they’re recording.
It could be, actually.

Imagine the "cinematic camera" you can turn on while driving etc. filming constantly with some sort of AI deciding whether it's good content, and you get passerbys and drones buzzing about regularly and before you know it you can see shots of yourself doing crazy shit, driving fast, shooting things, causing havok and it's all on tiktok, filmed with a passive cinematic camera of sorts so you get aerial and street level shots like you normally would when triggering it in gameplay.
I’m betting crime goes down irl if everybody can live their criminal side virtually
Man that’d be dope lol
You shoot me I shoot you
Will they film me if I smoke crack?
See that live leak appear in the corner your done
Wonder if you'll be able to shoot the phone out of their hands!

I wonder, if a post gets enough "exposure", will the Police, or vigilante mobs, ID you and come after you?
Ugh, I hope they don’t force you to do the social media. I don’t fuck with that shit in real life, I damn sure don’t want to in a crime game.
Would be a nice approach of a Replay Mode, love this idea! You will see your crimes from different perspectives in social media and the newschannels.
Using social media in this game will affect some aspects of your in game character's story, you watch.
DUDE. That would be insane. 

Imagine you gunning down some folks and then go on the "Instagram" app and see a literal instant replay video of an actual NPC's POV recording what you did!

I love how at this point we have no idea how crazy our expectations should be. Something that crazy might actually be possible
Omg that would be hilarious AHAHA GTA's very own Fail Army 🤣🤣
that would be sick. Imagine doing a heist with your friends and you open the social media app and no.1 on trending is a bunch of people in crazy outfits robbing a bank
I'm excited for the Tommy Vercetti references!
I want to be able to scroll through a virtual tiktok of crazy things happening that are all AI generated by the game to just put characters in crazy situations.
Reminds me of Saints Row 2 where NPCs would call the police when they saw you committing a crime
Yeah this was in the leaks that NPCs will have their phones out so I pretty much expect that in this modern world you have to watch everything when committing crimes.
I AM SO FUCKING HYPED 2 more years is nothing when you really think about it my people 🙏 stay safe, hang in there and before we know it we’re going to be tearing shit up in vice city 🌆
I think that would be like in rdr2 once a pnj sees you some will start raccording and the others will call the police up to you how to convince them not to
I think this was somewhat in Watchdogs right? Its been a min since I've played but I remember NPC's around you reporting crimes and recording you.
People need to set expectations back a ways lmao
Probably not this is just a cinematic trailer, but that would be really fucking cool if they did that.
That would actually be hilarious.
This would be fucking awesome, hopefully everyone can see me teabag a dead cop or hooker
It should be interesting game feature. Imagine when you doing something badly it’s will be frame on virtual news channel and you will see it on your virtual phone
If this becomes true I can’t imagine what kind of content will come from gta6😂
sorta like the news papers in rdr2
Maybe player can scream fake news and deny it lol
I feel this is just a cutscene. I wouldn’t think too much about it
FLORIDA SIMULATOR
Imagine a app working as digital journal for your GTA VI history.. LMAO 🤣🤣
That would be funny
Or it will just be an app on our real smartphones when we can see those kind of things and nothing in game... Don't have high expectations I'm telling you
Ehh... As long as we can play basketball, eat, workout and build muscle or fat, and have girlfriends that we consummate ill be happy
It would make sense because people film everything
They’re definitely being shot!
Good prediction
Much like RDR2 witnesses, instead of running to the authorities, they'll post it online lol
YOOOO
Im sure the will be a lot of armed citizens too who will not let you just mow them down.
This would be awesome. And then you get more famous as the game goes on
I like the way u think OP
It’d be awesome and I hope I’m proven wrong, but I don’t think it’ll happen outside of story missions.
And you can go to jail and be seen on the news
I agree
Which would probably put the cops on your ass even more lmao I like it
I like that idea so much tbh. lol
Something like a witness from rdr2 is quite possible
I really hope there will be like Karen npcs. The neighborhood watch lady and the dude grabbing his crotch in traffic makes me optimistic there will be. But that would be so more realistic and awesome, an npc filming you do a crime and then getting more police attention because of it, and then being able to watch the recordings.
Interesting! Maybe some sort of online reputation will take place. Like Karma on Reddit.
This will definitely happen within the story mode. If it happens in free roam it’s gonna be hilarious
I can’t wait to use the twerk emote whilst committing crimes
This would be an insane feature 🔥
I hope we can record our own crimes and make profit from them. Become some type of chaotic creator that blows up in popularity. 

"Watch me smoke these rich slimy assholes on their yacht!"
Idc...games gonna be woke as hell
That is such a cool idea
Remindme! 2 years
My murder count will be super high then!
I am shooting everyone. Please record me behind that sprunk vending machine and send the video to Weasel News
Imagine the homicidal rampage being live-streamed 🤪😜
Guys look someone got into a possibly life threatening car crash and they look really hurt. Quickly get your phones out I need this for my tiktoc!
I’ve noticed the npc’s in gta5 online recording me committing crimes. I saw it last night when I was stealing a car. Just nothing comes of that yet.
Can’t wait to see DarkviperAu’s fact and glitches series in this game
Man yall are really spot on in these! That would be a fantastic spin on things
Ohh boi, can't wait to see people complaining for features that were never promised by the developers
Can definitely see that happening. 
Apparently, NPC’s are going to have the most significant improvement in all of the previous GTA titles. 
Imagine you’re robbing a 24/7 and somebody wants to play hero and stop you. 
Like sir, I have ROCKET LAUNCHER!
They’ll probably execute me the first time because it’s still so unexpected.
They did that in GTA 5
This is reminding me of watch dogs 2 but better
Please be right…please…
That's pretty much what I was thinking, too. I also think one of the characters die.
I sure hope so
There will be a lot of NPCs ima punch in the face based on their habits
Indeed and then name your handle by whatever you want.
RemindMe! 1 Year
I was thinking maybe, if you show up in the background of a tiktok the police are alerted of your position.
it would be cool if cops didn’t start shooting right away and tried arresting us instead that way we can fight back and escape rather then automatically shooting
why are you yelling
I think ppl are going to play more for the social media part of it😂😂
That would actually be sick lmao
Gta6 gon be jus like rdr 2
Gonna Spam crouch to make it look silly
Pure just curiosity but why would this be appealing?

I'm reading it(maybe I'm not getting the idea)

All I can think of... To be fun is it could be a way to get consistent, fun variations in playback footage for sharing on YouTube or friends.

But what kinda system is needed? That's basically like Nvidia and many other companies that have software that is always recording so much. Which is incredibly resource intensive.

Sure, it's localized but....

Yeah. I dunno. Seems difficult to me.

What if you have 20 NPCs in range of you, robbing a store, funny stuff happens and you die, then what, you browse through a feed of clips they all took?
Ooh I like this!
That'd be awesome. That's one way they could bring the wanted system from RDR2 into GTA:6.
*emotes at them and walks away while committing more crimes*
I could see this happening and it would be hilarious
And the headlines will read “Florida man…”
GTA 6 is gonna be the next cyberpunk and 2042 don't over hype it yet, still has a year
That's cool.  I'll start shooting at them and keep shooting as they run away with their phones just like they do in GTA V
Ima record all of you and send it to the PD 💯
My first action will be to drive a vehicle through the 100 people on the beach while they livestream it. lol
I think this too. 

You’ll need to either slap the phone outta their hand, force them to delete or get the fuck outta there. 

Maybe if you’re on social media, the cops can use AI CCTV to spot you. 

On the other side you can check your own social feed on the phone and see what else is happening and maybe see events (think the Snapchat map).

Then online, your friends can live stream robberies and heists and shit. Or you can see on socials your buddy got arrested lol
Npcs will film you being arrested and will insult the Police just knowing the part of the story they witnessed.
This has been posted soooo much already.
Maybe scripted events. But actual live footage of you doing shit sounds crazy expensive (performance wise). That means every npc has a built in dvr or recording ability.
Bro I'm gonna say it, I'm going to kill everyone on the streets, but the consequences in GTA 6 will be mad bad bro.
I’m leaving no witnesses
Youre not psychic. Thats aderf how its gonna be
And we're gonna be social media stars because the internet just loves making psychos famous!
half the guys acting to be excited for gta 6 have never even completed 1 gta game
Imma turn into fleece johnson so they can really catch me in 4k

![gif](giphy|Pmt9INtEp3HgY)
Remindme! 2 years
Like how in spectate mode it gives you a newscast from a helicopter. Now it's going to be on life invader.
Absolutely. I think they're  gonna become a Bonnie and Clyde. The satire of insta and tik being apart of you either filming or what op said. Idk maybe just a small part of the story. But I can see an ending where you go out in a blaze of glory
It's gonna be a new version of the witness system I bet. People recording you.
Shoot me, shoot you
I want a court system in this game with an option to hire S’all Good Man as my defend attorney
"Blast em'!!" -Stormtrooper
They’re saying it’s either based on TikTok or IG, I’m guessing something like Snap..
Heck I wonder if happen remember doing this back in the 80’s heck even in the 90’s
The bit in the trailer where they're being filmed in the car is probably the introduction of this idea.
That would be cool
That's what I think as well! Kinda like in RDR2 if you commit a crime in front of someone they'll run for the cops I think people will call and/or film you. Be neat af to see your crimes on social media :D
Sounds too far feteched tbh
Now just realizing this one is Lucia too
The great Overhyping begins
I wonder if that means cops will be able to track you down based on that information. Kinda like in Mafia 2 when you steal a car you become "Wanted" and then they remember who you look like and what clothes you where. The only way to get rid of that was to go to the custom shop to get rid of the licsence plate and then change out of your clothes so nobody recongize you.
That would be so sick
Most likely!
It's gonna be fire for sure
I remember when V was coming out talking with my coworker about how NPC would film you and report you to the police. Now it’s going a step further if this is the case. Seems very cool.
Honestly, if I can wear a bandanna on my face and juggalo face paint to fool facial recognition software just like you can IRL, I'd do it in a GTA game.
For sure, also in Florida our car culture is huge so rolling shots could make for some cool car meet  moments
This would be the only time and place that the camera man never lives
H
If you show a nipple on twitch will you get banned?
I hope it’s like free guy, and they put AI NPCS in the game
This is fire af
Social media is gonna be a huge part of this game.  Probably even make an onlyfans.
I strongly believe that just like how with GTAV they made their own little internet, we’ll have some media feed of sorts, similar to the Spider-Man games where it progresses with the story.
anybody that films me is getting shot lmfao
IM CALLING IT NOW TAMPA BAY FLORIDA!

This game gon be a problem 💯🫠
That would be awesome to see
If so, I hope the footage is shown on the news!
I’m just here for the entertainment :)
Could be an extension of RDR2's witness/wanted system
Way to repeat half of the YouTube guesses out there Cpt obvious
Yeah and it looks like they become “famous” and popular as the story grows…
That would actually be an amazing feature! I hope they do that haha.
So it's kinda like Watch Dogs when NPCs call the cops on you?
Whether it happens or not, this is a genius idea.
I had the same thought
Not only that, but the more views it has, the more people that will notice you in public 👀
I’m going to do exactly what I do in RDR. Feed feminists to alligators.
Great 💡 idea
They will Film it and cops will know where you are
lol what does this picture have to do with the post?
I swear if theres a you ‘must be X popular online to do this or get discounts that im gonna be mad. Unless its 1 mission and its suppose to be a joke
That’s dope but I suspect it’ll be more used around big missions/actions than just too much in free mode. Just my gut feeling as cool as the idea is.
I could see this happening at certain parts of the story but not just everyday running into crowds on the beach
That’s what I was thinking. Instead of running away, half of the npcs are gonna stop and pull out there phones and start filming you.
Ima try to play this one realistic 😂
Imagine if someone live streamed you while you driving fast then suddenly you got a star wanted level lmao
Pfft I called that like a few minutes before you in my head
Everyone forgot dismemberment will def be a thing bc it was in rdr2
I thought about it too, it would be really cool, specially gaining followers and all that would add so much fun
U gotta b a dev
I'm pretty sure that it's going to be how you find other players in multiplayer since Rockstar hides the dot on the map now
It will be more like the witness in game mechanic in RDR2
Lmao this is the only correct response.
They shoot digital, I shoot 5.56mm.
Not if it's on live. Your screwed lol
Naw fr 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 no witnesses almost like the watchdogs
Sorry officer, I had no choice.
*Elon Musk has blocked you*
Got an actual laugh out of me. That's the perfect response
Ah yes, the ol' shotgun to the face.
My exact thought when I heard about phone cameras possibly being a thing lmao
Bro gone be on live shooting somebody without a mask and get a warrant then the fbi (fib) gone be kicking in your doors
Dont they already do this in GTA 5
In Minecraft*
📸📸
Worddd 😭
Cameraman never dies!
The most Miami shit I've heard in a whileeeeer
Someone else pulls out a camera to film you every time the previous person is shot lol
No witnesses
Settle down there officer
Hopefully with a tank
They're impeding an investigation 

/s
![gif](giphy|l0IyeOnag0kkj53Pi)
That's me on rdr2 then I realise I've killed the whole of valentine for trying to snitch
Facts 🤣
Finally a place where the cameraman dies
This is what I said, but I think it would be cool if you could take everyone's phone from them to prevent them recording you and all that, and in doing so it would keep your wanted level a bit lower to prevent you from getting caught easier.
I would love a intimidation method like in RDR2!
>bruh what if it's like that black mirror episode
Bro I’m live-streaming my shootouts
I'm gonna shoot their phones
Rdr2 witness intensify
“I thought the click was a gun pointing at me so I responded in defense”
Imma shoot everybody anyway. Camera or not.
NPCs already record you in GTA V
😂
LMFAO
Like the honour system in rdr2
Wow! Amazing! Emotional for sure I wonder how they'll inpliment the honor system and the whole thing about people remembering what arthur did for them after he passed
When they ask who did this you tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox did it alright? Say it!
hope they dont go down the betrayle shtick
I think that will happen earlier in the story and they’ll be forced to do dirty work for federal agencies (FIB and Agency missions).

I also think Lucia will start small, like drug dealing, and drag Jason for protection during these transactions, and end up either fucking things up or being given an unrefusable offer, provoking a bigger crime spree of them and larger heists (similar to GTA V, but vamping in scale as they successfully rob more and more places).
I hope the story allows for freedom at the end like GTA V, if we’re constantly on the run or restricted it will be less fun
I was thinking the other day how it’s Inevitable that it gets to a point where they can’t be out in public, so maybe they’ll do missions where someone/people with influence can sort of pardon you somehow if you do something for them. Like a group of crooked cops, crooked judge or some powerful criminal organization with ties to the government and law will have you rob/kill/catch somebody. You can sort of build up what kind of influence you have and it’ll determine your wanted level. Maybe the last mission will be some John Wick shit where they all turn on Lucia and Jason and the whole state is after them.
But it's based on Florida, you gotta do something that's really bad to stand out
Remindme! 3 years
Holy shit if we play as celebrities in gtaVI and have swarms of crowds chasing us that could be something  no other game has done
Yeah, a modern honor system.

I immediately thought of the Watch Dogs reputation system. Every crime you do in front of the people will make them call the police until it's unstoppable and if you do survive the cops, your reputation is now low and you can be seen in the news with a negative impression.

But it can be positive if you do vigilante missions where you're less likely to get caught.

I hope it's similar to this but better. Heck, I wish for vigilante missions to return where it's no longer limited to a car or a short time limit and I hope this integrates into the honor system so that the player can have a high honor system by being seen on social media for stopping criminals online with the most insane methods you can think of too.

I want to have a moral decision system for an open-ended mission and I plan to make Lucia or Jason a high honor ASAP.
Ooooo I like it! I am wondering how they will implement the honor system and this is actually a great idea
And bring in masking like RDR2
Remindme! 2 years
Remindme! 3 years
But if you confront them like in RDR2, you might be able to make them delete the video, or even rob their phone.
Wow! I don't doubt it I really hope they revamp the wanted system cus gta5 cops too dumb and rdr2 cops too smart
You can see people recording you in the leaks as the police search for Jason and he is hitting the people recording so they run away
I love that the wanted level is now getting things like vehicle description and hopefully outfit and maybe other defining features. 

Always hated in previous GTA’s how you can for example smoke someone in an alley with no NPC nearby, get wanted, steal a car from a parking garage with zero witnesses, and then when I’m driving down the street trying to get away an oncoming cop will just know to bust a U Turn because they somehow recognize me.
I think the “full vehicle description” is the same one as GTA 5 where it would just list the name of the car when you got in it lol.
Hmm, honestly don't care too much for that aspect of RDR2. I would be much more excited if this was more akin to the movie Nerve.
I’m sure it will work similarly to RDR2 - I actually think game is in a lot of ways a sounding board for what we’ll get here
I think it might be a new way of finding side characters and missions as well. You'll get notifications or see videos of some shit going down on your phone, and then you can drive to that area and find a new in game event happening
BINGO!
Amd their downfall will be the same as Bonnie and Clyde's!
Or maybe a twist on it
Hahahah nah not just TV your phone! They're gonna update the phone they have to! We're glued to our phones!
😮
YOOOOO that'll be nuts!
Ohhh snap he calling out the date and everything wow!
RemindMe! April 20, 2025
Most realistic expectation imo
I hope we don’t get magic stars again where you shoot someone with a silencer in the middle of nowhere with not a soul as a witness and you still get wanted
If you remember they have a patent for an AI system, as well as the leaks that have turned out to be true have stated GTA VI will have the most advanced AI you've ever seen in a game. Actually fun fact an AI recording you is technically possible in GTA V but with heavy modification and a script. Now In regards to what the OP said it's more then possible if they have a system set up for social media. "If this true then this..." basically with routes setup within the game engine via a script that turns the NPC into a camera with a generated overlay (basically would generate an overlay such as Tik Tok or Instagram live or snap chat from a predefined list of overlays(basically Procedural) as well as generated title and comments and usernames) where you can view later on. This is more than possible with today's tech and software. In lamens terms it would basically be a heavily modified version of replay mode that's been in games since the 90s/early 2000s. What about how it would be stored? Wouldn't that take up even more space on your hard drive? No, not in theory as the engine could put the footage into a predefined temp file and after so much time passes in game that social post/news story is no longer available and it deletes that footage.

Edit- It is more then likely theyve used the Rockstar Editor as the foundation for this as it already stores a simplified version of your frame by frame gameplay, such as the position of every character, vehicle, object, particle effects/animations/sounds and their start time + their current % elapsed in a temp file.
I really hope, I mean a game that encourages you to do crime having an honor system just doesn’t really fit right
Could be an offshoot of the Red Dead kill cam. Spitballing though because I have no clue how that would be implemented

Realistically yeah I’d imagine it is set moments that get captured if this is a part of the game
Look at you, with your realistic expectations
Really!? I have it and never touched it might make me go back
Npc's are so dense In this game I hope we get deeper interaction with them
Right I’m so excited, I can’t stop thinking about this game 😫
Mark my words!!!
Lol
I think it’s straight up gameplay
Not might. It definitely will. V already had snapmatic and life invader social networks.
The nemesis system from the shadow of mordor/war games would be interesting, you beat someone up and later they catch you slip and start dumping on ya
I'd love it if it appeared on the news or social media and police keeps track of it
YOOOOO! These are all insane ideas that would make gta 6 nuts!
You can do that in RDR2 too
YOOOOO for real huh! I think rockstar has something clever up their sleeve
Hahahaha I can see it now
like the old ifruit app for V?
What is bro yapping about 💀
I agree but I'm preety sure Rockstar has an army of geniuses that thought of this and expanded in it! It's coming!
Facts facts facts! We're glued to our phones all day there's no way Rockstar don't parody this
Ohh and you already know some missions will be found online I also wouldn't be surprised if a scary tik toks hint to something in game and you have to go looking for it
I thought V had that for some reason. In the 6 trailer, you can see people on their phones outside in that clip of crocodile walking into store
Nope! It's a first! It's gonna be crazy!
4chan 🤦‍♂️ ....also easy bait saying based on Place Beyond the Pines when they haven't even seen that film to know what it's about
It doesn't have to save it in video form. It can just be basic data about everything that is happening in the scene, such as animations, NPC models, coordinates etc, which is then used by the game engine to render a video of the scene. Could be a few MB at most.
It would just save data about whatever is happening on the screen, which can then be used to render a video of the scene. This has been a thing since the PC version of GTA III.
Wow! That's a good idea "content creation"of some sorts

Obviously" influence "has to be in this equation
I also speculate gta online was the testing ground for gta 6 and that's why they "milked" it, aside from money of course
Exactly! So in gta 6 it makes sense they expand on it
😂
Yes yes yes remember rdr2 everybody was strapped, this is the south so it's gonna be alot of trunks popping open
Yea I heard but it didn't expand beyond that, this trailer is filled with social media posts so it just makes sense you can record other npc's and npc's can record you, a highlight of sorts of your gameplay history over time builds up
I think there might be 3 endings Lucia lives is the bad ending, Jason lives is the good ending, because again I think Lucia is a bad girl, like toxic negative bad and I think both dying is the best ending, like Bonnie and Clyde, with another character related to these 2 being the one you play as, like jack in rdr2

Then people who interacted with the couple could comment on them, just like people commented on Arthur depending on his actions
Rdr2 wanted system was trash!
I’d be willing to bet that “social media” will play the role of the phone/reputation systems in former GTAs.
![gif](giphy|qaBJoGqAxyMucS7uUP|downsized)
I shoot smegma
Yoooo imagine when it is, but you can see a clip of the guy's POV getting shot by you online.
Maybe that’s how they keep the player on the rails of society instead of just police conflict.

And you know these NPCs are going to stay strapped
ESPECIALLY when it's live 😂
Well, at least one thing won't be alive afterwards.
No. In V characters do stop and take out their phones to seemingly record an event, but that is just an animation that doesn't go deeper. What OP is thinking here is that there will be actual footage from those NPCs available on in game social media.
Actually yes! They pull out their phone and “film” but it’s just an animation nothing special
I don't believe so. NPC's can call the police, though. 

This will be on a whole 'nother level. Imagine NPC's livestreaming your killing spree and you going full postal. Man I can't fucking wait for this game!
Exactly my thoughts. “Witness” will no longer be some rubber neck on a horse but a snot nose teenager with an ifruit phone
Could be!

We off the grid grid grid
The ending could end up be similar to the end of RDR2 where there was gangs of Pinkerton patrolling everywhere and everyone knows your face
Yes this system could change so much the way we play GTA! Just like what the actual social media platforms did to us.

Imagine all the crazy shit that could happen: some public members would view them as crooks and call the cops while the others might actually help them to escape. You could probably also run into some crazy internet stalkers, simps or imposers of the two on side missions it would be hilarious
A tale as long as time
Ah yes. If I'm recorded robbing a bank that's - 2 meow meow beans
I wonder if they’ll implement a feature in WD1 where you can appear on the news and if civilians recognise you, you can get the cops called just based on them seeing you. But, if public opinion is strong they’re less likely to rat you out
They need to hire some of you guys
That would be awesome
Wow, this would actually be wild! There is usually some new gameplay innovation in every new GTA. I could see this being the thing. It would totally change the way we experience the game. Man, I'm so excited!
YOOOOO! Facts facts facts!
Or take them lmfao. Sometimes it had to be done in RDR 2
And you'll be able to sell their phones / other valuables at pawn shops
I’ll probably just end up robbing gas station again
This is not how crime works in real life, that is a stupid idea
Context?
Wasn’t this already in GTA, at least for the radio? Like after a lot of missions especially the big ones if you’re listening to the radio it would cut and they’d announce some breaking news you were part of lol
When GTA 6 releases on 4/20
AI as in something similar to ChatGPT? That's the only way I can see them having some type of commentary on your random shenanigans. 

If so can you send me where you found this? Don't doubt what you're saying, would just like to read it
Why don't you think an honor system would work? It might have to be tweaked but it worked in RDR2 when you were in a robbing & killing gang of cowboys
It was in Legion. Every NPC had relationships with others and if you killed them their friends would hate you.

If you don’t know, don’t worry about it kid. Live your best life.
I swear 5 does have it? Am i going crazy
NPCs did it in GTAV and Watch Dogs but it was never integrated.
![gif](giphy|eb4WGfjWeIsgM)
What the fuck is this 😂🤣
Gonna be hard to film me with semen all over the lenses
You don't get arrested you get cancelled.
Sick!!
Absolutely expecting it especially after rdr2
It is Florida, after all
Yeah its a blink or you’ll miss it moment when u play 5
If Rockstar adds that to the extent you guys are describing how will it make sense in the story? 

They would have to write the whole story around it.
This for my kid, kid, kid
Wasn’t expecting a Ye reference here haha

I’m begging for a Ye track to be used in the gameee
And if rockstar actually put a r*ddit in the game with a sub dedicated to Lucia, the game will be officially a perfection
This!!! Like idea!!! You'll have "onlyfans" that come following you trying to be like you 😂😂😂😂
Oh shit, maybe that stalker speculation will trigger random events like in RDR2
Yeah and if the news played outside the witnesses immediately report you but you can stop them by throwing their phones away.

If you do have a good reputation if you roam around the city sometimes people can call you out like "Hey it's the vigilante!".

I hope GTA VI implements this feature as it also integrates with the game's theme and story.
They’ve likely already got a crack team of designers who came up with all these tiny details already
Nintendo hire this man
Oh 1000%, didn't even think of that!
Context for what?
RemindMe! April 4, 2025
Rdr and gta are kind of similar on the surface but gta focuses more on being a criminal while rdr focuses more on the duality of man. They both overlap in some ways but rdr has more of a focus on whether you want to continue being an outlaw or want to be a moral citizen, while gta has always been about doing crime, which makes sense since the title is literally a real crime.
And speaking of Watch Dogs NPCs, I really hope the folks at Rockstar spent time with Watch Dogs 2 and studied how dynamic and reactive the NPCs were. You could just stand around watching a crowd and all sorts of crazy shit could just start happening, and it would happen in interesting and unexpected ways, because it was just chaining random NPC reactions together, often into something wonderful.
Rdr2 did that too. Arthur killed this one ladie’s husband and every time you ran into her she’ll start spilling out about it
![gif](giphy|l49K2rm0Hjg7PmbUA)
i thought you gonna say semen all over your face because you will be playing a latina
~~WASTED~~ CANCELLED
#NOOO
Alec Baldwin has something else to say.
[deleted]
Florida is more normal than California lol
Not really. They can build the whole phone ecosystem out as a separate thing from the game world itself. Just like looking at your phone in real life in a way. It's all contained within the phone. So an NPC can "film" you on the fake parody of Instagram they make called "instaspam" lol. You can open instaspam on your in-game phone with a notification and see you trending on the in-game app. You wouldn't have to write a whole story about that in order for stuff like that to happen. Rockstar has more money, devs, time, and experience as well as access to technology than ever before. Expect some crazy and in-depth detail in this world.
for when my kid kid kids have kids
I don't know why I imagine this would be too much for a GTA game. Maybe because none of these have been done before in these games and I'm afraid of feeling limited in the open world. But if there's a mode where you could go on a rampage without any consequences, that would fix the problem. In Red Dead 2 I used to save the game, slaughter a town, and then reload the game back to my last save to avoid a massive drop in my Honour.

I don't know how a GTA game would flesh out such a system, but hopefully it's for the best. I believe in Rockstar, they never disappoint.
Add some of these guys to it
You've referenced a film that I would guess a lot of people haven't seen or heard of, what do you mean when you say you hope it's more like Nerve?
ehh idk GTA V had a lot of "one last job then i'm out" vibes, the morality of crime is usually something talked about
I 100%ed that game and the mechanics had immense potential but unfortunately, Ubisoft AI got in the way. For instance, you could call a gang on a random npc + cops as well but mid way the AI would get "confused" and just go about their day like nothing ever happened.
To be fair it's a bit different, those are just random scripted events in RDR2.
Cuh please log off 💀💀
![gif](giphy|jtlvNOS9XwSZMT8LZJ|downsized)
Well you are not wrong
Hahahahah
If gta6 does have social media, I hope there's a side quest about a dude getting canceled
🤣🤣🤣
And instead of dying the game gets wiped from your system. 😀🤣
Really Dead Raccoon 2
No. It’s not.

Edit in response to nickf090 who I’m assuming (unsurprisingly) blocked me since I’m unable to respond to him directly: Oh that’s weird, I guess CVS and Walmart etc., announcing they’d be closing stores in FL was all just made up. Also the fact that Florida Man is a phenomenon known to foreigners goes to show just how weird and insane the state is. On top of a governor whose main activities are battling black history and Disney 🤣 Sorry to burst your bubble but Florida is in no way a good representative of “normal” in any sense, but at least it’s entertaining?
😂🤣😂 no
[deleted]
Not sure what they mean but in the movie nerve they commit crimes and do dangerous activities based on what their social media fans want to see
He gotta delete the whole app 😂
getting downvoted for no reason. people really cant take jokes these days
They’re 100% gonna fit it in there somehow. This game is all about the social media/American culture that’s rapidly changed and developed over the past 10 years. And if criminals being cancelled isn’t a reflection of our culture then idk what is.

They could do that, but then they will lose fans and followers very fast. I say this as a person who doesn't like being forced to restart the whole game just because I failed a mission and I'm sure that there is others out there that feel the same way.
💀💀💀
Lol yes. Yes it is. Florida doesn’t have stores being emptied and tents in the streets. We have them in the woods behind corner stores 😂
Everything we did how we live
Oh right. Yeah that doesn't really make sense in terms of what he was replying to.
Brother gonna have to delete everything after this one 💀
Get downvoted buddy
My response was based on a mechanic that would incorporate pedestrians using their phones to record you doing things. This also happens in the movie Nerve, but rather than doing so to report your criminal activity, they record you to effectively give you clout as an influencer basically.
i dont give a fuck.  all these people can fuck themselves in the ass.lol
I see, thanks for explaining.
I can’t wait 🥹🥹
Image speaks for itself.
That shit looks like gta 3 in comparison lmao
This image really emphasises the game's age. Damn.
that's indeed a big jump
Never noticed how good those bottles look. Genuinely look real.
If i knew that it wasn’t gta id think that it was a real pic, shit is insane

Also side note but i love how clothing no longer looks painted on, Jasons T shirt looks real good
Every few years a game comes out and you can't believe the graphics, you exclaim that they can't get better than this and then they do, you look back and can't understand how you thought it looked real 😂

I think we are entering an age where that will no longer be the case, especially once they master people which DS2 seems to have done
And I bet you in shootouts they will spray liquid glass will break all that stuff.
There is so much that this game will have in it. I believe this may be a two disc game just like RDR2
The background makes me pretty confident that fishing will be part of the game again just like in rdr2
I hope its like RDR2 where he grabs the bottle. It felt so interactive to buy groceries
I hope it's like rdr2 where we can inspect each individual item
Remember we all thought GTA5 was real...and now look. I wonder if GTA6 will be the same in years to come
I wonder how detailed these types of stores will be. Will they improve on the mechanics from RDR2 where items are available to individually interact with / purchase? How will bottles react to being hit off shelves with fists or melee weapons? What will it look like to shoot up a shelf like this? In the leaks you could pick up bottles from the ground like in GTA IV, will you be able to snag bottles off the shelves? Commit acts of petty shoplifting?

All little details that ultimately won’t mean much to the overall game but I look forward to exploring how detailed and granular Rockstar makes the GTA VI world.
If you even compare the NPC on the gta 5's ps5 trailer vs the trailer for gta 6, it is still a impressive upgrade.
It’s really how amazing time spoils us. When this came out. I thought “How much better can graphics get than this?” I was 13 but still GTA V was revolutionary. Then RDR2 came out and I was blown away again at 19. 

Rockstar doesn’t miss. This game will definitely have us thinking that again. 

“How much better can graphics get than this?” 

I hope I don’t die before then.
[removed]
God help my 3060 when this comes out on PC
I can't wait to shoot at them bottles RDR2 style
I hope if you start drinking a lot you get warning saying your character will be drunk for the next 3 in game hours lol
You can’t wait to drink alcohol?
I’ve never really been into gta games (even tho I have all the main ones) but this one makes me curious
Not even comparable wow
Those bottles genuinely look real!
Temper yourself. Remember what games companies are like. Shareholders and money. I'm looking forward to it but I'll take it or leave it. Been stung too many times not to learn something. Fool me once....
Cant wait to find "LENNY!!!!!" everywhere in the game (rdr2 reference)
I think I just heard my graphics card start sobbing from the other room
Same baby
And we all thought GTA 5's fridges looked good since GTA 4's were just flat jpg's. I wonder if when GTA 7 is revealed if we'll think 6's fridges looked dated too.
yes you can actually u r waiting now lol
LMAO V looks like a roblox game in comparison
Tbh it looks like a real image
Also look at how to notes in his hands are bending and stuff. V cool
I hope hope hope you can just be a fucking crackhead and rob 4 packs of beer
Is this in game footage?
i thought this was a realism meme and bottom pic was some random real gas station 😭
you can buy liqour bottles in game
Wonder if they are all destructible 🤔 I’d like GTA6 to have more enterable buildings with destructible items inside. No more images for windows. Procedurally created and saved interiors like no man’s sky planet systems
there is already a sub?
Lmao
Image speaks by itshelf.
Yea, no way i can afford a pc to run this.
GTA VI should’ve been GTA VII
I'm gonna drink em all in one sitting
It won’t look like that when it comes out. You can remind me if you want.
wow, this image is one of the best i’ve seen that really shows the level of graphics difference these games have
Realistic asf
All I ever wanted in a GTA game was bottles to look round and not square.
Heaven and hell difference
Wonder what they will look like in game. Trailer got me curious.
I remember coming home with Vice City and a new PS2 and being blown away by that game. How far things have come.
This a new leak?????
Yeah but it's on PS5
Bro excited for GTA 6 for alchohol 😭
Can't believe it's GTA 5 and not Half-Life 2 or some'.
Perspective
They are looking too real
Alcoholic ahh post
Yea… so my PC will explode if I run this game.
So you can drink all day?
yes juste wait
There is so much variety and diversity in those displayed objects plus everything looks much more realistic and better than Gta 5 which it should.
The next real life mode in GTA 6 will be crazy with path tracing
I don’t know What’s everyone thinking Everyone is thinking that the game would be also like the trailer they released But why ??![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval)
iiiii
Do i see boxed wine
Jeeez the realism

![gif](giphy|vQqeT3AYg8S5O)
Just imagine how final release gonna look 🔥🔥
Don’t really care about graphics. Physics is what makes a game immersive. Graphics don’t mean squat if the physics are ahh.
R.I.P my Series S bro 😭😭
It’s just a cinematic video
Soo many choices🙌🥳🎉
DRINKING AND DRIVING SIMULATOR BABY WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It's all fun and games until the take two ceo shafts you all. I mean y'all complain literally about GTA V online yet Gooch Lick GTA VI Online as if you think Rockstar is gonna learn anything aka Sharl cards, GTA Plus, and whatever else Strauss Zelnik at Take Two has them cook up. The story looks ok though I'll give them that. But other than that y'all are hyping yourselves up kinda like when Bethesda announced starfield, or even similar to the COD stans that say "COD SUCKS" Yet they still buy the new game EVERY year. I'll keep GTA VI on my radar if they don't pull a GTA V behavior I'll think about getting it. But y'all better count your blessings WW3 is inching closer and closer. Check the News! 
Isn‘t the 5 image in-game and the 6 image from the trailer? Come on.
One of the many reminders that GTA V was an Xbox 360 game and we literally have two console generations of improvements for GTA VI
anyone moaning about details or graphics really don't have a clue about games especially when this shot is from a trailer 2 years before the actual release...rumors are the game is done, its just they like to polish their games big time. I always say watch a couple of GTA5 videos on the small details, the stuff people often miss but for a game that came out in 2013 is insane. Stuff like how the engine makes a ticking sound once you get out, how you only get wet to the level you actually get in and your trainers will make squeeky noises cuz their wet, police pulling injured officers out the way, the amount of stuff just on the TV for you to watch. Expect all that but way more with 6 and way more details on everything
Shame about the kernel anti cheat
Bro GTA 5 fucking sucked! Hope they can actually nail the hand-to-hand combat this time.
the character in this scene still looks cartoonish, hope they can fix that in the actual game
Just remember it is a cut scene though
Bro used a cinematic scene
In game vs cutscene
Cutscene vs gameplay. Sorry
That is just the AI made trailer.  The actual game has the same graphics as Fallout 3 from 2008. I don't need a sorce as I am smart.
it should… gta v released on the ps3
Ofcourse it would.

The gap between GTA 3 and GTA 5 was 12 years.

And the gap between GTA 5 and GTA 6 is also 12 years..
Or San Andreas
The view into a shop from the outside in GTA 3 was a 128x128 JPG of a shop interior
I thought it was comparing gta San Andreas to gta 6 at first glance. Damn.
2013. People forget that shit was a literal decade ago
I don't think it shows the game's age really so much as it shows how advanced GTA 6 plans to be. Those kinds of textures are still pretty standard when you compare them to other, newer open world games. Be it the newer Watchdogs, Just Cause, Ghost Recon, Assassin's Creed, Spider-man (to a lesser extent then the rest) and Ghost of Tsushima, none of them compete in terms of attention to detail on the smaller stuff.  It really makes me hyped how much better this looks compared to any of the other games I've seen advertised.

Having said that, I do think there are games which put GTA 5's graphics to shame at a grander scale (including Spider-Man more broadly), Red Dead 2, CyberPunk, etc.
And people are still saying GTA VI will just be V with a new map. They must not have played RDR2.
A big jump over a 12-year time period. So is it really a big jump?
Can’t wait to shoot them.
just for shits and giggles when the trailer dropped I was showing some of my fam the GTA6 pic and they were asking what liquor store that was. Did not believe me when i said it was a video game lol
We probably be able to throw shit again like GTA IV
Honestly I’m having a hard believing that is GTA. The details are so accurate I feel like I’ve been in a liquor store just like this.
camera doesn't cast shadow even though it's right by a source of light, dead giveaway but beside that it looks really realistic
Yep, they reached a point where human eye can hardly notice any difference even if you double the polygons on a model. From now on the difference will be in the number of details, objects, animation quality etc.
Whats DS2?
And the wood will get damaged by the liquid on the floor with time of course
That caught my eye too, more so than the bottle details. Those nets look useful anyway. 
There's probably gonna be some fish database thing where if you catch every type of fish you get an achievement or a t-shirt.
Just think what we'll feel in 2059 when GTA VII is a year away.
People once thought n64 graphics were realistic, now look lol! It’s a never ending cycle. It’s cool to watch and then look back and reminisce
When I watched the trailer and saw how real they looked I just kept imagining shootouts in shops with bottles exploding all around
I hope my 3060 can handle it because graphics cards are too damn expensive
with DLSS it should run alright, hope the game is going to be well optimized though
Hopefully it will be released on GeForce now so I can play it on their RTX 6000 Ultimate
Can wait to see how real it look when we start drinking it.
Accidentally opened that one door
yes, every rockstar trailer is made with in game scenes
More food and drinks options than just alcohol.
of course theyre destructible
After red dead trailers, things looked like they should look.
!remindme 1 year
What you said might be true… but the excitement I am waiting for is different… man I was 13 when GTA 5 came out… couldn’t really buy the game at that time…
I will be 25 next year…
Somethings are done to make your inner child happy… to get that nostalgic feeling…
Trailer is in engine like every Rockstar trailer, come on
Free speech was a mistake
and it still sold like 200m copies cry me a river
This aint Ubisoft bruh 😂
Yeah for consoles from *2005*
But 2 consoles instead of only one.
GTA V is now as old as vice city was when GTA V came out
11 years now
And it was originally released on XBox 360 and PS3 - from 2005.
Yea, and in top of a 2013 release, it released in 2005 hardware.
Cyberpunk on pc just may be the most graphically impressive game I've ever seen
Or GTA I, II, III, IV, Vice City, San Andreas...
Yes, thats quite impressive actually, a single jump that lasted 12 years straight and most people don't last a few seconds
Yes..??? It’s 12 years.
yes it is
Or drink em
🤣 don’t blame them for not knowing
Rockstar really does their research when they making their worlds
Death Stranding 2, check out their photomode! Seen a few clips online
Wait another decade for this
Dude, as a 7 year old I thought Mortal Kombat on the SNES looked like real life

If your talking gameplay trailer maybe.. but we don’t have any gameplay trailer just cinematic. Y’all are drooling over An ad for a game really.
Thanks please comment here so we can see, I am actually curious if a game is actually going to keep the trailer graphics in actual game.
Same man I was 13 when the game came out I hope to God I get the same feeling I did from GTA V but I gotta hold out until I see some reviews and see if they changed their way such as banning cheaters and such. Man I remember my first timebbooting up GTA V online and being killed by backwards zentornos and the rhino 🤣.
It didn’t suck but it’s definitely very overrated. However I think my judgement is because I fully played GTA V after RDR2, so GTA V was probably revolutionary for its time maybe.
No it sucked like SA and VC
Is it not though? The first shot is in game and the second shot is from the trailer which is just cutscenes no gameplay
This is what I tell people whenever I mention how much GTA V was pushing the absolute limits of that console generations capabilities.
Designed in 2002!
This makes me feel worse about not getting a PS3 until 2019
But the performance gap between PS3 and PS4, and between PS4 and PS5 is not as big as the huge gap between PS2 and PS3.

Me rn: 👦 -> 👴
Of what I've seen of it I agree. Never bought it due to all the issues in the beginning but probably will some time next year.
Speak for your self I last a few minutes.
Impressive!
Yeah it is but my point was… MANN ROCKSTAR SHOULD HURRY THE FK UP BRO! 😔
same here, the full phot legit looks like something you’d see on google images lol
100% 

Graphics gonna be crazy
All red dead trailers where "in-game". So it's all rhe same.
I definitely will :)
so u understand it’s good for its time still claiming it suck in 2024. Am I missing something?
Rockstar always uses in game cutscenes bruh. They are not pre rendered
Damn
Jason bourne that's Jesus christ
I wish I had a good enough pc to play it with some of mods I've seen, looks almost indistinguishable from real life at times
Bro got downvoted for impressive 😭
![gif](giphy|YT95XJOLvY1t2SJgpR)
You want a good game or not? Be patient, game development is super fucking hard dude
Me again xD, after a long time!  
How are you?  
why are you replying to your own comments
No it’s obviously not because we have zero in game trailers for GTA lol.
Can you point out anywhere where I said it sucked? Did you read the wrong comment 😂
Oh I didn’t know that
officer
Steam Deck and my love of flight simming have converted me from a lifelong console gamer to a pc gamer. I built my first pc last year and I’m saving up to upgrade my gpu when the Nvidia Blackwell line comes out. I still haven’t figured out which version of VI I’m going to to get though. If the pc port is released at launch then I’ll probably get that right away. But I still have my PS5 if that’s the only option.
he is the chosen one.
Yeah bro let them have fun
Yeah ik ik. Btw was said in a light way, and now I see the “hardcoreism” of GTA fans by looking at the downvotes lol 😅
Im good, idk should have just edited it into my first comment 🤣
GTA VI trailer is in-game, just not gameplay. It's not pre-render, and if you know what you're talking about, just watching it should be enough to notice.
I can tell you right now there is zero chance gta 6 is on pc for at minimum 6 months to a year after launch, it's just how Rockstar does things
Ooooh yea yea, it's really hard to tell what is sarcasm and what isn't when people are legit constantly complaining about how long it takes for a game to be made. The poor workers are already crunched beyond belief, overworked and depressed. Let's not make their life harder. Rockstar infamously is not treating it's workers very well
Ok buddy sorry I offended you lmao.
I know, up until recently I was prepared for at least a 1 year wait for the pc port. But I read recently in an article that was clearing up the false delay rumors from a few weeks ago that the pc version “might” be ready at launch. I know it’s probably not true, but I’m still holding out a little hope. Nothing wrong with a little hopium on social occasions just to take the edge off.
Yeah I’ve also heard about that
I see you’re exploring the galaxy CLIPPY is here to help!
Ship built inspired by Microsoft Clippy
Mods: Matilija Aerospace, Better Flip+Snaps, Vikingtech, 1-of-a-Kind Ship. 

Interior: "eyes-habs" are usable; 
Cockpit under the left "eye".
If you understand this reference. You should schedule a prostate exam.
That's actually epic. I love that, lol.
It looks like you're trying to confront Ron Hope.

Would you like help?

( ) Shoot Ron Hope  
( ) \~\~Arrest Ron Hope\~\~ Shoot Ron Hope
This is incredible and fucking hilarious. I can only imagine you giggling to yourself while flying this around, OP
This is what starfield was made for
"It looks like you're attempting to transcend our universe. Would you like some help?"
That's ridiculously silly. Kudos.
This belongs in the Louvre
OP, we need a freaking tour of this ship.
Omg this is amazing. Also, once when we played the guess-who-you-are-game I was clippy and after getting “no” answers to literally all questions since I’m not real, I’m not a cartoon etc I was just stumped and was like “Am I fucking clippy!?” as if he exists as a unique entity outside all definitions lol
The fact that it can land is insane.  Ridiculous and I love it.
I love how well it fits on the pad at New Atlantis 😘🤌
That’s very funny.
I honestly thought this was the KSP subreddit for a second!
Every shut down NMS... This guy wins.🤣
You're a mad man and I will follow you to the ends of the galaxies.
I'll never look at a paper clip the same way again.
I’d like to see the inside
I wanna see the inside so bad lol
Brilliance
Simply diabolic.
It’s an abomination… and I love it.
STOP I love it!!! 📎
Do Bonzi Buddy next.
That’s really funny.
Holy shit
Interior must be pretty hectic.
Want to know a weird and useless fact? It’s not actually named Clippy. It’s actually named Clippit. We all forget and agreed it’s Clippy now.
[Clippy must die](https://youtu.be/NxcmoLKVd60?si=9wP25gmcRPw5wOx8)
Cocaine is a hell of a drug
Clippy’s big brother Shippy
I’m a gonna have nightmares now
Stahp lmao !
Love it!
Move aside Mantis, hello new super hero the Clipper.
Tell me you're old without telling me you're old. 🤣😂
This is magical
the EYEBROWS
Why did you do this to us?
Hey! It looks like you're trying to find the Va'ruun homeworld!
Loathesome, wretched creature. Disgusting metal worm. Why would you do this. Why would you bring it back, when so many fell to kill it in the first place
Hahaha! 😂 📎 the annoying Clippy
“I see you’re trying to start an intergalactic empire. Would you like some help with that?”
I thought this was Space Engineers, then I checked the subreddit.
Hey! It looks like you’re about to raid a ship! Would you like some help?
How long does it take for you to walk through clippy to the cockpit.

Love this build. Everything about it.
So I don’t know anything about this game. Do you have to walk that whole loopy hallway to get to the second round vestibule or do all the ship interiors look the same after assembly?
It’s official. Ship building has peaked.
Hey, StarClippy, can you come resolder my leaking water heater pipe?
Lmao!! This is terrible and amazing at the same time! 

I'm sad though because I got the reference...
I love Clippy!!! I wish they didn't destroy him.
GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD NO I DONT NEED HELP NO I DONE NEED HELP STOP STALKING ME STOP STALKING ME
I laughed way too hard at thid. Here, have my upvote.
What are the ship stats???
EPIC!!!
That’s great!
Clippy is now GPT!
What have you done
I'm stuck for words...
This is so cursed,I love it
perfection
Thanks, I hate it. lol
Wild!
HAHA Perhaps the best ship in Starfield history
Lmao nice
This is incredible lmaooo
I always changed it from clippy to the other options but always wound up going back to clippy because he had more animations lol…ah man I feel old now 😭 writing papers with clippy, playing final fantasy 7 on 4 separate disks, making it to the final disk only to get a corrupted game file…ah those were the days 

Badass ship btw. Can we see the inside??
I love how it fits like a glove on that NA landing pad
I have never wanted to destroy anything more in my life.
What a sick thing 😜
On one hand, I hope your ship gets blown up by flying into an asteroid after successfully fighting 6 pirates. 

On the other, I really got a good chuckle out of this. 
Okay, this is epic.
Should have done it along with my colonnoscopy :).
I hate it. I love it. I… this is so wonderfully creative.
Port it into a mod...please? 🤣
Hilarious!
Thanks, I hate it.

Wow. This is just….wow. Bravo!
nowadays i don't know if i'm on the avorion or starfield sub.
Pog.
Vikingtech?  I'm not familiar. I didn't see this on Nexus. is it on creations?
“You have to do what? Sorry but I don’t swing that way doc”
Had one a few years back and am healthily laughing my ass off at OP's ship design.
Joke’s on you, I don’t have a prostate.
I didn’t study
Clippy was introduced in 1997 way too young for a prostate exam a 5 year old could retain a memory making them about 32 and prostate exams are recommended for 45 and up.
Fuck um about to be 37
I'm not sure they'll find one, but ok.
Hey, now! I'm not due for at least 10 years!
Noo! I'm only 29! I'm too young for it.
Back in my day they said "Ignorance is Bliss"
From Giant Bomb?
I do and I’m 23 💀😭
I’m only 32! 😫😫😫
Lol when the news of Maggie Smith's passing  yesterday, they referenced her as Harry Potter and Downton Abbey actress. Pshh, I remember her from the Prime of Miss Jean Brodie lol
And a colonoscopy too
I just turned 28, fuck
But I’m 23
I’m dying right now 🤣😂 I just turned 41… 🫤
Did that 2 years ago, good till next decade
No need, my plunger works just fine thank you
I'm 32 man, too young for that
Just got one Friday, it seems I still have some time I will use wisely /gaming / .
But I don't have one.
:-(
But I’m 26 😂
No, I’m only 35.
Easy homie, not all of us are at that point yet.
You could've at least picked up the tab at dinner, doc.
Doc: good god man, you've got a dozen long stemmed roses up your ass.
Guy: read the card.
Ok thanks for the advice
Don't tell me he'll do Snoo next lol
That’s how we get viruses
Meaning that you have to be old enough to warrant a regular prostate exam from your Dr.
I did 😏
33 and I remember this
Only 28, right there with you lmfao
Do not worry, purple monkey is friend!
Ik lol. you’d be surprised how many 30-40 something’s will forego the check up out of insecurity/masculinity hang ups. Why I made the joke
Dunno,  I asked my doc and they said " not yet" 
As if cancer has a age requirement.
I understand now. I also understand that colon cancer is not the way I want to leave this world.
Yeah well my rear end is a one way out only! I'd rather die from cancer than have some sadistic doctor sticking his hands in there! 🥸

Also, blood sample does the trick now.
According to actual mesical science sticking a finger up someknes ass is no longer needed. Here is Chat GPT telling you why you no longer need you ass probed. And in my opinion if you are getting it probed its because you like it.






Prostate exams, specifically digital rectal exams (DRE), are becoming less commonly recommended as part of routine prostate cancer screening due to concerns about their accuracy and the availability of better screening methods. The primary reasons are:


1. PSA Testing: The Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) blood test is now preferred because it can detect prostate issues more reliably than a physical exam. High PSA levels can indicate prostate cancer or other prostate conditions, although it’s not foolproof.




2. Inaccuracy of DRE: Digital rectal exams have been found to have a lower sensitivity in detecting prostate cancer compared to PSA testing. This means that a DRE can miss cancers that are in early stages, leading to false negatives.




3. Potential for Overdiagnosis: Routine DREs, combined with PSA tests, can sometimes lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of slow-growing prostate cancers that may not have caused harm during a man's lifetime.






Current guidelines, such as those from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), emphasize shared decision-making around PSA testing and place less emphasis on DRE unless a patient has specific symptoms or risk factors.
My last physical for work they said I should have it checked. That was at 27 🤷‍♂️ I’ve heard big indicators are trouble keeping a good stream well urinating (stop start flows) or having pain & issues squatting, lifting, & exerting yourself.
I got told it happens at 50 now.
Yeah that’s a big no thank you from me too
Still good to check for your bladder & to make sure you’re doing alright back there. Constipation, prolapse, hemroids. Or if you’re having stomach pains, aches, bloody or weird smelly stool, etc etc etc. then it’s best to get a scope done. There’s no way around those.

Eventually everyone needs these done in most cases, male or female. Scopes are a hilarious inconvenience and annoyance though. Can’t trust a fart for 3-5 days afterwards. Mostly all because of eating a box of dulcolax & a bottle or 2 of magnesium citrate.

I like to fast for a day or 2 then do only liquids and a bottle of citrate and 2/3 pills every few months. Makes you feel phenomenal afterwards.
You no longer need to. A blood draw and a read of PSAs is all you now need unless those PSAs are showing signs of problems.
I had to have one when I was 29. But that was for the physical for my CDL. No poke, no drive! LOL
💩🙃 been there!.. aint going to happen ever again!
No your incorrect
Like I said: My bum is a one way out only!
You gotta make eye contact. Make the whole experience more personal.
Candles help, too.
or when the doc puts both his hands on your back during the process..
Bill Maher be creepin
my bad meant to do this 
This dude is stuck in the 80s.
I love the episode with Richard Dreyfuss where he just fucking [melts in his chair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOkX0A5TcZU) and it's never mentioned.
Pick anything from Club Random and it's peak cringe. Tim Heidecker's parody is gold and spot on.



https://youtube.com/watch?v=1Ha6D1LQGD4
Look how uncomfortable she is, it’s like so clear she feels weird with him keep touching her and she’s doing a fake/nervous laugh

Also the fact that the chairs are far apart makes it even weirder bc he really has to stretch out to touch her so it’s even more intentional
Dude was a fixture at the Playboy mansion, being a old creeper is not surprising
never thought i would hear maher say “i feel u on that one, girlie”
True cringe, bravo
Thanks I hate it
Bella Thorne
I am Jack’s lack of surprise.
I think he’s mostly just drunk
Jesus Christ Bill is creepy and unhinged. What a psycho
That looks like molly.
redbar radio had a great breakdown of this.  it was hilarious.
Fuck Bill Maher. Did you guys see his edgy tirade about how anyone who is anti-Israel is an idiot?
He was that asshole little weirdo boy in everyone’s class. He still is, but was too.
God forbid someone touches a friend’s hand to look at a ring.  Come on internet…get over it
He shouldn't be hitting on a married woman, but she's obviously into it. Everytime he pulled away she could have sat back in her seat or took her arm off the armrest but she didnt.
The last minute of that video made me laugh so hard, what is happening to this man? He looks less than half alive
OMG they even had a pillow to prop him up & he was still 🫠
LMAO
Have to post this one as well.

Watch the Club Random with Fred Durst. I must warn you, however, that this is appropriate only for those with a high tolerance for extreme cringe.
This is great lmao. It's less out of control than Two Ferns or Eric Andre, just enough that the guest doesn't immediately realize what's going on.
Do boomers who act like this not notice when people get uncomfortable with it? Or do they just not care?
[deleted]
if she was black he'd of probably stuck his fist out all like "gimme some skin sistah"
thank you! all's I knew was she was an OF model
I really don't know this guy at all, but does he typically try to hold hands with his male guests also?
give it a year
Fuck yeah

And he looks like he walks around with turds in his pockets.
All of her body language and tone show she is clearly uncomfortable towards the end of that clip. Anyone with any kind of social awareness could recognize that.
You’re the type of weirdo who can’t tell when women are uncomfortable around you, huh?
>He shouldn't be hitting on a married woman, but she's obviously into it. Everytime he pulled away she could have sat back in her seat or took her arm off the armrest but she didnt.


/u/IdealizedReality *good* *grief* She is clearly uncomfortable. Would it be cool if she were single? Hitting on her while she interviews him? Bravo for keeping the cringe vibe going even after the video clip ends.
I bet his back hurts him, and at that age you don't give a fuck, you go where the comfort is, and in this case it was dowwwwn.
Holy fuck.  This is it. There is no beating this. The whole fucking shit with Theo Huxtable. The Roganisms. The countless minutes saying so much bullshit without actually saying anything. The predictions of Dwayne Johnson becoming President/King, lmao, too fucking real.
The first video linked had some great moments, but this one right here is fucking gold from start to finish 🤣
Are there any more of these podcast parodies? I tried looking through his videos but the majority seems to be normal podcast stuff. 
i keep hearing his Rogan parody is next level
That was amazing.
I saw his Tucker Carlson vid when it came out. Scariest thing is that the audio is material straight from the subject source.
Fred knows what’s going on, they’re friends. 

It is a hilarious bit though.
More a comment about the type of older famous guys that were staples of going to the Playboy Mansion parties, James Caan, Pauly Shore, David Spade and Bill, etc.
And he walks around with buttplugs up his ass. Yes, multiple plugs at a time lol
Then why does she never attempt to move away or retract her hand from the armrest? She looks into it the entire time.
I just watched it again and I'm tearing up with laughter again, look at that hip thrust and eyebrow wiggle in the last 8 seconds.
It'll be a classic I return to in 10, 20, 30, 40 years time.
Not quite podcast but on cinema at the cinema is a film review parody series he's been doing for about 15 years now and its one of the funniest things ever made. A complete work of genius but you kind of need to start at the beginning to understand all the plot lines.
He also made An Evening with Tim Heidecker, which is a parody of washed standup-comedians. Free on youtube
That's what I like about it. The spliced together audio, Meat Canyon sort of horror but with Skibidi Toilet visuals. Underrated channel.
Yeah, Fred is a very good straight man in this clip.
I knew it
Because people fear conflict, especially publicly making a scene. It's a mix of conflicting emotions and social confusion. "is this bad enough that I make a scene about it or am I blowing it out of proportion?"

Live a for a while and understand the nuance of human behavior.
The ending when he's spread eagle is so fucking funny. It's like he's trying to make Bill say something. It's like an Impractical Jokers bit.
I've watched it something like 5 times and it gets better every time. And the original upload was almost seamlessly [looped for 12 hours](https://www.youtube.com/live/P6Iyg9fznvM?si=pdSriIGojfyYgH6H), which is just the gag cherry on top.
The hours long courtroom arc is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. 
Leaning back in your chair or removing your hand from the armrest is making a scene? Give me a break. There are multiple instances of him not touching her at all where she could have regressed back into her chair but she didn't want to. It sounds like to me you guys are mad when women are attracted to anyone but you and your supreme gentlmanliness.
Okay, I always thought they actually kept the bit going for 12hrs which would be some next level commitment and comedic brilliance.
I feel very bad for any women in your life.
Michael Richards' apology on Letterman fails!
Michael Richards' apology on Letterman fails! The audience seems to think it's a joke or whatever. 
"don't laugh it's not funny"


Funniest shit Seinfeld has said since
I remember watching this when it aired. It was very confusing and uncomfortable. Him saying afro American certainly didn't help.
i've never seen michael richards out of character, and i include this appearane.
Patrice Oneal said it best.

I didn't think he was racist untill I watched his apology.

https://youtu.be/F11o46EVOHc?si=riHz6rcbbXrDHa6C
"You gotta help me Jerry. I'm dying here"
He said some pretty nasty things to some afro-americans
You think that's bad? You should watch what he's apologizing for 😬
I liked the show Seinfeld, I detest Jerry. He's such a 2 faced worm. Too funny when he said "Stop laughing...it's not funny." 
I feel like I'm Larry David, watching and orchestrating this,  small under sized circumcised woody vibe.
The absolute least they could have done here is write something. Surely these guys have access to plenty of PR agents and this fumbling mess is the best they can come up with?
As awkward as it is, it seems very genuine and heartfelt. I honestly don't know what better of an apology you could give
I thought it seemed sincere.  Why was it a fail?
I was in high school when this happened. I was a HUGE Seinfeld fan at the time. I had so many Seinfeld t-shirts. I wish I kept some of them because they must be out of print and people would eat that shit up now. Anyways, I wore them to school quite regularly. This was before the internet is what it is today so everyone didn't know everything immediately. I decided to wear a Kramer t-shirt to school one day. I had no idea about the incident but it just happened to be literally the day after the video dropped of him at The Laugh Factory. My high school was about 95% white but I still got some looks that day.
For those of you who don't recall, this is right around when the Seinfeld full-run DVD box set was released. Most sitcom money is in syndication, but at the time, there was a ton of money in DVD sales, and this was going to be the thing that took Jerry from "very rich" to basically the Jeff Bezos of comedy. It's important context, because otherwise you wouldn't know why Jerry was there and why he was so pressed to have this apology go over well. Like, if Andy Richter got #metoo'd, you wouldn't expect Conan to drag him onto Jimmy Kimmel and basically chaperone his apology.
This was before social media, so the Letterman audience (1) had no clue what Richards was apologizing for, and (2) didn't know that it wasn't supposed to be a joke.

One of most unintentionally funny things I’ve ever seen.  Watching it live was surreal.
Jerry watching his royalties evaporate.
It was also simply the wrong platform to be doing this. You really can't blame a Letterman audience for wondering if it's supposed to be comedic and laughing at an incredibly awkward apology over this in the context of late-night show hosted by a comedian with two sitcom actor guests.
In the UK and commonwealth countries we say Afro Caribbean to refer to any Black Caribbean people with ancestry to Africa so it was maybe possible at some point he’s heard this term get used and tried to modify it but it’s still very unusual hearing it from an American.
Just a little trash talk
Him leaving that huge tip at that restaurant sure was out of character
Again. And again. And again
Seinfeld is great because George is fucking hilarious and by far the best character on the show
I think after seeing how Jerry’s career and Larry David’s career progressed after Seinfeld ended tells you who the funny one in that duo was.
Same. Dude is an egomaniac.
How could they posshibly do thish?
Sorry dude, no one cares. 🤷‍♀️
Well they could’ve written something and planned it out better and not done it on letterman. That would’ve been a good start.
There are some things you just can’t come back from, even with a nice apology
Well, to start, the apology was made on David Letterman, a talkshow that's based on comedy. It's a little awkward in sense, as the listening audience was basically "waiting for the punchline" in the interview. Secondly, I don't think calling the black patrons Afro-Americans did him any favors; although proper terminology, it's a little too PR and far removed from sincerity. 


The whole thing was bad news, and, him being a seasoned comedian and easily one of the faces of comedy during that time, he should have initially handled it better. All comedians will encounter heckling at some point, it's bullshit, and anyone worth their salt should handle it in stride. However, the event like this blew the closet doors wide open, and, although he was speaking off the cuff in his video, which is more heartfelt than reading from a script or paper, it should have been cooked a bit more. 


He tried what he thought was best and fell short, and, unfortunately, it wounded his career. Luckily, he's still finding work in a world where people get dragged worse/longer for less.
I could see something like this happening to George in the show lol
That’s just not true. Richard’s even says it’s been a few days. Do you think news still traveled by wagon back then?
They played the Laugh Factory clip like 30 times on the Today show the morning after it happened.  Morning drive radio was all over it for days.  The entire United States knew about it
The reason was all over in the news, even here in Denmark. I doubt the audience didn't know.
His royalties should've evaporated when he was picking up his 17 year old girlfriend from her high school when he was 34
For a split second he wasn’t making 100 million per year?
Before the era of the notes app apology.
Also, the show taped in the afternoon while it aired later at night, so most of the studio audience was blissfully unaware of the incident that caused Michael Richards' viral moment at the time.
I'm glad the nomenclature shifted back to black.
$10,000 dollars too, very generous
My man. George IS the funniest on the show. George>Kramer.
That’s because George is basically Larry David’s character in curb.
Wasn't it because Jerry just wasn't that interested in pursuing acting after the show ended?
let's not forget that he's also a borderline pedo
Very random obscure Fred Herbert reference.
Someone cared enough to tell us they don’t care. Clearly you care.
I’m doing my apology on Tosh.0
I think Letterman was the biggest platform he could get on at the time. I don’t think anybody else was interested in airing his apology, and Jerry had a previously scheduled Letterman appearance that night. Jerry called in a favor to get him on.
Is that really better, something scripted and put together by a PR company, or this man going out and truly apologizing? Don't know what the answer is TBH.
He had done other appearances. One with Sharpton think.
Sure, some subset of the populace were getting their news online, but definitely not from Facebook or YouTube. You can tell that only Letterman seems to know what he's actually talking about here.
He’s a billionaire
This is incorrect. This appearance was three days after the Laugh Factory incident and it was all over the news and had gone viral by then.
So **that's** what Amy Winehouse was singing about
You're supposed to capitalize Black now
Was there even a competition?
[This clip](https://youtu.be/-TlDvH1EjgE?si=6t9jFVzuzg2dO4KH) of Jason Alexander teaching Larry the finer points of his own character is amazing.
Look at what he’s written, Bee Movie, Unfrosted, and not much else.  He’s done very little and what he has worked on has been a dud.  I think Bee Movie sunk his career to some degree.
Borderline? I’d say a 30 year old man picking up his girlfriend from high school has crossed that line.
Not sure why Michael Jackson don’t get backlash for raping several much younger kids. 
At least Jerry’s GF was of legal age and dated him willingly
Don’t you mean your redemption?
And it was a bad decision lol
You’re the one talking about handing it to a company, not me. The point is there clearly wasn’t much thought put into it. The dude basically just ranted so it obviously would’ve been better to write something down beforehand.
This was all over cable and print news as well so everyone in that audience knew what was going on.
ACDC?
His old man.
This season was fucking brilliant. One of the most creative and funny seasons of television ever made
Wtf are you talking about. Michael Jackson went from being the King of Pop to the King of Alleged Pedophiles. He went into literal hiding how is that not backlash lol
Because that is what celebrities generally do when handling a PR crisis, they hire it out to a PR company. That being said, even if he wrote it himself, do you think the public would appreciate him reading from a script, as opposed to something more from the heart?
That was obviously about Agent K's return to the agency in Men in Black 2
Now THAT is the best character in the show.  Frank Costanza
To this day, it's 50/50 on whether or not somebody will defend Michael Jackson. Never underestimate the inability for people to be incapable of separating the art from the artist.
I think anything is better than a random rant. Also stop being so pedantic and arguing against points I never made. It’s tedious and annoying.
I'm not debating that. The fact is that from basically 2005 onward he was a complete social pariah. Sure he had devoted fans but his name was mud as far as reputation goes.
That's not true though. Jackson was rehearsing for his 'This Is It' tour when he died and that tour was completely sold out. The tabloids always scandalised Jackson, but when it came to the common person; they still liked him.

Even after he died and 'Leaving Neverland' came out, you still had half of the people defending him. I speak from experience when interacting with people in real-life; loads of them defend him to this very day. It's crazy and it's not just the hardcore fans; it's 50% of people who casually enjoy his music.
You are repeating the same point as before though. The people who loved MJ were devoted and were going to support him regardless. The general public who were not attached had nothing but disdain for him.

There was documentary after documentary, newspaper after newspaper designed to villainize him even more. I'm not a huge MJ fan and wouldn't support anyone regardless of how important their music was if I considered them to be hurting others so I'm not defending him.

The fact of the matter is that even as a child I heard more about "Wacko Jacko" then I ever did about his importance as a musical icon. The common person saw him as the epitome of the ills of "Hollyweird" and the music business.

I'm not denying that people are devoted to him. They are, irrationally. But it's wrong to say that he didn't suffer from the downfall of his reputation because he absolutely did, it contributed to his death.

Back to the root of your first comment, MJ 110% suffered more both career wise and personally from the exposure of his personal life than Seinfeld ever has. That is inarguable fact.
Move on, kiddo
Guy dresses like the fedora king at Salt Baes restaurant.
I don't know what it is but this was painful for me to watch.
both are cringe tbh
Cringe vs cringer
I hate both of these people so much
The whole scene is cringe.
[deleted]
I will never be this bored.
Damn everything was cringe holy fuck
There is something I don't understand about the whole Salt Bae business.

My understanding is that he has a few restaurants (or is associated or whatever). Even though it's pure cringe and I certainly wouldn't visit his restaurant, I kinda understand that you would go there if you have the opportunity to be served by him and film his shenanigans for your instagram if that's your thing.

But WHY would you go there if you aren't served by him. It's like there is a 0,001% chance that he will be in the restaurant/country/city you are and serve you, and then you end up paying a probably stupid price with nothing in return.

So.

What's the deal with customers who aren't served by him when they go to this restaurant. What's the point.
That looks like the dude from Poltergeist 2
So. Much. Salt.
What's a fedora king?
The autism is palpable
[deleted]
Fedora keeps flinging because he’s in pain from the medallion burn on his palm. 
How much extra is it to not have forearm salt?
I hope they both get typhoid.
Overpaying for food is bad...but paying a dude to come out and cut your meat for you is like, on another level
Take it back
And that dumbass waiter is still the cringe king
I would need to be paid a significant amount of money to eat at one of his establishments.
I would rather eat at the Indian foot towel guy than salt bae or super wow restaurant
The smacking of the blade on the cutting board  is so fucking stupid. It’s just him trying to make it seem like what he’s doing is more complicated than it actually is. What we just watched takes maybe 10 minutes of training experience.
The walking personification of pretentious douchery.
Chef here…this cat is a mascot and I hate what he’s done to the art of “fine dining”. I’ve(been robbed) eaten at his restaurant  before.This is all theater because the food is nothing spectacular for certain,but him “meat slapping and flip folding” my meal isn’t necessary. My dinner,as bland as it was,did not deserve the price tag it came with and I didn’t have the “privilege” of having him knife molest my meal but as someone who has been in the business professionally for for over 30 years…..I think I can successfully label this guy as a clown.
I can’t believe social media made this fucking goofball famous. I don’t agree with what he did but maybe Ted Kaczynski was right, this world is fucked…
Looks like a Stephen King villain sitting down for an over-priced meal.
Hey , we need to stop . If we don’t pay attention to this ass hat.
Chop-enheimer
Fedora dude didn’t even do the salt pour right. Cringe all around
Way to go filming the customer touching the salt with bare hands. Always good to video and post your restaurant violating health codes. That is all the cringe I see here. 
I’d never actually seen saltbae in action before. The SNL skits of him were not an exaggeration…wtf is wrong with people to overpay for food from this mentally ill guy?
Both are meta. Salt bae legend
The cringe is also the price of a rack of lamb from Salt Bae’s restaurant at $250. $800 for the golden rack of lamb which is just gold foil added.
How much are dummies paying for this "experience"?
Needed more “Super rare.”
Pharrell called, he wants his goofy ass hat back.
Notice how he’s eating by himself
Why did they end the video before they start making out?
Douche vs. Douche
How much do you have to pay to have this plonker chuck these massive grains of salt all over your table? A lot I'd have thought.
So

goddamn

stupid
I can't decide if he looks more like [he's going to make Krusty "ride de Lil' bike through de loop"](https://youtu.be/TZH2_X7OquQ) or if [he's going to give Fat Tony the kiss of death.](https://youtu.be/XCsM511pg6I)
Every thing in this picture makes me angry...
I made it to 17 seconds… Jeez… I just….
Is that the real Oppenheimer at the table?
Lmao for some reason I found the interaction funny. Fedora king played the roll well.
How did this stupid shit ever become even remotely popular?
Why is the guy with the sunglasses standing like he’s about to poop on the floor?
Noisy, crowded, way too bright, trashy radio beat in the background, tiny table and a clown with a shtick, all while being overpriced... Sooo basically McDonald´s for stupid rich people?
I don't really think the guy in the hat did anything wrong. Salt Bae is cringe but when you go to his restaurant, that's what you expect to happen.
People pay this clown all this cash to do that?  I'd rather a porn model stuff it up her butt and evacuate back out onto my plate frankly.
Salt boy lookin like the Oracle's bodyguard in Matrix 2
I wonder what the markup is for that unnecessary salt pageantry.
I mean the fedora guy might be dressed out of era and he's giving off an odd energy to me but I don't really see him as doing anything wrong here. Hat indoors maybe? But do I give a fuck that he's wearing a Fedora? At least it's with a suit lol
Cringer was a great pet and companion. 
Cringe and Cringer 2 : Trouble in Cringeland
United in our hatred
I don't really get the hate for fedora guy other than some odd mannerisms, if you hat the hat or that he's wearing it indoors ok but is it that bad lol?
Mega cringe
Stupid people do. And god bless Salt Bae, he sucks, but he has made a good living taking money from stupid people.
He also does that thing where he pours a beer down his back and over his asshole into the patron’s mouth
This is where COVID started
I had a hard time sleeping after I watched this
Agreed - and not just that but then you have to be in the background of all the d-bags that are filming.

And then if Salt Bae comes around to your table, you have to indulge him and his ego "like oh hey, uhhh yea sure .... we'd love it if you cut our steak and salted it .... that doesn't cost extra does it?"
Look at Nobu. They’re everywhere super expensive and always packed. Nobu is rarely ever going to be there. I grew up going to his original restaurant, not named Nobu. Where he was actually there everyday, before he was mega famous. Nobu is a nice guy and he is also a very respectable person.
I'm pretty sure they just hire look a likes for the social media publicity like this.
i was wonderin if people had to like brush it off their food?
The king of fedoras.
That was the only thing that came to mind when I saw that guy.
Yes please stop using this as a slur.
Don’t disrespect autism by lumping this idiot into their ranks!
Hahaha holy fuck
The story is ludicrous. You can imagine where it goes from here.
Hey either way I came 
Your appearance is exactly as I have imagined.
Yeah exactly. The baklava cutting is even more absurd and cringe.
I stand with you man. So you actually tried his grul?
He’s shaking with nervousness to impress everyone and make a nice video to show all his friends
There’s no right way to do it. Ten times out of ten you’d look like a jackhole.
TBH, if I could charge $200/minute to behave like an asshat, I'd be all over it.
Hahaha. No lie that baklava they do looks good but I saw a video of a customer asking "what are you making that weird noise for?"
Literally 95% of those salt flakes missed the meat and hit the floor
Cringe and cringer III: The Cringining
Don't hat the hat
Tbh this almost got me on board with him. Like, the whole shtick is stupid for sure, but look at him, out here performing the weird cringy shit he does, to people who are absolutely lapping it up.  
I respect his... something, I'm not sure what it is yet, but I respect it.
Yes the salt comes from him in those cases 
No. 
lol
And the ones that hit the food rolled down his sweaty forearm.
Hāt the hat
>I respect his... 

grifting power?
I don't respect his cooking but I do respect the fact he saw the wave and has been riding it this whole time.

He doesn't give a crap what anyone says about him and I'm not even sure he really thinks what he is doing is anything special. He got popular, took that momentum and opened some high priced restaurants where he does his schtick, now people come to him and spend thousands.

Say what you will but, dudes making bank and having a lot of fun doing it.
His moxie?
Happy Cake Day! 🍰
Activate!
I hate people who dickride grifters. That’s so pathetic
Starfield just won the Xbox Game of the Year
Link to [tweet](https://twitter.com/StarfieldGame/status/1723041460268786052?t=CGPCz7ITLCXBnv5nQANTpg&s=19)
For anyone wondering the nominees were

Starfield

Chants of Sennaar

Hi-Fi Rush

Planet of Lana

Dead Space

Pentiment

Edit: also in case anyone didn’t know, ‘Golden Joystick’ awards are a popular vote. Whichever game gets the most votes online in a poll between the nominees wins the award
How many first party games has Xbox released this year, and what are they.. genuinely curious?
My grandma just named me most handsome man of the year. So there's that!
I really thought Redfall had a chance.
It is in fact the Xbox game that came out this year
Woah, people in this sub really don't like the game. 🤔
Rough
Weren’t really a hard award to win
Slow year?
I mean, even if it’s including multi-platform titles, how many of the other GOTY candidates are unavailable on Xbox? 

No BG3, no Spider-Man 2, no TOTK, no Final Fantay XVI, no Super Mario Bros Wonder
While I personally feel like Hi Fi Rush should have taken this, I had no expectations that it would over Starfield justified or not.
I'm enjoying starfield so far but there are entire parts of the game that are either completely broken or underdeveloped. The game crashed on me like 12 times over the course of 80 hours and entire questlines have glitched out to the point where I camt even complete them. The exploration of planets is especially egregious where there isnt even a vehicle to drive around a planet so you have to constantly run back and forth your ship and a randomized dungeon for the most part. 

It's kind of pointless comparing two games like Starfield and Hi-Fi Rush; considering they are completely different genres and the size and scope of starfield is WAY beyond Hi-Fi Rush. But I personally think Hi-Fi Rush deserved game of the year because it's a finished, high polished product that is extremely well done and exciting. The story is a little generic but the characters and the world are so much fun that it didnt really bother me.
Because Baldur’s Gate isn’t on Xbox.
Better get those tissues ready
not like xbox released any other good AAA title this year lol
Hi fi rush 100% should have won
Ah yes, when people in the games sub complain that it won an Award… Just like most other game subs this has become a hate circlejerk echochamber. I see the same complains posted every day. Many are just here to hate. 

Next year this sub will be filled with Posts how Great the game is and how greatly improved it is. But in reality just the haters moved on to the next game.
We are aware, this is just an ad?
I mean, when you're an 8 and your friends are 4s....you're gonna get picked.
Where’s that meme of Obama giving himself a medal?
No! They bought that award. This game is a pile of shit. Bethesda should be ashamed of creating such a shallow game full of shortcuts, cut corners, and almost zero depth. Not to mention 100s of bugs. Oh yeah, and terrible optimization, look up the topology for any of the models. The fucking chunks cubes have 5000 polys. Why?!? A default cube from any 3D modelling software would’ve sufficed, and you’d have 6 polys. 

If this is all it takes to make a game that wins GOTY, then almost every other game released this year should’ve been awarded. 

This is bullshit
Wow this subreddit literally hates this game lmao
....but the year isnt done yet?
Hi fi rush should've won.
That doesn't feel deserved to me, I like this game, but it is not GOTY.
wasn't really any competition
Darn shame not many people played Hi Fi Rush...
Nice mine crashes and won’t let me advance everytime I get near the 15 hour mark. Game sucks
Too bad it’s shit on Xbox , patch  it already
Lol what
Hi-Fi Rush got robbed 😭
Hi-Fi Rush should have won
And it still somehow stumbled over that really low bar
Low bar lmao
Xbox handing Xbox it’s own award
I mean it has alot to improve on but its incredible. At least for me. Its what I have always wanted in a game since I dont have pc
Not much else for games this year or what?
It was their only game. Lol.  It that hard.
Wow, such a bad year for Xbox, lol.
Bethesda now has the excuse to name a "Game of the Year" edition
I mean.. it’s not like it had much competition lmao.
look at the competition though lol
Cool. I love Starfield.
https://i.redd.it/obvqaa0lhn841.jpg
Wtf are these games? Its like putting 6 400 pounds guy competing with a 250 pound guy in a foot race
Ew how
It really had no competition.  Deadspace is awesome but it's older game just redone so can't really see it winning on that alone.  But other games no contest. So yeah it won.  Meh
It didn't have much competition
Lol ooof
Nothing against those other games, but I've never heard of most of them. Bad marketing.
lol
Larian was a little late with their Xbox version of BG3.
Hi-Fi RUSH deserved Xbox's GOTY wtf
This is a sad thing I just read.
It doesn't deserve it.
Is it pat yourself on the back day?
Literally means jack shit
I liked Deadspace more. Starfield was way too safe. I guess it was good for children, though, and that's who most video games are marketed for.
Man that's the equivalent of me a 23 year old going up against 12 year olds in a basketball competition :].
Ya nothing special this year. On to the next.
This is Average Xbox Moment :D one good game in looooooooong time that is also on PC and being soo proud of it
Hi-fi rush deserved it more
Only cos bg3 ain't out on xbox yet rip
lol given how bare the cupboard is over there
Wow. One more reason to hold onto ps5.
Did they award it to themselves or something?
I was going to say… what how… then reading the list it was pretty lean this year.
I heard that game was sssshhhhhiiiiiittttt.
Why? It's not that good. Its just fine for now.
Pff like there are no good games or something...
What has become of gaming.....
Sad that this game won
It’s not hard to be GOTY on Xbox
Big OOF moment.
Like there was anything else
It is, truly, one of the games that released this year. 

To be honest, Hi-Fi Rush should have won this instead.
Didn't know there was a nomination "Most bugged game of the year."
Quiet year for Xbox, I guess.
That Game should not win anything.
So... Microsoft owned game gets Microsoft owned award for being best game of the year on Microsoft platform.

Colour me shocked :P
Must’ve been a slow year for Xbox.
Bs. Bg3 all the way
lol
rip xbox if this was the best they got this entire year.
LMAO. the big as a football pitch shallower than a puddle game?
Lol
Lol that just says Xbox had a shitty year of games I guess.
I was pretty disappointed with it
God knows how with it crashing every 5 minutes lol 😆
They were worried about Baldurs Gate coming out in early December for the Xbox and beating it. Had to stop it before the end of the year
Okay so in other words... xbox GOTY is a completely meaningless title. AAA gaming is going sooo downhill It's just so sad.
Im sorry for the xbox folks! 😂
I’m glad that everyone here, who all probably have at least 100 hours in, is in full agreement that this game does not deserve this.
Lame. BG3 or TOTK were way more deserving
wtf?
Its fun but I played through it once and haven't had the urge to do it again.
This made me laugh so hard.it felt like when you're playing video games and there's a kid beside you and you give them a fake controller and we just handed starfield a goty to not hurt their feelings, The playstation goty was also really funny, at least Starfield is exclusive, what is RE4 to playstation, maybe I'm missing something.
It only won because Gollum wasn't nominated;-)
Lies of p is better than anything on the list, star field is dope Ik it gets a lot of hate but it’s dope I will say it is somewhat annoying going planet to planet and the planets ain’t really got shit on em could be better even with less planets If it had 10 planets but stacked out be much better but anyways Lies of P is a banger great game!!!!!
How? It’s pretty good, but it’s not Witcher 3 good….
Hi-fi Rush was a unique, gorgeous, fresh game that accomplished everything it was designed to do with style and charm and nothing left on the table.

Starfield is unbalanced and incomplete, full of useless skills that don't matter, base systems that don't matter, entire weapon classes that don't matter, and is a rehash of a decade old Bethesda formula that actually took steps backwards, and they made dogs and cats extinct.

All this award says is that the award means absolutely nothing.
as a corporation giving yourself an award shouldn't be news...
Wow this really drives home how shitty xbox releases were this year.

Not throwing shade at starfield but when some of the other runners ups are remakes of old games you know you are shitting the bed content wise.
The biggest disappointment of 2023
Slow year for xbox huh?
LMAO. usesless.
How fucking lame
Crazy how much love and care was put into Hi-fi Rush only for it to lose to one of the most soulless modern games I’ve played in recent memory
Somebody make the meme with the dude putting the medal on himself.
As long as it doesn't win actually game of the year, they can have their Obama giving himself an award meme award.
I mean, it's XBOX game of the year so not surprised.  It's not been a great year for Xbox.
With what competition though?
I mean, it’s not like they were up against any real competition
Hahah fucking LMAO

Starfield is Xbox's **only game** this year.
Damn, it's crazy a game made in 2011 got a reward 12 years later.
Lol can't hope to win any thing else with bg3
Yikes. There goes another incentive for Bethesda to actually improve it. 

Where are all the good Xbox games?
Complete joke.

The game is an empty shell
Lol
I bought an xbox specifically for Starfield, imagine my disappointment.
The most soulless and watered down RPG ever created wins. Wow. The industry standards are at an all time low :(
That’s sad…  there are better games this year.  (I know I’m about to be downvoted a lot.)
I mean, what else could realistically have won it? Regardless of it's faults, it's the only GotY-worthy game Xbox has released this year.

I love Pentiment and think it's a more enjoyable experience for my tastes, but it's not really a GotY type game. Same for Hi-Fi Rush.
Well deserved, Starfield is fantastic!
This just in: Big Mac just won the McDonald’s burger of the year!
Bar wasn't high...
Kinda like shaking your own hand isn't it?
What a terrible nominee list lol
Hi-Fi Rush should have won.
Over Hi-Fi Rush AND Dead Space and even Pentiment?? Xbox is wild for this pick lmao

Starfield is the most "it's fine" game of the year. It doesn't have the fun combat of Hi-Fi, it doesn't have the graphical fidelity, atmosphere and, honestly, better jetpack mechanics of Dead Space and it most certainly does not have the writing and imagination of Pentiment. 

Starfield was a perfectly fine game. Fine would have been in a different year, but with the incredible games we've had throughout the year like BG3 or Alan Wake 2 or Cocoon or Lies of P or Resident Evil 4 Remake, 'fine' is definitely not enough.
Did y’all expect something else to win ? 😂
lol. Xbox really hurting for games it appears.
<Insert image of Obama giving Obama a medal>
Well I mean what was it really up against?
How tf does this beat hifi rush
Lol
You guys know that this is entirely fan-voted, right?
Hi Fi Rush is way better than Starfield and I’ll die on that hill
-insert Obama awarding Obama meme-
Flogging a dead horse
I'm not surprised by this at all. I don't see why people have so much hate for this game.
As if the nominees were any competition lol
In addition to Star Field, I also played Pentiment and High-Fi Rush this year. While much smaller in scope, both were much richer experiences in my opinion. 

I put plenty of hours into StarField, and there's some fun to be had there, but it's very much a "Bethesda made another one of those" game, and I've put a lot of milage on those already.
I think it's fair considering the competition. Actual GOTY for PC and in general went to BG3 so no surprises there, everything is completely expected.
Well the golden joy stick awards can go humbly fuck themselves.
How though
why?
How did dead space loose?
Pentiment fucking robbed
How lol
Congratulations Microsoft on your Microsoft Award
Gross. Must not be much completion.
I’m an Xbox fan… but SF didn’t deserve it. Hi-Fi Rush for me.
lmao
I hate to say it, but the competition wasn't eh... that competitive. The Xbox exclusive list this year was horrendous. Dead Space wasn't exclusive to Xbox.
Should’ve been Hi-Fi Rush
Damn.....must have been a shitty year for Xbok.
Ridiculous considering g how many bugs there were and still are. Hifi Rush should have taken it home
I absolutely hate Starfield after 400 hours the bugs and crashing gets worse. I can’t pause the game without a crash. I’m on a series X and it runs horribly
I enjoyed my time with Starfield, but game of the year? Over Hi-Fi Rush? 

lol no
Wtf this shit doesn't deserve game of the anything....
Hi-Fi Rush was far better for the complete game package.
:(
Why
How????
Not worthy of it IMO.
yeah pretty flimsy competition and it's an online poll. So it's really more of a "which game had the highest marketing budget and sales" kind of poll
So if this is the best game on xbox .. xbox is doomed because the game is garbage
Deservedly so.  It's a phenomenal game though trolls have been trying to sabotage it for months.
For Xbox releases it's the best for sure. 

I've really enjoyed starfield. Can't wait for creation kit.
Must of been not much going on
Glad starfield won but golden joystick sounds like a shitty award show. How did Zelda only win “Nintendo game of the year”. Complete BS.
Why? Did they play anything else this year?
GOTY doesn't really mean anything anymore
Must have been an extremely low bar
I feel like it won off the Bethesda name alone. Like don't get me wrong, I enjoy the game, I have fun with the game, I'm a lifelong Bethesda fan since the days of Morrowind, but this is not deserving of Game of the Year by any stretch.
Shit graphics and optimization
Well, the nominations made zero sense anyway, so I'm not surprised. It's like they created a list that guaranteed Starfields win. They put it up against a game I never heard of, a sleeper hit, a remake, and another game I never heard of. How the hell was it not gonna win?
Need the meme of Obama putting the medal on himself
McDonald's claims the quarter pounder is the burger of the year, how prestigious.
this seems like a pathetic desperate bid to prop up starfields popularity. its not like its a bad game, but wtf were those nominees? this reeks of being a marketing ploy.
GOTY is so clearly a marketing tactic at this point. Starfield is so buggy and barebones that it definitely does not deserve any awards at the moment. These kind of broken releases should not be encouraged or allowed, but like an abusive relationship, it will never get better
Feels good to own a PS5.
I've never seen a community of so called """fans""" of a game so hellbent on hating it on every opportunity possible. Can't even let developers enjoy the recognition of a simple popularity award.


And people still wonder why Bethesda doesn't directly interact with this dumpster fire of a subreddit lol.
Good for Bethesda! I hope they keep updating and patching the game.
What a joke...
I kind of think HI-FI rush should have won.  
Its a complete game Starfield is going to take a few years to reach its full potential.  


I enjoyed PIt'sentiment but it's a very niche game, and kind of adult. The kind of game you get your mum to play.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

This is the reason Democracy is never going to work, you give stupid people the right to vote, they are going to vote for stupid things. 

Dead Space was MILES better next to what STARFIELD Delivered.

Hell, even Hi-Fi Rush was more original and fun to play.
Rough year for xbox
How Sad.  Starfield is not a good game.
no, just no
yes and a while back last of us 2 won so many many awards, it means you garbage if you win and very least nothing to celebrate.

Not to mention 1 tiny award...really you going to celebrate that when passed games, in good and challenging to win times... won how many awards ? This should have easily doubled if not tripled Skyrim's instead its like 1%.
I still feel like starfield was overhyped and extremely’meh’, but that’s just me I guess…
Couldn’t get into it. And honestly didn’t hear much about it after the initial release
Not like there was much to choose from. The nominees show that this year was a very weak year for XBox.
Wasnt much competition tbh.
Hi-Fi Rush: Am I a joke to you?
What the Fuck?!
The absolute state of Xbox
This beat deadspace?…
Obvious choice. Game succeeded. Whether people like it or not. It’s an incredible game right now. And it sets a strong foundation going forward. 

The things people want added to Starfield are minuscule compared to the list of things people want added to Star Citizen (which doesn’t even have a console port). 

So Bethesda is in a very strong position with this title and the possibilities are limitless.
Hi-Fi Rush deserves it much more imo
Didn't deserve it... remnant want even a contender?
Pretty transparent attempt to boost sales on their under performing game
Damn jerk yourself off much?
Well I guess whose opinion we know not to trust!
Wow Xbox chooses its own game as game of the year.
Yikes, must have been a pretty quiet year for Starfield to win.
Beautiful game well deserved.
Y'all are complaining so much holy cow. If you don't like the game why are you even on this sub
Microsoft patting itself on the back.
Pentiment is a much better game than Starfield. Fuck this shit.
Well Xbox won’t be getting BG3 this year so that makes sense
Not much competition. Let’s see about game of the year. That’s probably going to Zelda.
Hard times for xbox
I mean... that's a pretty low bar to clear. Microsoft isn't exactly pumping out hit after hit.
Only because bg3 didn’t get released on the Xbox this year!
When you race alone are you a winner or a loser?
Lol
Biggest lie of the decade lol


Though we all knew it was coming
of course it did xbox owns bethesda
But Resident Evil 4.
This is the equivalent of my mom saying i am the beat looking boy of the year
It doesn’t deserve it
It was a low, low bar
There are so many game awards now that everyone is a winner...

Starfield shouldn't be getting an award, it is a half baked game, and Baldurs Gate III and Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty both left it in the dust. Starfield is like oblivion (they weren't wrong about that), but with more loading screens and no real open world. Oblivion is the most boring elder scrolls game by far. Skyrim was a masterpiece, Fallout 4 was really good despite the lack of strong narrative and real choices, but Starfield is slow and awkward. It's just not a very good game.

Bethesda getting awards for making Oblivion's also boring space sequel is a testament to how meaningless these awards really are.

\#BetterThanRedfallAward
Why though? Game is unfinished, and news articles are fucking ads now.
Yeah theres like no other xbox games to compete.. lol

Sad to see. Starfield isnt even that good of a game all things considered
was it a good game, yeah i'd say so. I enjoyed it alot. GOTY tho? hmmmm i dont think so.
What? You mean to say Xbox elected the studio that they bought and continued to hype up is their game of the year??? Noooo....
A little side Award for Xbox 😂, but it is meaningless in comparison to the big ones.
i.. i honestly didnt think anyone cared what happens on consoles anymore.
Bring on the conspiracy theories! 🍿
booooh never played prob dont deservetoo expensive
Dead space is a remake, Hifi Rush is the same publisher and the only other options were either Pertichment, Forza Motorsports or Redfall
Xbox game of this year
I'm surprised bg3 didn't win this too. Oh wait....
Xbox game that Xbox paid a lot of money for exclusivity and then spent alot of money to advertise wins the Xbox game of the year, according to Xbox.
They definitely served this award it most definitely wasn’t bought
If true I dunno why. Biggest empty game I've ever played lol. Or it just means this year was garbage for Xbox. Either way...it's embarrassing
Won because lack of competition, dont get your hopes up
Seems pretty obv that sf would win, besides hi-fi rush ( even that game to me is only a contender cause there isn't any better options). What else could really win?
Bullshit
Why?
did no other games come out on xbox this year?
are we supposed to pretend it's something worth celebrating?
Poor Xbox. 

I'd have given it to Penitent. But yeah, the state of that platform....

I lke Starfield, don't get me wrong. It's slop and I like it. But, GOTY? No. Not by a long shot.
I mean truly what was it going up against? Redfall?
Starfield beat dead space remake?  Wild.
More a commentary on the quality of Xbox games, than anything.
Someone please add that meme of Obama medaling himself.
Must of been a bad year lol
Grim
Aren't Xbox any games out there worth bragging about?
Lol the bar was on the floor. Its not a big feat
this game felt bland as fuck when I played a few hours of it on my cousins Xbox lmao
Pull that meme with the guy giving himself a medal
Reviews are manipulated, awards and accolades are manipulated.  Of coarse it won, they want that GOTY edition.
Did they even play the game lmao? Literal copy pasted trash game
Thus...

This says a lot more about the Xbox lineup than about Starfield
Most disappointing Bethesda game I think I've ever played. Uninstalled without finishing, just too bland a game for me. Would say not worth the award, but with the other nominees it makes sense.
Why???
Its a Joke?
Where is Baldur's Gate?
*insert Obama medal meme*
Does this mean they might start actually fixing the game? I like the concept but it plays like pulling teeth and I’m on series x. Also the story was alright but there were far better games released than starfield. I just feel like people are biased because it’s exclusive
Ew.  Makes me want to buy a PlayStation
well...it was the xbox game that came out this year....
That is genuinely an atrocious win hahaha
LOL, well no shit.  It's like a CEO being awarded best business leader at their own company.
Hate to say it…but I guess it was a pretty bad year for games then.
Bad year for gaming?
Evidence of how low the bar was this year. 


Starfield is fun, but it's hardly GOTY material
Lol
How?
Must be a slow year
Uff rough year for xbox
This is like an only child winning kid of the year from his parents
That’s kinda like Sony having an awards event and then naming Ps5 “Console of the Year” lmfao
I guess it was the only game on the list?
HiFi Rush is easily the best of the options. Starefield didn't deserve it honestly.
What a joke
Starfield should have received most hated game of the year. Every single major game review I watched gave poor reviews. And I totally agree with them. Every single part of Starfield is garbage. So much content and mechanics are missing in the game. Such a disappointment....
Wow, Xbox had it rough this year. My condolences.
Tragic that the best game on Xbox this year was a 7/10
Playing that game is equal to taking a shit and a bunch of cold shit water splashes up on your balls and ass.

Edit: And pulling your pants right up no wipe or drying your ass and balls.
Obama giving obama medal MEME! 

&#x200B;

lol
None of these awards matter, they are all popularity and pay to win contests.
Popularity contest...
Wow, with all that competition it’s hard to see why it won /s
never even heard of these other ones lol (other then dead space which ive never played anyway)
Lol uh…. Wow…. That’s kinda sad…. The game is at 49% recommended on recent steam reviews… this is not a goty by any metric
l  
o  
l
Why though? It’s not good.
Ngl i didnt evem no hi fi rush was a nomanee game did go harddd
With how many other amazing games came out this year, this is honestly a joke and any half-aware gamer would either lose faith in these game awards or have already lost that faith years ago. Try games for yourself, play the genre you prefer even if it isn't mainstream. Ignore noise like this.
Should've gone to Hi-Fi Rush imo
What we’re the other options because damn I canceled my game pass because of this game
Yep, and BG3 cleaned house with Best Game, Best game on PC, Best Studio, Best Visuals, Best Storyline, Best Gaming Community, and the VA for Asterion won Best Supporting Performer. 

All Starfield got was the Xbox award which is like Microsoft patting itself on the back.
How tf did that gane win lool setup imo
Gonna wait for The Game Awards.. respectfully..
It’s because baldurs gate 3 didn’t come out on Xbox yet
Ass game
They didn’t really have any other games to compete
Starfield isn’t a good game
Brooooo, Jedi: Survivor?
Hi fi rush should've won. That game was way more innovative than starfield
Bruh, he got no competitors in its nomination
Someone hasn’t played it apparently! 🤣
theres no way they didnt had a bunch of bots voting for them
Lol. A game that's buggy won the GotY for the Xbox category. 


You cant make up this irony. It just falls into place.
Says more about the state of Xbox than the quality of Starfield. The *absolute* state of Xbox smh
Deadspace??
I love Starfield but Hifi Rush was amazing as well. I hope Microsoft gives Tango the AAA budget and they go balls out for the sequel.
Wtf is the criteria lmao, it’s obviously not exclusives with dead space on it. 

Did they just forget about every other game that came out this year?
Hi-Fi Rush should win
Weak line up, only saying this because i know 2 games and one came out like 50 years ago.
Hi-Fi Rush deserves it head over heels based on that list.
How is the game of the year group so weak? Bethesda planned this out.
Look, I love Starfield. And I get it's a popularity contest. But it winning over Chants of Sennaar *and* Pentiment? No no no no no no

Those are far superior games.
In that case, HiFi Rush was more fun and Pentiment had a better story. Both have way less bugs and a more distinct art style with a better performance for what they are.
Review (critic/user) scores for each game on Metacritic:

* Starfield - 83/7.0
* Chants of Sennaar - 84/8.6
* Hi-Fi Rush - 87/8.9
* Planet of Lana 80/7.9
* Dead Space 89/8.8
* Pentiment - 86/7.4

It's amazing that the game with the 2nd lowest critic score and the lowest user score won GOTY. 

Kind of a joke if you think about it.

At least Starfield's fans showed up to vote. Got to at least give them that.
Hi Fi Rush is way better
Oh that's a boring list
Pentiment was robbed.
Hi-Fi Rush, Redfall, Starfield, and Forza Motorsport are the ones that would actually count here.

Edit: and Minecraft Legends.
It's not only 1st party games.
Off the top of my head… they also released HiFi Rush, Redfall and Forza.
It’s not the first party/exclusive GOTY though for the award. The PS one went to the RE4 remake.
Again!? I worked really hard this year too.
Exactly 👍
Congratulations!
Such a nice young man
Grandma's boy!
Id let you fuck me if you paid me a bunch of money too. 😘
Happy cake day
Awh i don't have a grandma that's a decent human being, so i'll nominate you too
That game was god awful
🤣
It probably did if Starfield won 😬
The highest edition of Redfall still selling for full price
Golden Raspberry Award equivalency, then yes, you are absolutely right on the money!
It is in fact a game of our time
This just honestly tells me, if that's the best Xbox got in 2023 of all years filled with absolute bangers, boy am I not missing out not having the console.
Is Armored Core 6 not available on Xbox?
And every game you listed there is better than starfield and it’s not even close.
>or underdeveloped

It is literally, game was released half baked, literally done to 50%, you truly realize that when you start modding, seeing the stuff modders find, barebones in the game or cut or just not finished and literally basic shit that is not in the game and no one would imagine is missing... is a TON.
I wanted to love it. I'm just bored.
Just started Baldur's Gate and it's so much fun! Really scratched the elder scrolls itch and the multiplayer really makes it special, feels like all the fun of gaming back in the early 2000s again
BGS3 isnt even nominated for Playstations version and the game was launched a month later on there. RE4 won isntead.
Tears or jerking ourselves off?
I don’t really hate it, but it definitely was underwhelming. I stopped playing after about 12 hours I think and jumped into BG3 then back into Fallout76. Just had a hard time staying interested in the game.
I don’t think people hate it. We just feel disappointed and want Bethesda to understand that and learn from it. Maybe some people hate it but those people probably never liked Bethesda games to begin with if I had to guess which I understand
The 180 this sub has taken since the game launched is hilarious. Everyone used to be so hype and negative opinions got heavily downvoted. Now top comments are just people shitting on the game and shilling for BG3.
I mean... you don't seriously think it deserves GotY, do you?
It is hilarious. People on the Elder Scrolls sub likes this game more. To be fair, there are some trolls in this sub, but still.
I get mass downvoted whenever i mention that i like this game in this sub.
Yep it’s hilarious, with the way some people talk about it on here you’d imagine it’s the literal worst thing to ever happen to games. I don’t know why because despite some issues it’s still a fantastic game with a lot of stuff to do.

Watch, in however many years, when the next Bethesda game is out, it’ll be the same complaints, same issues and yet somehow Starfield will be viewed as this great masterpiece that suddenly everyone loved.

It happened with Skyrim, it happened with FO4, it’ll happen here. It’s my (and a lot of others’) favourite BGS game, it’ll age well.
I can't even begin to fathom why, but there are *way too many* people in this sub who quit the game months ago who just hang around on here to shit on the game and the people who are enjoying it. 

I mean, sifting through a reddit sub just to shit on something you quit a month ago... It's seriously not a healthy way to go through life.
Yeah it’s pretty pathetic honestly. I mean it feels like 75% of the sub doesn’t even play anymore, they’re just here to bitch.
There’s usually a cutoff for awards season.  Some awards roll the ones after into the next year, and some just say tough shit.
They don't have any more exclusives in November or December anyway
After Forza Motorsport is the only big exclusive of 2023 so...
So... I am confused, how is Xbox or Microsoft involved?

The awards are done by "[Future, plc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_plc)" who owns and runs PC Gamer and several other gaming media sites/magazines. 

They are not related to Xbox or Microsoft in any way.
Its the Joystick game Awards, Xbox has nothing to do with it, what are you on about lmfao.
> incredible

I'm not trying to be disingenuous about this but like, what about Starfield do you find *incredible*? I honestly can't even get myself to finish the game. I love RPGs I've played all the other Bethesda RPGs and just about everything from this game feels like a backstep to me.
Same thoughts. Incredible but much to improve on.
I tried putting both of those in my Xbox and the games wouldn't even start! 
0/10
It's a non xbox/microsoft company that's doing the award judging,so it isn't "GOTY as chosen by Xbox", but rather "the game that won for the category of games on Xbox".
It probably wouldn’t when you have to compete with bg3, re4 remake, totk, lies of P, etc
Then why deadspace…
Seems several small titles were in the running with Chants of Sennaar, Planet of Lana, Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, and then the only other choice was the remake of Dead Space.

EDIT: Also seems some people dislike and will downvote facts?
HD remake
hifi rush shoulda had the award tbh
It's pretty clear: the best Xbox exclusive or non-exclusive game that is not better than starfield.
Wild how many people on the starfield sub are hating on starfield 🤣
Baldurs gate 3 isn’t out for Xbox yet.
Yeah, they definitely planned to develop and release a video game.
hi fi rush is goated though?
So they released the game when they did to win a single GOTY award from one outlet? My god the people in this sub...
Never even heard of those two...
[deleted]
Absolutely. Starfield is one of the weaker titles on this list. But hey, broad appeal gonna broad appeal I guess.
They lost though. So
If a million people know about a game and half of them hate it that's still more votes than a game only 100k people know about but only 10% hate it. When awards let people vote like that it basically just means the most well known game wins.
Kind of a strange category. The nominees were actually:

Starfield

Chants of Sennaar

Hi-Fi Rush

Planet of Lana

Dead Space

Pentiment
Honestly, imo Hi-fi rush is a much smaller experience, but is much more deserving of game of the year for Xbox. None of the game feels like bloat and everything it tries to do it does well. I simply can’t say the same about Starfield and I think Forza is probably too niche to warrant GotY. I don’t think I really need to speak on Redfall for us all to get it.
I haven't played Hi-Fi Rush, and I don't hate starfield, but I think the award should of gone to Hi-Fi for taking on such an niche concept and doing it so well.
Redfall was a HUGE flop. It doesn't count.
Minecraft legends
Sorry, man. Better luck next time
Uh?
I played the game for an hour, uninstalled it and never looked back.

And I'm someone who played ME: Andromeda to completion.
2023 should in fact get a year of the year award.
I have a PS5 that I buy my favorite “high-end next gen” games for, but having a Series S has been a blast and I play it more than my PS5. Starfield and Darktide have been a ton of fun to play, and GamePass is an unbeatable value.
My thoughts exactly
It is. 

Only listed the likely GOTY candidates that are not on Xbox. It’s why I also didn’t mention RE4 or Sea of Stars, because they’re all on Xbox.
I didn’t suggest otherwise. I stated that all of those games are unavailable on Xbox and therefore could not be in the running for “Xbox game of the year”.
Lol hell no, you guys really have a problem with the concept of taste and how different games can scratch different itch for people, outside of possibly BG3 and maybe Zelda, I take Starfield absolutely any day rather than Spider Man 2, FF 16 or Mario Bros, and it's not even close. Starfield is way way more ambitious and offers a million more possibilities of gameplay and experience than those games.

I really can't believe a message like that got so much upvote on the Starfield subreddit, if all of some of you guys do is hating on that game in every comment possible, just go elsewhere.
Yeah I really really enjoyed my first initial month or two with the game but man I’ve just gotten so board with how dead the world feels in some ways
You can't win GOTY category in more than 1 platform, so since BG3 came out first on PC, it wasn't put up for nomination in the PS5 platform. They mentioned something about this.
Ope, that’s not the case actually! The people that run GJA stated they didn’t want BG3 to dominate the categories as that wasn’t really in the spirit of the awards show! 

But it is totally understandable coming from an outside perspective that you might think just because it wasn’t nominated people didn’t like it on PS. 

Unfortunately that’s not the case!

I see that you responded with “lol doubt” 

And then you blocked me… I think it’s pretty obvious you were spreading misinformation intentionally and didn’t think anybody would call you on it.

But yeah. Maybe use google?
That’s well deserved for RE4. Great game/remake
Yes.
Tears of *my* kingdom
I loved Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim which I still play today with lots of mods.

My believe in Bethesda got first cracks with the paid mods fiasco then the Creation Club (or paid mods 2) then Fallout 4 and Fallout 76. I also started to see through Tod's lies in his scripted interviews, he only gives scripted interviews, compare that to Sven.

I knew that Starfield would be bad and I have no hope for TES 6.
Well, God of War received goty over RDR2, that proves that the awards suck anyways.
That's pretty understandable.

People who like both games are going to be more likely to talk about those games in a shared context. Can more easily bring it up as a topic you like as a parallel to something in Skyrim's reddit.

However, there's not much reason for someone who has an issue with Starfield to be posting that issue in a Skyrim reddit.
>People on the Elder Scrolls sub likes this game more

probably because they are used to a 2010 game
But it's just healthy and sound criticism though ! 


.....but yeah, holy toxic
>Watch, in however many years, when the next Bethesda game is out, it’ll be the same complaints,

It probably will, because as we have now seen Bethesda doesn't really grow or advance in anyway, so the complaints will likely be the same because the problems will likely be exactly the same. 

It's odd that people are confused that others are upset a game comes out in 2023 that is missing gameplay features other games implemented in 2007.
Skyrim doesn’t have a 70% rating on steam
> Yep it’s hilarious, with the way some people talk about it on here you’d imagine it’s the literal worst thing to ever happen to games

That's where people's perception needs to change. People criticize the game because they like it and care for Bethesda games. If people actually thought it was the worst video game, this sub would be empty
This is horseshit. Skyrim was good at launch even with all of the bugs.

There won’t be a next time for me as I’m never buying another Bethesda game. Go ahead and set a reminder.
I think it’s a symptom of just overall displeasure with the gaming industry as a whole. People are sick and tired of being hyped up for games only to be disappointed with mediocrity or greed over and over again, and making that displeasure known is their outlet.
Can we stop this stupid opinion policing? I haven't played Skyrim in ~2 years but still hang out in its sub and participate. Stop this "oh you don't even play the game, so get out" type of bullshit gate keeping. Grow up and stop being so triggered by other people's opinions
This happens with pretty much every game subreddit these days. People who actually enjoy a game stop bothering to participate in online communities because they're such salt fests. Everytime I pop back into this sub to check things out, most comments are just people being upset. 

It's like, why do I bother coming back here if the vast majority of people on the sub seem to hate the game? I might as well keep playing it and talking with my friends about it.
People need their conspiracy theories.
This is always true for BGS titles, simply because they make massive games. 

And yes, they’d rather make massive games and have modders fix it (though fix isn’t really the right word, it’s customizing) than make smaller games that come out more finished. I’m thankful they do it, because I have 300+ hours in Fallout 3 and Oblivion and 800+ in Fallout 4 and Skyrim.
I'm terminally online and I've never heard of sennaar or lana. This looks like Starfield was put up against really really good smaller studio games, a remake, and hifi rush just so it could stomp some things just by pure install/recognizability votes. The reviews for all of those other games generally better than starfield.
No no I get that but it was released on all consoles and PC, by EA. How is that a contender for best Xbox game?
More than an HD remake. Complete overhaul of the game. As a lover of Dead Space, the game was absolutely fantastic.
Yeah I dont even hate starfield but hifi rush was amazing
Don't remind me... Only game I'm remotely interested in and it got held up due to Series S...
Chants of Sennar is an indie language-deciphering puzzle game, and Pentiment is an indie-sized narrative mystery game directed by Josh Sawyer at Obsidian.
In that case, it feels like it was handed to Starfield by default as all of the other nominees were niche
Pentiment was really good. You wouldn't expect such quality writing and storytelling from a game like that unless you were already familiar with Obsidian.
Pentiment is the best game on that list
Andromeda got unfairly shit on. Played it recently on gamepass and quite enjoyed it.
I still have Redfall installed, I’ll play it eventually but after a few more updates. Hopefully the updates are coming
Series S makes for a decent low end PC alternative. Otherwise it's hard to justify an xbox console when PC + PS5 got you covered.
At the same time.
Starfield being underwhelming has gotten me to specifically go back to Skyrim which I haven’t touched since near its release. It’s been…a lot more enjoyable.
If that were the case, they wouldn't be so hard on Fallout 4
It’s hyperbole. It’s fair, there are issues but I don’t think they’re as game breaking as some people let on. I would welcome some improvements sure but it’s a good game, just a little rough round the edges at times.
I have spent the majority of my starfield reddit time over on r/NoSodiumStarfield due to the complete toxicity over here, but I figured that the new rule about comprehensive reviews would make a lot of the trolls go away - I gave it a week, but it basically seems the same. 

Still deciding whether to stay or go though, as I do want to be able to help people who are having game issues or have questions about the game, and this will be the first place they will go to - but having to deal with these trolls is not good for anyone's mental health.
Yeah, it was impossible for those games to win in user voted awards like these. Even if one of the competitors was an absolute 10/10, Starfield would still probably win by virtue of having so many players.
You're absolutely correct in how weird it is to see that there. It wasn't a day one gamepass exclusive like Lies of P, which really fits better into the category, but also isn't exclusive to the console.
There's not a lot of competition. It's best Xbox game, not best Xbox exclusive game I guess.
They didn’t want to include Redfall.
FYI, Playstation game of the year on the same event was Resident Evil 4.

Its not about exclusive games.
Resident evil 4 won for best PS5 game so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Well, RE4 won best PS5 game lol
It was released on Xbox!
Starfield is on PC too
It's a popularity contest and Starfield has a larger audience
Honestly hifi is the only one who could beat it on this list but it's popularity which it has no chance because it's very  indie. I wouldn't even take it as a win if hifi was awarded, idk wtf half the list is, these are seriously the best Xbox had in 2023?
It’ll be worth the wait, and your first playthrough wiill be with all of the other fixes.
and because of series S we are all getting 30 percent more vram optimisation. it's win win
You lost half the people gaming at puzzle.
kind of yeah. Eh, I like all those games. There all good, people should play them. Game Pass is a stupid value... for now... I'm sure capatlism is going to fck us soon enough with that one.
It probably was honestly, Microsoft bought them out so they stand to gain from promoting its newest investment  the best they can.
Yeah I am loving Starfield but Pentiment was the best game I’ve played in yearssss
Pentiment is amazing! I still need a few more playthroughs to get all the endings and achievements.
Pentiment and Chants of Sennarr were by far the most interesting games of the year. They're definitely not for everyone, but I'm glad they're getting recognizition.
Mannnn THANK YOU for this comment. Was wondering why obsidian sounded so familiar. Fucking loved the outer worlds, just gonna go into pentiment blind, they’ve earned that level of trust from me considering they also made fallout new Vegas, dayum
That was such a fascinating game! Similarly with Valhalla, it made me curious about how mediaeval people viewed the Roman and the remains of their empire.

I really hope they bring out another game like that.
Obsidian is still one of the better studios at story-telling imo.


I loved Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny.   great games!
Microsoft still wins whether you own a PC or Xbox. In fact, they'd probably prefer you to use PC, as that forces you to participate even more in-depth with the Windows ecosystem and Bing and Office365. 

And I write that on my Windows laptop.... :|
Can you do that, or is it like peeing and sneezing?
Tears make the best lube
That's because Fallout 4 is a 2005 game.
This is pretty much the opinion of majority of the gamers. The majority of the complaint posts start with "I spent 100-200 hours, I got my money's worth, it's a good game, but here's what I don't like about it ..."

Everyone needs to stop being so triggered by what others think about the game. If you don't want to hear complaints and only want positivity, just read and respond to only positive things. That's it - just ignore the criticisms. Nobody forces you (sorry, I'm not talking about you specifically) to be triggered and viciously defend the game or say "well, I liked the game, so you suck and your view is wrong". We should stop trying to moderate this into only positive or only negative things being allowed
Seems like saying Xbox exclusive and best Xbox game should in some way be somewhat synonymous.
If that's the case, how did Jedi Survivor not make the list? It was better than all of them
I honestly don’t think it’s the best of either, I think DeadSpace was a much better game despite being a remake and not exclusive, the only reason I would vote it best exclusive is I can’t think of a single other title they have exclusive that did well this year.
God! That game had sooooooo much potential. It could've been like Far Cry 5 but wit supernatural/vampiric elements. They blundered the shit out of that.
That’s good PR for Xbox. PlayStation exclusives get me out by the remake of a decade old game. Damn.
Honestly I've never even heard of those
Yeah I know... Microsoft sucks, windows sucks, tale old as time. Not like we have any choice. I'm not gonna spend hours watching Linux tutorials trying to make my games work, or get a mac to play the handful of available games.

Anyways, like I said PC + PS5 and you can play pretty much any game these days.
Yea, just wipe the tears first.
Closer to eating and shitting at the same time if I had to guess.
Happy Fappenings or Painful Pleasure?
This sub acts like Fallout 4 is so much better than Starfield, or at least it did until the mods updated the rules. So, maybe they were just trolls and left. I hope so honestly, because the amount of pushback I would get for saying that Starfield is a better RPG than Fallout 4 was kinda insane.
Yeah fair points. I guess it’s hard not to be annoyed by this sub though, it’s so overly negative to the point where any positive opinion that pushes back on it gets downvoted into oblivion and that annoys me.

I guess we just need to accept that it’s great for some but there are some things that could have been executed better. I still think it’s the most fun I’ve had in years playing a game, but that’s down to the genre and play style suiting me perfectly, so I can overlook the issues.
Why ? Games that don't ship on Xbox are not elligible, but games that are present on Xbox are. Those are totally not the same with an exclusivity.
Again, if it’s a popularity contest it wasn’t popular enough to make the list.
Playing both hi fi rush and jedi survivor day one i feel they both deserve a spot
It's on the Playstation list.

. . .and yes, these are dumb categories.
Because Jedi Survivor isn’t available on Gamepass and requires an EA Pro account where as Dead Space (and Wild Hearts, which isn’t a contender but was released at the same time) were both recently moved to only requiring a Gamepass account. Or atleast that’s the only thing that makes sense to me. This entire “award” really feels more like a Gamepass advertisement than a celebration of Xbox’s exclusive titles. I doubt Dead Space would’ve been there otherwise.
Should of went with another prey. Atleast the foundation is already set. Unfortunately the game wasn't received well until well after its time to shine. Such a good fucking game, dlc too. Still has alot of potential.
Pentiment is very unique and I'm glad I gave it chance. Think mystery + Monty Python Holy Grail-style art + multiple endings. May not be everyone's cup of tea but I think it surprised a lot of people.
Well you'd also need a Switch for all the Nintendo games.
DON'T TELL ME HOW TO LIVE!
Could also be that a lot of players still don't have next gen consoles (like moi) and therefore can't play Survivor, but since Starfield is available on gamepass for xbox one it can reach a wider audience.
Unfortunately, I doubt we'll ever get a Prey 2. Prey (2017) and Mooncrash were no doubt hidden gems.
Prey bored the crap out of me for some reason. It had all the things I love in games but in the end it was “Go Up, go down, Go Up, go down, Go Up…” until I was getting the feeling I was John McClane in Die Hard tapping the pin up photo every time he passed it on his numerous laps up and down the high rise.

I get what you're saying, but that may conjure unintentional images of fart trumpets. A better analogy would be similar to The Secret of Kells.

The design is straight pulled from pre Renaissance art styles, most often recognized by the lack of fixed point perspective in paintings.
Yes of course a Switch ~~emulator~~ console. How else would you ~~emulate~~ play nintendo games.
Okay, you got it sticky boy.
I have a next Gen console and my survivors playthrough broke on the first planet you go to💀
Wait long enough, and not even the switch will be able to play Nintendo games.

Gentlemen it’s been an honour not having a fucking clue but having a shred of hope with you
THE GTA 6 IS REAL
WE ARE SO BACK
I’m bout to bust
Why did I move here? I guess it was FOR THIS FUCKING MOMENT!!!
Jason doesn't miss.
SELLING, SELLING, HOPIUM 90% DISCOUNT. NEED TO GET RID OF MY BATCH!
My appointment is immeasurable and my day is made
I was here
Dutch did tell us to have some goddamn faith.
IT'S HAPPENING
This subreddit exists for 11 years now?!?
Passing out right now
I can't believe that I'm not dreaming holy shit!
Crying and cumming rn
That’s nice and all but GTA 7 when??
I WAS HERE
I'm pretty sure YouTube will crash once they drop the trailer
My goosebumps just got goosebumps!!
Holy shit, it’s happening 🎉
I can't believe I'm actually still alive to witness this holy shit
Now MrBossWorld or whatever his name is has content for another 4 weeks.
this is enough to make a grown man cry
Oh my god, finally
“I USED TO PRAY FOR TIMES LIKE THIS” -Meek Mill
good news to wake up to 👍 can’t wait for the trailer
It’s finally here! Announced right before the earnings call. Good call who ever called that last month.
I just had the best orgam of my life. 10 years being blue balled.
"in early December"... They didn't say which year 😭😭😭
This Subbreddit is reviving!
Well, didn't expect it to be THAT early.
Interesting how they haven’t referred to it as grand theft auto 6
LET'S FUCKING GO TO VICE CITY
They called us madmen...
WE DID IT JOE
All I wanted to say: Guys, this is an incredible moment. GTA means a lot to everyone. To me, it flashes me back to my childhood; playing that over-the-top camera on a game that challenged being bad or good. Then videogame magazines talking about GTA 3, and how it would change the franchise for ever. Then wanting a PS2 so bad until I got it from my parents.

After that, Vice City on Internet cafés after school. Then Vice City at home. Then GTA IV and my shitty PC not handling it properly. Thanks to that I researched in forums where I met my best friend ever.

Then I finally got my first job, got a nice PC, and played GTA V with medium settings. Then I got a better job, and then a better one, and finally was able to build a BEAST of a PC. And no GTAs were emerging anywhere for me. At least I could play and enjoy RDR2...

&#x200B;

But now, guys, full circle for me. A life of memories, of being poor and not affording the hardware required to enjoy my favorite game. Now I do, and now a new game is releasing. Just in case I already have a PS5 at the ready too (but I don't think they would separate the console launch AGAIN, it could happen, but I don't think so).

&#x200B;

I AM READY.
Holy shit it's happening
I’m cumming
WE'RE BARACK
I can't breathe
Holy fuck! What do I do now!? When can they take my money!!
THANK YOU UNIVERSE!
Hello mom!! I'm on an historical announcement
Finally.... 
no more copium 😭😭😭😭
Rejoice boys !!
THE WAIT FINALLY BEGINS!
IT'S REAL, IT'S HAPPENING (I've been cured of schizophrenia)
IT'S OFFICIAL!
Never bet against Jason Schrier lol
THANK YOU JASON
All aboard the hype train!!!!! We leavin the station!!!!! CHOO CHOO
This will be the most boring 1 month since this sub was created.
Vice City, my body is ready!
I'm glad I didn't kill myself!
LETS GOOOOO
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
There's so many comments being made that no one will see that I jerked off to the GTA V strippers when I was 13 and now I get to jerk off to the GTA VI strippers in my mid 20s
new will to live unlocked ‼️
Well I think that's about the end of todays productivity at work!
We aRe NoT gEtTiNg AnYtHiNg ThIs YeAr?!
I find it interesting that they never referred to it as “Grand Theft Auto VI”, always just “Grant Theft Auto”, I wonder if we will get a special name like “San Andreas” or “Vice City” instead of a number. Defo hope the name isn’t going to be just “Grand Theft Auto”
I’m gonna guess a 2024 fall release date hopefully
2023 announcement squad where ya’ll at? We never gave up. Never!!
From Sam Houser himself, I’ve never seen his name at the bottom of any post before
This Isn’t like any of the past announcements. Usually they give a logo with a countdown to the trailer

Rockstar is Cooking
The quickest most watched YouTube video in 24 hours, mark my words.
I lost NNN
27 million views to the tweet in an hour and a half lol. People saying this is not the most anticipated release ever are tripping
First gta game I was anticipating the release for and it feels good
I was here. 

I can’t believe it’s been 10 years, but it’s finally happening
WE MADE IT TO THE PROMISE LAND
The urge to say ‘we’re so back’ right after saying ‘it’s so over’
WE ARE SO FUCKING BACK HOPECHADS
Lived long enough to see GTA 6 announcement ✅
I woke up and bro I’m actually getting emotional. Got that single tear coming out my eye shit. I just beat GTA V for the millionth time again just yesterday but on the 360 to celebrate 10 years. It’s actually funny how I’m crying about a game rn. I don’t care. GTA is childhood, GTA is the best game franchise out there. I’m happy man.
I can't believe you fucking copium fiends were right, im busting.
I was fit and full of energy when GTA V was released. Now my back hurts and 10pm is sleepy time on a Saturday.
Failed no nut november
Imagine the number of people who have passed away while waiting for this announcement/game..getting a little emotional here.
Man… when gta V first trailer came out I was 17. No job, still studying, still living with my parents, not a care in the world

Now I got my own little family, full time job, mortgage, every responsibility in the world. Crazy how much life changes but I’m ready for this. Can’t wait
IM PRE ORDERING THE MOST EXPENSIVE VERSION I DONT GIVE A FUCK
Lady’s and Gents.

We have finally made it.
I WAS HERE! WE GONNA EAT GOOD TONIGHT
ITS BEEN 84 YEARS
Remember, remember, it's happening in December!!!!
It’s been an honor being here with y’all
I remember being so fucking hyped when they dropped the GTA V teasers and trailers over a decade ago. 

Here we go again!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This is a monumental moment! What a time to be alive, I honestly thought I would die of old age before this game was actually unveiled.
Calling it now. The trailer will just say 'coming soon', instead of an actual date.

But if they're cooking and it's gonna be good, let em cook.
The time has come my brothers, years we have waited. Now we prep the feast.
Lets fucking goooo dude i’ve been here for years, finally no more huffing hopium. It’s happening
imagine dying before December lmaoo
GOD IS GREAT
i was here
GOOSE BUMPS ALL OVER MY BODY
I was here when we collectively recovered from our copium addiction
Literally Got Chills
HOLY SHIT IM ALIVE FOR IT
So this is what the dream feels like...  This is the victory we longed for.
They saw the video of videogamedunkey and just had to make it outdated.
Damn I couldn’t believe Rockstar would leave its community hanging this year without an official announcement/teaser/trailer after all the hype and speculation.

This made me very happy today, thank you all for being such a strong community and sharing the love for Rockstar Games 🤟🏾
I remember people skipping football practice when I was in high school to play GTA V, now we’re all full blown adults with careers who will probably still take a few “sick days” to play this
This is surreal. I honestly wouldn’t mind speculating with you all for years. But it’s time to get this hype train moving fr.
HOLD UP WAIT A MINUTE

Y’ALL THOUGHT I WAS FINISHED?
GTABROS WE DID IT, I LOVE YOU ALL
I could actually cry. I was excited for next month because of christmas, but now i'm even more excited.
Finally 😭😭😭😭
Fuck NNN I don't care about it any more.
It's Happening!!
You already know I’m getting some days off work to play this in peace
I was having such a shitty morning and now I’m absolutely SO HAPPY
An announcement about an announcement is extremely odd for rockstar. Just saying.
We're so back baby
This day will be remembered in history books
I witnessed this.
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD
AM I DREAMING? SOMEBODY PINCH ME!
Nah I genuinely thought I was gonna die before we got anything. I’m a healthy 22 y/o.
I upgraded from PS1 to PS2 for GTAIII, to PS3 for GTAIV, and to PS4 for GTAV. 

Just tell us the damn release date so I know when I'm going to be unable to resist PS5 any longer.
THANK YOU MR. HOUSER
I'm about to pour my life savings into whatever shit I need to make this game run. I will enter area 51 If necessary.
Finally something official ever since the leaks. Looking forward to the next years with endless trailer analysis.
The start of an agonizing 1-2 year wait, but my God am I super hyped about this! Even got a little pep in my step.
I’m not much of a gamer, but I am literally going to drop $500 on a PS5 and whatever this game costs just to play it, and I’ll probably take a week off work too. That’s how hyped. 

Of course this is provided that leading up to release we don’t start hearing issues of the game being broken or sucking, but rockstar games is yet to disappoint.
Let's have a moment of silence to honor the homies we lost along the way to this journey. History in the making.
The best tweet to wake up to ever
Goddamn, November is gonna feel slow as hell now.
Killing myself postponed.

You know seriously I wonder how many ppl who were thinking of committing suicide might not do it? I said it as a joke but imagine how many ppl will not do it because they wanna see how the game looks like.
Wooo, soooo, Gta 6 on the way? Cool. I was on the phone with my grandma when the news hit. I was brought up too well (still followed the standard grandma hangup protocol) and said that I will say my prayers for her like 50 times followed by her saying that she will hang up the phone, but no, I said I will hang up the phone back and forth followed by maybe 20 "I love yous" and tons of "God bless yous" HAHA. She was still worried that I wouldn't say my prayers and said that she will send a nice shirt for me. Same everytime lol. 

I could only imagine how she'd react if she knew about Gta 6. I'm lucky the call didn't disconnect and reconnect followed by more worrying.

Now there are around 9,000 online in this section with 50 comments already haha.
Is this just a "teaser" or will we get game logo or screenshot about game that means "teaser"?
after months of schizo posting this sub has finally won
I only come here to check the News if something "new" or "interesting" is up... but THIS... omg ... i did not excpect that😍😍
Holy shit, it's happening stay the fuck calm
THE WAIT IS JOEVER
I literally started crying after reading this post
lets bust a nut together for gta VI bois
Holy moly history
IM GONNA HAVE NO JOB, NO MONEY, NO FRIENDS, NO FAMILY, NO CAREER, NO BITCHES, NO HYGIENE, NO SOCIALISING, BUT GUESS WHAT?


IMA HAVE GTA 6 😭😭😭
Watch them show some crazy shit on the trailer and make us feel like the leaks were nothing
ALL GAMERS DEFCON 1, WE'VE TRAINED FOR THIS. JUST LIKE THE SIMULATIONS!!
As a 40 year old this may be the last gta release in my lifetime. A special moment!
We're close to driving by the modern Vice City beach with the sun setting, boys.
Finally, no more hopium/copium
They are doing things different for VI. Cant wait
I just came in my pants
its been an honor
Used to pray for times like this
At least one of us is going to die before GTA6 comes out. 

Not it
10 fucken years god damn all our lives have changed during this time shit is sad
This better be an iteration on the franchise that takes everything they've learned and done well from the previous games and makes it even better

I'm still sad about Volition's saints row reboot, here's hoping Rockstar, the company that inspired that series, still knows what it's doing
Man we’re starving so bad lmao
WE'RE GOING HOME FELLAS
Holy shit it's fucking happening!!!
good job, gentlemen. we can finally rest easy now
Bro I'm lost for words for real
IT'S TIME TO GO BOWLING!
Rockstar gonna break the internet.All aboard the hype train 🚂!!

What a time to be alive.
GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS AAAAHHHH
YO WHAT
Finally announced and will most certainly de-fucking-liver
We annoyed them so much that they just caved 😂
What a lovely day
We made it OMG FEELS SURREAL
*drops dead from excitement*
Just fell to my knees in a Cluckin' Bell
I was working in the office, now I can't stop shaking... I've been waiting too many years for this moment. 

Thank you Rockstar, unlike many, I've stayed with you
AFTER EONS OF LEAKS, ITS HEREEEEEEEEEEEEE
IM CURED FROM STAGE 7,000 CANCER HOLY FUCKING SHIT
We really got a GTA 6 trailer announcement before GTA 6 smh
guys, that tweet is literally skyrocketing wtf
Video games, in specific categories, has been released from now or after the actual release will be compared to GTA 6. This will set the standard going forward and my god we need it... Developers over the last decade have been lazy. The call of duty franchise is basically super expensive DLC, Cyberpunk wasn't finished (although a marvel of a game now) Starfield is a prime example... all that promise for a game that feels like it was released 5 - 10 years back.

I have a feeling this game will break everything!
Okay so I'm just as happy as all of you, but don't you think they could have done it in a more exciting way instead of just telling us?  
Like, with RDR2, they did it so cool by changing the color palette of their social media to the pallet of RDR2 and slowly teased us with screenshots that got us drooling until the trailer was released. It was a lot like how Bethesda announced Fallout 4 in 2015 which was done masterfully and got the whole world excited.  
But with GTA VI....in 2022 they just posted a tweet saying "btw the game is in development" and then today just.. tell us when the trailer is going to be announced..? Boring. Imagine if they changed the pallet on their social media or website, posted a countdown, or did an ARG I dunno ANYTHING to make it more exciting. I wish they never announced it in 2022 because it ruined the mystery.
Gentlemen, this clearly shows, with enough schizoposting you can get anything done.
WE WERE BOYS 10 YEARS AGO 

NOW WE ARE MEN LFG
Really hoping we get a countdown a little while before the trailer. IV and V had it. I just wanna know exactly when the trailer drops. Today was a super-historical moment but I just don't wanna go through the whole "it's today right?" and the disappointment that follows once again for 10 days. I hope later this month we get a countdown just to ease my mind

still tho, HYYYYYYYPE
The fact that they refuse to openly talk about GTA VI but they keep mentioning it as the “next” GTA is interesting. And once again Schreier being the real leaker.
Well, in a month, we'll finally get to see a piece of what's been cooking!

Honestly, I hope it's a current gen exclusive. By the time the game releases, it deserves to be. No disrespect to last-gen users, but this game SHOULD be a masterpiece. I want to have my PS5 worked like it hasn't been so far!
I poked my head out of the gutter for one freakin second and fate shovels THIS in my face!
Wtf? I had just lost all hope after all the shitshow the past month
I AM SO FUCKING WET HOLY SHITTTTTT I GET TO PLAY AS A WOMAN IN A GTA STORY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
We got a official GTA 6 announcement before GTA 6. 💀

Oh my God!!
FINALLY
Just leaving a message to be here in eternum
I don't know what to say
I was here in this historic moment
Currently adding a ps5 to the Christmas list
It's hard to believe after months and months of leaks, even though it's Rockstar Games itself. Anyways, looking forward for the trailer!
clean up on isle 9 i just came everywhere
im so hard rn
screaming and vomiting hoping this isn’t a sick joke
Please Rockstar breed me
i need to go change my pants, its not stopping…
‪I’m in disbelief, I can’t believe we’re finally getting a look at GTA 6.‬
so isnane to me that after all this time and a truly historic amount of hype, they just announce the trailer in a corporate-formal tweet. no imagery, no logo, just a trailer release window and a message from Houser. 

I'm too excited to feel let down -- it's just marketing, who cares -- but this is not what i expected this day to look like lol
10 years of coping finally over holy fuck I can finally rest
I always dreamt of these days , now we are finally here !!!!
i really didn't expect to feel so hyped by just an announcement
 
what a time to be alive
I’M DYING
I WAS HERE! let's see how revolutionary this game will be.
Waiting for YouTube notification: GTA 6 Trailer now
Nov 30th is gonna be followed by Nov 31st and then 32nd and so on. No December for us.
my heart just stopped its like my crush proposed to me holy wow.....i am mad
at work just jizzed my pants, taking the day off🫡🙌🏻 happy humpday fellas
I had no more hopes for an announcement this year, at least it got me by surprise, AND IT WAS FUCKING GREAT, LETS GOOOOO!
Everyone is so f***ing hyped and it’s awesome
That post made me fail NNN😭😍
Okay y'all better be listing those 'leakers' that predicted this correctly so we keep an eye on em.
Jesus Christ be praised!!!!
Ah it feels like the good old days when the first trailers of Vice City, San Andreas, V came out. Feels good.
Edging complete
I don't even like GTA stuff much and I'm still hyped!
Well I apologise to Jason for doubting him
I’m do excited that I will edge to this post😭😭
This is gonna become the highest liked gaming tweet again isn't it for a month before the actual trailer breaks that again lol.
They called me a MADMAN..
THE MADMAN DID IT ON A WEDNESDAY
Next grand theft auto: GTA IV Remake, coming PS4 2024
Finally we are heading back to Escobar International Airport, Florida :)
I wonder what song I'll be listening to over and over again? Can't be much better than Ogden's Nut gone flake!
I HAVEN’T FELT LIKE THIS ABOUT A FUCKING VIDEO GAME IN MY LIFE
Bout to bust the largest load humanity has ever seen
God is great GOD IS GREAT
Finally, this community can be sane again
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't stop fucking smiling, we did it guys! RIP to those who didn't make it.
"GTA 4 - The Mobile Game" let's gooooo! /s
*GTA Mobile*
This screams trailer wasn’t ready on time for October and this announcement was released in time just before a earnings call.
Just went 6 to midnight
Can't wait to spend thousands of hours in this one.
Fucking hope this is not another one of my dreams
About fucking time. I hope this won't be like a 2 year wait post trailer until it's released like GTA V was. That was a killer.
Imagine touching that Grand Theft Auto 6 hard copy. 🫨
Ya'll gonna be disappointed when it's GTA: iOS Edition.
I was here. So its official. GTA VI will come out earlier than Half Life 3. Lets see how the trailer is gonna be.
man for years on end GTA 6 was always just this rumor and speculation and now it’s getting an official announcement
Pisswasser
THE CRAZE IS FINALLY OVER... but I still hear voices in my head
So fucking happy, congratulations everyone!
Will to live prolonged for at least one year.
So you can tell everybody... ‼️
Good to know it's still Sam houser, which means the plot will be really cool, if it's anything like the previous games he's done
Thank youuu, thank you so muuuch 🥺, this just might be what I need to buss 😫cause im bussin 😩
i remember when gta5 trailer came out when i was a kid and was reading everyone in the yt comments go crazy about how incredible the games was going to be... gta6 here we go
Holy freak my balls hurt. It’s finally joever 😭
Some or us didn’t make it along the way. Lets pray for them and not forget them. We are lucky to be here and witness this. Thank you rockstar. You truly are a Rockstar!
Alright, who's making the gta7 reddit
They can't do that, they're in development hell remember?
The end of an era for this sub. 

It’s been an honor folks!
We need a “I was here II” tag 🤣🤣
This is already the most upvoted post in this subreddit
This is like the queen dying all over again. I just never thought I'd see the day.
I can smell Mutahar pissing himself from here
lmao Zelnick holding a gun to Sam Houser's head to make this bs announcement (ruining the trailer reveal) before the earnings call.
I'm literally crying rn 🥹😭😭

THE GODS HAVE LISTENED!!! THANK YOU!!N
I may have to finally go next/current gen now
Isn’t it weird how we’re calling it an announcement? Wasn’t it announced last year?
I sold my Xbox Series X this summer. You patient gentlemen already know what I will be acquiring again, solely for this masterpiece of a game. It is time.
I already told everyone important in my life that when this game drops, you won’t be hearing from me for a while and don’t try to contact me. I’ll be busy.
Rockstar, listen to me good. Y'all fuc this up, and I'm immediately calling Trevor on y'all!!
The top 2 most liked gaming tweets are both from rockstar games and are both about gta 6. Number two is rockstar addressing the gta 6 leaks. Number one is gta 6 trailer announcement. The fact that gta 6 trailer announcement became the most liked gaming tweet in LESS THAN 8 HOURS really shows how many people are waiting for gta 6 and how bad they want it.
Feels like the end of an era
Gaming history is being made 

I've always felt annoyed how I've never been able to truly take part in a release of a game that makes a huge impact but now I can! And not just any huge game, but one of the biggest to ever release so far
Lol it really was the glue that kept us together.
COULD WE GET MUCH HIGHER
THE WAIT IS JOEVER
trailer will hit 100 million views in 6 days, change my mind
Im excited
Hopefully NOT a console exclusive
In my mouth?
They'll just keep edging you. This is literally a teaser for a teaser.
Oh I’m sorry I though this was the bathro- BWUUAAAH!

Imagine the trailer begins with "Why did I move here? I think it was the weather" but in a very senile voice of Michael because it has been 10 years

OKAY, JUST ONE LAST SNORT TO CELEBRATE THIS HISTORIC MOMENT
Buying!

Waiting for the possible 24/25 release date discussion to sell
I expected everything and I'm still happy!
I hope your Dr appointment goes well and he will excuse your eating of excessive sweets for the upcoming pill that is GTA6
Literally. What great news to end my day with!
Me too
We were all here
GTA6: Tahiti
🫡🫡 I was here and the Hype starts noww!!
Obviously the mod pins his own message lmao but I can’t be mad
It's been an honor.
YES! Any chance us old members who weren't old enough for other flairs could get a flair for being here for this?
Original GTA's were like 2 years in between releases. GTA IV took 4 years, GTA V 5 years, GTA V was released 10 years ago...
**WASTED**
pissing myself
Yes
😭😭😭💦💦
HELL YEAH BROTHER, CHEERS FROM IRAQ!
On god I can’t believe it’s been a whole 3 minutes since gta 6 was announced and there’s still no news on gta 7
r/GTA7
Probably 2030ish I really don’t believe this will be the last GTA game I honestly feel like that’s a stupid thing to say when GTA literally makes Take Two and Rockstar money.

It’s so weird and bizarre that people will look at this and say GTA 6 will “be the last game” lmao 🤣 hardly
Rockstar never fails to disappoint 😔
So was I
It'll blow up
Imagine if the trailer reaches something crazy like half a billion views in a few weeks.
It should only play first for 2023 announcement believers.

Anyone who said the Trailer would never come out this year have to wait last. That should alleviate server traffic.
so fucking real
Let’s hope WW3 doesn’t happen before GTA6 releases.
Now I have a bad feeling I won't make it to December
Bro i almost died from covid and all i was thinking about is gta 6
More like 4 years

They did in a certain way. They said that next month is  25th anniversary. And so on
They also didnt say 6. Just "Grand Theft Auto"
This Subbreddit is hard and wet right now!
We are THE gta subreddit now
very early bro
I think its weird to say GTA6 before the game is even revealed yet. This is just a tease, theres no logo/art yet or any description of the game.
What if it’s just called Grand Theft Auto: Florida
GTA V 2
I was thinking the same thing. I am not sure if this is usual for R\*, but my other thought was it might be named "VIce", I saw some concept art with that name, and thought maybe they are being vague about calling it GTA VI because they want this new name to be a surprise? Idk
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City 2
Rightly so
YEAH!!! Wait..who’s joe!?

Dude for real! Being old sucks but I’m so grateful that I got to play the first GTA ever when it released. I remember the day I bought it even. Incredible how far we have come.
Same bro, I remember getting gta IV for Christmas back in the day, I was excited as hell, but my pc was actually too weak to run it. I was real sad then, but later on I got an xbox 360 and I had the chance to play it through. I might just cop a ps5 for this one though. Cheers!
We didn't lose Jope
Get in the car and lay off the fentanyl loser, GTA VI just got announced
We’ve been waiting years for the wait to officially begin… again
JaSON?  More like JaDADDY
We all did probably 🤣
Hi
Because to refer to it by it's actual name is to announce it and they don't want to do that in a newswire post. 

This is the biggest entertainment product in the history of mankind. It is literally sacred, holy. They want to take it step by step and give it the respect and honor it deserves. This isn't just another yearly call of duty. This is a game that will *revolutionize* gaming once again, be a major part of peoples lives for another decade plus, and make more money than every other game in history excluding minecraft.
Calling it Grand Theft Auto would sound pretty stupid, given the fact how this ain’t from a different universe if we’re going by the leaks

They do reference “Jay Norris is dead” it would make more sense to call it GTA 6
I find this interesting and a bit odd too. Jason Schreier has reported that it will indeed be called "Grand Theft Auto VI", but why won't Rockstar acknowledge like that? This is the third time they've referred to it simply as "the next Grand Theft Auto". I'm very interested to find out why.
Goddamn hope so, it would suck if it’s a 2025 release.
cap, they said #GTAV and then dropped a trailer a week or two later
Let them tears out my boy we made it !
Ya know I've never bought any game at more than the base price. But I think I'll go with your plan as well.
Whats tonight
Remember remember the 8th of November
FUCK YEah
i'd kill myself
Unfortunately yes, wake up jimmy, you've been in a coma since 2013, please wake up.
It’s a trailer so will likely showcase the new map and give some context of where it’s set and what themes the story will likely follow, plus what the new logo will look like. Both reveals for GTA IV and V followed this trend.
They could still do those things leading up to the trailer release. They didn't give us a specific date, after all. I can definitely still see them setting up teasers like that in the final few days before the trailer.
I guess it might be because of the incredible hype for this game that an exciting way of announcing it is not necessary. Plus, cat's out the bag for GTA 6 with the leaks anyways.
Its 10000% current gen exclusive no doubt about that part lol
Indeed. End of the guessing game
Nah, the real end will be when the game comes out and we start thinking about GTA 7
Yea this is definitely gonna break every record in gaming, I have surgery December 1st if I die ima be so heated I can’t play GTA 6 bruh

Update: I’m shook I might die so I moved it out another week these mf better drop that shit in the next 7 days tho lmao new date Dec 8th!!!
It was. Same thing happened with the tears of the kingdom subreddit before the game was revealed. I’m gonna really miss the sense of community we have before the game is officially shown off. I know that when the game is out no one will be in this subreddit like we are now.
SOOO HIIIIIIIGH
Thank you for keeping this legendary album alive!!!
ITS FINALLY JOEVER BOYS! WE BACK
WE'RE BARACK
I give it a day.
Probably quicker. I'd guess three days.
I mean a fucking mrBeast video gets it in that time. It will probably hit 100 million in 12 hours.
The GTA 5 trailer didn't even hit 100 million in 12 years, chill out 😭
More like 6 hours
And you just can't hide it do ya?
its already joever bro, its going to be a console exclusive for one year.
Y’all boys a lil bit to excited 💀
no mine
Lol that would be funny.
Black screen. "Why did I move here? I guess it was the weather." Immediately after that Michael says: "God, this is crap! We have to change this line..." And in the first scene we see older Michael with a script in his hand working on his new movie set in Vice City. Now that would be a funny way to start a trailer.
"why did I move here? I guess it was politics"

Talking about the Californian exile
"Why did I move here? I think it was the-" *gunshot noise*

The main villain of GTAVI kills Michael. It'd be a hell of an introduction.
I would honestly like that xD
did you just called a 50 y/o senile
You mean unlike that "leaker" Tez2 who predicted GTA 6 trailer to drop last year in an ufo.
This guy stonks
Me too
So bummed that there was no mango harvesting level in the game.
We've been here for many months, friend. Subscriber count here about to go through the roof
Same
Haha, to be fair I was waiting since last hour, to post the announcement :)
>GTA V was released 10 years ago

Man, did they milk this game, what the actual fuck.
Shiterally
Creaming myself
Shitting my pants and ejaculating at the same time
😛😛
greedy ass company milking gta 6 for so long
Have some God DaMn FAITH SeismicQueef!!
I predict 2026 at least. /s
I heard gta 7 will take place on mars. 

Dont quote me on this though. Its just a unverified leak.
Fr we waited all this time and absolutely nothing?!
Subscribed!
I hope I'm alive for GTA 10
I mean the tweet has 84 million views after only 6 hours. And it isn't even a trailer. I think the trailer will break records
Man, I'd say there's a higher possibility of that's happening. Rockstar's X post has nearly 900k likes just after 3 hours of announcement!! The hype is real...
Luckily World Wars were developed by Valve so there won't be a third one
GTA6 will bet set post WW3.
Let’s hope GTA6 causes world peace
You’ll be fine it’s less than a month away. Making it to the actual release day, on the other hand …

Didn’t the copyright strikes of the leaked footage mention “footage of unreleased video-game Grand Theft Auto VI” or something? I personally think that’s it.

[deleted]
So people can talk about it, playing the guessing game etc. creates more hype. Good marketing
I saw someone comment on Facebook “2025 wouldn’t be that much longer of a wait” dude gta v came out when I was 13 I’m 23 now 😂
That first tweet linked to a logo and countdown for the trailer
good food
I remember that they showed IV's and V's logo before trailer
Nah, we can still try and guess what day in "early December" lol
Lmfaooo til 6 comes out. Within a week i promise a search for gta 7 rumours will give your results on youtube
We’ll meet again in r/gta7
Ive always said GTA7 will be out before they announce GTA6
IDK do you think that they'll milk gta6 for 20 years instead of just 10+?
It definitely will have a huge impact

Also don't worry the surgery will go fine and good luck with it! Report back to me after it so I know it went good lol
OH OH OH
SO BARACK
I'ma go with fitty in the first 24 hours, though I'll say I want you to be the one who's right in the end.
There are only two videos in the history of YouTube that have hit 100 Million views in less than a day, and both were music videos by BTS.

The best performing MrBeast video had 46 Million views after 24 hours, and that's the record for non-music videos.
Youtube was nowhere near the popularity level that it has now in 2011
There also wasnt an eternity between GTA 4 and 5. GTA 6 is long overdue
sorry, someone needs to explain this trend im seeing im of adding a J to the beginning of words.
Is this confirmed? I'm buying a console for the first time since the PS2 if it's true.
we can’t all share…?
Glad you aren't one if the writers lol
nah still mad they killed Johnny just to make Trevor seem tough
Why did I move here? I guess it’s because I was on the previous two generations of console so it only naturally meant I’d be on this one too
Me too
Or the general lack of sandboxy things to do like chop wood, mine. 

I just wanted to shepard some sheeps on a farm.
This announcement feels almost as impactful as an actual trailer and will sustain me though the rest of Nov.

Not a "SoonTM"

Not a "when we are ready"

But a clear, short, time-frame!

I'm appropriately excited for the reveal in a month now :D

Edit: Formatting
[deleted]
GTAVI will be milked for more, probably. They invested $2 Billion in this game, I am sure they will make it stand the test of time and the game will probably still be a marvel of game development 15 years from now.
Cumming myself
diversity ruining games again smh
We need to do our job there. Rockstar sees us and it’s because of us here that they announced the trailer.
This trailer is actually just for GTA 1 and 2 remastered
Finally getting that expansion baby
Tommy Vercetti refers to “Florida morons” in GTA: Vice City. Meaning the State of Florida is canon in the GTA universe. Which makes total sense btw.
Yeah I believe its gonna be called GTA VI aswell, its weird if it weren't, I was just speculating on the vagueness
DAMN RIgHT
Think it will hit 100m relatively quickly too. This is gonna be epic
yup. gonna be that much more impactful when they officially reveal it with its title graphic along side that trailer
I assume no later than the 7th. If they don’t release at the very start of the month then it will likely be at the Game Awards.
Now we have a new guessing game, when is launch date?
Release date 2120
Thanks homie!
CAN WE GET MUCH HIGHEERRRR

Yep - That's me - You're probably wondering how I got into this mess. It all started back on grove street - home.
I low key was mad at this too, and he was a crackhead
Yeah they made him look like a b*tch then had him get stomped to death. Really didnt like that for him.
Me too
Fine by me. Just PLEASE add some story mode DLCs like in GTA IV for fucks sake
Lmao
That's the 3D Universe, though. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the HD universe (*IV* onwards) is a separate timeline from the Trilogy.
No hesitation, immediately dropped their guess 💀
Dec, 7th the dropping of bombs on Pearl Harbor and the dropping of vi trailer.
What are you willing to wager?
A day that shall live on in infamy if you are wrong.
Exactly, trailers don't do much for me.  I knew the game was coming, we've already seen leaks, I'm hoping a trailer this year means we'll play the game next year at some point.
Tentative
Weird asf but once I thought I was dying (I didn't) and all I wanted was to make it to the release of GTA V. I didn't care if I died after 😂

I was 100 percent satisfied with that thought.

Glad to be here for 6, though. And, you'll be fine with the surgery. I had my first a few years ago. Nothing serious, but they put me under and I was scared about not waking up.

Who's to know if I ever did wake up? Maybe this is all a dying dream.
I FANTASIZED ABOUT THIS BACK IN CHICAGO
na son we swapping that shit. open up
Sounds like saints row 2 when you get Johnny out of the courthouse
HD is IV, CTW, V and 3D is III, VC, SA, A, LCS, VCS. But Vice City and VI's map will still exist in Florida the same way Las Venturas still exists within San Andreas and not a fictional Nevada.
This is the way

Elon musk says chess is a simple game and he has never been beaten… 
This is the only version of the video I could find. If you don’t know the person in the reaction video is Hikaru, he is one of the greatest chess players of all time.
Me when I Google En Passant. 💻🧠♟️↗️♙🧐
"There's no fog of war". 

Elon would legit compare a game that has been around for hundreds of years to Red Alert 2 if you asked him to.
When the kid asks, “Have you been beat?” 

I think Elon’s response was: “Yeah, it’s not like I won every game.” 

The subtitles at that part seem inaccurate.
Elon is so fucking stupid
This is like a textbook example of the Dunning Kruger effect 😂
Can‘t be beaten if you don‘t play
Must buy more tesla stock
What a knob
I could beat elon at chess.  Let’s do this.
The cringiest part for me was the comment about his laugh and his reaction. It reminded me of an only child first social interaction with his peers in kindergarten
How do we know this is Elon though?  I can’t tell who it is because his head is so far up his ass
I bet he doesn't even have 1000 elo.
Lest anyone think Musk isn’t a complete douche.
Elon just likes to say words that make him seem much more grandiose than he really is. He does not care about what they actually mean, just that it might "look cool" to one of his yes men.
This is the cringe for which I come to this sub.
God, he sucks.
So if Elon loses it’s because for others its a simpler game
It's good but is it World of Tanks good?
bro really said chess is too easy, there's no fog of war 💀💀💀 how are you not embarrassed saying some shit like that past the age of 13
If you don’t play, you can’t lose.
Surely this is one of those AI advertisements for a phone game?

Say something outrageous, get clicks, use influence to sell whatever he called that game Poly-something, probably generated by AI.

If real though… F
If you’ve never played, then you’ve never been beaten
Bro did not compare polytopia to chess. LMAO
I’m sorry but if this dude dropped dead I’d be stoked. I rarely say that but he’s a literal cancer to this earth.
I have to agree with Elon, chess is fundamentally a simple game.
Being that it’s from the time of Kings and nobles commanding troops in planned battle it has become outdated compared to modern warfare.
Which is why Bridge was a popular and more accurate strategy game during the first and second world wars.
It has all the elements Elon is missing, fog of war, not knowing the enemy’s capabilities, forced allies and foes and I believe is harder to understand than chess.

What annoys me the most about Elon is his stupid ramblings where he’s just basking in his own brilliance talking in vague technobabble.  His inability to concede simple concepts like he might not like chess become ramblings on his reluctance to learn a zillion moves and how future AI and tech will eclipse the chess world. He’s misunderstanding his initial premise that chess is a fundamentally simple game and that computer science has fundamentally used to build AI technology.  
Flippantly dismissing the game because he came to a conclusion that computers will get better than humans shows his ignorance on the past three decades of work that has gone into this field from Deep Blue to Stockfish.  I would say that computers were already better than the average human back when Kasparov was battling it out with Deep Blue in the 80’s but Elon’s always got to prattle on about vague future tech to make himself look smart.
It says a lot about how smart he really is when he thinks that StarCraft is more complex than Chess.

He’s really cementing his place in history as the thick persons intellectual
He's a very well known chess master, sorry, ment to say BS Master!!! What PoS this guy turned out to be. And at some point I was a fan! Shame on me!!!
>Have you ever heard of Plato, Artistotle, Socrates? Morons!
Ahhh. I said this to my chess friend!! Polytopia rules.  Chess is simple and I barely win. ;)
Also said he used to be one of the best Quake players.
"I am 14 and very smart"
Honestly who really cares? Elon Musk can love or hate chess and that doesn't really matter to me at all.
It is a simple game, like volleyball... It all depends on who you play against. Most people are average to poor at chess because it's not a popular game. A select few professionals could beat 99.99% of average people and a decent player can beat maybe 80% of the average players.
You can’t call this cringe if no one can prove he’s wrong
Not an Elon fan but I feel the same way about chess. The difference between an exceptional player and an average player is one who memorized thousands of openings and strategies. That does not sound fun to me
Why is this a screenrecord of a video reduced to 25% and some rando in the corner overlaid?


That is more cringe tbh
Me when I Holy Hell! 😇👼🧚🔥👹👿
2000-2100 rank chess man here. So I'm like amazing to most people, but struggle agaisnt actual good players.

Also consistent top 10 Advance Wars by web which is a turned based strategy game with FOW. Advance wars can be very very deep, tons of room for counter plays and surprises. But it's unit damage system is really hard to quantify in a competitive sense due to a small damage roll % that can cost games. Given the games economy, capture faze, and it's general gameplay, it's honestly much more predictable than chess in a lot of ways this goes for most TBS RTS games. RTS adds in apm and multitasking to the equation which often is more important than the base strategy. 

So there is a lot of cross over from chess to other games.

Chess is straight forward planning and its all on you. Your mistakes are your own. The amount of options are huge, and keeping a 3 or more turn prediction on course is very difficult. You have to spend an insane amount of time playing and researching to break into the top.

No other current game really has 1. The playerbase and 2. The history and huge game theory history of development that chess has.
[deleted]
Hundreds? Thousands!
Someone correct me on this because I find game design interesting but isnt fog of war a balancing thing that evens skill levels between players? It means theres now hidden information, which would increase the chance of a noob getting lucky.
Exactly, the title is saying the opposite of what Elon actually said. Elon is cringe enough, we don't need to spread misinformation about what he says to make him seem more cringe.
True, and there is inherent cringe in that moment. He makes chess sound like baby’s play in comparison to this other game and then is quickly humbled by the other interviewer’s reality check.

Elon: ‘Chess is easy as fuck, try adding more dimensions and hundreds more squares if you want an actual challenge that you’ll enjoy.’

Interviewer: ‘Damn, are you undefeated?’

Elon: “uhhhhsyheheiskxsm It’s not like I won every game”
yeah, he's also talking about how he played chess as a *child*, not his lifelong pursuit/career in chess. peoples' hate boners for Musk are what is cringe most of the time. i saw a comic the other day that implied that cybertruck owners deserve to die. like.. what? is that supposed to be funny?
But he's way smarter than the dipshits who think he's smart.
Remember when everyone used to love him? What a turn of events. This is pinnacle hubris. Fucking clown.
Maybe but the craziest thing you'll ever read in your life is that he's smarter than you are. 

It's almost funny, to have that realization that you know someone is stupid, but that they have a higher IQ and quicker mind than yourself.
Good bot
Honestly he makes a great example of a lot, including supposed meritocracy that's actually 'I know a guy'
Kasparov "Chess is mental torture." Musk "Chess is a simple game." One of them is not very good.
No he said the game is simple... which it is, the most complex move is en passant. its very easy to teach even 5 yearolds how to play lol.
Seems to be a recurring theme with billionaires who are surrounded by yes men. They become convinced that they’re geniuses. Rather than saying “yea I don’t really like chess”, he has to couch it with something  about how it’s too simple and AI is better at it. Hey Elon, AI is better at everything!
Starcraft is more complex than chess, in the same sense chess is more complex than checkers or tictactoe. Starcraft is much less of a solved game than chess is.
I’m truly a middle of the road, intermediate level player. Learned as a kid, didn’t play for years, took it back up in college, played ever since.

It’s a game with simple rules, but it’s not a simple game. I find the thing that really distinguishes it though is that literally every stupid person has an opinion about it. You have confirmed this with your comment.
The game is objectively complex, regardless of who you’re playing. There’s an infinite number of move combinations and a human is only capable of calculating a handful of combinations at a time. Unless you’re Elon musk…
"simple game" "not popular" what world are you living on lmfao
That is hikaru nakamura, he is one of the greatest chess players of all time. He is reacting to the video of Elon saying chess is simple.
Are u telling me there is an advance wars currently active online version and I didn't know about it? Cuz if so and u can show me the way, you'll make my day.
Chess master AND old school RuneScape enjoyed? A man of high culture I see.
I love chess because there is zero excuse you can use if you lost. If you lost it was your fault. No lag, no glitches, no "my controller wasnt working" bs.
I heard the guy who invented chess actually based it on Red Alert 2
It also just artificially raises difficulty against AI opponents, just making sure you can't see their moves.
He says that because he is comparing it to something like starcraft which has the tech tree, fog of war, etc. he talked about. So the game is simple in an uninteresting way not in an easy way.
tic tac toe is easy but i haven’t won every game. you’re stupid and it’s unsettling
Saying it's simple doesn't mean he is saying the game is easily mastered. He's saying it's not overly complex 

>Chess is easy as fuck

He never said this.

But chess is relatively simple for a game. The rules are not difficult to comprehend, it's why so many children can learn the game from a young age.
They have to own a cybertruck.  No need to pile on.   The damn thing isn’t even a truck.
That is the problem, isn’t it? He’s yet another dumb person’s smart person.
👅🥾
You got something on your nose. I'd wipe it off but I don't want to touch Elon's shit
that's such a meaningless thing to say. It's simple to learn but has a near infinite skill cap when it comes to mastery. You can say soccer is a simple game compared to certain other sports but that means nothing. there's still levels to the game and no matter how smart you think you are you aren't beating the pros without devoting your life to it like them.
Chess is very simple compared to the kinda RTS video games that are on PCs these days. That doesnt mean its easy just thats its easy to learn and follow.
> I find the thing that really distinguishes it though is that literally every stupid person has an opinion about it. 

Its like art in this regard. One of those horrible topics to bring up at a party.
It's a simple game. Everything I said is true. You are confused because you don't like Elon Musk. I don't care about him in the least, I'm talking about CHESS. Y'all are obsessed with him so you can't differentiate.
"But there's no tech tree."
Chess players use heuristics and strategy models. They don't brute force all the possible combinations.
Not infinite just real large.
Simple in that a child can easily learn to play, mastery is another thing.p
There’s infinite number of “moves” in most games. The respect chess gets has more to do with lasting legacy than being the most complex or skill intensive game. Elon is pretty regarded but I somewhat agree with what he’s saying.
The game objectivity is simple, it only becomes more complex when you introduce theory and variables to it.
All the kids and adults are playing it... 🧠🧠🧠

Hell yeah man, super active community with ranks, small maps, absolutely massive 10 person maps, and everything.

Also tons of replays to watch high level players Slug it out. Though I recommend downloading the replays and using a third party replay viewer.
My adhd taking me places. Lol
Exactly, I don’t like Elon Musk but this whole video is a whole lot of nothing. It’s worrying reading the comments where people have just invented their own narrative… and it’s not even AI.
Tic tac toe is a solved game unlike chess
There is a huge difference between chess and tic tac toe
Can you read? No one said they've won every game.
You’re going to speak on someone else’s behalf as if you’re certain?

Also I never claimed he said this. Note the use of apostrophe quotes, which mean ‘paraphrase/emotional summary’ as opposed to “direct quotation.”
its still simple... you can dedicate your life to any hobby and become unassailable to anyone else who hasnt dedicated similar time. You and everyone else in this thread are conflating simplicity with depth and knowledge because you think you are more intelligent than the richest person in the world, who is also self-made. The moves and rules of chess are simple. Every sport is even more simple thats why they are so popular.
Imagine simping for a man child billionaire so hard that you stop seeing objective reality and start believing the half wit things he spouts.

You're confusing the rules of the game with its difficulty.
How many possible move combinations are there by 6 turns in? Ten? 

The game is simple to people who do not think. Those of us that do think are aware of the staggering level of strategy that goes into that amount of combinations. 

You are not a smart person.
If chess had fog of war then maybe, maybe it would be as complex as Angry Birds.
Low skill floor, very high skill ceiling.
There's been a huge explosion in the popularity of chess in the past few years, to the point that even non-chess streamers have learned how to play and have events regularly, like pogchamps. Chess streaming and chess YouTube has also exploded, big tournaments are seeing record numbers quiet frequently. Chess is more popular today than ever.
Anywhere I can watch this?
Holy shit here I was thinking you were talking about the remakes on the switch, this has always been one of my favorite strat games I can’t believe I’m just finding out about this 😭
This is some weeb shit lmao
here i will break it down for u dummy… “game is easy does not mean i win every time. if i don’t win every time that doesn’t mean game is hard. is that explained slow enough for you ? damn child brain
The point they were quite clearly making is that a game can still be easy and yet still be difficult to win every single game, not that there are minor differences between chess and tic tac toe.
guy doesnt understand analogies. there is a reason everyone hates u reddit dorks
It's not an accurate paraphrase.

Saying something is 'simple' doesn't mean 'easy to master' it just means limited in scope.
again meaningless thing to say and it's clear the way Musk is saying it he thinks he's above the "simple game" of chess
There are vastly more combinations of moves in the types of games elon was comparing it to though.
On YouTube search:

Mangs, Deejus productions, Go7, and Humita AWBW.

All are entertaining to watch and informative for Advance Wars.
How is playing turn based strategy games weeb shit?
He's trying to teach you something new, and you keep trying to teach him something he already knows.

You're the child in this scenario.
if you've ever lost a game of tic tac toe past age 6 then you're dumb...
Tic tac toe is an easy game. Chess isn't
Where do you think you are my man?
Analogies draw comparisons between similar things for the purpose of explanation. You’re comparing apples and oranges. You don’t understand analogies.

I bet you don’t even know how to play chess.
Redditors are the biggest dorks in existence. There's a reason everyone, including yourselves, assumes you are all obese foedora wearing losers who never interact with women
That's fine if that's what he meant, but I can guarantee you, Elon doesn't know every rule in chess, unless he's followed the game seriosuly. Many people think they do, until you show them En Passant or a stalemate. Or they draw due to a repetition, or they touch a piece without moving it, or their opponent says J'adoube, or they promote to knight, or they try to castle through a controlled square etcetcetc.
That’s not unequivocally true though. You’re claiming your paraphrase is more accurate than mine, however you’re assuming you’re CERTAIN of the speaker’s intent whereas all I’m describing is how it comes across. I love how you can just decide for everyone that “simple” and “easy to master” are somehow not extremely similar though. Okie dokie, we can tell you want Elon to like you. He’s not going to be emailing you a car anytime soon, you can stop trying to bend logic and basic word definitions anytime.
He said he would rather play something more complex WOOOW what a horrible person he is for having a preference and an opinion in an interview. He never talked down on chess or the players, chess is mostly theory these days anyway untill like move 15 because of the simplicity of moves, i dont blame him. You're just a jelly hater and everything you've said is meaningless keep fighting the boogeyman.
Does that make chess a simple game though?
what is he teaching me exactly there genuisn
No one is disagreeing with that.
Do you understand how apples and oranges are similar? They are both fruits, for example. The guy understands analogies just fine. Chess and tic tac toe are both games so obviously they can be compared in that regard.
they are both games idiot. they are similar in the way that they are both fucking games ????? what are you even saying. i’m not comparing the fucking mechanics i’m comparing that just bc something is easy or hard that doesn’t equate to winning or losing every time. and i would whoop you in chess
also your little definition of “compare similar things” is wrong google the word. it’s a comparison of two things for the purpose of an explanation. you dense little pudgy ugly man
Oh shit he's bringing in his alt for backup. The irony in you calling other people 'dorks'. 

You can always just log out brother, no need to get so upset.
stop they are going to tell you that chess is hard !!!!
No you're absolutely right 

Changing simple to "easy as fuck" is certainly less of a stretch than taking the more literal definition of simple.
relatively? yes.
that tic tac toe is a solved game, meaning, you can purposely draw every time, so a terrible example as in this case it actually IS an easy game. Unlike chess. You just chose a bad example
Oh another person that needs an explanation. It’s about context and the idiot above was drawing an unnecessary and irrelevant correlation that has absolutely zero relevance to the subject matter. This entire comment thread is discussing Elon’s assertion that chess is an easy game. In terms of difficulty level there is zero comparison between chess and Tic Tac Toe. Chess is a game that is “unsolved” in terms of gameplay and is extremely complex, Tic Tac Toe is a game that requires the strategy level of a 3-year-old and any dimwit can play.

An analogy to prove that both are games is completely unnecessary. Everybody knows they are games, nobody is challenging that. That dude really thought he was bringing something to the table by pointing that out. And you do understand that the term “apples and oranges” refers to two things that are fundamentally different, right? That’s what that means. Tic Tac Toe and chess are fundamentally different in their difficulty levels, that’s the whole point of this discussion. To grasp at one single comparison - that they are both games, is pointless. You and him for some reason are so stuck on an irrelevant point and can’t seem to move past it to get to the context of what this thread is about.
Dumbass, the topic being discussed here is the difficulty of the game. That is literally the entire discussion. Nobody is questioning whether chess is a game you simple minded cuss. Maybe that was a groundbreaking discovery to you but it’s irrelevant to what this entire post is about.

Let me explain this to you so your underdeveloped brain can understand it: chess is an incredibly complex and difficult game. A game that has held up over the centuries because it’s considered “unsolved” in terms of gameplay. Elon claims the game is simple; it’s not. Your dimwitted brain then thought to compare Tic Tac Toe, one of the easiest and least complicated game in existence to compare to chess.

Does that make sense or should I explain it like I would for a fetus?
Is ad hom always your go-to after being called out on your dumb shit?
You do understand that words have multiple definitions, right dimwit? You cited one definition that wouldn’t even apply in this case and then completely disregarded the other ones that would. 

Google it again, rain man, read the second one; “a correspondence or partial similarity.” That is the type of analogy that would be relevant to this discussion. You embarrass yourself even more with every post, it’s astonishing really. Do you have a humiliation fetish or something?
I guarantee you’re a teenager and don’t even know the full rules of chess
“More literal” because you said it. You’re like a toddler who’s also a bad lawyer.
but i didn’t eat breakfast ass post dude. sorry you can’t extrapolate dork
Why are you making something so simple so complicated? The guy’s original point was simply that “a game can still be easy and yet difficult to win every time”, and gave tac tac toe as an example. You can totally unpack WHY this comparison might not apply to chess, but that doesn’t mean their comparison is an invalid analogy, since they are both still games. They were just showing how a game can be easy and difficult to constantly win, they weren’t even saying that this applies to chess. Sure, it’s a little irrelevant, but it’s not totally irrelevant. You’re being an obtuse asshole for the sake of it.
nice virtue signaling btw
i can attack both you and your shitty argument. small brain
keyword partial dipshit. which they do. they are both games. are you being dumb on purpose?
i would poop in ur mouth in chess
I suppose a toddler would assume simple necessarily means easy instead of limited scope
Ok, go on then. I'll wait.
You are dumb
Again assuming, thank you for proving my point :) I never claimed to define his words, only pointed out how they come across to others. But I don’t want to crush your dreams and point out to you that you don’t know everything…hmmm I guess you’ll have to figure that out on your own 🤷🏻 should come pretty easy since you can read minds
Brian Kilmeade asks Harris Faulkner if she makes 'Kool-aid"
Fucking Yikes.
She even made him repeat it and he doubled down 😫😫
"And did you steal this food?”
In fairness Kilmeade is as dumb as a hammer and coincidentally has the subtlety of one.
“No Kool-Aid?  Well, what about watermelon?  Fried chicken?  Malt liquor?  Crack?”
This is the "other species and other ethnics" guy.
Dunno what she was expecting working for Fox News...
What the fuck man
"Damn girl, I bet you can fry the fuck outa a chicken!"

I’m not American and I don’t really understand the connotation will kool aid? Is it specifically racist to say that brand?

The look on the little girl's face is priceless!

Interesting, I've seen this clip a lot and I assumed he was trying to make a joke about mixing the easiest and grossest drink to the high class chef, something she'd never ever make, and it didn't go over well. I've never in my life heard of Kool aid being a black thing as some comments suggest.

Haha, imagine.
Jesus. I was about to give him a pass, like maybe he had cool aid on his mind and it just came out at an awkward moment. But god damn, the rant about racial purity and other species is insane. Can’t even cut him slack for making a joke in poor taste, he’s just a classic fucking racist.
There is a stereotype that black Americans drink lots of kool aid. That’s why he asked, it isn’t something that anyone would ever ask otherwise.
Im American and I’m also confused. My white family regularly drank Kool Aid.
yeah i'm confused on this also
Racism.
Disagree this is cringe or what’s up
If you're not then you're playing dumb.
I had a neighbor growing up that called it “N***** Juice” so I’m sure in some places it’s a stereotype
It’s a stereotype.  I’m glad you were sheltered from it.
Its known enough that Dave Chapelle had an entire sketch about it called Purple Drink.
She's not a chef. She also has a show on Fox News.
Do yourself a favor and watch Dave Chappelle's first special: Killing em softly

Oh so he's *RACIST* racist... And not surprisingly, a complete fkn moron.
Oh... how does he still have a job?
"No Brian, do you people have Wonder Bread and Creme Soda?"
It's like watermelon in that everyone likes watermelon but for some reason that and Kool-Aid are especially associated with a black stereotype. I wouldn't think anything of asking someone if they make Kool-Aid but the fact that there was *no* appropriate context for bringing up Kool-Aid in the middle of this cooking segment makes it pretty suspicious.

Actually *edit* I just watched it again and I finally understood why he might've asked it. She was talking about making this peach cobbler in the summertime. He's asking if in the summer she also sets the table with Kool-Aid which makes sense but nobody else understood why he was asking that.
Yeah it’s a stretch. It might be a dumb question but the insinuation here is that it’s racist. Which is dumb.
Damn, wtf. Honest question, where did you grow up?
Yeah, me too except I hope I've never said anything unknowingly that offended people. Kind of freaks me out.
I've heard Key & Peele talk about purple soda being a stereotype but never Kool aid. Til.
I've never watched fox and have no idea who she is. That was just my assumption watching this singular clip in like news blooper reels on youtube.

Imagine if they killed off Trevor in 6 like the did Johnny in 5
Especially since Steve Ogg seems to hate that he played Trevor
I think it would be funny for there to be a mission to assassinate a rival drug runner bringing drugs in by plane.. and you have to shoot them down and then they offhandedly mention his name was Trevor Phillips out of Los Santos, wouldn't even need Steven Ogg involved.
Why does Steve Ogg hate that he was Trevor?
i think its gonna be franklin making a cameo because he's the one who survives in all 3 gta 5 endings
Out of the GTA V protagonists, i can see Michael or Franklin appearing the most. Franklin, due to his business, which could appear in the game. But i can also see Michael appearing as a Movie producer seeking someone to do his dirty work to do a movie in Vice City/Leonida, as he can no longer do it due to his role.
It still hurts that Johnny died that way
That was fucked and totally uncalled for. They messed up imho, the pain was not worth it.
and they do it by bringing back the chainsaw
I do not blame Steven ogg for hating gamers look at what they did to the new resident evil actor for Ada they fucking harassed her so much she had to block her comments on Instagram

I think people forget that there’s a human and not a character that was made by writers
Mods are biased. They removed my same post citing it belongs to wishlist and now letting this post let go on reddit wall

Mods are biased.
That would be amazing
I don't think Steven Ogg hates that he played Trevor, he just hates how for so many people that's all he's known for with some people even calling him Trevor. Can totally see how that annoys the living shit out of some actors.
They won't.
[I’ve been saying this in this sub literally for months and I’ve been downvoted to fucking oblivion. Ironic how it’s a whole ass post now with an assload of upvotes. Fuck y’all lmfao.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6_NEW/s/anqH3l85z1)
This would be genius. I’ve always hated what V did to Johnny. Made him pathetic. I liked him in IV way more than Trevor in V.
![gif](giphy|l0zAiJHyg0fMA)

Its classified!
I feel like Steven Ogg wouldn't agree to appear unless he was a protagonist. he has some kind of resentment towards the character and GTA fans recognition of him in that role, but he also seems to be the time so motivated by ego that he wouldn't be able to handle being demoted from main character to peripheral supporting role.
It's gotta be Lester who bites it
As much as I love Trevor, I wouldn't be too upset if they killed him off.
we have the same cake day! lol
I sure as fuck hope not.
Ain't no way they'd go through the hassle of getting him back just to kill him. I only want characters to come back if they're side characters like Packie in V
They wouldn’t do that to a main protagonist.
Steven Ogg might hate it, but that role got him lots of other roles where he plays the same dude over and over: crazy person with selfish principles that carries a gun with a snarky, aggressive humor. Think Better Call Saul, Westworld, Walking Dead.
i hope they do, but dont make it to hype up a new character like trevor did to johnny, thats disrespectful to the fans of the murdered character. having him getting eaten by gators would be a funny way to send him off. 

suggest maybe he went to vice to hide, covid made him a recluse wild man and he gets caught by a gator
Good luck with that lucia
ngl wouldn't mind this, trevor's an ass (and his actor)
Honestly feel like Michale and Trevor will not be involved since they can both die in V. 

But if there was going to be a shocking death, I could see a scene where you drive through a movie set and run over Michale who is producing the movie.
Considering what Steven Ogg has said and done they might do it Mafia II style where it's not even a major event and he doesn't speak.

For those that don't know in Mafia II at a certain point you're in major debt so you do extra jobs and one of them is to kill the protagonist of Mafia I and it's done very casually and the protagonist of Mafia II has no connection to him.
It would actually fit Steven Oggs view on his character I think they should do it
Steve Ogg hates that he played Trevor? What happened?
He doesn’t hate Trevor, he just doesn’t want to be known as Trevor, he wants to be recognized as his other roles
He probably hates all the low-T gamers out there who only see him as Trevor and probably gets harassed in public. He hates the fame.
Florida Men can never truly die.
Im worried they're gonna kill Luis. I think he & Tony where going to start a new club in vice city right?
Steven Ogg would love that
Knowing Trevor he'd probably pull a D.B. Cooper and fuck off to a 3rd world country or something
It would be funny but I would feel sad I liked Trevor
I gave him his 3000 up vote!
That would be suitable because Trevor always gave off “Florida Man” vibes.
Wouldn’t make sense since I killed Trevor
Will he die, or would he go into witness protection like Michael did.
Ogg had a cameo in Broad City as a locksmith. The whole episode I thought, cool, he's playing something other than a Trevor type...
Until the credits sequence played.
Poor Steve.
Wouldn’t be surprised if his death was on the news or something. Trevor just seems like someone that has to die. His end game leads to nothing good imo, like he was an interesting character because he was insane and shit, but those people don’t last. Does he really even have a purpose after the GTA 5 story? His mental never got any better, I don’t see him living long.
Trevor won't appear because the players could have killed him in GTA 5.
A
Never reaygit into gta 4 dlcs so Johnny's death didn't seem like as big of a deal as i saw people making it. But reading this post makes me kind of understand it lol
I think the next gtas best play is to avoid reusing any people and start fresh. If they killed Trevor there would be riots. People really love Trevor
Out of all remaining GTA protags, Trevor is easily the most likely to die. Ned and Shawn love the game, so they wouldn't kill Mike and Franklin. Luis probably went straight by now and i dont even think Rockstar has the stones to kill Niko.
Entirely possible, they don't even need Ogg for that since they can just reuse some Trevor dialogues from V.
Here’s hoping. Never did like the e character tbh.
Ah yes.. imagine them having no imagination and reusing the same trope from last game.
That‘d be dope. Trevor should just drop dead. Maybe by choking on a human thumb he ate or something like that. His craziness became annoying as f real fast.
Can somebody explain to me why Steven Ogg doesn't like people calling him Trevor? He's like one of the best GTA-hilarious character in franchise.
I’d cry
Welp id just restart the game and just stop doing the main stuff because I’m not killing uncle t
God I fucking hope so, as the years go on I’ve grown to really dislike him as a character.
That would be nice. Never liked this psycho.
I'm always puzzled when I see people who are upset that Johnny was killed off. He was such a boring character. My guess is that Rockstar realized he was a mistake and decided to erase him. As for Trevor, you might hate him, but at least he is not a boring character
Yea it could work like Harrison ford came back for Star Wars just to kill off his character
Yes - every johnny fan
Trevor would never go to vice city. Think after 5 he's staying in sandy shores
"GO FUCK YOURSELF"
I wouldn't mind if they did it with Niko, since his voice actor said he wanted Rockstar to kill him
i mean.... you can already do that in 5..... right?
I'd be okay with it. Trevor is a walking disaster to everyone and everything around him.
Lmao I fucking hope so
I hope they do
I honestly hope so. I fucking hate Trevor. He's like if a 13 year old wrote a GTA character.
Good because Trevor is a horrible unlikable character
I hope they do.
I hope they do. Can’t wait to off that mid character
[deleted]
spoiler alert
I kind of despised Trevor so I’m good with that
I would love that because I hated Trevor.
Poetic justice
God please. It would be justice
The actor who played Trevor is an ass. Very disrespectful to the fans. I don't need to see him again.
It would be simply cathartic.
some people didn't like johnny. Everyone liked Trevor
[deleted]
I hope not, Trevor is much more important than Johnny
Didn’t he already die?
Who tf is johnny
What if GTA VI has 3 endings similar to GTA V

A - Jason turns Lucia in as he's been undercover all along

B - Lucia kills Jason after finding this out or

C - Jason switches sides and they go after their enemies..?
Dax >>> Trevor

I actually hope Dax is the new Trevor Phillips and some lines Dax said were actually meant for T, I'm mixed for Trevor, I agree that he wrongfully killed Johnny off that was a dumb move 

I DON'T want Michael or Franklin killed off, Trevor is basically Deadpool, he's full of shit but had a bad childhood but kills anyone if they piss him off or do nothing but he's loyal

I know T didn't kill Debra and Floydd, T was trying his best to convince Floydd to man up and defend himself against Debra and somehow without knowing who Debra was, T KNEW what kind of person Debra was and understandably hates the city of Los Santos (full of fake people which I relate too), it's obvious T was just in the middle of Floydd and Debra's violent argument and T was unarmed, D and F killed themselves so I'm assuming Trevor was upset and wanted to comfort Floydd which probably explains the blood on Trevor and feeling the guilt losing someone (I don't know why he didn't report it to the police BUT I think they would've  accused him if he had tried reporting it) 

But rather than kill off Trevor, just remove him from canon lore and have Dax replace Trevor aka reboot him as Dax for online or story DLC since Michael's FIB friend was originally meant to kill Trevor but stupid Brad got in the way and rightfully killed him instead)

I really like Dax, I loved his story mode for GTA Online (I actually sniped the enemies whiles stealing the lorry then blew up their vehicles so make it slightly easy lmao)

Michael (amazing and fave)
Franklin (also a fave)
Trevor (mixed)

So if Rockstar reboots Trevor and changes him to Dax, I wouldn't mind this
Karma
[deleted]
I want Luis to show up and get killed lol
Who’s Johnny again?
Since Gta 5 had different timeline and Trevor already die in one of them, i doubt it.
it's possible with the death wish ending being cannon. i hope he shows up as a smuggler tho
I only ever played 5, who was Johnny outside of being killed by Trevor?
How would that work if you had the option to kill Trevor in V story? Would he just come back from the dead to be killed off again?
Well considering the first ending for GTAV is the correct one, Trevor wouldn’t even be in VI.
Imagine if they did it how mafia 1 and 2 was where tommy got killed by vito then we play as him. Like if lucia or jason had a contract to kill michael, trevor, and/or franklin
There is a part of me that wishes GTA 5 just at the secret option c death wish one instead of the other ones. Trever was so loved by everyone that I feel like they could have done something but maybe it wouldn't even make sense because vice city is literally based out in Florida 😂
Johnny 5, you say?
Doesn't GTA V lack canon ending? So Trevor nor Michael can appear in VI
Wouldn't aline with the ones who already killed him in V tho
I told my brother that I expect this to happen. There will be a wild drig addict mission or something par for the course in Florida and we will have to kill Trevor.
I hope so. Either that or they retcon Johnny’s death.
My take you meet him in a shady motel do a quick mission like steal drugs or bike from the local lost chapter to come back and he dies from a heart attack shitting on the toilet and the PC like it smells fresh
I hope so. I hate them 3 guys from V
Well Trevor will die without uttering a word then because idk if there’s an amount of money available to get Ogg to play Trevor again.
Me choosing to kill Trevor rather than Michale had to do a lot with Trevor killing Johnny. I grew up always wanting for a MC game and I when rockstar delivered I was hooked. Regardless Johnny should’ve let Ashley alone.
I thought that too but I don’t think they would because of the option to kill Trevor at the end of GTA5. Now, Franklyn on the other hand……
Or even worse: Niko Bellic

Nah Trevor wont be killed, if anything he'll show up in 6 and kill someone
Personally I wouldn't mind as long as it's well written
Tp industries already had history with the latinos. Forget which. But im pretty sure he is wanted by the triads and not the haitians. Doubt he would make it big enough to be a main competitor in vice city. If we have government relations with the drug trade, then maybe he might get a mention. Given that trevor has more than enough beef with the government. Especially haines
I mean that would be a good thing. Trevor is dangerous to say the least.
He’s already dead. I watched him burn alive.
It’s only right
They should.
God I hope so. Trevor is the worst GTA protagonist imo
Never really liked Trevor tbh. They really did Johnny dirty
I'd gladly kill Trevor. He was my least favorite character
I just hope Trevor is in it
What goes around…
I was really confused why this bad ass from Liberty City just ate shit and had his brain stuck on Trevor's shoe.
It wouldn’t really work. What if you decided to kill Trevor in GTA V?
Trevor died in gta 5, it may not be canon but if you die in a  game u can't go back
It would work. This is fitting since R* don’t seem to be fond of Trevor  anymore. Maybe Jason / Lucia takes him on early on.
Nah they won’t
what if they made trevor an antagonist?
He dies of overdose that’s my guess
The almighty forgives, the lost don’t
#Johnny 5 is alive???

Sorry, disléxica.
Imagine if they reveal nico bellic and all three gta V protagonists having a mud orgy
I hope so, but I think the only GTA V protagonist to make a potential appearance would be Franklin because he doesn't die in any ending.
Yeah I hated that part. In fact I always wanted more freedom regarding choosing my actions
God I hope so
i wouldnt gaf kinda
Man I hated Trevor for killing Johnny
I hope that they do bring Trevor in as a side character from him expanding TPI to vice city
Maybe killing Trevor could be a daily quest. That way we can do it over and over. He is such a vile, vile character.
I would love this. Trevor is the easy joke. The Deadpool from GTA series.
Feed him to the gators 🐊
I liked the lost and damned dlc. Sucked to see Johnny as a junky.
I’ll never get over such blatant character assassination.
I mean nearly all the characters are pretty much dead except for blink and you'll miss it cameos.
We will have some GTAV characters appearing for sure. 6 happens a few years later after 5
Trevor is not in 6 lmao what are you on about
Honestly... That would be kinda cool lol as long as it was in a wacky way
Spoilers! I've not had time to to play 5 dude

/s
They could just make it so that the ending in which Trevor died is the canon ending
They are
what do you mean Trevor killed an imposter Johnny's still in Liberty City.
I couldn't believe how dirty they did Johnny, like yeh he was my least favourite protagonist, yeh tLaD was probs the most boring GTA (only one I've never finished), but I didn't know the developers felt the same
The only thing he hates about playing Trevor is that people only refer to Steven as Trevor
I think they steer wide of him tbh. It’s unfortunate how he feels towards the character but what can ya do
Who was Johnny to Nico again?
I think Ogg just wants to be known for more than just Trevor. But since he doesn't seem to have the chops for anything other than playing a variation of Trevor he's shit outta luck
That video of him talking to Jason and Lucia has to be one of the most hilariously pathetic things I've ever seen
I actually hope so
I will never understand why did they killed my man Johnny :(
We can only hope…
Jason kills trevor Phillips and takes his atv he got at the end of gta 5 .
Trevor is already dead though.
That'd be crazy. I can already see the theories of people trying to say he survived somehow lmao
I’m pretty sure Rockstar owns the rights to all those voice lines. Meaning they could cut it up and actually make it work if they wanted to especially if they have all the cut content recordings even the ones that never made it into the files for fans to discover by accident.
I doubt that will happen as Trevor basically gave up on his company and doesn't do all the crazy stuff he used to do anymore sadly, he basically abandoned mckenzie and sandy shores field. He's a "vinewood guru" now according to Ron. (If the newer GTA Online is considered canon to the storyline)
Steven Ogg has said tho recently he loved playing Trevor and would do it again if R* asked.

He doesn’t hate playing Trevor, he just doesn’t like only being known AS trevor.
Didn't they also do something similar for Avery Carrongton where Toni just shot him?
Hahaha damn this is actually brilliant. Really wish ogg would come back to cameo though, Trevor was my favorite character it sucks that he’s probably just gone
Kinda like in TBOGT when Evan dies we don’t see it (unless you play TLAD) we just get word that he died, they could do that. Some rival drug plane goes down and later it’s mentioned the driver was Mr. Phillips of Los Santos (could also mention sandy shores to confirm it or something)
Or at least have a half assed "TPI" painted on the side of the plane.
this is absolutely what needs to happen lmfao
Honestly I'd rather they not made either Ending A or B non-canon, I prefer all endings being canon like in GTA 4, it just depends what you picked.
I really feel like bro should just be happy about it, he's going to be a part of human history forever.
After the way Niko got slammed and seemingly killed off screen bc of Michael Hollick's behaviour towards R*, I'd say a scenario like this wouldn't be too far-fetched lol
I think this is funny because I think how Steven ogg has acted towards fans. This wouldn't be bad. But he is mentioned to be a life coach? Or Hippie kinda guy, and he.left Ron, so I doubt he is still actively running drugs.
It would kinda be how they killed off Avery Carrington in LCS, didn’t need Burt Reynolds’ involvement
Imagine how millions of people would react chasing a van for the first mission of the game before seeing the brief subtitles to kill trevor in bold red
They did this with Avery Carrington from vice city in Liberty city stories, Donald Love has you take out his former mentor and he just makes an appearance with no voice acting and I heard it was because of some fallout
Would even funnier if he talks to you during the mission and just keeps taunting you, getting progressively more pissed off
RemindMe! 2 years Read this
Oh man you would love playing Mafia I and Mafia II then.
I like this idea. If Rockstar wants to kill Trevor in GTA 6 or other sequels, they should do something like this.
As far as I can tell, he doesn't hate that he was Trevor. He just hates that people only know him as Trevor and always ask him to do wild shit
I think he hates that everybody only sees him as Trevor and not any of his other work
Because despite being in other projects this is the one people recognize him the most. So much to the point that I guess he would be seen as Trevor more as opposed to himself Steven Ogg.

idk but he made a couple videos since expressing his frustrations with the character
Steven Ogg is not a gamer, he doesn’t understand the medium or gaming culture. Steven Ogg’s aspirations is to be a working live-action actor. He views video games as a lower artform, he also calls it a “cartoon”. He doesn’t like how his work on GTA overshadows everything else he does. He had small roles in Better Call Saul, WestWorld & Walking Dead.

He’s getting typecast to the “crazy guy” roles. Which usually most actors don’t like getting typecasted.

Also fans keep calling him “Trevor” but don’t even know his real name. 

I see it happen to Ned Luke & Solo in interviews too with random YouTubers who are interviewing who keep calling them Micheal/Franklin as if that’s their real name. They have to sometimes remind them what their real names are, which I imagine can be annoying.

TLDR; basically Steven Ogg is like my dad, he’s stuck in the 80s and still thinks there’s a cultural stigma against video games, and doesn’t understand how mainstream & popular gaming is nowadays.
He got 35 rolls after GTA V. Before that, only 10 small parts.  He should be thankful for GTA. Rockstar made him.
Because fans call him Trevor Philips in real life. They post clips/screenshots of him from his movies and write Trevor Philips in the title and call him Trevor in video game conferences. He insists that fans call him Steven Ogg since that's his real name but fans disagree and hence he quit.
It's already canon that all 3 survive
all three of them are shown to have survived in GTA online
In the Casing The Jewel Store mission, Lester mentions “that crew from the south, they all went down” after mentioning the McReary’s and before mentioning Niko. I now feel like he’s mentioning Lucia and Jason or someone related to VI, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Lester shows up again.
R.I.P Johnny :((
Really did show that Trevor was a fucking nut job but it probably should have just been a side character and not a main character.
I struggled to like Trevor for a while after that tbh
Yeah im pretty sure seeing this scene early on in GTAV made me hate the game just a little more.  I couldn't stand Trevor, so sure, let's see him eaten by a gator or something.
I never played lost and the damed...so maybe i don't have a connection to Johnny like that...maybe rockstar set Trevor up to be disliked by the player because of that
Well he shouldn't have called trevor a motherfucker
To this day I am so fucking baffled by that decision? What was the point? It was so needless and completely out of left field.
💯
I think they did it to show how much of a lunatic Trevor is
"Cut here"
Killing trevor brutally with a chainsaw is something that i didnt think i needed until right now
Very true
I wonder if this is why they made r/gta6_new
Biased against whom? People called Grammar_Learn?
Mods are biased.
Yeah but that’s like Aaron Paul getting mad that people only know him as Jesse, and that would be more justified because he actually has major roles
But they should
Probably not, but maybe.
Lmao dam son. I thought the post was gonna get downvoted hard, but instead, I've got a bunch of people saying they hate Trevor wtf is going on man
Omg I thought I somehow glitched into a cyberpunk comment section reading “what V did to Johnny” lmao
Well Given that Steven has issues with the character, I could see Rockstar doing a casual "F U" Steven by having Trevor return and kill him off. 

No voice lines, no nothing, like the guy said, Maybe a plane crash or some other "No body" death. 

It would leave the community guessing what happened to Trevor, whilst also leaving a window to have him return should the situation change.
literally OP in that one reply
Is this why Trevor has to go on the run again after a heist in gta online? I’m trying to think if Ogg has had any new voice lines to record since that update, but I’m drawing a blank.
He doesn’t need voice lines
I agree. If I had to choose, I'd keep him alive.
Why’s the actor an ass? I don’t follow him
How’s the actor an ass
I should have written it better. It might not be so much that he hates the he played Trevor, but rather that people only know him as Trevor. I think he wants to be more than JUST Trevor
That's fair, lmao. I could see it getting old pretty fast
![gif](giphy|1tx0ifZmIZLEzPYo9T|downsized)
Witness protection for what?! No one was convicted of anything!
Yeah. That's exactly what I said.
I'm not sure doing something once qualifies it as a trope.
Top comment had a great idea about killing him by shooting his plane down, unique and fitting in my opinion
First, he’s an actor, his name is Steven, people like being called their name. As for what I think you mean by, it’s the same reason Daniel Radcliffe didn’t like Harry Potter, you’re forever immortalized as your character. 

That kind of fame may be the dream, but at the same time, you’re kind of stuck with the name and association, which will affect your casting in the future, due to getting typecasted. Actors are artists, and while doing the same thing all the time is a steady gig, maybe you don’t wanna play a funny psychopath.

Lastly, he probably got a raw deal in a lot of ways, you don’t get royalties every time someone plays or watches a stream of GTA5, so inspite of the fact that the game has been printing money for the last decade, and its billion dollars in 3 days, he may feel like he was underpaid, especially in light of any challenges the role has given his career
You're not supposed to like him. Sounds like rockstar did good if you don't
I like Trevor. He's fun to play as. But yeah I see your point. I never cared about Johnny either.
And to think 4 wouldn't get any more sadder
>I wouldn't mind if they did it with Niko, since his voice actor said he wanted Rockstar to kill him

I'm pretty sure they've already heavily implied that Niko's dead, haven't they?
Niko is a character that fully deserves closure. If they brought him back, id be fine if he died but it was for a cause he believed in, like a redemption. He was an awful person but he had the potential to be a good man.
Yeah but it’s not canon.
It came out in 2013 man I don't know what you want me to say
Yeah, it came out 10 years ago
I mean the dude just doesn't want to be seen as a one trick pony? He doesn't want his whole career to be defined by it. 

Given the right amount of money he would 100% voice him again. Dude is not THAT rich.
Cry about it
He is? I had no idea he hated being trever. What’s happened?
I met him, he’s actually pretty nice, I think he’s just tired of acting like Trevor for people after it was done like 10 years ago
That's kinda what I thought when I was making this post, but I've seen a ton of people saying they didn't like him AT ALL. 

I like Trevor quite a bit. He's fun to play as, but the dude is a super-degenerate if we're being honest.
I thought deathwish ending was the true ending
he isn't..? he is mentioned in GTA Online. if you own the Agency an employee will mention a crazy guy that asked for Franklin and tried to take a shit.
I hope we get more than 3 ending choices. I hope game play choices affect the outcome of the storyline.
Man, I don't want to ever see that Dax guy again.
Pretty sure the Canon ending of V is that Franklin doesn’t kill Michael or Trevor, all 3 survive.
He did not die. Ending C is canon ending anyway.
why
Deathwish was confirmed as the canon ending by GTA Online
He was the protagonist in the story DLC for GTA IV. Johnny was a senior member of the Lost MC in Liberty City and the story mimics the show, Sons of Anarchy.
Shooting Trevor’s plane down would be kind of neat though because “did Trevor survive?” Would always be a mystery embedded in the GTA lore.
I mean *this is trevor* were talking about, mf is harder to kill than a heroin charged chimpanze.
It's like how I tried to think that Johnny wasn't dead, he just suffered major head trauma and basically became semi brain-dead and paralysed, not to the point of losing speech skills but somewhat reduced intelligence and also handicap like Angus. We all know that ain't happening tho
Damn, the voice actor for Trevor hated playing the dirtbag character? That’s unfortunate. I loved Trevor’s storyline though I understand having your voice attached to his personality may suck
Denial, that is the first part of the grieving process brothers! Now let’s all hold hands.
It would be a reasonable assumption
To be fair, a plane crash wouldn’t kill Trevor lol
You just get killed by trevor in the end game credits lol
Trevor jumps out with a parachute and flips them off
They can’t say he somehow survived. It’s not Star Wars
I get Steven has an issue with people calling him Trevor out in public, but is there anything else that I am missing? Why wouldn't they bring him back? I am sure he is not THAT expensive for a company that dropped 300mil on a game? 

Like unless there is something else going on, I am sure for the right price, he will legally change his name to Trevor Phillips not only return to voice the character.
i don’t think the man would be okay using his voice lines again unless he’s getting paid an outrageous amount. take two has an army of lawyers, but that would just be begging for a lawsuit i think

idk the laws towards unapproved usage of voice lines though so i could be talking out of my ass
Oh god, he's got a cult now? The things he must make them do...
I enjoy seeing him when ever he pops up in movies or tv shows
Yeah it was a mission in LCS, cold as fuck but Bert Reynolds is a prick so it's fair enough
Lol why do you think Mike made all the jokes about the amount of weapons he took off him
even though he actively does wild shit both in real life and as his other characters in TV shows.
Someone asked him to read something as Trevor on one of his cameo videos and he was such a jerk about it lol I don’t get it. They’re literally paying him to make those videos and he complains
If he didn't play Trevor people probably wouldn't know him at all.
He's the video game version of Harrison Ford. Man hates that he's mainly known for Han Solo and hates being asked about it because he has a huge career of many other films.
I would get that too. You know people look at them like a crazy insane person like he’s like much more than that and he did a lot of TV shows. It would be crazy for that if anybody looked at me like that.
I'm not Steve Ogg, but I hated being Trevor.
it's not our fault that GTA 5 is his biggest role
I wouldnt be mad people recognize me for the job that made me famous to begin with, annoying that its THE only thing they know me for? well... yeah, maybe, but its the thing that in fact made you famous, and its the one that paid the bills, and its the reason you also got more jobs, i dont get it.

But to be fair, theres a lot of artists, actors or famous people in general that are known for that _one thing_ and they always seem to end up hating it, so i guess its a semi unique thing that only they can feel and understand, i think i wouldnt hate it, but then again, i dont have that one thing lol
it’s funny that he’s frustrated with that association because the only other role ive seen him in is in a single episode of Better Call Saul. and his character in that episode is essentially live action Trevor Philips
Some of the interviews I’ve seen with Steven have been thoughtful, but also a little bit obsessive. He’s a very interesting guy.
i mean why those actors cant understand it means they atually did a great mf job on the role where people identfy them in real life as that char they not all meryl streep
I'm sure he's using his millions of dollars to wipe the tears away, boohoo

I don't sympathise when actors have issues like that, they're set for life, deal with it, at least he's not stuck doing a customer service job or something getting abused by people
I highly doubt that he is NOT thankful for his role in GTAV. He is likely just annoyed with fans. Gaming fans are not like the fans you get from staring in TV shows.
Wait really? I picked killing Trevor and it was pretty brutal
Gta online isn’t canon
I feel narratively killing Trevor made the most sense outside of that
Would be funny if that's the reason Lucia's in jail in the trailer
Lester can see the future too?
That would be cool, but very unlikely since GTAV is set in 2013 and VI is set in the present day, likely 2025, but it’d be interesting to see
IIRC, there was an interview with a developer way back when it was announced that GTA IV would be getting story DLCs and he mentioned that he doesn't really like the idea because Liberty City's tone and feel are made to fit Nico's story and now they have to shoehorn another story into it. 

The DLCs were Xbox exclusive at first, so it was probably a deal between Microsoft and Take 2 (initiated by Microsoft to push sales on their store) that writers and developers had no control over. So my theory is that they hated having to do the DLC and they hated what they came up with, at least for TLaD (and I would concur). 

TBoGT felt much more complete and there were several mechanics kind of play tested that made it into GTA V (base jumps, golf, mission scores), so I guess they eventually warmed up to it. TLaD felt uninspired and kind of lackluster, so my immediate thoughts when Trevor wiped them out weren't "he's a nut job" but "they must have hated it too".
 Johnny was a side character. If you didn’t play the L&D dlc you wouldn’t even know who Johnny is.
> it probably should have just been a side character and not a main character.

No. That's the point.

He kills off a main character for the shock value as it builds his character into someone you know not to fuck with.

If it was <insert no name npc> it wouldn't have had any lasting value whatsoever. Rockstar set the tone with him immediately that he will kill anyone and do anything regardless of who they are. You instantly know he is unpredictable.
You take that back right now. I love Trevor’s unhinged unpredictable batshit insane existence!
That's the point.
Same here. It felt needlessly edgy which I mean it’s GTA so makes sense but doesn’t mean I have to like it.
The point was to set the tone for Trevor. And it worked
I thought it was funny. It was clearly meant to be an end to the previous era.
Dan houser loves edgy shock value
The real pain kicks in when you see Grove Street is taken by the Ballas and no matter how much you storm that place, whether in or out of the story, it doesn't turn it back into a Families gang territory.

But I've heard a valid theory which says CJ has survived and is a great business man (as he also was in the end of SA), there are tons of SA references in V.
It all comes together
Honestly he should go out in a blaze of glory, not as a chump
I thought the exact same thing when I posted the comment, oh believe me it had much more than 2 downvotes. I think I deleted another comment, but there was a second time I said this and easily got downvoted about 30+ times. Somethings always been fucky in this subreddit. Side note, dude is the not canonically perfect though? Between Ogg hating rockstar, and fans being divided on his character from day one, it’s like the perfect sendoff. Michael is a famous movie director now, and Trevor became a crazy ass Florida man who gets killed doing some dumb shit. Meanwhile Franklin is the OG who never leaves South LS. I always thought that maybe Trevor’ll try to cat call Lucia on the sidewalk or something and just get dome’d on sight lmao. It’d drop as many jaws as Johnny dying IMO 🤣🤣
Had to do a bit of a double take to read it right.
It would sense aswell Johnny became weak and frail to drugs it only makes sense that someone that has done it longer for it to catch up to him
Steven Ogg was in RDR 2. I doubt rockstar hates him
That's no fun. Johnny at least got dialog.
He's not. He just likes to make it very clear that he doesn't like to be associated with Trevor and he hates it when people ask him to act like the character.
He refused to listen to a fan on Cameo. Cameo is basically a website where you pay a shit ton of money to a celebrity, and then the celebrity says exactly what you want him to say in return.
Because he usually uses poor children as housekeepers, paying their parents less than $600 per month, uses Louis Voitton stuff with the money he gets from selling deceased/poor people houses and properties and he also does a little trolling.
Well we all liked him for a long time, but within the recent years he barks at anyone who want to talk about his role GTA 5. I kind of understand he wants to move past this role and not be known as the guy from gta, but he gets somewhat passive aggressive about it.
Oh I see, then he should probably take some roles that aren't so similar to Trevor lol. Everything I've seen him in he's basically Trevor.
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect
I love playing him in single-player free roam. He’s a perfect GTA Frenzy/Rampage psycho character.
Not like “oh I hate him that’s why he’s such a good character” type of dislike, like no I genuinely hate listening to him talk, he’s edgy, 1 dimensional, has one gimmick and that’s it, there’s no layers to him like Michael and Franklin
I mean I like edgy characters, he's just lame
There was a throwaway line from Lester that there was an effective crew leader in LC, but he “went dark”. Not sure if he’s in hiding or dead.
He was a bad guy but he wasn't the *bad*  guy
oooh ok. im always down for fun nods and cameos of other characters, it wold be weird for me that we are able to kill Trevor in a random mision like we did with Johnny, Trevor was way more of a power house than any other character i have ever seen in GTA, like almost every cutscene that he is antagonized he is almost imposible to kill.

i meet Steven Ogg once and he is really scary when he takes the rol of Trevor lol.

i would love to see characters from Vice city, but as far as i know thats not likely since Rockstar has said this games are another universe. lets hope there is a Lance, Tommy and others around the streets like what they did with CJ, Smoke and Ryder "being" in GTA5.
![gif](giphy|xT9IgHCTfp8CRshfQk)
>I mean the dude just doesn't want to be seen as a one trick pony?

Then he should stop playing characters and giving performances that are near identical in style to Trevor.
I think people are largely misconstruing a statement that he made about not liking people referring to him as “oh, you’re Trevor from GTA”. In the same way that he doesn’t want to be typecast, he wants to be referred to by his name and not only by fans who only know Trevor but are unwilling to look up the actor’s name.
Total douche to take money from fans and then shit on them IMHO. Sorry. [https://www.unilad.com/celebrity/grand-theft-auto-steven-ogg-cameo-20221014](https://www.unilad.com/celebrity/grand-theft-auto-steven-ogg-cameo-20221014)
Yep! And even before that, Uncle T gave jobs for us, so… although, those were before the story…
True. The plane idea is the best I've seen.
Like DB Cooper, but for video games.
Depends how they execute it because if you take it out with an RPG or something should go without saying he straight up ded and anyone who disagrees would be deluded, however if you had to snipe or shoot it down and it dropped in a lake or something there's more of a question mark
He's not dead he's just chillin with Gavin from RDR2
Bro said heroin 😂😂😂 the chimp would be like

![gif](giphy|LXaYYPzQroo80|downsized)
A heroin charged chimpanzee would be knocked out bruh
meth charged chimpanze* but you were quite close, if anyone’s seen someone or themselves on a speed ball shits wild.
In GTAV, if you actually shoot Johnny after the cutscene, it pops up with the killing hitmarker meaning he was actually somewhat alive after the cutscene
I don't think he hated playing him so much as he doesn't like video games himself and is a little resentful of his arguably biggest role being a video game character.
The reason he hates to play Trevor is because fans have started to call him Trevor Philips on the internet and irl. Like for example fans will post a screenshot of him from one of his movies and write Trevor Philips in the title. He says that Trevor is a character, and he, Steven Ogg is an actor and hence fans should call him Steven Ogg, which they don't and hence he quit.
It’s not that rockstar wouldn’t bring him back it’s that he wouldn’t want to come back. Also his main problem is he wants to be nice to all his fans and stuff but all his fans ask him to shout at them or do horrible shit even though Steven is a genuine nice guy, he also wants recognition for his other roles in other things
It would probably erase any Little progress he made he made to create his own image
They wouldn't bring him back simply because that's how Rockstar deals with their stories. They are made - done - and left in the past so new stories and characters can exists on their own.  


There is no great conspiracy or any other reason, they just don't like reusing the old characters too much because you get tangled up in nostalgia stuff instead of progressing with new stories. Hence they only add a character here and there for a second, just for the sake of small fan service, without adding too much baggage.
[deleted]
Either way I doubt rockstar would reuse voice lines in a game like GTA 6 that's supposed to be their most immersive gta yet, one which they poured 10 years and 2 billion dollars into, it's gonna sound sooo out of place, and no motion capture? Yeah this isn't 2008 gta 4 where they can just reuse voice lines.
Nope. Rockstar paid him to record lines, they belong to Rockstar. I'm quite sure they have that in their contract that any materials created remain their property for use when and how they please. So he would have nothing from a lawsuit.
Oh FUCK I just realized that was him in Better Caul Saul
His character on better call Saul is literally Trevor in all but name. And the guy wonders why people make the association
He was a fairly unknown actor before GTAV and did a phenomenal job with playing Trevor. It's no surprise that he got booked to do more of that ever since then.
Fr it’s like Jim Carrey getting mad at people asking him to make a face
Sounds like something Trevor would do
Shoutout to Hugo One
For what it's worth, Steven Ogg said afterwards that that *was* him reading it "as Trevor." He was ostensibly trying to do a bit where he was himself, but responding how Trevor would respond if someone asked him to respond as someone else. Your mileage may vary on whether or not you think he's full of shit.
Sudden fame can get to their heads. Yeah, it might be annoying that everyone knows you for one thing.. but 99.9% of actors are not known for anything by any significant amount of people, and he is in the lucky few who is known for something (plus paid well) and is being a jerk about it.
Harrison Ford does have a huge career besides being Han Solo or Indiana Jones. Steve Ogg doesn't. He has credits, but it's not stuff he is known for, he is known only as "the guy who played Trevor".
It's not that. It's that fans can't seperate him and who he is from a total lunatic drug addict who does wildly inappropriate things, and people treat him like he actually IS Trevor.
He's in the BBC drama, Boiling Point, and is an utter creep in it. It honestly made Trevor seem loveable in comparison 🤣
He was in two season of the Walking Dead, also kind of a Trevor Philips type character here too. A little more reserved, but definitely a few screws loose.
He was in Westworld too, and plays an equally, if not more creepy and unsettling character.
That's the exact source of the frustration. The only roles he's being offered are Trevor-adjacent characters.

He's pissed that he can't turn them down otherwise he won't work at all.
I think I can understand it. It's suffering from success, basically. They're artists and want to do other roles, different sorts of characters and stretch themselves some more, but they keep getting asked to do either the same thing they did a decade ago, or parodies of it. It's not that they're bothered by what they did or the fact that people liked what they did, but annoyed by the fact that people seemingly won't let them move on to newer things.   


Adam West is one of the most famous examples of that, he was Batman in the 60's and spent decades trying to do new things, but had difficulty getting cast in any large roles because directors couldn't stop seeing and hearing Batman when he would audition. His best bet for a while was doing parodies of 1960's Batman. Family Guy helped break him out of that rut by casting him as an unhinged version of himself who got elected mayor.
I mean in any workplace, you are expected to stand out. If you don’t stand out as an actor, then you are definitely not going to have a sustainable source of income and lifestyle. 

So from an actor’s pov, it’s understandable that he would be frustrated. Even Harrison Ford and Alec Guinnes hate Star Wars cuz no one talks about any roles they have done outside of SW in relation to their work.
An actor of his stature is not likely to be rolling in millions of dollars. He likely makes good money, but I highly doubt he is set for life.
He is not set for life from one role in GTA V. Far from it. He probably got a couple of hundred thousand, which is a few years worth of money in Hollywood if he's a fairly modest man.  


He may get a bit on the side from conventions, custom videos etc (if he's doing that, not sure). But that's all crumbs.
Set for life? It doesn’t seem like he’s been in all that much. I can’t imagine voicing a gta character pays all of that much.
With the agency dlc there's a one liner when you do the golf cart chase where Franklin says he knows someone that works at the movie studio being Micheal. With the hanger dlc ron says Trevor went vinewood and is now a yoga instructor or something like that plus in the agency dlc one of the security people or desk workers say some something about an unhinged dude coming by saying they know Franklin
Death Wish is the official canon ending, the other ones are what could've been
Wtf bro I didn’t know people actually picked the other endings. Not judging but I am
What about 2023 Franklin missions in GTA online?
It's a bit of closure for Michael's arc to finish what he started (Ludendorff heist was set up to initially kill Trevor) but it's out of character for Franklin. He had spent so long trying to escape his old life only to do what some rich government guy tells him to do for nothing more than the empty promise of cash. Franklin is supposed to make his own future and he goes right back into making his old mistakes by turning on Trevor.
TBoGT had better guns than TLaD too.
yeah definitely feels that way with how the treat the characters of TLaD and TBoGT. The Lost are treated as mooks that you rob and kill in Online while the characters in TBoGT are your partners in new money making ventures with some role in the story.
Tbf he does show up and is mentioned in IV’s story.
I feel like the idea isn't what most people take issue with, it's the execution. They essentially reversed all of Johnny's character development off-screen and then killed him off being cucked. The point of the scene would've been conveyed a lot better if Johnny died as a result of an intense firefight/fistfight or something, which would undoubtedly display Trevor's dangerousness better while still paying respect to a protagonist that a lot of people liked.
People be like "wow Trevor is such a bad ass and unpredictable character, but why he kill johnny?!?!?".
Trevor kills many nameless civilians and hillbillies: 😐

Trevor kills Johnny: 😠😠
It's part edgy and part shock for sure, but at the same time Johnny is a biker who peddled meth & other drugs and killed a tonne of people. People who live that life can often have a steep & sharp descent and don't always have a happy ending. It was also to show how Johnny became a victim to himself
True. I just completed Max Payne 3 and I get why some fans think it’s not like the predecessors. Dan Houser is not bad as a writer of course but sometimes he’s corny and tries to much to be edgy. GTA6 trailer already felt different from the usual Rockstar Game before he left.
I mean, there are references sure, but GTA:SA takes place in a different universe than GTAV, so having the Ballas in Grove Street doesn’t mean anything for CJ and friends
Would have been cool if there was some dynamic gang war mechanics where you pick a side and can influence who controks what are
It's like poetry. It rhymes
"It all makes sense now."
this is GTA lol
People would've said the same about Johnny 10+ years ago
What would you call a falling plane that blows up at the end, if NOT a blaze (of glory)?
The same could be said about Johnny.
That’s what they did to Johnny, the protagonist of the Lost and the Damned DLC. GTA seems to only kill people like chumps.
But he wasn‘t in RDR 2
The story of RDR2 finished it's development 5 years ago
Does he actually?? Huh???
What?
bro what, is this serious lol
link?
take your meds
He's probably been getting typecast since GTA V came out, so I can see his frustration. That being said, I don't know why he wouldn't simply embrace it. But hey I'm not Steven Ogg so I don't know what I'm talking about
Trevor isn’t edgy… he’s the people that live on the edge except they fall off
We see his life invader page. I think if we see a character from 4 or 5, it's going to be Brucie( he would so retire to Flordia, I know he is in gta online but I personally consider that to be a different cannon)
![gif](giphy|tMPSeKEplOfK0)
They’ll do it now lmao
Johnny Gat style.
Shoot it down way up In the sky like in San Andreas hi jacking mission. Hit it with a missile and it just smokes and goes down. We never see it crash or explode.
Well there’s still no confirming if trevor is even really ON the plane or if he played 5d chess with you. Not even an rpg can give you full clarity.
well yea, im not a narcotics connoisseur
Tbh I think that was more an oversight. I wish it were true so that none of the Lost besides Ashley have to die, that'd be cool tbh.
I'm pretty sure Steven has said that he would work with Rockstar again if they asked him to.
He does cameo work as Trevor, he can't hate him that much
use it without paying him would definitely lead to a lawsuit lol. it’s kinda the price tag that’s the only issue atp. even then though, for the right amount, i still don’t see him being okay with that. the man *really* dislikes Trevor and wants to distance himself as much as possible, i’m 100% sure Rockstar would honor his wishes in this situation
I think he meant use the b-roll recordings they have somewhere. Stuff they recorded but didn’t use in 5.
Same in the walking dead.
Im not suprised he took that role, BCS is a great show. But that's the problem, the only roles he gets are typecasted as a crazy Trevor like dude. That's the main reason he "hates being Trevor"
well i mean at this point he’s typecast
Even the guy having guns hidden all around his body was straight out of GTA lol. Surprising that Mike didn’t find an RPG up his ass
Trevor could have backed up his boasts.
When and where did he say that?
I'm in your walls.
He should embrace the typecast imo. He plays that kind of part really well and could get consistent work doing it. 

In Westworld he was basically Trevor in the wild west, tho he did have a redemption arc in the 2nd season. In the clips I've seen of him in The Walking Dead, he was basically Trevor in the zombie apocalypse. 

There's no shortage of villain roles in Hollywood and he could make a good career out of it. Look at Peter Stormare for example.
Don't you actually speak to Trevor in online?
Weird to read updates for GTA online be described as dlc
 I’m not arguing he isn’t important or anything, but to call him a main character doesn’t fit the bill. Roman is more of a main character than Johnny is.
i think was clear that Johnny and Ashley were both pretty fucked up in V and relied on Trevor for supply.
hence Ashley immediately asking to “get lit” and it explains Johnny being so passive.
bro why do you care so much, we were never going to see johnny anyways, he was a dlc charcter from a game 5 years prior that most gta fans didnt even know existed until his death
[deleted]
My brain refused to accept this fact even after having learned of it. For Marvel, it can differentiate between the various worlds ans universes, but for GTA it simply has a hard time to do that.
I don't think so. TLAD has often been regarded as one of the weaker GTA games in terms of story and Johnny has never been nearly as popular of a character as some of the other protagonists.
He's in the epilogue. That guy who really hates Jim Milton
I refuse. They make me act normal.

Also, based username. Literally based, not cool, just correct.
The unhinged lunatic with a “cut here” tattoo on his throat isn’t edgy?
cmon now
Well nows a good time to start
A cracked out Chimpanzee would have been a better choice
Heroin is an opioid like morphine. Those are not the types of drugs you would associate with energy, or vitality.

They turn you into a lifeless, mumbling, stumbling zombie.
I’m guessing he was somewhat alive after that cutscene but since she doesn’t do anything but cry on top of him he prolly bled out as he never got actual care
source?
He was in rdr2
im pretty sure by paying him to say the lines on a recording that is Rockstar buying those recordings from him.

They don't have to pay him unless his original contract were to state that, otherwise it most likely states something like by signing this contract you are giving Rockstar the rights to use those recording when ever and how ever they want
Same in West world.
Yeah typecasting must be a very vicious thing because you either doom yourself to playing the same character forever or pass up millions to try to break out, and sometimes you just can't justify passing up that kinda money.
Which interestingly contrasts with Far Cry 3's Vaas. Where Michael Mando played a calm dude on BCS. Idk if he has been in anything else tho, I heard he was supposed to be a villain in the MCU but that was only a nothing burger cameo in homecoming.
Yea but those interactions were before the gun running bunker dlc and everything in game that happens before gun running is set in 2013 either 6 or 3 months before the events of story mode. Everything after the bunker is set in 2017 and whatever year the dlc came out. So his contact missions and heist are pretty much prequel content
Those missions/heists are canonically set before story mode I think
Yeah they’re like, technically downloaded content but DLC generally means something specific (and optional) which doesn’t actually apply to GTAO updates
i just wish they brought that to non online game, i know its an unpopular opinion, but i hated to partner up with randos and try to do something, or trying to do some activity and some kid on a flying bike harassing the entire lobby came by
Ok thank you, I thought I was completely missing story DLC (no interest in GTA Online - SP only).
Fr. I like him, but not everyone has played that DLC, and hell, I doubt anyone even noticed him during the GTA4 story quests unless they were "hardcore" fans.

I just liked the fact he got shown in the first place. Shows how big he was in his DLC despite the small sad part he served in the next.
Not only that but I remember when the dlc came out and everyone hated Johnny. I was happy to see him die in gta 5
How do you think it would have been different if Houser remained?
It's not out yet and you're judging it from a minutes long trailer
It would help if there was more distinction. But since there are characters with continuity across the universes (Lazlow did in fact host a radio station in Vice City, even though that game isn’t in the current universe) it makes it harder to grasp the differences
We're not saying he's popular, just that he didn't deserve a chumps death.
Sounds similar to him but it‘s not Steven Ogg
Imagine a PCP monkey that was given weight training, MMA, and steroids
Source: trust me bro
I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted, Steven Ogg voiced a character in RDR2

Edit: After further review, I found no evidence of Steven Ogg voicing in RDR2. Downvote away
Same in The Romantic Comedy with an Edge.
Same in Snowpiercer.
They wanted to set him up as a villain but Sony holds near exclusive rights to most of them and their relationship with Disney was rocky to say the least
I'm not super familiar with his career but he did have a few roles before being vaas, and many after.
A fun fact is that he also directed his own short films
GTA lore is peak
This is exactly why I never played the game online. How bad is it?
[deleted]
Hmm, not really sure - with how secretive RS is, it's hard to say for certain. I ***definitely*** think she'd be a lot closer to the "Trevor with tits lol" that we were all secretly expecting, however. Not only did he always seem like the edgier of the two founding Brothers, but it'd be a "sensible" decision given how much money *V* has made. By contrast, *VI* seems more subversive and exciting ***because*** a lot more is clearly going on with Lucia. How much of her compassion is an act, how much of it is genuine yet misguided? *Can you be a good criminal?* This is the type of shit Rockstar *should* be asking, not "lol what if she stuffed a corpse in a toilet?"

Don't get me wrong - I love T and always will. But you can't play the same setlist twice, particularly if you want to remain at the top of the heap.
Joe Rogan?
Chimp with steroids and on crack could probably kill at least 200 unarmed guys without breaking a sweat
It’s because I’m so cool
No he didn't.

The Laramie gang leader was performed by Mason Hensley. He also voiced one of the Dugan's guards which you can hear during the Bugstar/Yung Ancestor approach.
Was interested to see who it was. But from googling it turns out it is just someone who sounds a lot like him.
Today I was 38 years old when I found out he was that guy fml
No wonder it bothers him if he’s constantly type casted like that
Same in Boiling Point
a little unrelated but Lester actually mentions your GTA Online character in the jewel store mission. he says you're "too unpredictable" 🤣
Yeah before story mode los santos was ruled by flying bikes and laserweapons of course
At first, back when it launched it was fun and everybody was on the same playing level, but as the game got more and more dlcs and shit, they introduced a LOT of OP weapons that were 50% annoying, 50% OP, or flying cars that had unlimited rocket launchers, and everything became so super expensive, you had to literally grind for days to get something, but you couldnt just power through the grind because there were randos just fucking shit up, not to mention the hackers.

And if you werent lucky to find friends that could play st the same time, you had to match with randos, who would either just straight up suck, or troll and fuck things up on purpose.

Dont get me wrong, it still is an absolute blast to just play around blowing up stuff, but rockstar made it a nearly impossible chore to grind enough money to actually buy shit, so you would feel compeled to buy their currency with real life money, so it was nearly impossible for a casual player to eventually obtain what they wanted without missing out on other stuff.

All that, personally made me feel like constantly missing out on content and couldnt keep up, there was always that new (and OP) new weapon, new vehicle, new content locked behind a huuuge grind.

And none of that, NONE made it into offline lol, not even the actual new zones in the map, so you couldnt just go and at least explore them
Contrary to popular belief, it's not bad at all. You can easily switch to a different lobby if you're getting griefed or switch to a completely private, invite-only lobby if you don't want to deal with other people. There's also an option called Passive mode that makes it so that you can't attack anyone or participate in lobby events, but nobody can kill you either. The majority of the time lobbies are mostly full of people doing their own thing that won't fuck with you, in my experience.
In what world does his tombstone in VI, set on the other side of the country from San Andreas, makes sense to you?
Interesting, thanks for explaining. I wasn't aware of his effect on the tonality of the Story Mode experience.

This is for the best, then.
> we were all secretly expecting

Who’s we?

Besides, Dan left pretty late into VI’s development cycle, so all this still has the hallmarks of his writing. The *next* game however…
If you free based a chimp it would definitely sweat regardless of how many it killed
True! Gonna downvote
God, I hope they take it easy on that stuff in VI.  


I mean, I know they won't, but please have "realism" servers where it isn't Fortnite Vietnam the second I load in.  


That'd be nice.
[deleted]
To be fair, *this is just my theory.* I neither know anyone at Rockstar nor have design documentation for V, lol. Regardless, glad that I helped out here!
A joke has something funny or witty in it, this was not it, it's a fart at best.
B-girl Australia vs France @ Olympics
Poor Australia gets all 0 
She's the best breakdancer in Oceania. And she's a university lecturer on the cultural impact of breakdancing.

Yet this was worse than David Brent's dance in The Office.
It’s gone
Really? That's painful to watch.
She claims to practicing for 3-4 hours per day.
When you lie on your resume
We the people demand the full performance be posted on youtube by the Olympics! Not letting the people see this is an attack on freedom!
When i turned this on live they were the first ones up. I couldn't believe it was real. I was like wtf is going on, is she about to tell me that Jesus is her homie
wait, is breakdancing genuinely in the Olympics now?! I saw a clip of this girl dancing and thought it was a celebration from another sport.
Here's. some [clips from X](https://x.com/StevieAustin14/status/1821943357410570530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1821943357410570530%7Ctwgr%5E076a483aa5d7722a9514334c38f499b79f6a6454%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcchicago.com%2Fparis-2024-summer-olympics%2Faustralias-raygun-goes-viral-for-performance-in-debut-of-olympic-breaking%2F3517964%2F)

And oh boy is it bad
The cringe could have been averted at the Oceania finals. It was equally painful to watch.


[https://youtu.be/MorhA98eK7M?si=RmY24H4kUcuYk4lI](https://youtu.be/MorhA98eK7M?si=RmY24H4kUcuYk4lI)
This has Chris Lilley's Mr G. interpretive dance routine written all over it lmao
Why can't I find an actual video and not an AI narration with stills of this performance anywhere?
im pretty sure she finished and busted out ....



''AND THAT'S HIP HOP'' \*\*arms crossed\*\*
This is the shittest thing I've ever seen.
She finessed the system all the way to the Olympics. That makes her a winner in my eyes.
[deleted]
Chris Lilley playing Jonah is all I see
Fuck me. Look I’m all for everyone to express themselves in whatever art form they choose. But this absolutely makes a mockery of the Olympic Games. It just shouldn’t be there.
This whole event was cringe
I don’t understand why YouTube is being so strict about removing Olympics videos. It’s not like they won’t end up on the platform eventually, so why keep deleting them?
Wait... this is an Olympic sport?
Video is unavailable?
Just because it’s a physical skill doesn’t make it a sport and it certainly doesn’t mean it should be a competition at the olympics. Imagine competing at a level of skill so great, having endured training since childhood to compete at the olympics just to arrive to see that in some pathetic attempt to appear progressive and current, the Olympics has its first year for competitive “Arm Pit Farting” at the Olympics. This is embarrassing and it absolutely diminishes the image of the Olympics and the athletes that compete in it with its association. This is like “Curling” is among the winter olympics except worse because it’s not a sport with explicit rules and specific game related structure and goals. I think that even people who are passionate about break dancing would agree.
The first and last time it’ll be in the olympics. They are already replacing it with cricket in 2028 LA
I just know she took someone’s opportunity that really deserved it.
Holy crap, how did she rank?
BOOOOOOOOO!
Lol
I hope no one pays for the olympics. Biggest scam ever
Video isn't available
I'm not even mad. I was entertained.
Did it get taken down because it's too cringe?
Every single time she went i kept saying "get off the ground, stop rolling around on the ground"
I mean she had one or 2 moves that made me go "huh" but otherwise just a bad performance.

Its one thing to lose because you are less good than the other person, it sucks to lose for your entire country with absolutely zero points and be visibly worse than all the people you went up against.

Im so sorry australia, i dont know your breakdance scene, but i believe you have better b-girls than this. 
I dont know what process they used to choose her but it was the wrong process.
She had a hard time after being used to spinning in the opposite direction in Australia.
Where can I find the full video?
This is what happens when friends are not honest with each other.  She needed better friends to say things like "No, that is not a six step and you should stop trying to bring interpretive dance into a break battle".
I feel like this is just karma for all the Australian social media posted trying to brag that they had more gold medals(at the time)than the US.
What in the hell did I watch?  I mean, I was born the the 70s, I know what break dancing is, but why?  Damn Greeks and their traditional break dancing competitions.

Zeus started this crap when he kept doing Jackhammers in front of the ladies.
Gotta love how genuinely furious and elitist the "breaking community" is acting on her IG page though
Fuq breakdance at the olympics
Fuck France for this sill shit, go clean your streets.
As ridiculous as I find this dancing, I can’t help but have a small part of me feel bad for the girl. 

One of those “hey what’s the worst that could happen?” 

Well, the worst that happened is literally the entire planet laughing at you 🌎😬
Sort of fused flashdance with MC Hammer shit
Wait..so this wasn't like a joke or something?  This was a real attempt?
Oh god she’s going to have to lecture about herself now
I mean, maybe with the gravity going the other way she’s better? You also got to realize she’s used to spinning the other way
I mean when you can’t do, teach?
Really hard to find a decent video of this!
The clip? It’s uploaded by CBC in Canada so probably geoblocked elsewhere
I cringed the whole time. Like I’m sure Australia has better B-girls than that…
You put really and that’s in the incorrect order
For 3 weeks?
Practice what, though?
And have all other applicants killed.
Hahahahaha
A host country gets to pick some demo sports to add. Tokyo added Baseball and Climbing. France chose Breaking as one of theirs. LA is adding Lacrosse and Flag Football in the 2028 games.

The IOC can decide if they want to keep it or not which is how skateboarding ended up in the olympics full time.
Its not just breakdancing, its literally breakdance battling. Like you would see in the movies. They throw gang signs and stuff and the judges go “oooOOOHH!!” While holding a fist up to their mouth when they pull a crazy move. Like literally like watching a Channing Tatum movie from 2000.


I was just watching it.
Can't wait for Air Guitar to make its entry to the Olympics.
NOT THE KANGAROO! 🤣🤣🤣
Somewhere in Australia, Jonah Takalua is shaking his damned head.
🫣
What's X? Do you mean twitter?
Next time this guy is going to compete in judo

https://youtu.be/FLmlbQst5eA?t=5
That wasn't great, but it wasn't nearly as bad as the Olympic match. I have NO CLUE how they chose her over that other dancer though. I didn't think it was even close. Wtf are those judges on?
Mate how do you reference Summer Heights High on a break dancing video and talk about Mr G instead of Jonah
Because the networks are immediately taking down any unlicensed footage anywhere.  It's worse than professional sports for some reason.   For something that's supposed to be about the world coming together, the Olympics are disgustingly copyrighted and  monetized.
My wife showed me a great Tik tok last night that had the whole dance overlaid with the audio from that Bob’s Burgers episode. It synced perfectly. Especially as the competitor started coming into focus. “Uh oh, I guess we BATtlin’ “ 😂
Absolutely, and she looks like she has the time of her life. I mean, the golf outfit… the kangaroo hops…. I love it….
All I know is it’s not that… 😵‍💫
Why does breakdancing make a mockery of the Olympics?
I don´t dance but im a fan of Hip hop culture and breakdance since i was a teen and yeah, i agree with you.
She lost all her three matches 18-0.
Same and I'm arriving reluctant and late to this discourse yet still not really seeing what was the issue. Rayon did more floor work and accompanying head movements, not nearly as many flairs nor quite as fast which I can kind of sympathize with given her age (I'm barely much younger than her fyi) whereas Syssy was doing smoother flairs, standing more often, doing less floor work and had overall more appealing pacing yet is notably \~2 decades younger than Rayon.

Also *let's face it*, stuff like turntablism, the 'pots and pans'-esque music productions of something like the music playing\* from the world where breaking emerged is utterly alien from what most of current hip-hop aficionados would be used to listening at performances hence imo I won't be surprised if the antiquated anachronism of the sounds already risks making things cringy for ppl maybe more used to or even expecting apparently contemporary ,trap, mumblecore and cloundsound.

\* ('\[Romani ;I\] rock' by ill boogs)

If it's about having had one shot presence of breaking at the Olympics, sure that's a conversation to be had but it seems baffingly to see a performer be put on the spot for something a fair amount of us wouldn't really ever expect to do--one of the few globally recognized performance based non-social dances which isn't say ballet and it's (even *more antiquated*) vibe of seeming haughtiness and posturing; ; overall I find it interesting how didn't resemble a '*individuals take turns*' version of Capoeira's *jogos* as much as I thought it'd be.
I hope she has a good support network, this is the kind of public ridicule that can send someone into a very dark place mentally
Oh god I feel what you just said so hard. That makes me feel terrible!
This is why they have qualifications in major sports federations.  You should have to be able to perform at a specific level to even get into the Olympics.  I guess with it being a new sport to Olympics, they just don't have that type of qualification and people like her somehow get to compete.
Yeah I feel like this is pretty much cyberbullying and can't help but feel for the person. They dedicate their life to their passion and they get clowned like this. People are assholes.
To contrast that sentiment, my mind has a focus more on the potential talent stepped over for this.

 I am very excited to see vids come from ACTUAL Breakers in Australia so we have proof that whoever ran that qualifier event is MAJORLY out of touch. 

To be a little more rude: good job to the grown ass 36 year old that got to “express herself “ on the world stage, for the best of the best, the Olympics.
Yes. By a 36-year-old called Raygun.
It was in all likelihood an intentional joke. There are videos going around of her in past comps where she is way better
She’s been saying she was trying to push the boundaries of what breakdancing is.  We have a new floor, now let’s never do that again.  She gave her students the lowest bar ever.  I love the meme where she’s looking for the dropped bolt under her car. Or the one where the dog rolling in the grass did it better.  I would like her to apologize to Australia and the Olympics for that performance, it was embarrassing and if she intended to do something like that. It had to have been approved by Australia, right?  Also I love how people can watch her dance and imitate her at home.  But nobody is doing what the person that won it did.
Imagine failing Bgirl Raygun’s college class on breakdancing
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTYrbG-8RYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTYrbG-8RYE)
No, Olympic integrity.
Yup. My VPN made it watchable
The term ‘b-girl’ is cringy in itself
Have you not seen that Australian trend of people in offices dancing in a circle to the camera lol…
Poker
For 2028 technically the 2 new sports that are making debut are Flag Football and Squash. Baseball/Softball, Lacrosse and Cricket are being added back.
Didn’t Tokyo add surfing as well?
What about pickleball?
It’s the IOC, not the host country, that chooses which new sports to add (and which existing sports to remove) from each Olympic Games. [Source.](https://olympics.com/ioc/faq/sports-programme-and-results/how-can-a-sport-be-included-in-the-olympic-games-programme)
France shouldn't be allowed to make adult decisions 
She even did the Sprinkler in the last clip 💀
Puck you miss
It finally happened, he changed the url so there’s no more twitter
That makes much more sense than what I was thinking.

I thought the powers that be were trying to erase evidence of this embarrassment lol
Makes sense why I’m not seeing any Olympic content on social media.
which defeats fair use. 👎👎
this bob's burger episode is awesome they parodied her perfectly :) if you find it back,,, shoot me the url :)
But she’s a professor whom literally lectures about breakdancing. It’s her life.
Breakdancing is not the problem per se. As we can see with the other contestant, it can be good and we can understand why it's in the Olympics if something like artistic skating and swimming is. We're not used yet to the style that's so different from the elegance of those other sports, but that shouldn't matter.

But, it's still new, it's still a bit awkward in its presentation, the music isn't great, i'm not sure it's the best location/presentation for the thing. It also feels like the contestants aren't all the greatest. I don't know how it works exactly, but it's kinda shocking that Australia's contestant was selected for the Olympics. Did she just mess up? Maybe she shouldn't have been selected at all by her country. Not sure if the Olympics have a word to say on who the countries send.
Because at its core it’s not a sport or a game, it’s an art. It’s about expression, style, music and individuality. It came out of hip hop counter culture. So at this point, why not have a DJ event? Or a rap event? Or beat boxing? They all
require skill. And they exist in competitive formats, but they would seem pretty out of place in the olympics right? Just my opinion of course.
I'm the same age as "raygun" and probably about as in good of shape. If you put me in the 100m dash it would be a fucking embarrassment, and to say that I was the best representative of that sport for my nation would be making a mockery of the Olympics.  That's how.
Especially since she has a genuine love and interest for the art in the academic sense. Hope she’s doing well.
At a high school level, yes this type of bullying would be horrible, but she willfully went through the process, and sent herself to a WORLD COMPETITION.  Even If I got accepted I wouldn't go because I know I'm not a top 20 in the world, neither is she. Honestly I've seen much better busking in Rundle mall, she should have known her personal limit and not gone
[deleted]
On the flipside, you prove that people are delusional.
To do that and then be absolutely schooled by someone called syssy? I'm not sure how you show your face in public again.
“Not available in your country”
Have one that's not region locked?
Where did u watch it? What rigon?
It's historical. [DJ Kool Herc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Kool_Herc) supposedly coined the term in the 70s. I agree that it sounds super out of place though.
Why?
Huh?
Um, where can I find this?
Joke of a sport
I mean if we wanna split hairs about it. The host country picks sports it wants to include and the IOC then approves or denies their requests which is what it says in your source.
🍆tation
I always just put twitter as the URL and it always works. When it stops working I'll stop going
Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.
The selection part is what baffles me. I’ve lived in Melbourne for 25 years and I n the early 2000s I used to go to the DMC dj competition every year. 

They always had world class breakers perform at them, male and female. I refuse to believe they couldn’t find someone better than her
I agree, it's not a sport inherently unworthy of the Olympics. Why am I downvoted for asking someone to elaborate on their strong opinion?
But figure skating, gymnastics, synchronized swimming, skateboarding, etc. are all accepted and they are artistic expressions. Using the same grading metrics it can absolutely be included and scored and be popular as an event.
It is a game, the game is "who can dance better, me or you"
Shit, the [This Is Hip-Hop dance instructor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS2KQ46Kf84) (Dena Rizzo) is still doing her thing.
Honestly, can you tell me why NOBODY focuses on this truth?
Yeah if I dedicated my life in studying something and get invited to THE prestigious event at a world stage I'm gonna take it idgaf.
She was schooled by the Lithuanian kid haha
yeah, didn´t know, i´m sorry
oh damn, nope, sorry :(
USA. Everything gets blocked here because of peacock I think.
i think hes talking about genz boss and a mini
It's tennis for non-athletic people.
Well what the hell is Flag Football then?
The ancient Romans did not think so when they invented it
Because you assumed the disgrace was breakdancing as a sport and not the performance of the Australian.
Maybe i misinterpreted the comment you replied to, but I read it as ‘this performance makes a mockery of the olympics due to how weak it is’, and not ‘breakdancing makes a mockery’.

Maybe the comment did mean the latter, but i believe the downvotes came from people who read it as the former
Figure skating, synchronised swimming and above all gymnastics are first and foremost about athletic ability, technical skill and technique - with elements of art mixed in.

Skateboarding - I actually feel the same way, I don’t think it should be in the olympics (and it wasn’t until 2020).
Could be applied to all dancing, and singing, acting, act. You can put judges in front of any type of art and make it a competition. Does that qualify all art for the Olympics? 

We don’t we add line dancing? Salsa? Opera singing? It’s a slippery slope when you start. And for some reason they’ve chosen an art form that came from 1980s American hip hop culture 🤷🏻‍♂️
It’s alright. More of a heads up to others, than a dig at you.
I found the full video message me and I’ll send it to you
Exactly
So what you/re saying is after concrete, aqueducts, and the Julian calendar they were due for a dud.
They literally said "IT shouldn't be there" not "SHE shouldn't be there". It sounded like to me they were referring to breakdancing being the disgrace and not her (when clearly she is).
So other bad performances of every other sport equally make the same level of mockery of the Olympics. If this was a vid of that poke vaulted, would the same comment appear?
Also, with respect, you're not the person I was asking to elaborate
Breakdancing js also about athletic ability, technical skill and technique - with elements of art mixed in and a little more personality.
Hang on, why is it a problem to select something from 80s American hip hop culture?
Yeah that's what I saw
If someone was so bad that their performance was on this level yes. Eddie the eagle was on a similar level and they changed the rules for eligibility to the Olympics because of him.
So you didn't want an answer, you wanted a specific person to answer?
Nope - sorry. They are just not comparable. I mean  if you want to you could apply that classification to most forms of dancing, singing, musical performance, all martial arts. Why don’t we include them all? 

We can’t and we shouldn’t. That’s exactly my point, constant arbitrary expansionism of the games makes a mockery of its history and tradition IMO.
Did I say it was a problem? No - point is it’s arbitrary. Why breaking and not salsa? Ballet? Mongolian throat singing? Irish dancing? If were having one let’s have em all.
You got it
What's the definition of a sport?
Eh I disagree. The physical skill level is comparable to gymnastics. I'd agree other forms of dance could be included, and martial arts because of that physical aspect. The history of the modern games has events being added and dropped through it's entire existence, it's part of the tradition.
I agree, that would be cool. Of course they can only bring a limited number of events in, so that's why they have to pick one. Maybe they could've done a whole "dancesport" event with various disciplines like breaking, ballroom, contemporary etc. Would you have preferred another culture?
You should just DM them next time if that's the case. Posing a question in an open forum will probably keep leading to people you don't approve of answering you.
Before you go down the dictionary road, remember the olympics does not only have “sports”, and I never made the claim that it did. That’s why it’s called Olympic “games”. But games should be more about competition than art.

I believe most would agree - especially performers themselves - that breakdancing is much more about culture and artistic expression than points and competition. 

I think I’ve made my point and I feel we are kinda going in circles. Have a nice day!
It’s called Olympic Games not Olympic Sports. We should view it like this: is it a competition? If yes then it could be viable for the Olympic Games.
Watch this Australian performer. Then watch Simone Biles. If you think the level of physical skill is in any way comparable, I’m sorry you are out of your mind.
It’s not about my preference. I actually like breakdancing and grew up listening to rap and hip hop. My point is that the selection process is arbitrary, and dilutes the prestige of the Olympics. Why not have all dances? Would be weird right?

Which is why I think it would make more sense selecting events that focus more on competition and/or athletic ability as opposed to artistic and cultural expression.
Also no, this is a public discussion but I'm asking the person who said breakdancing makes a mockery of the games to elaborate. You then decided to do that on their behalf and ended up getting it wrong, because they have since done so and said that in their opinion it is breakdancing ITSELF that makes a mockery of the games, not this performance specifically which you thought they were referring to. Make your own point sure but it makes no sense to assume you know what another person is trying to say, especially when you got it wrong
To clarify, you do not think that this sport itself makes a mockery of the Olympic games, but you think that anytime sometime is very bad at a sport at the Olympics, they're making a mockery of it?
I agree
I don't think the level of skill between the Australian and Simone are the same, that's why I said the Australian was an embarrassment. But watching actually talented breakers the comparison is not 1 to 1 but it's a lot closer.
If I watch someone shooting air pistol and compare their physical skill to Simone Biles I could say the same. Heck, I could say the same for a lot of the Olympic events. I don't feel like gymnastics is the bar.
Watch anyone other than the Australian performer... She's nowhere near representative of the sport. These breakdancers are major athletes, especially if you watch the men's event from yesterday.
Got this summ’bich stuck already.
Got that thing stuck like a wank panzer!
It’s hilarious once you start driving in town, people running in terror.
Damnit Shepard!
The first time I landed in New Atlantis, I heard a scream behind me and turned around to see ground crew getting up off of the ground. I think the buggy shot out of the ship and knocked him over.
Need to find the post where some jerk told me there would never be vehicles allowed in cities 😂🤣
You blew the transaxle, you're just grinding metal! Ease down... ease down...
The car spawns in the cities? Lol
How do you get the buggy? (I've installed the update)
Looks like it ain't got no gas in it. Hit it with a anti gravitational Field.
Just tried to bail while skidding and the game crashed.
Hey you can't park there
Cyberstuck
Bethesda gives you rovers to explore distant planet geography….

*gets it stuck in new Atlantis skyscrapers
This little baby is gonna be a bug masterclass. I'm getting the popcorn ready.
Can you get it unstuck by hitting it like in Halo?
How fast is it
How many credits?
Is this on xbox? If never seen a car lol
Sounds like a skill issue 😆
This isn't Halo, but I commend the effort
Show us the vehicle module
🤯that’s a thing?!?! 
Fuck, back to the grind ig
Is this like the cyber truck of Bethesda? Or is Bethesda the cyber truck of gaming?
Wait did I miss them adding vehicles????
*Sarah dislikes that*
Hows it handle/feel?
Haven't gotten stuck yet but Low G driving sure is amusing. Bouncing all over; jumping into orbit ..
So far, 2 pieces of feedback:
1. Change the steering controls, (at least on console; forward/reverse on one stick and turning on the other is just soon much better)
2. Im a bit disappointed there's no storage container you can interact with. I'm sure a mod will fix that ( and maybe a biit more speed 🤣) very very soon though
Can you transport it in your ship?
I bought it and it mentioned a vehicle hanger? is that like an outpost thing or something or did I misread with my exited ass
Anyone else getting this issue? I get in the rev8. But i cannot exit the vehicle.. holding E doesn't work.
Is this one on PC? I'm Xbox player so that's why I'm asking as I haven't seen anything yet
Gotdamnit
I can't get out of the damn thing. Exit button doesn't work.
did they release the official vehicles already
What in tarnations..
Put it in H
Where do you store the vehicle? Do you need a place on your ship to store it?
Living up to your Reddit name I see
That was fast
There are ground vehicles now???? I might have to fire it up again
hit the thrusters and go vertical
Was it foolish of me to assume we’d be able to customize the car? (Other than color) 💀
Lol! Mine spawned stuck in the ramp wall right at the services guy! 🤣🤣🤣
Is the buggy fun?
at least you made it to a planet. My entire game is bugged and glitchy
I can’t even get it. I clicked buy, but how do you actually spawn it? Is there a vehicle hangar hab or something?
Same! Got it stuck in the wing of my star eagle in less than two minutes lol.
MAKO 2.0
I know what’s wrong with it
Are you a beta tester?
I accidentally shot the strip services guy because I didn't realize that it had lasers on it 😂
New weekend plans.. this game got a whole lot mote entertaining! I'm glad I started a fresh campaign again
Where the crap do we get cars?!
Hold A there’s turbo jets
When did this get added?
I might be behind on the update but are there vehicles in the game now? Since when?
You are why we can't have nice things.
There are vehicles now???
Woah wait they included vehicles now?
You can drive cars in this game now!?
Hilarious. Mako vibes.
💀🤣🤣Lmaooooo im Fuckin dying over here
Vehicles ???
#It ain't got no gas innit.
Looks like I have to update.
Wait, we got buggies now? I haven't played since May.
I can't even buy it. It won't do anything.
Wut, is that vanilla? Nobody told me they added vehicles, I shelved that game months ago, figured I'd wait till it reached the doneness that is Skyrim
they have buggies now ?
Man I’ve bought like 3 of these from different vendors and I still can get it to load so I can use it.
I got mine stuck under my ship approximately 10 seconds after getting in it the first time.
OK challenge accepted to who can get the most stuck.
They added drivable vehicles?? or is this a mod?
Very first thing I did was drop I into the lake. Lol
So if you dock at a station does it just... Launch into space?
Just boost to fix yourself.
Did you try turning it on and off?
Ahhh, relatable. You must drive like Shepard.
Damn it Austin!
What is that?! Are vehicles in the game??
I thought I had it stuck at one point. Was pressing all the buttons and accidentally found out that Y makes it boost straight up
What what happened, I'm gone for 4 days and something happened.
I see your problem, ain't got no gas in it.
Was this a free addition or a paid mod?
Man I see it. Look close at the driver: Head pointed straight forward at an unspecified distant focal point, a moment taken and wielded as a refusal to move, knowing full well, and *at this moment,* that the disposition he has caused his famously anticipated, brand, new, and untested vehicle to assume - an inexcusable one - has caused only to place both them, *and* their prestigious coche, in straits that chafe a gentleman professionals sensibilities. Tut tut I say. And bravo.
Need more roads and traffic for major cities
What is that?! 😯
Now they need to add to be able to get out into space after we disable the engine on a ship and jump with the rover on the enemy ship 😂 or to be able to get it out into some asteroid belt for mining 🤔 or maybe a mod will do this
Took me less than 30 seconds to get it stuck between some trees. If you switch ships though it comes right back!!
I havent been able to get one to show up and ive supposedly paid for it 37 times and says it will spawn when i land.   Nothing.... even switched to a different ship and paid for another giving me the same notice that i have access and it will spawn when i land.   Doesnt allow me to select activate. 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️.  Just another useless bethesda update.
There's vehicles now? Haven't been able to play since the wifi been out due to weather
Hadda lay her down hoss
Wait what? Cars available? It's the main reason why I quit playing months ago!
Can’t wait to try it out
With a controller on PC it's 'B' to exit the vehicle.
Won't work for me I have to jump somewhere.
Me or a bug?
Pity as the car is brilliant
Put it in 4x4!
I had fun driving on planets. I got in trouble trying to drive in Jemison. No more
Do NPCs use the buggy??
Even more reasons to compare it to the Mako
Does this update mess with mods on pc? (Probably yes)
Wait... there is vehicles now????
It was just a regular patch that added this, right?
It's no Skyrim horse. But it still gets around
Anyone else had a problem with the game crashing on pc since the update?
Lmao I’m sorry bro this looks like it’s on you. Did you manage to get it free?
Yep, trapped mine in a crevasse on earth. It was fun boosting about.
It also runs over citizens and security with ZERO hesitation. Had to learn that the hard way in Akilla City
"I know what's wrong with it, It ain't got no gas in it"
I like how mining with the gun on this thing is a game changer
you can not park there
theres fucking cars?! when did they drop??
"what where you doing?" 

Nothing

"Don't lie"

I'm not

" You were trying to jump it over the plaza weren't you"

......

"I miss the terrormorphs"
Wait, there is cars in the game?
First thing ima Do is run over some ashta. Show akilia city how its done
You can drive?
Glad you’re in the fleet. If you weren’t, I would’ve double parked you already.
My buggy doesn't spawn when I bought it, not on 2 different characters. Is it cause I have Creation Club mods installed?
Just saw this new comment on loading screen:  "Driving vehicle within city limits is frowned on by local authorities. And Sarah." So they get it. Loving the vehicle! So much fun to drive (in wide open spaces). Thank you, Bethesda.
It’s not supposed to be there lmao
I'm gonna try to drive up the mast
I can't believe with all the terrain going on in the game that they didn't make it a hovercar. Make that shit automatically hover a few feet above the ground so it don't get stuck, in fact, gimme a hoverboard and everything gonna be alright
WHAAAAT?! when did they add rovers?
Do they really shorten the time of travel to temples? How’s that boost? I can’t wait to try tonight when I come back from work.
Is this a mod or did I miss an update?
I actually downloaded mods and I can't deny this game is awesome with mods (some paid most from nexus)
I was jumping all over and through Akila earlier. So much fun landing on anything with it haha. On console too no mods. Can’t wait for pc with nexus mods. Such a game changer
Sarah Morgan did NOT like that
Samir… You’re breaking the car!!!
I get stuck and I can't get out the vehicle. I'm so stuck I have to load last save. Now I save before getting behind the wheel lol
What mod is that?
Is there a new skill tree for driving or combined or no bonuses when driving/navigation around?
Damn! They added rovers?!? I sold my XBox a couple months ago. Looks like i gotta get another one 😭
I managed to launch mine into the atmosphere somehow (not literally but I was very high up)
Hahahaha!! Me tooo! Except I got it stuck inside my ship, lol!!
It’s crazy driving it, I feel like I’m playing rocket league lol
Username checks out
Driving around on a moon and I got high-centered. Had to reload.
And again… it just works
Got mine stuck in my grav-drive (don't ask). I couldn't dismount, fast travel, or get out. I was able to boost-shimmy out after not too long, thankfully... Sarah said she disliked that...
Damn!!! Good to know I'm not the only one. Lol
The mods gonna be so good.

Need someone to Mako me
How many mods were broken in the process of this update though 🤔
Just wait until they allow you to build your own rovers. Or give them tracks. Guarantee someone’s going to build a tank larger than most ships.
Same experience here, bought it, went on ship, got off ship, spawned glitched in a barricade, oh Todd you did it again you little rascal!
I updated my game and now I can’t interact with anything or anyone. Wtf. Can’t talk to any npcs, board ships, kiosks… nothing.
cant wait for the mod that able to upgrade the laser on the buggie, and also steer by keyboard only, not by mouse
How do I get a vehicle in game for lane missions ?
Achievement unlocked : “Help me Step Bro”
is it boring or is the second coming of skyrim horses?
Why r u driving in Atlantis?
Find the strangest places imaginable to get stuck. Make us question physics.
When did this drop???
Yeah that's why most Bethesda games don't have cars.
Aye! You can't park there!
Is that a mod or can you actually finally get one?
They added buggies?
It's great that they added a vehicle, but they need another update to make it not handle like a piece of shit.
Hold up, they're still actually working on this game?
Looks like someone needs to lay off the Space Chablis
Okay but WHY would you need to ride in a car on New Atlantis? It's obviously for moons and shit not a populated congested city. Don't blame Bethesda for this one!
When you run them over do they go splat?
Wait the vehicles are available in game already?
They run directly INTO it while screaming “Run away!!” 

10/10
Username … checks out?
Does it count as a crime though and you get bounty applied to you? Cuz if it doesn't in going to run over everyone tomorrow!
I have to try this myself. I did a short spin on a low grav moon and took a few flights. trying to find a way to see if I can send it to space!
At least they're running.  Usually you fire rounds and they're oblivious lmao.
Do people react to you shooting in town yet?
The verse has just witnessed the return of a terror only known of in old tales of Earth-That-Was, the dreaded Mustang driver.
Wrex.
I'm commander Shepard, and this is my favorite store in New Atlantis.
I want to drive it horizontally through a gap to have less trouble with geth armatures
Time to hop in the party Mako.
Report to the ship as soon as possible…
Hehe my character is called Shepherd
looooooool
So wait, everytime you land it just plops out?
Ah Bethesda at its finest.
I didn't realize it was a Nissan buggy. Sweet, time to go terrorize the streets!
Yeah pretty surprising for a Bethesda Rpg, this is a real advancement that they are trying on the engine. Eventually they can build an entire city with roads and vehicles.
They probably deleted it by now lol
Is it just a tiny person with a big hat?
I remember people saying that vehicles would never work in starfield unless they floated above the ground because of something about how the game engine renders the ground or how they didn't build the game with vehicles in mind or something like that... well here they are.
Yup, nope, never leaving the house with ONLY a flamethrower.
An aliens mod would be so cool, especially with pulse rifles and xenomorphs
In that case, just nuke 'em from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.
WTF!? Cringe!
Ima go see how long it takes me to end up in the water on Neon.
Always appears outside of your current ship.
Purchase at the ship services rep.
Is this buggy thing vanilla or a mod?
illegally underrated comment
>This little baby is gonna be a bug masterclass.

It's very *Forza Horizon*. And given how glitchy Playground Games titles are at launch and their habit of doing crossover events, I wouldn't be surprised if the REV-8 is already in *Forza Horizon 5*.
I can't wait for a modder to turn it into a terrormorph body.
Can't wait until someone gets it to the top of MAST.
I couldn’t and needed to reload.
Need a modder to bring over GTA's Atomizer over to Starfield.
Regular driving isn't blistering fast. It does have boosters though. And a cannon. And jump jets.
Found the UGA football player
it feels like ass tbh
25,000
25k I think, could've been 250k but 25k makes more sense
Should be on both.  It was an update today from Bethesda before the Shattered Space DLC in September.
Yep. Make sure you download the update first then visit a ship tech to buy it
For sure, I hit the boost button three times and ended up there. Tooling around NA wasn’t a great idea to begin with.
Yes.
Update released at 5p EST today.
Sloppy! Loose and sloppy.
Agree on all those points.
It doesn’t do damage when you run over a creature as well, was trying to do a gta 1 gotcha on it! They will likely fix this though
Go to settings and select "Traditional" for vehicle steering and that will fix point number one.
I think the fact there's a "vehicles" menu and dialogue option with the services tech heavily, heavily suggests that there are going to be more vehicles, probably Creations, and of course other free mods on Nexus and the like. This is like the basic option.
This is what I want to know. Can I drive it into a vehicle bay or does it have to stay at an out post or what?
Should spawn next to your ship. If it’s not appearing it’s most likely a conflict with a mod.
Yup...over here too...attempting binding to something else and nothing.
Haven’t seen that one yet. Can you fast travel?
Should be on both Xbox and pc.
Fast travel has worked for some of you get stuck.
Yes, today but the offering is limited to one rover.
It’s spawns automatically next to your ship once you exit.
I rocked that thing for a while and just got myself more stuck. Reloaded and went to a wide open space, much better now.
I’m sure they’ll add more customization and functionality with the expansion as well as in Creations.
if it were we’d both be fools
It’s faster than walking. The dynamics are wonky but it’s more fun than running around.
Should spawn next to your ship. If it’s not appearing it’s most likely a conflict with a mod.
No.
Update game, see ship services rep, pay 25,000 and vehicle shows up next to ship. If this doesn’t work you might have a mod that is conflicting.
Update released at 5p EST today.
Update released at 5p EST today
Update released at 5p EST today.
Yes, new update released today, but only one rover available and no customization aside from color change.
Yes, rover added in today’s update.
Yes, new update has a basic rover.
Good one!
Update > visit space services rep > pay 25,000. Rover spawns next to ship, if it doesn’t show up there is probably a mod conflict.
Yes, new update today offers a basic rover.
Do you have any mods installed?
Straight, no mods!
Today’s update provides a basic rover.
Do you have any mods installed? That has been the root of all functional issues mentioned in this chat.
New rover in the game
Land. Go to ship. Look to to right of ship. If purchased, it’ll be there. Not useless at all actually a game changer.
As hard as is it to say, this thing is better than a horse. And I love Skyrim horses. Looooove them
Yesterdays update.
Yes, basic rover is now a standard feature
That made me chuckle, thank you!!
I'm not sure specifically what mods are causing the issue. I have the Vulture campaign installed and nothing else and have no problems.
Yesterdays update! It’s basic but fun.
It’s a messy drive but faster than a jet pack. Yes, horizontal and vertical boost.
New update came out yesterday.
I’ve read about that happening. Do you have any mods installed?
No mod, new update yesterday!
Negative.
Most to all?
Only script based since those are based on version number.
i haven’t personally experienced, other than when i was first opening the game i got that audio bug that makes everything quiet but ive been getting. but its a pretty easy fix :D
Using any mods?
Same
Defs worth getting a controller for PC gaming, I started a few years ago and never looked back
Laser is useless... On Akila, you need more than 10 shots to kill a small Ashta... but a mod will probably change that quickly.

\[EDIT\] It's already here : [https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/11058](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/11058)

More damages and... your vehicule is now a cargo, great for mining !
yes
Tuesday.
Standard game feature.z
Update dropped today, free update with patch
Just today.  The Trailer for the REV-8 should be on the main Starfield sub.
Yep!
Yes and the UC guards will get pissed and start attacking. Not even kidding. Run everyone's ass over and rack up the bounty.
Yes the update was made available about an hour ago
And shattered space is coming next month and I'm fuckin buzzing for it
Aaahhhh Bethesda jank strikes again.
I ramped from the spaceport to the fountain area, and an NPC actually shouted "oh fuck!"
Idc what it actually is I can't see anything but "kills car" now 🤣
It does add to your bounty when you runover the people who jump infront of you and "die". I think it's an insurance scam.
Haven't gotten a chance to play the vehicle yet, will play tonight, but from what I've seen on YT, it definitely counts as murder and you will be shot at
sheparrrrd!
Named my last dog Wrex!!
Don’t worry McKay can fix it, just tell him there’s a ZPM at the end of that rainbow
Definitely have done that
We'll bang, okay?
Yes!
I was kind of hoping for a more immersive integration. Oh well, that’s what mods are for.
It's like your ship had a baby
this kind of things are features in Bethesda games, and i wouldn't want it other way
Imagine how dope it would be if we got motorcycles in the next fallout, there's so much potential there. 

Like, you find an old motorcycle laying around, and it isn't just set dressing, you can walk up, figure out what's wrong with it, replace shit by scavenging parts from other bikes, get it up and running, and cruise the wasteland in style.
Cyberpunk 2077
Heres hoping Fallout and to a lesser extent the Elder Scrolls have vehicles now.
There's a New Vegas mod with working vehicles. Skyrim has horses. This is just getting to the level of a decade old game made by the same company in the same engine.
How is it surprising? When have the ever restricted anything for the sake of practicality
Ah yes eventually they can catch up with everyone else.
It’s a dragon actually
Prolly like 2 sec cause the only path has an elevator
The bigger question is, can it float like a boat?
bet
Thank you ❤️
It's a ship module right? How's it look?
Wait, so it’s not a mod?
illegally parked comment
That would be awesome actually.
I could only hope...
Couldn't you have just hopped in your ship and gone into orbit, come back and it spawns back near the ship?
What if you stick some landmines underneath and let the explosion launch it like battlefield?
Pressing Y (Xbox) makes it boost straight up like a rocket.
Oh I'm so in.
Do you know if it is related to the Boost perk/skill?  

If not, I wonder if there will be a separate Perk/skill for the Rover just like the ship
What would you change?
Phew. I can definitely afford that. And i only have to buy one?
I was going to say. I could buy a whole mew ship for that
lol!
Looking forward to all the vehicles mods/tweaks to come from this though
My thoughts as well. Whether or not intended, I kinda like the jankiness. Trying to get a feel for the jank will be entertaining.  It'll give me something to do while traveling between PoIs, along with ramping every ridge and running over wildlife. I was also excited that you can switch back and forth between 1st and 3rd person. And scan wildlife while driving. 

Can't wait until people start posting Biome Complete speedruns of surveying flora and fauna, starting from common landing zones like Akila City 😎
I may not have been clear enough. I did. I'm just recommending others try that as well
It travels with you and appears outside of your ship
i gotcha i gotcha, i was just wondering because I got the vehicle and played around with it, but when i was purchasing one of the text menus said something about a vehicle hanger or so i thought, dunno maybe i’m trippin.
I'm gonna have to look and see if there's a mod blocking it or something.
Ill send a screenshot of my mods and see if we can cross reference which mod we have in common.
Yeah for sure. Just annoyed I can't literally get out. 

I'm sure it's a mod breaking it.
plus i'm guessing it needs some help, heh.
A shame! But can't wait to try it out!!!
if  you just get out and fast travel away via your ship, does it automatically come with you?
Great.. I’m gonna update today.. but please tell me that we can take our vehicle to different planets
Well shit guess I'm not playing Cyberpunk tonight.. is it tied to the ship somehow?
Oh ok. Haven’t touched the game since release, was just pondering if I wanted to give it another chance
Oh good to know thank you
I must update my game then, Ill look tonight. Thanks :)
Thanks for the info.  Don’t run any mods so I should be good to go!
oh yeah. I'm seeing if disabling them, buying it, then reloading them works
Yeah I have the community patch mod which sounds like the problem.
:o :o :o :o :o :o
Ive done that at least 37 times.  It never shows up.  Even deleted the game and reinstalled it and still nothing.
Had to disable my mods, and load into the game and buy it and then re enable my mods
well there go my week.
Of course they are and most the authors don’t update in time so I have to get rid of/ delete save games that were working fine until Bethesda breaks their own coding adding one thing
I couldn’t even load my save from last night and I have 24days played with over 130 mods..
Yes. Mods updated too via the creation menu.
I know it’s a mod causing the issue.
Agreed!!
WHERE DO I GET ONE PLEASE TELL ME
This is the main Starfield sub.
Should I save beforehand?
All fun and games till you figure out you fat fingered F6 Instead of F5 and your last save was when you stepped into unity 8 hours ago.
Thanks.
Really? I didn't even know it was available
F ing Finally!!!! Now to see all the ways they screwed up this vehicle to make it only slightly better than walking with a jetpack...

Edit : I have experienced the StarField Space Buggy....

I'm impressed 😏 👍🏾 😁
And now the wait for all my 250 mods to update.
Oh wow!
Yeah and upon entering the menu to buy the rev, I'm met with my 500 vanilla+mod ship parts instead... I gotta check my lo.
Wait so Bethesda invented Deer?
Hmm, well sounds like a quick save then drive!
I should go
[Grunt.](https://youtu.be/Pj6iDczCDOI?si=OV2Xy7YffJlUSbNe)
Grunt!
Did that on my first playthrough. I love the Mako, despite all its flaws and hate.
Would be neat if you could walk into a ship cargo bay and drive it off yourself…
I mean "Loading Bays" that we can't load. Just saying BSG.
The only thing that makes me hesitant on that is that then they have to justify the bike, which means there will be a lot more empty areas. 

For example, in Fallout 4 at the run speed (not sprinting), you can go from the upper left corner to the lower right corner of the map in just 15 minutes, which implies that you can get to anywhere on the map (as the crow flies) in about 8 minutes on your own two feet. Considering how many locations and other things there are, thats a really dense map. 

If we assumed that that amount of content is the limit for Bethesda (after all, I dont think Starfield has that much more raw content (i.e. assets, items, quests, etc.) than fallout 4), would it really be better if everything was spaced further apart?
Sounds Like Project Zomboid
GTA actually.
Further proof that you can never talk about Bethesda/Starfield without someone being up Cyberpunk.  It's legitimately impossible.
Elder Scrolls has had horses since oblivion
That elevator is pretty big. It might fit.
I'm sure it will once people make mods for it
I mean, you can't really swim in this game to begin with, just walk through waist deep water.
Yes it can, someone already posted about it! All terrain!
Is it a ship module or do you just buy it?
It doesn't show up on the ship itself.
Knowing Bethesda and their reputation for bugs, the *Starfield* update containing the REV-8 probably put it into *Forza Horizon 5* completely unintentionally.
Yeah, that would have made more sense.
Someone has played Elite
Maybe just fast travel to the cockpit and back?
A+ for creativity!
Ah, that’s too bad
I frequently click past messages and am left wondering what I missed.
Half-assed implementation, so very shocked.
I just disabled and attempted to no avail.
Someone in this thread found that it was a nexus hud mod. Others might be causing it
Yeah, that would have worked too!
Yeap, it will spawn everywhere you land your ship… and it also float in water
Yes, it automatically spawns next to your ship. Update game > visit ship services > pay 25,000 > if ship doesn’t show up next to your ship there is a mod conflicting with it.
There have been some pretty decent updates in the last 6 months, it’s worth a revisit.
They added a new thing to the game. Mods could not account for the existence of said new thing because it did not exist in the code before now. How tf is this “Bethesda breaking their own game”? 

God you BGS haters need to seek help.
if you haven’t cleared reserve data yet i recommend disabling all mods, quitting the game, open and re able all of them, and just hit continue. that should fix it (it’s fixed almost all of mine). if not then todd howard did it again
Most modders won't have had time to patch for the latest update tbh
Save before you do *anything* questionable
Silly question was my snap decision but then knowing it's Bethesda I can't even be sure that would be a crime coded in
Yeah, crime gets expensive lol
I drove through a town for a bit and didn't get any bounty. Even flattened a security guard twice
Fukd
At that point I think I'd just either be a mass murderer in that universe or step through the unity again asap lol
It’s slightly better than a jet pack. You kinda just fling yourself around.
twist: the vehicle has a jet pack!
It's basically a jetpack in how it functions
It is not better than the jet pack, at least with my initial playing with it. Jetpack is faster and easier to navigate with, and the car easily gets stuck and struggles with terrain. The controls on the car are awful and have very limited options for remapping.

Edit: I see I'm not the only one struggling with the controls - https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1expquw/rover_controls_need_a_decoupled_freelook_and/
Not sure what is going on here, the rev is not in the ship parts menu. It's right on the front menu with modify a ship or buy a ship or buy a car
No, John deere invented deer to run in front of vehicles so they could sell more. They dropped the e so people wouldn't make the connection
Do I sound like that?
I was hoping for this as well. But I’ll take it at this point. Walking everywhere is just stupid.
There's a lot of options there. 

For example: NV was a smaller map than 4, with lots of stuff everywhere, but I've used a mod that added a motorcycle before, and it felt right at home. 

That's because of how the map is laid out; you can't really straight line anywhere, and that makes routes longer. So some similar map trickery would be great. (I can also see that being easy if the next fallout takes place in certain locations; for example, I've always wanted to see a fallout game in New Orleans, and swamps could definitely give you that effect. 

Further:

Skyrim had horses, and a bigger map than F04, with slightly less content, and didn't feel empty.
I say go for it. Make areas that require either vehicle travel to get to quickly and safely or foot travel to really drag the process on and put them at risk of whatever dangers are (more) easily bypassed with a vehicle. This will discourage people from venturing into advanced areas, but still leave the option open, should they feel adventurous. How cool would it be to have a vehicle break down or run out of fuel in a dangerous area? It would give the game a whole new element of survival. 

I’ve recently been playing the 2015 Mad Max game and I love the feeling of being so exposed when you get out of your vehicle to salvage some roadside scrap. You’re stooping down to pick up something… and suddenly you hear the sound of an engine approaching. You run back to your vehicle and peel out just before the crazies are upon you! It’s a cool, immersive feeling!
I said cyberpunk because of how buggy it was at launch os 100% gonna be how a bethesda city with driving cars and such will be. Just completely broken
Either works. Cyberpunk has a much more detailed and advanced structured city then what we have seen in gta
Honestly, I only brought it up because, like CD Project Red, Bethesda has zero experience with large cities where npcs can drive and massive crowds.  

The resulting issues like despawning traffic and npcs vanishing randomly will probably happen if Bethesda ever attempted it
We will get carts now probably.
No mod necessary it floats, it’s literally like a boat. I’m floating around the lake in new Atlantis
You can swim and it also floats and acts like a boat, it’s just slower than on land.
Just buy it. New option in the ship services screen.
Ahh that’s a shame
Bet the haters gonna leap on that haha
You can’t fast travel while in the vehicle, tried it!
Killed what little interest I had in the thing honestly, especially since they also ruined ship building with this update.
I got mine to work when loading the game with no mods..
I think the issue is the mod that displays your current starborn power on the UI. It’s interfering with the rover.
🥹🥹
Oh yeah didn't think about mods... Oh well guess we will find out.
Ok I’ll give it the ole Cyberpunk treatment and give it another go. Hopefully it goes as well 🤣
I hate their ridiculous arguments so much I stg. These fuckwits think "This game sucks!" and at the same time get mad when Bethesda improves it because "It broke my mods!". They're fucked in the head.
It fixed some and I was able to load In but yeah I’m definitely gonna have to wait for mod updates and then clear my cache again or ng+ might help too because it resets everything
True.
Accidentally didn't skip the main quest so you need to find a way to pay off the bounty or struggle every lodge revist.
Now that's the Bethesda I know and sort of like most of the time.
Same.
🤔🤔🤔 .... 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨 I guess I'll take a look in 5 to 6 business months.
😐😐😐😐😐😐💀💀💀
* Bruh Moment * For Bethesda 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨 The Space Buggy might as well be a dang mod. Or Bethesda creates a shit vehicle and modders fix 🙄🙄🙄
Bingo. "I'd like to view my vehicles." And instead it's filled with all my ship parts and no Rev. Both vanilla and mod ship parts. Xbox. I may have to disable them all to see if it fixes it then see if I can enable them without a loss of data(which I doubt) I may just have go back b4 the ship mods.
I SHOULD go
TBF, I honestly thought the content density of Skyrim wasnt ideal, and its one of the reasons why I prefer the Fallout games, because they feel denser and more lively. But thats a rather subjective opinion. 

And New Vegas is a decent point.
My experience with CP2077 at launch was fairly decent.  Driving wasn't my favorite thing, but I beat the game and had fun.  

Trying to do my second playthrough now and having different fun, but is nice to see vehicles on the bridges.  Having fun turning enemies into pin-cushions in record speed whilst crying when fighting invisible enemies and missing loot
it's higher resolution, I don't find better graphics to be innovative over GTA's design, especially since GTA has always a more responsive environment. Better graphics are to be expected from games 8 years apart.
For one, the lane aren't absurdly wide. The lanes in GTAV are pretty wide, being that you can drive between two cars on a 2 lane road.
Cool, now if they'd let us make outposts on water it'd be of more use
Not spawning for whatever reason, really hoping some mod isn’t messing with it already

Do you have to take off and land again or does it just show up?
Yeah, I'd make one myself but I don't know how to change the spawning scripts.
dang...im in no luck land...now I find out glitching is out for ship building...
The Bethesda I know and enjoy sometimes
I did some more playing with it, the car is faster if you are on something like Earth where the terrain is open and smooth. Anything with tougher terrain will still be faster and easier with a skip pack and personal atmosphere. 

I do hope in a future update they give more control options for the car, I would rather it drive like any other car from any other game. The steering is very strange where it steers where you look instead of where you are actually steering.
I should *go*
I felt like Skyrim pulled it off because getting places for the first time kinda felt like a challenge in itself. Like, leaving whiterun for winter hold for the first time; you leave the plains and you pause to look at the mountains up ahead, knowing it's gonna be a challenging journey. 

I will admit it does get lackluster after the first couple playthroughs.
I played CP2077 on PC day 1 and it had a few glitches but it was absolutely playable and fun.
My experience at launch was driving at any semblance of high speed despawned all traffic
Same.
Stadia (RIP) was doing the job, near flawlessly for me, before I got my 3000 series card.
I would like to see more interiors in gta,
No the actual structure of the city and its layout is better and feels more believable gta is just a basic grid. It looks good plays good, makes a believable LA but it’s not on the same level design as cyberpunk.
You have to purchase it from ship services first
Just shows up.
found the issue.   
I had to disable some HUD Nexus mods

[https://imgur.com/a/reg1cZq](https://imgur.com/a/reg1cZq)
Ah, so it has Borderlands steering.
I should go?
My biggest issue was looting robot corpses, had to grab from the bottom of the list or else it bugged out....... if it didn't bug out from the get go
Me three. Had a blast with no game-changing bugs. The glitches were honestly funny. 

It feels surreal to me when people talk about how broken they think it was at launch.
Might have been the same for me, but I never noticed unless I was on a bridge........ alone
I find the opposite to be true. Found cyberpunk to be lifeless with the exception of areas based on telling two parts of the main story, and absurdly created. A downgrade in design from the Witcher 3's Novograde. Seems to me they slapped a few Japantown, Chinatown, and Americatown esthetics together and called it a day. San Andreas feels like California. Cyberpunk seems forced and clumsy
Right okay gotcha, so I’ve purchased it, but it doesn’t appear anywhere after. Do you think it’s bugged or am I missing something obvious?
I'm gonna try mine out with the HUD ones tonight...thanks
I've never played borderlands but it has a very LEGO game driving. If the rear of the car is facing forward, if you press up on the joystick you go backwards. Turn get the car facing forward then press up and you'll go forward.
Cyberpunk is DEFINITELY way more lifeless. It felt practically empty in a lot of areas and the pedestrians you see are there to just walk around on the street, that and you can go 20 feet and see the same person three times still. In GTA, people will greet you when you’re walking by them, are doing exercises, playing games, on their phones, a whole lot of stuff besides just walking in a line on the side of the road.
Hmmm..that does sound weird.
Did you get yours working?
Got it to work. If anybody is having a similar problem, go ahead and disable the community patch for now
Yes! That was totally it...had one of the HUD mods...disabled and loving this little buggy...thank you!
35 years from now, this will still haunt him. 
Bro. 
Autopilot for sure. The guy who brought the chair tapped him on the shoulder and pointed at the chair. If someone places a chair directly behind me and does that, I'm sitting down lol. Just as an automatic reflex. Especially when he's in an unfamiliar, high pressure environment! He realized very quickly. 

I think it's funny and not mega cringey. Embarrassing though but I could see myself doing that! With that said, it's almost a wholesome cringe in a way. Maybe because it's not disgusting or super negative like most of the cringes we see now.
It's funny and a little embarrassing, but really not a big deal. I don't think that would haunt him and it shouldn't.
This cringe is like the cheeseburger from *The Menu*. 

After years of endless posts of racist twitch streamers, cheap political gaffs, and low effort Tok toks, this place finally found a perfect cringe that goes back to the roots of this sub : someone doing something embarrassing and it being caught on camera.

This is delicious.
Video is gone, anyone got another link?
Eh he got up quickly it’s fine
Perfect example of someone reacting without thinking while in a distracted state. Nothing cringe about this and nothing that will or should “haunt him”…
This is a nothingburger
ℹ️ Try [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangeAndFunny/comments/1eh2ywf/here_bro_i_brought_you_a_chair/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) for another video source, although as what is presumably officially licensed Olympic Games footage, it will probably get taken down automatically from absolutely everywhere (here, YouTube etc) except somewhere dodgy and unpoliced like Rumble or whatever.

P.S. [**Here**](https://youtu.be/FhrEvfYUcz8?si=4l4WZIdbcGCgFm8U) is one of the few YouTube versions that has actual video rather than just a clickbait title and only a series of still photos. It probably won't last up there for long either, so if someone is especially keen on preserving a cringe video they might want to lift and upload it to Rumble or somewhere else totally lawless.
That's not that bad. Maybe a little embarrassing but no harm no foul
This is that good cringe that you can think back on and laugh at yourself, not hate yourself for.
 Why would he think it was for him lmao
I don't feel this is too bad, he got up pretty quickly. if I was that guy I'd own this moment and send the video to friends and be like "look at me being an oblivious idiot at the Olympics"
Video is gone what happened?
That’s hilarious
Good thing they had a chair tester on site
Am I missing something? I don't get what's cringe. Sorry, it's probably just because I'm tired.
I did something like this once at work and it still haunts me to this day. One coworker dragged a wheeled cooler close to me and as soon as he set it down I just absentmindedly sat on it. Another coworker was waiting for him to set it down so he could grab a drink out of it and just says “did you really just do that” 

Yeeeeeesh
He just wanted to warm it up for her. Chivalrous.
Should have just refused to get up.  Crosses his arms, shakes his head no at the fencer.  Proceeds to smoke a cigarette
Why thank you kind sir, yes I will take a seat my legs are tired.
Video has  been taken down. What was it about? Any other links?
Normalise always putting context in the title so we can find it once it gets deleted
Honestly, I’d be surprised if I still remembered this 35 minutes from now.
Duuuuuuude
Would have been more cringe if he refused to get up.
It’s definitely funny! I hope the chick is ok thoooo
I think he'll just laugh about it tbh
What’s wrong with her? Do injuries happen often in fencing?
“Haunt” him?… you sure OP? He accidentally sat down and got up?.. big deal.
Thanks for reminding me to unsub. I don’t need to be this bored on a regular basis
I’m ngl, didn’t even notice until the comments lol. It all looked fairly normal.
OMG That poor guy! 😂😂
I didn't even notice until I read the comments. I thought he was a medic or something and needed a chair to sit down and help her.
bro hit the wrong button
Ol "Don't mind if do!" head ahh
Low bar for what qualifies as cringe these days, huh?
Really? Random dude walks up from behind taps you on shoulder then points at a chair he placed right behind you.
This isn’t cringe…
He should have sat her on his lap
Right, and knowing that millions of people are watching would heighten anxiety quite a bit.
He was just testing to see if it was structurally sound enough to put the injured person on safely is all
For me this gets back to the original meaning of the word and the sub. Just stuff that makes you feel secondhand embarrassment. Not assholes being assholes, or politicians being shitty, just a well-intentioned fuckup that everyone saw.
It wasn't a big deal when eight-year-old me farted loudly in class, but it haunts me 35 years later.
It's just a tiny misunderstanding at a crazy, internationally televised event. Not cringe.
And he knew it too! That head rub at the end, oh god it hurt to watch. I could *feel* the cringe.
I was so ready for this to be mocking an athlete who had something happen. I was not ready for the sheer beauty of a man autopiloting his ass in a chair
Go get some fresh air
It’s not even that bad
Great analogy btw
Try [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangeAndFunny/comments/1eh2ywf/here_bro_i_brought_you_a_chair/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), although as what is presumably officially licensed Olympic games footage, it will probably get taken down automatically from absolutely everywhere except somewhere dodgy and unpoliced like Rumble or whatever.
That was my take, he got up too quick to even remember this tomorrow
It was a knee-jerk reaction while he was already distracted. Pretty similar response to those videos where someone will hand over strange items to coworkers when they're on the phone.
Dude tapped him on the shoulder and said “here’s a chair”. That totally feels like an invitation.
Also, with all of the other commenters on this. I’m pretty sure there is very strict rules when it comes to bystanders and where they are supposed to be at during the event especially when it comes to fencing. So an Olympic official comes up to you, you sort of just follow along.
Agreed. Guy is a legend
Random dude that sat in the chair instead of the injured athlete it was brought out for. Nothing major.
Dude it’s cool, take a seat kick your feet up
Nuanced cringe is an acquired taste
No, that’s legitimate trauma. I still remember every kid who farted in class. And I graduated high school LAST century.
Bro…

In 10th grade this girl had just broken up with me. We had the same final-class of the day together so I was trying to be *extra moopy* that day.

Well I feel asleep with my head down. 

I woke up to the class, including said ex-gf, pointing and laughing at me. A few seconds of being awake, I felt this steady *rumble under my ass*.

Welp, I’d started farting in my sleep and was *still farting* (same fart) 4 seconds after I lifted my head.

When I realized I was farting, I stood up, left all my bags in the room, walked straight out of school (open campus), went to the mall, bought a movie ticket, and watched a movie *just* so I could hide from the world.

Skipped that class for 2-3 days.

The worst part wasn’t even the ex-gf laughing, it was the *teacher* pointing and laughing; a teacher who was the butt of allllll the jokes by students and other faculty.

I had taken his place (… for a week then it faded… like a fart in the wind, thankfully).
I got one better. I met Dr Dre in person and called him Ice Cube when I was 14. I asked for his autograph he signed Ice cube. My friend then stepped up and he asked if he wanted Ice cubes autograph as well. He said no because your Dr Dre..
lol what?? Y’all are wildin

The man brushed off his hair. It was a split second… I doubt he even realized it, he was focused on the athlete 

I watched the video twice because of the comment above yours, and yours. 

It’s a funny video but it’s not even remotely as cringe as y’all are saying 
Thanks
That and he was doing the right thing in the first place so I think the cringe part gets outweighed by that too.
Ohhhhhh okay. Now I get it. Thank youuuuu!
Oh lordy lordy, that is the plan, my friend. Just got the kiddo to bed after a hectic day. Thanks so much. You enjoy your night!
I remember the kid who shit himself in class forty years ago. If I remember it there’s no way he doesn’t.
What about my college professor who called roll and the person after me was "Mr. Weiner" and I was the only person immature enough to giggle. Then the sheer terror of being the only one to laugh sent me into hysterics and I had to leave the room to calm down.
I’m one of those kids (see my ⬇️ or ⬆️ comment)
lol me too … this is a nothing burger. I do more stupid stuff on a near daily basis
This thread cracks me up. I suspect you can tell who does and does not have some form of anxiety based on how they interpret his actions. For me watching that I damned near have a panic attack. But for a whole lot of other people its no biggy. Its pretty interesting.
Actually, that makes a pretty great story. Although, I'm sure in the moment it was mortifying.
When I got my first job at a bookstore at 17 a customer asked for a Playboy and I laughed :(
Is this cheating? It feels like cheating
Decided to make a ship with a hollow center (from front view and top view) to minimize how much i get shot. Its working REALLY well
No, this is pod racing!
The ship looks cool, not your fault the AI is dumb.
Being more technically advanced than your enemy is not cheating.
Definitely an exploit.  But it’s a single player game, so who cares.

Edit:
It’s an exploit, simply because it’s exploiting poor programming.  Doesn’t matter how poor quality the programming is, how poor the testing was, or how easy it would be to correct (target cockpit always, etc.) Doesn’t even matter what the intentions of the player is.
Cheating no. A perfectly valid use of a game mechanic to avoid damage? Yes. All you're doing is taking advantage of the enemy ship AI's default targeting mechanic. Since enemy ships always by default target the centre mass of your total ship build, making sure that there isn't actually anything in the spot to hit is simply taking advantage of an exploit. But you're not cheating. No codes or modification of the base game is needed. No clipping or other such cheat methods. You just made a flaw in the Enemy Ship AI work to your advantage.
There is a 46 level reactor? Which vendor sells it? Most I've seen is 40 so far.
Dude, who fucking cares, that ship wins fashion forever.

Like, there are exploits. Such as mounting a bunch of empty modules on your ship to throw off enemy aim, but, no, this looks like an actual design. It's pretty damn cool looking.
Can you share the design please. It's beautiful and cool as hell!
If the AI is so dumb that you become invulnerable just by removing center mass, I almost feel like you ought to abuse it - if only to bring it to BGS' attention.    
It might even get fixed somewhere around 2029.
I really like the look of your ship, so exploit or not, it's awesome!
The devs themselves made use of this tactic, so I don't see it getting patched anytime soon (hopefully).

https://old.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/17eddxd/so_even_the_bethesda_developers_even_useshow_the/
Build template???

Vid is a bit dark but would love to build something similar in design
It’s not cheating. It’s Innovation!
gives me star trek vibes but i cant pin it to a particular ship
it's beautiful
Now THIS is "Innovative Gameplay"
Huh. Ai exploits. Its programmed to shoot in center of mass i think. 

The problem with space combat in this game is:

"Upgrade all skills install best gear (railgun is my jam cause distance) and auto-win every fight"

...

...

...

 But if i realy gona think about it, its a problem for every single open world (and many NOT open world except Doom Eternal and Elden Ring probably) game that exist ever.
Never liked this exploit because all the ships people built looked stupid af.. this one has changed my mind 👌👍
Have heard of a build just like this and it kicked arse, perfectly acceptable in my opinion 🖖respect
I'm still using vanquisher III....400+ hours and haven't touched ship building yet 🙄
It's the first design of this type that actually looks good.
Show me how to do this witchcraft!
Agreed with those that call it an exploit. Cheating sure, but only yourself if you care. 

But if Bethesda games weren't wracked with technical issues these exploits wouldn't exist. 

So you play it your way.
Well played !!
Do you have a build tutorial or something for this? This is probably the best looking invincible build I've seen
They really need to tweak the AI so they always target a subsystems rather than just center mass.

Default they can target grav drive, and higher level AI might go for engines (eg pirates trying to board or whatever).
From one perspective, you're exploiting the bad programming in the game.

From ***my*** perspective, you're exploiting your enemy pilots' reliance on bad auto-targeting.
It's cheesy, but you do you.
Cheating? Yes, but as it's single player you're only cheating yourself out of a challenge so who cares

I imagine that Bethesda will change it so that the AI targets the cockpit or landing bay. As every ship must have them. Or a modder will do it and it will be a must have mod for most of the community
I like how the AI has perfect aim….dead center every time
Their fault for sucking at aiming
As long as you're having fun, it is not cheating. In my opinion.
The people who have developed starfield figured that out before it was released. They made their own ships in similar fashion to explain. Not cheating. Part of the game.
No way. You built the ship with their resources. This is honestly a must-build technique in order to survive high-level fights. I usually build a long sideways leg with a landing gear in order to push the ship off center, and I can take out the entire defense of the key singlehandedly. Long-range weaponry and high maneuverability are also important, though.
TBH, and perhaps thinking too much like an engineer, this is actually quite realistic depending on the targeting system and the sensor info that feeds it.  Raw Radar for example might send a Kalman filtered centroid track to the targeting control system and this most likely would actually happen IRL.  I can say this from an experienced perspective.

That said, I agree with others, its an exploit but for a single player game, if it makes you smile and have fun, go for it!
you do you. AI is designed to shoot center of mass, so it’s it’s a void, nothing will get hit (a big ‘ole empty box outline always wins)
The only thing that seems unfair is how sexy your ship is.
There was a few videos not long after the game was released of people literally making ships in the shape of a cube to totally avoid being shot. 

There was even a dev video where they spoke about doing it while testing.
I mean it’s the coolest ship I’ve seen that’s exploiting the mechanic. Doesn’t seem too bad
Not only is it using a clever wrinkle in the game, but it does it while being a really cool looking ship! Gratz!

What's the mobility / top speed on it?
Ok. How looool
Very cool ship
I'm doing this as soon as I get home from work.
This ship looks cool. Makes me wanna load it back up for the first time in months to play it. Do you have a vid on how to make it?
I love that ship. Super cool looking. Did you glitch any parts?
Nah but it is awesome
Omg i hope they dont fix this lol this works too well
I did the same with a VA ruun ship
I've been thinking of trying out this exploit, but I planned on more of a u-shaped layout.  "Go long!"
You're a genius!
Looks cool af what ship parts are those?
how tf you getting 46 reactor
Looks great. You should share the design
That’s such a cool design, mind if I copy it a bit?
It just works.
Definitely not cheating, not even an exploit

Just shit game design to make a single hitbox for players ship and have AI only target the center of it
Gorgeous ship, just have fun with it!
The game is so easy, playing with anything but your original ship feels like cheating. 

Once you start down that path, might as well go crazy. Like they say, ain't no kill like overkill.
Kingdom Hearts 1 had literally this exact same trick so good to know bethesda are operating on the level of a ps2 game
Some people might call this "perfectly balanced"...
i removed all my auto weapons and downgraded the rest , it's boring like this

also that ship looks like smth batman would drive
Did you ever see the [cube ship](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/s/2cAQLpKofQ)? Nearly unbeatable, even though all components are exposed.
why didn't they just make enemies aim for the cockpit. every ship is guaranteed to have one.
That is a sexy build!
It just works!
This is the best looking exploit ship I’ve seen; only works front the immediate front/back though.
Yes.

But also, if I ever load the game up again, I now know how I'll be designing a "heavy fighter" for ship hunting.
its a Bethesda game, so its not cheating, its a feature.
In such a perfekt Game this must be the way Todd Howard intended us to play.
Damn! I would called it the Star Demon!
Works as intended. Your pc is just not good enough for the game to work as intended. /S
Kinda looks like the batwing! I must know how you built this
Dope
Dude I might use this on my playthrough 3 any chance for a tutorial?
Please....explain?
Its dope, howd you make it?
I’d love the build specs for this
How did you max out all stats? What is your reactor output?
I suck at the ships element to this game. I’m a run n gun plunderer, Harry.
Your ship looks like a ps2 controller.
No, this is podracing.
No, not cheating. I was planning on making a ship design like this too.
It's not cheating but cheesing.

AI is braindead as in every bethesda game, comparable to counterstrik <1.5 POD bots
It wouldn't be cheating, you are not changing the game for your benefit. I would call this an exploit. Now if your enemy targeting system is developed by Russia that's not your fault. Maybe their broke ass should go get an upgrade.
Such innovation ^.^
Man Bethesda really did just squeeze this one out huh
Fucking LOL
How do I build that is there a video or something??
##The devs literally did this in a gameplay demonstration
Impressive
Bethesda updating the enemy ship AI to target components instead of center mass in the DLC without a patch note to that effect would be hilarious.
Brilliant. Even some of the devs posted a video about making ships with a null space at the center of mass.
An exploit, yes.
Sorry OP.. I have the discussion have tapered off but no I don't feel like you're cheating and that is a very good looking ship design👍💪
vanilla space combat is soooooo bad anyway
Damn wtf how did you build that???
What game difficulty? I'm on very hard my man.
I imagine this will be an upcoming change where they target the ship and not just the hitbox
Just a poorly designed space fight system. No cheating required!
I watched one guy build a giant doughnut every missile and shot at them went through the gap in the middle as they took zero damage and murdered everything lol 



It's an unfortunate side effect of how they target things
Yes
That seems really smart
I know what my next ship is going to look like lol
One of the biggest game forges ever and their programmers can't even 

if(firingAtPlayer=true){
shootTheFuckingCockpitYouDunce();
}
4 months and this still hasn’t been patched 💀 Glad I played on gamepass and didnt spent $60 on this
I want to know how to build this and parts used, ship looks sick
That's totally cheating !

*Covers screen*
'nooo mine isn't the same!!'


Ya it looks like they made weapons fire dead center.
Not even a center of mass center.
Just dead center of build design.

I'm tempted to try one with a wing out in one direction.  

Just to move bulk of the ship to one side.
Do you even need shields?
This has been deemed cannon due to devs using this exact thing on live streams. I dont quite agree with it as I feel they took a more lazy approach the whole ship aspect of the game than they did companion personality... I will say though I quite love the ship! Nicely done.
Bravo! Thank you for the design inspiration!
How do you custom build a ship?
That’s a legit design. It’s not anyone else’s fault but Bethesda’s for making a half baked game.
A weapon to surpass metal gear
This build is sick!! What are the specs for it??
Build ?
Blueprints, hand em over🔫
I mean, the way we developed the Stealth bomber and stealth tech is based on exploits in how radar technology works. Considering this is exploiting their computers targeting and aiming technology, this could absolutely have a lore friendly reason as to why this works. 

Your ship is definitely cooler looking than the countless Donut ships that exist that people have used to take advantage of the same thing. 

If you've having fun being unstoppable, then go for it.
love to see it.
Looks awesome, is there a build guide for it?
It just works.
I just think all enemies automatically target center mass, which for that ship is dead air lol
OP post the build!
Post a build guide, that design is fantastic looking
Amazing lol. Even made it look good too
It’s not about cheating it’s about style
i really wish there was a way to share ship blueprints. this game would be significantly better with it.
I used a similar layout and a mod that adds extra flips to the Stroud cowling to create a large TIE Fighter looking ship.
This is the first design I have seen using the targeting glitch that actually looks nice.
Seems fine to me. This is a good design
Bethesda puts space ship combat in their game.

Also makes the AI targeting SUPER exploitable.
No, it’s lazy coding, blame bgs
Really innovative and gorgeous design!
Not cheating, NPCs are just dumb as a brick
Okay, cool, but what happens if there's more than one ship shooting at you? 

Still love the design and think you should keep it though.
That looks like fun!

So it'll probably be patched out soon.
This game really isn’t finished
I'd like to build this looks great
Not the most meta build but close. Not cheating though.
Ah, the kingdom hearts shipbuilding style.
I want that (lady from Napoleon Dynamite)
Very nice ship. I like the center. Me, I took a House Va'ruun ship, stripped the B shields to C, kept B engines, removed nonessential living or cosmetic structure and put the long gunmount rails with a bunch of weapons. No reactor points to allocate, but i could dust virtually any ship <40 lvl in about 5 seconds. Mine was very flat.
No, this deserve innovative gameplay award! 🥇
Link to the actual design?
Tried making something like this,  but didn't work out
"We don't need shields where we're going." - OP
If you're not getting hit use the A shield with the 10% regen, 12 power on a shield is not needed.
Very slick looking ship my friend. Not cheating if it's within the game mechanics!
That’s a damn cool looking ship!
Hey how many ships is there in the game
I think it's genius!
I feel like I cheat when i go collect a bounty from a crimson fleet member.im part of the crimson fleet
Why don’t they just shoot you? Are they stupid? /s

This will never not be the funniest thing to me because its SO easy to avoid but they programmed the ai in the laziest way possible
The abyss trekker has a similar concept with  hallow center you just made the center larger I wouldn't call it cheating
Can we get a build guide? Need this ship
No, you show me the interior now !
I Need a tutorial on how to build this
This looks really cool! What did you use to make it?
NGL it is weird that the whole ship doesn't just define the boundaries of a squared off solid 3D hitbox.

Almost as of the game isn't finished yet, and they had ambitions of multiplayer spaceship PVP that required hitting subsystems in real-time and not in a "bullet time" targeting mode
No this is Patrick
We need an x-wing build and the millennium falcon
I seen a guy on tik tok did the same a while back made a big square with hollow center. Yeah it works lol.
You got the blueprints for this?
All of the targeting systems were engineered off of original nasa/nova galactic computer systems. Automated systems were seen as the way of the future so after all r/d expenses were accounted for, companies found the center of mass of a ship was the easiest most inexpensive way to set automatic targeting systems. The war is over and has been for a long time so nobody is taught manual targeting skills anymore hense the perk you need to learn to manually target engines, grav drives, and what not. Makes perfect sense they can't hit your ship.
Catamaran of the stars.
top programing right there!
Lol i want this
I dunno, I played for about 10 hours and quit. Anyways you guys heard of Korev? It’s this brand of beer I saw in the supermarket and was wondering whether it’s good or not?
If this is cheating than I'm a massive cheater because all my ships end up looking close to this
That’s absolutely ingenious…
This is actually the kind of thing that real aircraft do to defeat real threats, so no, not cheating at all.
Now that's a cool looking starship.
dude, this is hot!
All im seeing is that they are  bad shooters.
You good, fam. Also, sick ship. Would love some specs.
Don't waste energy on shields if you aren't gonna get hit lol
"Most innovative game btw"
In Nascar, we don't call it cheating. We call it "innovation". I think the same applies here.
Can you post pics on each side but with a lighter color ship? Hard to see.
Gonna need a build guide on this.
Nah, you're good, mate. War is the mother of invention.
No, that’s god damn brilliant!
Nope, it’s strategy.
Fun fact that the devs know about this exploit and use it themselves. Someone found a freeze frame of a dev flying a version of the giant cube that clears the hitbox so they do it too!
I'm going to modify my existing Class C now, this is awesome!

Also, how did you get a 46 power Class C? The highest I have seen is 40.
More people should share cool ship designs like this.
Did the same thing in kingdom hearts 3. Just made a donut ship and they always shot through the hole in the middle lol
Hell no, I fly around exclusively in a window frame. They shoot straight through the middle 😆
Imagine running into a npc fleet of ships like that tho
“You see my friend, the enemy cant hit us because they are distracted by how sexy the ship is”
 This isn’t cheating it’s genius
Damn, that's sexy. What parts/cockpit and such did you use?
Now I just wanna pretend that I never made a ship after looking at this beast
Can you upload a tutorial on how to make this beauty
I wouldn’t say cheating, more of an exploit. I wouldn’t say your ship helps too much but there are far superior designs to exploit the Ai further.

Basically imagine a shape like |_|
Did you make a Cylon Raider/ Blackbird hybrid?
The AI is overwhelmed by your coolness factor and refuses to shoot straight.  

Can you share a build video?  I’m really curious on a few design elements there.
I saw someone here who had made a donut shaped ship that the enemies just kept insisting on firing through the hole lol
This is the best cheating ship design I’ve seen looks like a star wars ship
I've shit on people doing this before, but at least you're is stylish af. Allowed ✅
I'm just here for the ship design
Lol it is finding a way to avoid stuff in game no cheat no glitch. In eEder Scrolls V Oblivion I found a ledge that I can jump on in the arena. I won every single match with bow and arrow. Easy money without getting hit (except ranged opponents)
That looks like some star wars shit
Better enjoy it while it lasts, Bethesda will patch this out eventually?
I love it. It is beautiful in its uniqueness. You built a masterpiece. I am inspired by it
Our military literally would do the same to game the technology of our enemies. So, no. It’s not cheating, just as hiding in the bushes was not cheating against the British when we fought the American Revolution. The British certainly thought we were cheating when we didn’t stand in front of them and get mowed down, also they felt we cheated when we killed their officers who were used to buying their commissions and playing war like a chess match with the lives of the poorer classes. (There. I gave you historical legitimacy.)
M class would be cheating. This is slick. I love it.
looks great! I think anything you make work in the shipbuilder is fair game. Yours looks good though
Show me your ways 🙇
Folks are saying pod racer... it looks more like a Cylon fighter to me, complete with matching colors.
Do you know what shipyard you went to to have all the available building materials?
That’s so dope!!! 🤩🤣
Did you glitch the engines inside the cowlings?
I love the look of that ship! I assume it's not possible without glitching the parts into place? too bad there aren't able to buy player built ships in game, like in StarBase.
I have been using the twin hull design since day 3. It's a lot of fun.
I just want to know where to start? I really don’t want to be OP.  I just like the idea.  Ship looks amazing
If just works
It was done in the first week.

How tf this post is getting so much upvotes...
It's only cheating when it looks like ass. Your ship looks fabulous. As you were, captain!
Tbh I don’t care.. just.Take.my.money.. that is absolutely gorgeous ❤️❤️👍🏻👍🏻
No way. This is genius. 👍🏻
You need a tutorial bro this ship is fire
You should do a YouTube tutorial!
Nice reversal of shitty engineering for benefit.
Alot people do it since all attacks hit center mass where the game takes in account height and width to find the center. If your ship is U shaped or O shaped 99.9% of attacks will miss since the exact center is open space.
Nope just bad game developing. You can aim at specific ship components but the NPCs just aim at the center of your ship. I'm surprised the testers, if there were any, didn't see this at all.
Where did you get the 46 reactor?
It reminds me of a scaled up Sith fighter from the old KOTOR games. Or a Cylon Raider from the reimmagined Battlestar Galactica.
Ok fine I’ll play again
Welcome to day 1 starfield
Nah. It’s easy to justify from an in-universe perspective for the same reason it’s happening in reality: Standardized targeting systems clearly just aren’t designed for ships with empty centers of mass. In a single player game, if it makes sense in-universe, it’s just a dominant strategy, not cheating.

Also, that ship is gorgeous!
I'd love to know how you made this?
It's more like the Mantis than the Mantis is
Damn
No, it's just a poorly designed game
This just shows how poorly coded this game is
Seems to be pretty advantageous. 

So I'm sure it'll get patched immediately.
Man. I was so excited for this game. It came out and got pretty shit reviews. Tried to stay positive but was cautious and signed up for a free month of Xbox game pass pc to get it for free for a month.
After only giving my time to it, I realized that I had overpaid.
I don't get how the devs didn't think about this before they rolled the game out.
Poor game design. They made every ship only target the direct center of the ship. Another "This is so cool!" to "wow this is bad" example of this game.
That's next-gen level AI.

Not your fault Bethesda can't code for shit. Not cheating.
Bethesada shoudl probably patch that
Genius 💡
Genius. Well played
If the Blattodea can get away with it, so can you.
Game of the year.
People are still playing this game?
This game sucks thats it
Well it's not an "exploit" lol.

Reddit legit fuqing kills me lol, some of you people just somehow live to not only post, but comment absolute 💩.

There was amfr comparing it to being able to get to he vendor chests like what the literal fuck lol

Less ship means less ship gets damaged, it's not an exploit its part of the mess that is Starfield and one of the few things that make sense.  Enjoy it I guess?  I know that one guy on this thread has to be loving life lmfaooo
It only functions head on. If they attack from other angles then no. 

I moved all my engines, shields, drive and reactor inside the core of my ship so they can't be targeted.

These are just tactics. Good ones work.
Stardock certainly wouldn't think so.
Thank you for the new build idea to reduce the chances of being blown up again.
Clearly not. You don’t even have your grav drive maxed. It would be cheating if you did.
i just use all particle beam auto turrets. you gotta face them front. i didn't know that the first time.  
I find its either all or nothing with the turrets. i used to keep two guns so i could trigger pull. but i had one too many instances where i accidentally hit a friendly and turn them red, then the turrets are still autofiring. its a lot of experience but the bounty is very untasty.
I love all these ship designs that get posted on Reddit but I’m over here with a cargo hold of 18k and I don’t know how to turn away from it! Lol #givemealltheresources to craft anything, anywhere, anytime!
What reactor gives you so much power? :o
Compensation for the shield bug eating shields with no way to repair.
Nope not cheating at all. If you built it with the stock tools in game then it's legit. Looks good btw, and reminds me of the Surak from Star Trek the Motion Picture.
Do you have a video building it?
Definitely cheating.  But it’s Bethesda who enables it.  Why do we have to accommodate the dumb AI?  

“Let me make myself weaker so the AI has a chance to kill me!”  Said no one whatsoever.
It's not your fault bethesdas ai acts like it's from the early 2000s still
The more I see about this game, the more I wonder what they were doing when they were supposed to be testing.
One on one, sure.. get surrounded and you are just as vulnerable
I wish we could download blueprints! I could never build something like this.
Having a ship with nothing at it's center of mass?
It’s a Catamaran!!!
I’d call it par for the course.
Building ships was so much fun, felt pointless after my 6th ng+ though
It’s a Bethesda game, console commands are the only form of cheating. Hell most of us don’t even care about mods and console commands. The fact that you got such a cracked ship is crazy, but you deserve it bro! 🤙🏽😂
A cylone raider
By far the coolest ship I’ve ever seen
Cant believe they didnt patch that yet. Spiffing brit showed off this exploit at launch.
Nah bro it's using shit coding for a better gaming experience
So many of the empty center designs are trash aesthetically, but this looks great.
It's single player game so cheat to your hearts content
Holy crap. What weapons are you running?
At that point, don't even bother with a crazy strong shield
Sir, please share blueprint?
Which reactor is that?!?!
That looks sleek, absolutely love the design.
Haven't played since November 2023, having already reached NG+10. But this just makes me want to install the game again, maybe start a fresh save (not NG+) just to try this building method and go crazy with the Shipbuilding Mod.
It just works
uh.. can you explain your build please? this is awesome!
No, this is Patrick.
It’s sad because it shows that they’re just using your entire mass as a hitbox/target and always aiming dead center - rather than the enemy ai knowing to target specific parts of the ship.
Can you make a video the ship it looks cool af
This is the first build I've seen exploiting this behaviour that actually looks like a normal ship (i.e. not a box frame). Very cool.
Amazing
I wish I could make anything cool but I’m apparently really bad at designing a starship 😔 every time I make something I finish it then decide I don’t like it and delete the whole thing
Stealing!
They should fix that hit box. Also that’s a really cool looking ship.
Fine, I'll build another ship...
Your Ship looks cool.  But I wouldn’t worry too much about enemy fire.  Strong shields are available.  There are skills that make shields stronger.  
And auto-turrets take out enemies faster than they can damage your ship.
This hasn’t gotten fixed because this isn’t something that should be fixed you get the design your ship anyway you want. The ship is still destroyable, just get better at manually aiming and hitting it from the side.  It comes down to who’s the better pilot not necessarily ship design. In the video is obviously missing too low so aim higher
Videos show the Starfield devs using a empty-box type ship, so this is canon.
You did it within the restrictions and rules of the game. It not your fault enemies can’t aim for shit.
This is why this game needs to have a file download feature. If we could share ship designs while playing online it would be a lot of fun. Similar to how in madden (as much as I hate to give them credit) you can download custom rosters, sliders, and playbooks, and add them to your franchise
Most innovative game of the year right here folks.
It’s a sandbox! Play how you want to play! If it stops being fun you’ll move on to another ship. If it continues to be fun then you’re getting the most out of the game
Where’s the how to?
No, it's called "playing how I want to play"
Clever? Yes. Cheating? The devs put the ability to do that in the game, so no
What's the best way to make money.. I just started a few days ago
Do you have a how to video for this build?
Considering the ai has near perfect aim and evasive maneuvers aren’t really an option I say no.
No they couldn’t bother to create a decent targeting system for their “epic space game”
I need the tutorial for this! Can you please link me one or tell the parts that you used for this design?
Ah, ha! A Catamaran! You can't sink it because of the pontoons. That is totally-cool. I want wan! You need to make a vid showing the process.!
Oh shoot! That is a pod racer! I gotta figure out how to put those engines on the front now…
No, this is Patrick!
Dang beat me to it 🤣
Space wizard!
Kinda reminded me of the old Y-Wing and I was about to make a star wars themed joke about it, but yours is better. GG fam
Core memory unlocked
Exactly. Dumb by Bethesda to target the mass center of your ship instead of e.g. the command module, which would always work.
That's not even AI, the ships are just targeting geometric centers of the block they would fit into. That's why hollow ships work.
Agreed.  There are several obvious solutions Bethesda could use to prevent this, but they didn't bother.  If the player wants to exploit goofy systems in a single player game that's up to them, and it's pretty much par for the course in a Bethesda game.
It's odd to me because I've played hundreds of hours of Space Engineers, which is really more of a voxel building game with some basic combat, and the ships in that can target any ship system you / the AI wants. Thrusters, power, command, weapons, etc. That makes for a lot of interesting scenarios like disabling weapons and thrusters so you disable ships rather than destroy them and then board to salvage materials.
Can't believe they still haven't fixed this.
Starfield the Video Game!  Humans will always win because AI is dumb.
Dah, the amount of hatred is just annoying.

The AI isn't dumb. It was made to shoot the center mass for gameplay reasons. Make it shoot your main deck and you will drown in VFX. Make it shoot anything else, and your equipment will be deleted instantly.

Inability to think, for people like you, is just annoying at this point
Leave it to the modders 😑
Is what most games companies are saying to Bethesda right now.
Call it a limitation of the enemy’s targeting system…
You would think that ......and then they took away the vendor chests exploit as one of the few patches they've made to this game...... Well we still have broken quests and unfinishable quest lines....
Also, it's a really pretty ship design. I'd call this an AI failure by BGS before I'd call it a cheat.
Exploit of an incredibly dumb dev error. Wouldn't even call that an exploit. More like a Dev fuck up, just like the rest of the game anyway. Like come on, what kind of hitbox/AI aiming is that. "Most innovative gameplay"
I think you could even have an in universe explanation for this. The auto targeting systems onboard ships aim for the central area of a ship, and this fools the targeting system
i would disagree with that. Its just normally used build tool, and this is not so difficult to make any asymetric or such symetric ship that will have empty center. Its just wrong programming of the devs. It just shows how simplistic real space battle are in starfield, where there are a lot of space games that are using system disabling etc.
I would almost call it cheese rather than an exploit, but either way OP isn't cheating lol.
When you take into account that even military doctrine is “aim center mass” then no this is not an exploit.
He tried so hard, and got so far!
I care.
This is on the same level as clipping or duping or any of that stuff. Intentional abuse of an unintentional error within the game is an exploit. Doesn’t actually matter cause it’s single player though
But wait, when the Center of weight is somewhere there in the nothing, is Vasco then placed outside of the ship?
There’s a perk that increases max reactor output by up to 5 points.
Aneutronic fusion maxed plus Vasco probably
It's a skill called aneutronic fusion that increases power of ship Adam Kepler and Vasco also has them
Its the 40 Power Class C Reactor with Max Propulsion Perks + a bonus point for a crew member.
Thanks!!
Most people "discovered" this glitch from a dev stream. They know.

It seems the fix would be as "simple" as making ships target the cockpit. But I dunno, maybe it's not?
Now that's not true because any other exploits that have no effect on playability of the game they've already patched both of those out....... In fact it's the only two patches they've made other than the graphics patch
It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!
Klingon warbird
That makes sense as a solution. I was thinking of having them target the cockpit, at least, but aiming for specific systems is much better.
[deleted]
Is it cheating to make a stealth bomber to avoid enemy radar?
Iiiinnnteresting…so real world application here??
😂😂🫶
Top speed is 130 cause of the big c class engines but mobility is at 100
Skills
Yeah I usually play with my smaller b class ship but this was more of a “can I do it without it looking like a hollow cube” kinda thing
Haha yeah, this design popped into my head when I was thinking about that exact ship. I wanted to make it smoother with a double “U” concept. U shaped profile from the top AND from the front. It’s still more angular than I would like. I’m sure I’ll change it 27 more times before I think it’s perfect 😅
Man idk. Maybe it’s not object based targeting but rather rule-based
And top and bottom. Sides are the weak point
Npc’s aim at the center of you ship. If the center is empty they hit nothing
This comment needs to be higher up
I’m on very hard as well. It helps at that difficulty since their accuracy seems to be heightened at very hard mode
Yessss asymmetry is in
When you land your ship in any city you’ll see a person nearby that you can speak with, and they provide the option to modify your ship
Thanks! I used parts from every company. Flew between shipwrights at Taiyo/stroud/hopetech/deimos/nova for every part
Cockpit is from hopetech. I’ll be making a parts list/teardown video soon so people can see what was used
Cube ship looks boring. 

I’m combining a double horseshoe concept here. “U” shaped profile from above and also U shaped profile from the front. This way shots fired from in front/behind/above/below will miss. 

I’m aware it’s not optimal for taking full advantage of this exploit because it still can be hit easily from the side, but I prefer ships with some curves
I guess…basically yeah lol
[Sure! Here ya go](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/s/ZdDREYSgTa)

These are techniques I used to make it but I’m doing them on a different ship here
Yeah I’ve got the engine and reactor and grav drive in the engines and that let me snap the stroud cowling to the back of them so the flames get covered up in flight
Astrodynamics skill plus crew bonuses in astrodynamics on an already 40 reactor base level
Immediately? 😂 It's been like this since release
They did that themselves.
[deleted]
I like how you have a little tag thingy (Crimson Fleet) yet you hate the game.
This one works from above and below as well because the cockpit sits so far back. Being shot from port or starboard side is the weak point. Considering side facing turrets to compensate
I've done a couple "chariot style" builds with the engines in front..  they're kinda fun but I think what you built here already looks way cooler than anything I've done so far! Definitely stealing this look for my next build
I think taiyo had decent looking reverse thrusters, not sure about other brands
It reminds me of the Swoop Bikes from Knights of the Old Republic.
Yeah, or you know give them the ability to target components so different groups would have different proprieties like pirates shorting your engines, peacekeepers targeting weapons, etcs
Edit: would be cool have more boardings happen( which in my experience is never very common unless I initiate)
You know I just don't think they expected this ship design. I'd call it an oversight more than anything else. I wish we could save and share ship model designs
It's funny to me that Kingdom Hearts 2 did the same thing, and they fixed it for Kingdom Hearts 3.
Was watching an interview when Starfield first came out. They had to dumb the AI way down for space combat to even give players a chance.
I completely agree with this! I really hope this is something they fix in the future.
True, but calling it ai makes me seem hip and trendy.
im surprised they havent changed it given how fast they changed vendor chests
I doubt they will.
So you're saying devs intentionally made AI miss the ship if you build it a certain way. 
And you're questioning my ability to think?
“Most innovative gameplay” is a participation trophy now
Nice.
I mean one of the devs once showed of a hollow cube ship in an interview if I remember correctly
Isn t that the first time they patch vendor chests ? 

For other games, it was the unofficial patch that moved them
Those are not equal things. They literally just moved the chest. That is vastly easier than tracking down the source of quest bugs and correct them.
They never bothered to patch them in Skyrim. Why do they care so suddenly??
That’s why I stopped playing after a month. I kept either losing all my progress due to a bug. Or couldn’t finish out quests because of a bug. I can’t believe they still aren’t fixed. And now every game I play I think back and it just makes pissed at how mediocre Starfield was.
I think the vendor chest exploit and the weapons crate exploits were causing other issues.

They've not fixed the ship dupe glitch that can net people tens of thousands of credits a time and is widely known.
Facts. They should be worried about all of the game and immersion breaking bugs before worrying about exploits only a small percentage of the population uses. I own weapons that I can't sell without spending money because vendors only carry enough for a weapon at a time. There's a million other things they should of fixed before worrying about something like that.
Frankly they did it because it's easy. Moving an object in the creation kit takes a whole 2 seconds.
Don't worry,  I can't dock at a shipyard,  AND NPCs are missing from the main city in the game though.
So not that I don't enjoy....a good set of elipses....but why put so many...?

Oh no, they took away something that let you get into the inventory of sellers and now you have to earn the already trivial credits in the game lol.  If I were the developer and saw this constant 💩 I wouldn't put out much either as what would be the point?

Ohhhh yeeaaaa so a bunch of overentitled reddit users can get their way on a game that launched in gamepass lol

Oh shyt....forgot the....are you still able to read that....?
And an extreme lack of content :/

This comment comes across as incredibly salty.
Except it’s the fucking space age so that’s a bad in universe explanation especially since targeting exists for the player.
>cheese rather than an exploit

What is the distinction?  lol
Nope. Clipping is cheating because you go someplace you were never intended to go. This is just a simple honest exploit of how BETHESDA programmed the game. So no. This is NOT cheating. It's wisdom.
Vasco is already placed outside the ship. Even if you are flying around in something like the Star Eagle.
Also, Vasco gives you one extra point.
Wait, you can get an extra point for a crew member???
Don't know either.  I heard they felt compelled to nerf the AI for space combat, possibly that affected it - assuming it's what happened?    
The targeting mode differentiates between different ship systems no matter where they are in relation to the superstructure, perhaps reigning that in on the part of the AI was part of the nerf or partly broke it?    
Again, just guessing.
Glitch building doesn’t affect playability and it’s still possible
Looks more like Spocks Warp sled from the Movie
no fr how
But the ship does have a middle, it's whats connecting the other two parts....right?
Hell yeah! Kudos brother man!
It's funner to play games on hardest difficulty. This game its easy to not die but other style RPG games I'll play one part for hours to till beat part/boss lol. 

That ship is so siick! How long did it take you to build? The building of ships seems really hard to grasp at first
Hell yeah man, that thing is sleek as hell. Can't wait to turret it up and stuff turn to space debris.
For sure, it is definitely a cool design. I wouldn’t have the patience
No guys, now that this exploit has been posted 50 times on Reddit, Bethesda will awaken.
It wasn't a broken as the money and shop inventory stuff.
So not as quick a reply.
That was the joke
Yeah, and that's generally referred to as the enemy AI.
It's definitely related. I wanted the game to be good. I wanted to be a space pirate, build my own space station, and have my little pirate crew who railed against the establishment. I wanted Bethesda to redeem themselves after over a decade of releasing nothing but straight up trash.

Didn't turn out that way, unfortunately.
Well just figured out what I’m doing today
I've yet to get boarded, can it actually happen?
Yeah. I would love for counter boarding to be a thing. All your crew would arm up and run towards the docking port and then have an all out firefight on your ship as waves of hostiles come through and start attacking.
An awesome wrinkle that would get so much praise.

Sure the pirates hit my engine and knocked me steady, but they want what in my cargo hold so they try to board me instead of just blasting. 

Get to repell them, take their stash, and use their ship for parts to repair mine lmao.

This could used in reverse as well. Hitting engines and boarding party would get more rewards/less stuff floating in space.
Yooooo. That would be awesome. Build a weak ass ship, drive by kryx. Shake that booty. Get boarded by pirates and totally destroy them. Then steal their ship. Teabag the corpses on the way out the airlock.
Sounds like an awesome utility mod concept. Ship blueprints!
How dare other people enjoy stuff that doesn't effect me!
Only to VCs.
Yes, they did that intentionally. Simply because it can be fixed by console commands, you don't need to reinvent the AI.

So yes, I seriously questioning your ability to think. I have a lot of worries for all of you, actually.
I like to think it was the community trolling steam with the votes, same as RDR2 getting labor of love (or even CP2077 the year prior)
I know, funny how a bit of 20 year old code can be deemed most innovative.
They sure did that's initially how that exploit was discovered was by watching the Dev interview....... Which would make me think that they just left it in the game intentionally but since the fix for that issue may be more in depth than they had time to deal with it..... We just don't know and since they seem to be all secretive about the things they're working on fixing in the game ....we just don't know.....
Great, now I have another build to play with...
Yes it was in fact the vendor exploits are still left in the other games...lol
They also patched build empty weapons chests and reload glitch did they not. Talk about priorities....
it doesn't matter how much effort it takes to fix each thing, what matters is how much of a negative effect each thing has on players. 

Exploitable vendor chests? literally not a single player negatively affected. Even if it takes only seconds to fix this, those seconds could have been spent on bugs that do affect players negatively.
Wow you got a little hostile with that

 All I was making the point was that the guy said it's a single player game so who cares......... And I was making the point that yes it's a single player game but the two game fixes they have put out of both meant to fix single player exploits instead of fixing things that are broken....
Obviously......... The use of dots........ To affect a pause in the reading.......... Seems to set off something in you.......... That has upset you....... Enough to become hostile......... About it........
And randomly not being able to look down the sights on your gun
One would’ve thought that they would at very least set the AI to target the Cockpit/Bridge just as a general reference point or something.

Oh well right
No it means that the AI was not designed to target anything other than a centre mass.  It's lazy.  Specifically a a specific area on a ship.

I don't know how this game got any awards it's got blunders from the 90's.
Department of redundancy department right here
So, cheese is when you use a game function that is working the way it's supposed to in a way that defeats some aspect of the game in a way the designers didn't intend. In this case, the player is explicitly allowed to build a ship where the center of mass is empty space. It's also the game working normally for enemies to always target center of mass rather than, you know, an actual piece of the ship. Does this kind of break the game in the player's favor? Yes, but everything is still working as designed. 

An exploit is when the player finds something that *isn't* working the way it's supposed to and uses it to their advantage. Like the ship design bug where you can attach sections that by all rights shouldn't go together, but the game breaks a bit if you flip them around enough and allows you to do it anyway. 

So this is cheese.
It’s an oversight by Bethesda. Abusing anything non-intentional is almost always cheating to some extent
or andromeda if vasco is constantly trying to appear in and block your passage between habs
Yeah there's a engine specialist I forget what they're called or you can use Vasco.
Dude spot on. I could stick the stroud cockpit that sits on top with some cowling to get closer to the shape of that ship. Then a paint job and it’ll be hella close
[Here is how it used to look before I downsized and raised the cockpit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSodiumStarfield/s/q4zBWliyzz)
The skill aneutronic fusion can give you 5 extra units of power and assigning crew with the same skill will get you one additional unit of power. The most advanced reactors are unlocked with the skill starship design, and can give you 40, 

so reactor + skills = 46
The middle of the overall design is empty
Dude I was in the ship builder for like 3-4 hours on this one. It’s still not perfect. I want a smoother shape overall. Need it to be curvy
Most people saw this exploit for the first time in a dev stream. They are well aware.
It’s never happened to me, maybe in a cut scene or something? But yeah would be cool to have to defend your ship from pirates or something
Haven't seen this happen during a ship fight but I have been followed back to my ship and boarded by mercenaries trying to apprehend me which led to a shootout on my ship
Bethesda has coded it into the game, it's just not active.  Though I did have a bounty hunter board the frontier on a test save when I got back to the ship on kreet before going to NA during the first mission.  I think that was a glitch though.
It's clearly something they thought about. When you board a hostile ship but don't commandeer it, when you get back they're all strapped ready to ride or die. Wasted opportunity.
> This could used in reverse as well. Hitting engines and boarding party would get more rewards/less stuff floating in space.



You realize you can board other ships, right?  Take out the engines and you can board a ship.
Considering this is Bethesda our ships are probably modified dragons from Skyrim so implementing a fix is probably difficult.
Wouldn't be too difficult to make it aim at certain ship modules instead of just the geometric center. Other games like elite do it too, where enemies of higher difficulty are more likely to actually target specific systems like thrusters for example. 

They could just make the enemy ai target the cockpit or something like that but instead they went the easiest route and just aim at the center.
it's probably not a priority for them to fix given how many more things they could be working on to fix. forcing players into a gimmicky ship build to remove a gameplay challenge should never be a design choice, so it's an exploit either way
[deleted]
You are correct, I believe it has to do with Microsoft being in charge now. BGS didn't care before but this exploit was patched pretty quickly.
You are falsely assuming the solutions for all issues are the same and they are choosing to do letter important stuff over more critical things. Consider instead that the more critical things are more complex and can not be fixed as quickly and require more investigation and testing.
Except it does. And taking the literal 2 seconds required to fix it doesnt impact work on larger issues. Somone could have done it on a break from investigating the bigger issues. They could have had an intern do it.

And god forbid they fix issues in the intended design of the game... BG3 gets praised up and down for fixing literal thousands of small tiny bugs and exploits most will never notice see or use, but when bethesda fixes just one, people like you shit literal bricks.
The game has received 5 updates since launch. Yes they patched an exploit and yes they have been patching broken stuff. Do you read the patch notes??
That's what commas are for.
>enemies to always target center of mass

This is what is being exploited.

>An exploit is when the player finds something that *isn't* working the way

This is called a bug.

>uses it to their advantage

This is exploiting the bug.

Cheesing is just slang for exploiting. The AI is *programmed* to shoot center of mass, but it's not *designed or supposed* to shoot center of mass.
Exploiting without having to alter the game is NEVER cheating. It's taking advantage of Bethesda's own stupidity. Cheating by default requires actively altering the game, via mods, codes, or forcing clipthroughs. Simply taking advantage of a loophole is NEVER cheating, and nothing you say will alter that.
thanks dude
I’ve had uc security follow me onto my ship and I took off instead of fighting and so there were just 2 uc security npcs chillin on my ship talking about I’m wanted but never initiating a convo with me or attacking.
I think wasted opportunity is about the best description for the game. So many things that they could've fleshed out to be awesome but didn't.
🤣
Thomas the Tank mods inbound.  Freestar model Gordon coming in at ya!
I shall now imagine our ships just have invis dragons in the center and we are just forcing them to lug around these metal monstrosities we call ships XD
Yeah, my thinking! Whole game is just another patched up bad engine, what was used for oblivion first :DDD
They could lower the enemy accuracy and it would probably do more damage by hitting that stuff occasionally
Elite is just a better made game when it comes to the actual in-space stuff.
Yea, all they'd have to do is target something every ship has, like the engine.
No they'd rather patch chest loopholes than fix actual game breaking faults
Wow I didn't know........ Meant depression I guess if they don't teach you anything in school anymore that you guys just make up whatever you want..... Well let me tell you back when they used to teach proper language and grammar in school.....Ellipsis points we're meant to signify a pause or a hold in statements for thought..... Now all of a sudden since everyone's all emo and snowflake ellipsis' mean you're depressed..... Good to know

[🌈⭐](https://media.tenor.com/ERa47gPVan8AAAAM/the-more-you-know.gif)
5?...... Maybe I miss them but it seems like the only thing they've done is patch it 3 times one for the  graphics improvement..... Once for the vendor box move (with a couple pet rock repairs).... And then the latest one which was the filling up gun chests with a couple of lost npc repairs.........

If there were more then that ...I would love to hear of them and  I will stand corrected but I do think there's only been three that I know of... And yes I read patch notes I've been reading patch notes on games and things since the late '90s maybe even earlier.......

I await a more intelligent and logical response......
Truth^
Essentially interchangeable though ellipses show more of a trailing off which is hard to show in writing without narration. Also most people use a comma incorrectly most of the time.
You use your definition, I'll use mine. Don't get me started on the terminology fight around defining a bug vs. a user story vs. a defect.
Haha! Must've been bugged. I thought I could run from security and escape to my ship to avoid getting caught stealing from a store in Akila but they chased me down and still confronted me on the ship.

Decided to just off the guy and give his uniform to one of my crew. I forgot though and next time I boarded my ship I accidentally shot him thinking more of them showed up.
I'm still a fan despite the fact that more could've been done with it. Granted I've wasted some time but all I have left is Ryujin and Unity, I'm at 11 days worth of play time in my 1st universe. I think I've gotten my money's worth.

I'll be interested to see what the next installment is like. I feel like a lot of folks forget this is the first entry in a brand new IP which they haven't done in 30 years or whatever.
The Bethesda way: mile wide, inch deep. These games have a hundred systems and a thousand things to do, and all of them are about as complex as a McDonalds chicken nugget's flavor profile.

It was one thing back in the days of Skyrim release, because that kind of scope was rare as all hell. Didn't matter that nothing had any real depth, because you might have seen one game per year (if that) with that kind of scale to it, so everything felt so massive and exciting anyway.

Now we have a new game like that every month thanks to procgen advances. Even more if you include the indie scene. You have to offer more than scale to really stand out at this point, and they just really haven't figured that out, if Starfield is anything to go off of.
Watch that idea turn into a mod, stardragon chariots assemble!
But that was the entire focus of elite and was for nearly all of its lifespan.

Its just not comparable.

Elite also has no characters or questlines, no boarding, no ship builder, no real characters, no storyline at all.

And you can even get ganked should you choose open.

I enjoy elite, but they are two totally different games.
Engine or cockpit yeah
Yep, 4 since release and one on day 1. 

https://gamerant.com/starfield-all-patch-notes-updates-bugs-hot-fix/


Well if you read the patch notes you would realize every patch has included fix for broken things too lol. Just because whatever broken thing you’re experiencing isn’t fixed doesn’t mean they aren’t actively working and patching them.
>the terminology fight around defining a bug vs. a user story vs. a defect

FWIW I'm very anti Agile so I'd be willing to entertain a rant.
It's not bad. I've played a lot as well. But it just feels so hollow for a Bethesda game. About the most fleshed out feeling thing is the ship building. Which is fun. Until they delete your ship after the unity.
Wheres the download! I need this mod now! XD
Hence why I said it is a better made game for space stuff. I didn't say it was a better solo RPG. No need to get defensive, I am not talking crap about your favorite game.
 Ok so there were 4 patches and one hot fix on release day......I never said they weren't fixing or patching other things I said that they were focusing the main point of their updates on exploits that aren't game-breaking while they still have other ones that are broken ....many people's games have been lost and have caused many people to step away from their game ...now how's that make sense?....You're losing players and you're slowly" bleeding to death" because you're keeping everyone in the dark about the things you're trying to accomplish........I love the game, I still play daily, and I understand some fixes come easier than others. But honestly the secrecy of what fixes their looking at and working on is not helpful in keeping people interested in playing the game....
Ok, so my boss has decided he's on a data kick, right? More metrics, more info, more and better decisions, etc. That means they want to start looking more at bug and defect ratios to see which of our teams is underperforming. And *that* means we had to - for the first time I might add - get everyone to settle on a common definition for user stories, bugs, and defects. 

It. Is. A. Nightmare. 

I'm in charge of the performance management group. I'm the bad guy looking at all the projects to decide who's fucking up. But because I'm not a complete idiot, I make things fair, and I work it from the "help me help you" angle. If I do my job well, they do their job better. Everyone wins, everyone gets to claim more accomplishments at review time, no one gets their contract terminated because they forgot you're supposed to have a functional project management plan. That way people understand the metrics and are willing to play ball. 

None of them. Not one of these professional teams. Not one can agree on what a bug means. It blows my mind. 

So now I have to waste time running around between six groups trying to get everyone to get off their high horse, accept that there is no industry-standard definition, and just play the game the way we set the rules. It's maddening, annoying, and very much everything I've come to expect from years of government service. 

Thank you for listening to my rant.
Hence why i said they aren't comparable.

A game focused on space is going to have better space gameplay than a game that does space/ground/RPG.

I thought that was obvious.

I am not being defensive, just spelling it out because why would you make the comment about elite having better space if you werent comparing them?
Ok but tell me when has this ever not happened with a BGS game? Starfield is leaps ahead the most polished experience they’ve released.

These games are huge. You get that. You get there’s testing that goes into these things and then making sure your fix doesn’t break even more on top of the hundreds of issues you’re actively trying to fix. I’m currently experiencing skills attributes not correctly being read in NG+ pretty much making it a rough playthrough because half my perks don’t work and that’s been there since launch! 

These games could be patched every month for the next 10 years and it wouldn’t be enough to fix every single thing.
You are being defensive, and I really don't care.  Interpret my comments however you want, makes no difference to me. Bye.
Now imagine GTA VI.
Anyone who says that things won't be possible because of console limitations don't know what they are talking about.  They have the resources and talent to make a colossal game the will push the hardware to it's limits.  Which hasn't been done before on the PS5 and series X as far as I'm aware.   Games for these current gen consoles. Haven't had time to catch up to its limitations.  We still haven't experienced a major leap in this console generation because developers have been hard at work making the games. And making games of that caliber takes a very long time.

I've seen people on almost every post be so pessimistic saying that certain mechanics won't be achievable on this generation of console so they won't be in the game.   When you look at Red Dead redemption 2 that came out in 2018 on the PS4 and Xbox One and then compare it to GTA V that came out in 2013 on the PS 3 and Xbox 360 It shows a colossal leap In every aspect. Now what makes people think that GTA 6 won't be another colossal leap, probably double of what it was for GTA v in Red Dead 2. There is no doubt that this game is going to be setting a new bar for immersion in the gaming industry.  To underestimate rockstar's capabilities with their current track record Is like underestimating a fight with prime Mike Tyson.


I expect another benchmark in gaming

With a budget like that, you're here to make history
Crazy how they can have so many devs on a game and still manage to keep everything top secret
It's not easy to make a masterpiece of a game
Wasn't the 2 billion number debunked? I'm pretty sure it was connected to that dumb leak that said it was gonna cost 200 dollars.
I bet GTA 6 gonna be like RDR2 , but more advanced. The AI in RDR2 is crazy good. The graphics are amazing. Now Imagine GTA VI..
Man, this is probably gonna be the only game rockstar releases for this console generation. Woah..
Boy.......I hope the developers are mentally ok.
Where did this 2 billion thing come from in the first place? Also I doubt it was in proper development while they were also developing rdr2 which is a huge game.
I feel like this is gonna be like the leap between GTA/2/London to GTA3. That shit was insane! A truly mind blowing moment.
I read sometime ago RDR2 full development started after GTA V release on Xbox 360/PS3, so RDR2 took 5 years of full development, GTA 6 if some of old leaks was true then development was "restarted" twice(One after Leslie Benzies left Rockstar, and that other one after Dan Houser) but even if that is not true, i think GTA 6 full development started after RDR2 release on PS4/X1, so it will be 7 years at best, but based on 2022 leaks i think it will be similar to RDR2 full development time
My luck I’ll die a week before it comes out
Optimise your engines

![gif](giphy|SWKyABQ08mbXW)
Gta V was just the place holder for the ACTUAL masterpiece that gta 6 will hopefully be
None of those things are confirmed, you honestly think they were developing GTA6 simultaneously alongside RDR2? At most they had a big bag of ideas and a location, some rough story ideas, but actual development? Unlikely.
There’s no way marketing will cost that much. What fucking marketing? If I were to guess they probably took a big chunk of marketing out and used it for other resources because they know they don’t have to market shit and it’ll be huge.
I think 2 billion had been allocated to the game as a whole, that is GTA VI online content, upkeep, updates, DLC, everything

That said, I think 1 billion in dev costs is not far off, that would about quintuple the budget of RDR2
realtalk
There has not been a single time where a rockstar game crashes and burns like people seem to want it to. Yeah online is questionable, but if you’re using the gta online business practice to claim it will be shit, you have no ground to stand on when talking about the single player game of gta6
The $2 billion budget is bullshit. RDR2 costed $540M with marketing included. It doesn’t matter that GTA V grossed $10 billion, Take Two would NEVER let that budget fly. That’s a ridiculous amount of money for a single video-game. 

It will cost at most $600-700M with marketing included.
I'm glad I purchased a genuine copy of RDR2. I want to support the developer in any way I can.
No way the 2 Billion are Real 

Do you even know how much money that is?
Even if the game is anywhere near equal to RDR2 in detail and variety of stuff to do, I’ll be happy. If it’s equivalent to GTA V then, for me, it’ll be the biggest let down in gaming
The budget wasn’t 2 billion
First week 10 billion easy
is this confirmed?
Half of the two billion is probably going straight into marketing
i’m so fucking excited
Text adventure
A good chance that gta 6 will make that development costs back in the first two weeks.
birds are going to have a day and night cycle, and will even keep track of their jobs too.
Isn’t that 2 billion dollar budget rumor just a rumor? Even if it is, I’m sure the game will still set a new standard just like rdr2 has.
GTA 6 took more than that.
Huh
Compare this woth star citizen...sigh
Seems so simple and measurable put like this
![gif](giphy|Fo1cy8mqGDvbjpJBB7)
that budget is bs but ok :)
All that it took to make RDR2 and campfire works under rain, the game does what it wants regarding your weapon choice, they still do that bs of spawning lawmen right in front of you, the satchel system makes no sense, you go from 5 to 15 to 99, the controls are not consistent, the story is full of holes regarding the first game when it wasn't necessary at all, why they made up stuff outta thin air is crazy, how they completely screwed John's model in the epilogue is baffling as well. 8 years.
I feel like I'd lose to today's Mike Tyson.
2 billion is insane. I imagine thats going to licenses and leases for music and arts
I always find it crazy that marketing budgets are more then production
How about the part where they abandoned RDO?
It's ashame it wont experience it's true glory until it comes to PC. Can't wait for the roleplay experience. It's gonna be insane with modded online rp servers lol.
Nice sources bro
I think AI will replace most of the jobs to make a game, it can generate animations, if you feed it with enough data, it can generate dialogues staying loyal to the scenario too. 

Just needs more time and we need stronger hardware IMO.
Comparing it with Paradise Game
I have high expectations, but I also can't help but remember that more budget doesn't always mean it's better. Just look at all the super high budget movies that crash and burn. Or Skull & Bones.
The large yachts look drivable from the trailer with so many cruising around, for me if I can just drive large boats around, that alone is enough to have me totally stoked, and I'm sure there are going to be a shit load of new vehicles, new gameplay mechanics from gun play to mealey, more interaction with the world, and all sorts of other stuff we don't even know! It's going to be a fucking industry leader of course!
I'm just curious of the kind of development and animation they can create with AI now integrated into their development tools.
once it comes out, it'll be like a fucking aircraft carrier compared to inflatable dinghys
Also an insane amount of forced overtime. Crunch culture in the gaming industry is horrendous.

Naughty Dog got a lot of shit for it and they have since reformed and it's an incredible place to work now. Rockstar has never opened up on the allegations of crunch culture.
If gta 6 fail 💀🫠
Developed on PCs, then tested on consoles. Without PCs they wouldn't even be able to make the games in the first place.
So pissed they haven't done a 60fps patch for current gen yet.

Bought the game expecting 60fps out of the box as my first game on PS5 and its a laggy judderfest.
Console does historically limit gamers though. Imagine if they focused on pushing PC hardware to its limits.
Rest in peace to all my friends who passed away before seeing gta 6.
I hope Live Cut Scenes are in VI, because those videos are Hilarious!
Cod could never
I would rather play it when it releases than keep on imagining everyday.
AI can do all that now 😔
Just release the damn game
I didn’t even play it for more than 4 hours or something. Just goes to show that no matter how much resources you put into a game you can’t please everyone. Stoked for GTA 6 though
With 2 billion dollars you’d think they’d be able to export it to pc 🤷
we are witnessing history being made by rockstar
I know its the bigger market and easier to make a game to fit the hardware, but i wish companies would stop limiting games that are also on PC to console limitations
Just fyi that doesn’t mean they’re spending $2billion dollars to develope the game BTW
Does the 2 billion dollar development cost include marketing?
"Development" started immediately after GTA5? Whoever said that has no idea what the difference is between planning a game (and writing the design documentation) and actually starting work on it.

You might as well say development started the first time anyone at Rockstar said "we should make GTA6"
I trust rockstar to make it optimized af tbh
Why do they need to bother with marketing? Game will sell without a penny of it
$2 billion is outrageous. I think at the ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM that the game could cost to make is $1 Billion and even then that’s a stretch.
I wanna see the collector's edition. My dad got GTA4 and 5's collector's edition, and I wanna get him 6. He never opened 4 or 5, actually he hasn't played a GTA since San Andreas.
Maybe just maybe we’re over hyping gta 6 and it won’t be the game we’re all expecting it to be JUST SAYING
No I didn’t!
What is crazy it that they spent more to advertise RDR2 than the hundreds of millions of dollars they spent making the game.
Well let’s hope that it’s actually good and that it hasn’t been infected with The Plague.
"Gta VI will be a flop 🤓☝️"
Remember, we are talking about Rockstar not Ubisoft.
This is the first AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA game
It's been that long since the trailer dropped? It feels like a month or two ago.
exactly, look at microsoft flight simulator, a new one is coming november 19th. the sim is supposed to outperform the previous installment by a lot
Rockstar always setting the standard for how games should be developed.
Red dead had all that work and they just left it in the dust. No Ps5 upgrade or continuous updates for online
Not playing GTA anything. I like to ride my horses!!! My favorite horse is online. He's a shire named... Dork. He climbs up in things all the time. And of all things, jumps off cliffs down south of Armadillo! But he won't freak out with any animals.
100 usd for sure
Worth the wait
bro how do people believe the 2bil number. I don't doubt the game has been expensive as all hell to develop but there is not a single reliable source that confirmed it, it was just a random rumor people started taking as fact. rdr2 cost around 200mil, no way would gta 6 cost 10x that
I’m not getting my hopes up. Could be the best game to come out in recent years, but if it turns out bad I don’t wanna be disappointed.
Bigger doesn’t mean better. Wait till we have it
Mark my words, we will see the apocalypse before we see GTA6, it’s time to phone it in.
I think realism will have a huge factor if they make car damage more prevalent. It’s non existent rn on V
Ofc they can. If they want to! But looking how poorly made some new games for the current gen came out these past years… i am indeed a bit pessimistic.
RDR2 was made by all of Rockstar's studios working together as one. That is why GTA VI has taken so long.
i don't care. release it now
I would die for a medieval RPG made by these folks.
Imagine GTA6 ? It's the same as Red dead 2 with just better graphism. 75% of the build of GTA6 is from Red dead redemption 2. So now stop believing it will be the game the decade cause no this is just pure marketing. 

Less than 1 year of the release and still 0 real game play revealed.... Only one trailer completely scripted. Wow amazing.
this will be rockstars last gta game.  they are taking a break afterwards.
Imagine if it doesn't run at 60fps in 2025.
And rdr2 still put me to sleep
"Rockstar has a plan."
Budget isn't confirmed and was grouped together with the really dumb $200 on release price "leak"
This game will be nothing short of revolutionary for gaming
We’ve had our concord, now it’s time for **greatness**.
Rockstar doesn’t miss
Dont get me wrong the game will certainly have a bigger budget than RDR2 but this $2Billion figure seems to have just been pulled from the sky, no one really knows where it came from.
Or the biggest mistake, just spending money isn’t a good metric.
And/or they expect to make a lot of money with micro transactions.
What less can anyone except from literally the most anticipated thing ever lmao
Most definitely!
I mean it is kinda easy when you can sue anyone who leaks to the fucking oblivion, the hacker guy who leaked footage from the game was put in a mental asylum or something like that
When you work on a project this large, with so many different teams, you get to a point where your day-to-day work gives you no insight into the bigger picture. 

I worked for a massive financial institution as a software engineer. The things I touched on a regular basis were basically a tiny cog in an overall much larger machine. I knew my piece but I couldn't tell you how exactly it all fit together.
maybe because they only hire the best of the best in the industry? 
probably worked their whole life to get to this point why would anyone throw it away with a lawsuit and a put on a blacklist that you will never get hired by any other game company.
They didn't though, it leaked.
I mean people at Rockstar North don't want to be sued lol
Devs are probably assigned to a things so so specific that they themselves don’t have much info on the game, like some devs might be just fully dedicated to the driving physics and know nothing else about the game 

Arthur’s voice actor in RDR2 also mentioned that during production he wouldn’t know which scenes he was doing and wasn’t sure of what voice to use, like a mean normal sad happy voice and tried to keep it neutral
Yet rockstar never fails
2 billion makes it a hell of a lot easier
None of the figures OP is showing are in any way verified. Notice how he just took the first Google-generated answer he found which are probably from the hundreds of clickbait articles with no actual source.
I don’t think it was ever debunked and it was $100.
It's quite silly how this number keeps popping up. Nothing in the industry will get a budget like that, it is horrendous, impossibly huge of a budget. If it cost 500M it would be too much. No way in hell any executive would ever allow for something like this to happen. You don't make a product better by throwing money at it. Money is not magic.


A good product is made by competent people, with good assets and a reasonable time. There is a ceiling of how much better you get with these by just spending money.


Also, saying GTA 6 development started on 2014 is equally as silly. It was at a conceptual phase at best. It started full development on 2019, when everything with RDR2 was done with.
Fr
R* has switched in the recent decade to remove all crunch hours & become way more friendly to its employees
I think early development started in 2014 but got paused for RDR2 and they picked it back up in 2018. just my personal opinion
It's probably gonna look slightly better than RDR2.
Yeah iv heard they restarted twice, but does that mean restarted from scratch? never knew what it meant
It is confirmed that GTA 6 started full dev after the release of rdr2 so late 2018, but was a background project for a few years prior while full focus was on rdr2,
They def were developing GTA VI while RDR2 was being developed. I would imagine the folks involved with the map were busy right away after GTA V came out. They were certainly developing the features alongside RDR2 development. My guess is everything was put in place so that staff who were working on RDR2 could immediately step in once development on RDR2 stopped. That kind of setup to transition takes a lot of work. I don't deal with anything nearly as complex but we do similar things at my work 
Yes, this is not unusual. If RDR2 was in development for 8 years that means it overlapped with GTA5 for almost 3 years. We are probably talking about a core team writing the overall story, considering location and scale, making up story boards, making characters, and just generally laying the groundwork for the game. I am sure it’s been mentioned in interviews at R* that development started shortly after 5 was released. Not sure what is so unbelievable about that.
Rockstar North make GTA and Rockstar San Diego make Red Dead.
big ass posters on buildings, I guess
The number is made up.
I’ll bet you a copy of GTA6 that the cost is over $700M as Inflation alone puts the cost at $740M.
it hasnt been confirmed nor denined if it was 2 billion but its the closest we have to a rough estimate
Yeah it is, the source is trust me bro
It's made up.
Isn’t that game a scam
GTAV had a ridiculous dev budget as well, especially by 2013 standards. When it came out it was the biggest media release, ever. Nothing else other than the highest grossing movies have even approached that since over a decade ago. It still has a massive player base and cult following, there’s no reason why anyone would doubt that rockstar would go absolutely balls deep into the next installation
How much do you think paying at least 1k devs for 8 years costs ?
[deleted]
GTA 6 is far superior to RDR2 lol it is not even close.
This is typical Rockstar marketing though...
Doubtful.
It won't. If you want to play at 60fps you have to wait PC relase.
Rockstar had a goddamn plan !
Really? You'd think yearly financial reports by Rockstar would give enough information to make a solid estimation of what the actual budget would be. I haven't heard any other number than the 2 billion.
Still can’t believe people actually believed that $200 price thing LMAO.
it really bothers me how many people actually believe gta 6 will be $200
I know its super unlikely that it will release with a $200 price tag, but I think I would actually pay that lol.
Rockstar made it clear they were going upmarket in cost.

I’d gladly spend $200 on GTA6 without a passing thought even as I have zero disposable income.

Edit: zero disposable income doesn’t mean I’m broke, just that I invest a ton, but I’d pull $200 from investing to buy a banger of a game.
We know but we don't realize

The expectations are high and they WILL be exceeded
Wait...what? Link?
What lmao
Yeah, they send Strauss Team Six after you
the guy had to go to an asylum because he said in court that he wanted to continue hacking immediately after his release. he not only has rockstarstar games but also nvidea and was arrested while trying to hack siemens. the court decided that he was not fit to be sentenced, which is why he had to go to an asylum.
i knew that guy, knew he did shit with computers but i never thought that shit would happen
Well the play testers would have a pretty good picture.
Yes but it leaked because someone broke their security, not because of an insider
Hell I wouldn’t want to lose my job
That's true
GTA The Trilogy The Definitive Edition:

![gif](giphy|WplDMrnQT7Pofoj2Vl)
Don't jinx
>Yet rockstar never fails

They technically failed with GTA 4 DLCs under performing according to [Take 2](https://thatvideogameblog.com/grand-theft-auto-dlc-episodes-underperform-says-take-two-ceo/)

If they continue doing that with GTA 5 single player DLC chances are this would’ve been the same fate…
which is why i'm surprised that this inaccurate post got so many likes.

or that's what i would've said if i hadn't known the amount of idiots and kids on reddit
![gif](giphy|fpFPWzrXhLOo6uFXGg)
It's not gonna cost 100$, don't be delusional. People need to actually be able to afford the game to buy it.
I agree, but imo it would be around at most 650-700m if we go by rdr2s budget of >450m, 

 T2 could even be doing a Netflix and not even give it a budget, just giving r* what is needed when it's needed because no matter what the profit will be there, but to get to 2 billion is absurd, 

And yeah full dev didn't start until very late 2018, with it being a side project while developing rdr2,
And you believe this?
I have read a post of a banglore employee and he doesn't agree with this. In fact it's the opposite of it.
While the graphics are a usually A-tier from them. I think their main focus for awhile has been continuously making their games feel more and more “alive”.
If restarted twice then for me it means started from scratch or almost from scratch, i mean they drop that old ideas(story, characters etc. maybe they saved some old concepts)
Yeah I'm not disputing that, but people seem to believe that this game has been in development for 10 years and that's just not true
Source?
When people refer to game development they mean the actual game, as in the software, the code, etc.
Yeah that's what is called pre-development. 
That was true for GTA 5 and RDR1, GTA 6 and RDR2 are built by all studios combined
I had to check via playstation Store and its real but named as City Paradise
I didn't say I doubt that, I said I doubt the 2 bil budget
As much as it did for rdr2, which wasn't  2 billion
Yes but you clearly haven't because 200mil 6 years later does not equal to 2 billion. If the game had a dev budget of like 500 million (which would still be the biggest gaming budget ever and over double that of rdr2) in 2018 then now it'd be about 628 mil. Even if it had 1 billion then (very unlikely), now it'd  be 1.2 billion.

If we consider 2 billion to be dev + marketing it's still be an absurd amount

2 billion is an absurd number even with inflation adjusted and if you genuinely think 2 billion is reasonable then you need to learn the value of a dollar
The game isn't even out yet bruh. Do you know how much 2 billion is? And rdr 2 is already one of the biggest games ever. Sorry dude but gta 6 won't be 10 times that, maybe double or triple
It's really unfortunate we're gonna have to wait another 1-2 years for a PC release smh.
:(
The only real estimation is that take2 as an entirety is expecting 8 billion in revenue(not sure if it's a total or an increase i forget) in 2025 between all of their properties,
Im pretty sure the reports provided to the public and shareholders does not include extensive information regarding exact costs and budgets more so revenue. If my memory serves me right the ONLY indicator the budget is 2 billion is that the dude that leaked all the footage said so in a conversation with one of his friends.
Ikr, what a shot in the foot that would be, it would alienate 90% of their planned consumers
If the game lasts 10 years, it's $20 a year.

For reference £20 gets me 3 pints of Stella larger and a pack of nuts at my local pub. 

I personally think it'll launch at $70, but they'll release a $100 version with lots of extra GTAVI online content.
With that mindset you’ll be the reason games start costing more
Absolutely pathetic.
Dude, you maybe happy to spend that amount on a video game but the rest of us that aren't out of our minds would pass. Btw your username smells of "thank me for my service."
Did you just say having investments is the same as disposable income?
If its 200 I aint buying it
Source? They havent confirmed anything
Rockstar knows what are expectations are going to be. Their main goal is to like you said exceed those expectations and blow us away.
That's the same thing you said about cyberpunk didn't you?
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67663128.amp
is he still in psychiatric hospital?
And they would be the first suspects in case of a leak most likely
It literally leaked a few times from inside


Comes first to mind Project Americas was a huge thing
But still, i dont Think gta6 will come close to its hype, people want too much.
You really like calling people idiots, huh? Every time your username pops up you're usually telling someone or some community that they're stupid.
Fun fact: The GTA font is the same as this TV show's logo.
Yeah obviously. I’m responding to a comment. Obviously a video game is not going to cost $100.
Yes, actually. They've been public about improving their work environment and so far the biggest complaint from employees is that they had to come back into the office to finish the game.
They only worked on RDR2 and might be involved in working on GTA6. Guess what? RDR2 crunch time is why Rockstar overall changed policies.
Yeah that's what I think but think about it, RDR2 released in 2018 , VI is releasing in 2025, that's a 7yr dev cycle -in line with rockstars dev cycle of 5-7yrs, I'm not convinced they restarted from scratch cuz if so then it should of released in like 2020 or 2021, 4 years after rdr2. WEIRD.
If you account for pre-production, probably.
Except it is true...
Jason schrier who Is constantly in contact with r* employees got confirmation from multiple that the pre planning started in 2014 and continued in light development until very late 2018 when rdr2 was done, then it became their #1 priority,
Dawg I’m saying it’s not implausible for them to have a 2 billion dollar budget. Between their history of record-setting budgets and releases, the amount of money they continue make from their games and the sheer size of the market for the next game it’s not at all out of the ordinary
Have you done the math to know?
Rockstar is seeking perfection for GTA 6 and we already know they made over 2 billion with GTA 5 so it wouldn't be surprising if they spent it for GTA 6, a game will make much more money.
[deleted]
Financial reports do include breakdowns of budgets and costs. From the financial reports I've read these often don't include a specific breakdown per project (e.g. no specific budgets for Red Dead Redemption and GTA 6) but more like overal budgets (Marketing, R&D, etc.)

So it is true that it is unlikely to provide an *exact* numbers but making a rough estimate from the reports should still be very possible.
Honestly, if a pre order includes items that non pre order purchasers will ever get I *MIGHT* get it

(like a pre order exclusive house or car or whatever)
I truly think that if there's a $200 edition it's a stupidly over priced collectors edition WITHOUT the actual game itself like the RDR2 one
Found the poor.

It’s ok man, you’ll be alright.
You are on a fanboy Reddit, you’d absolutely pay Rockstars asking price.
No. Not the way we classify disposable income in the U.S.
Our
> Despite having his laptop confiscated, Kurtaj managed to breach Rockstar using an Amazon Firestick, his hotel TV, and a mobile phone.

Jesus.
Life in a psychiatric hospital? Holy shit that is worse than death, over leaking games? Fuck me.
Bro that's horror movie corporate shit.
Damn thats insane but understandable.
Holy shit I didn't know it was indefinite, is he ever going out?
seems so, haven’t spoken to him in many years
If you're expecting amazing graphics, open world, and interactabilty, you probably won't be disappointed. That should honestly be a guarantee.
The hype is so unreal and unparalleled to any other game that I can think of, that it is bound to piss some people off. Some people at this point are hoping for a 1:1 recreation of real life.

Edit: come to think of it, this *must* be the most anticipated game, ever. If not simply because of how wide of a reach social media has on advertisements and hype. People will love it, it will probably be relevant for years, and people will also nitpick it to death. 

Whenever this game comes out, it’s probably best staying off any social media. Guaranteed the ending will be spoiled within hours of its’ release.
When it comes to some of the crazy shit people want, doubtful - but it will likely match the hype. Rockstar is one of the only game companies who can do that consistently.
> I don't think GTA VI will come close to it's hype

I remember being soooo excited for *Grand Theft Auto V* before release back in 2013; I'd watched every trailer repeatedly, read every interview with Rockstar, read the previews/reviews, rinsed the songs being featured (leaks), constantly daydreamed of what I could do in the game, I studied every detail as much as I could. So when it came out and I put the game disc in my Xbox 360 on release day, I felt like I'd already played it before. Being *that excited* and having so many expectations definitely killed a lot of the hype for me. I thought this game was going to change my life, school was shit and it was the only thing I was looking forward to, and that I'd play it everyday... but the reality was I completed the main story within 2 weeks and left it for fucking months before I eventually ever came back to it. Started producing music even and haven't stopped since!

> people want too much

My point is, I was young back then and hype got the better of me. The game was incredible for what it was, but I alone ruined it for myself. I think a lot of other people here will do that too with *VI*. Now that I'm older, it's easier to reign in expectations and not go too overkill on looking up interviews, reviews, gameplay videos, songs, etc and dreaming of all the impossible things that I would like in a GTA game.

Mostly, I genuinely think it's down to age. Younger people are going to be frantically obsessed with all things *Grand Theft Auto VI* until release, because it's probably the first (and only) GTA rollout in their lifetime, where they're able to go and buy the game for themselves and everything.

They've just got to keep their hype and expectations in check, ofherwise, like you implied, they're going to be beyond disappointed. 

(Sorry for the wall of text reply!)
I hope there will be not to many delays at least
People have always speculated what features next GTA have and hype has been unreal always, still nobody never got disappointed except delusional ones.
was thinking the same. the higher the expectations, the greater room there is to potentially not reach it
Ur right people are expecting way too much
You’re actually right I just checked his comments his whole page is one big ego trip. Ok now back to minding our own business..
The font name is "Pricedown"
Would anyone argue that $100 isn't fair value for the entertainment? How many players clock in hundreds and in some case thousands of hours. 

The story is likely to be what 40-80 hours long?
Which a lot of people can't do because they live far away or other reasons. Not exactly worker friendly.
We will see, if at the end credits they will not mention Dan Houser then last restart was around 2020, so 5-6 years of development, and when u look that leaks form 2022(90 clips) then based on that videos it looked as early development(probably alpha verison)
Oh i read his comment wrong. whoops, I thought he was against the idea of what Jason said.

You're 200% right
So you just believe some random made up number because you think it's "not implausible". Why not 3 billion or 5 billion?
Have you read the post? It literally says how many people worked on rdr2 and how big the budget was. About the same amount of people are working on gta 6 cus rdr2 had the entirety of rockstar games working on it aswell

I don't understand why you are so adamant about the 2 billion? Even like 500mil is an insane number for a budget and would still lead to the biggest game ever
And you have no concept of money. There is absolutely 0 proof that rockstar will spend 2 bil on the game is what I'm saying. Send me the source of that claim
Yeah. Even though I don't agree with it, RDR2 had one or two exclusive side missions if you pre ordered the more expensive version.
You said you have no disposable income, yet you're calling others poor lmao. That's what makes it pathetic. You're encouraging billion dollar corporations to do massive price hikes for literally no reason.
Is there enough of the broom left to sweep up? Or is it too far gone up your arse
You sound extremely insecure over your financial status.
In this economy? Ha nope
My fault thanks
that’s why you don’t fuck with rockstar
They buried the lede. He was stalking girls with the intent to rape them and murdering animals but for some reason people made it out to be because he hacked Rockstar
The guy is unhinged. He said he wouldn’t stop doing that.
[deleted]
Depends, there are some good things GTA4 had that GTA5 didn't, though at least we could finally use ladders.
I honestly don’t think so. I think it releases and fucking nails it
Yeah 100%. I said this in another comment, but it's reasonable to expect the best open-world, top of the line graphics, and other stuff. But some people go way too overboard.
Honestly, i dont think rockstar would post gta6 trailer it they werent 100% sure they can finish it by 2025 but one can only hope
No shut that corporate dickriding bullshit up. The devs and all employees are paid anyways. They aren’t getting more for a higher cost.
Minimum_Dentist_9105 when workers have to go to work
I agree with you in the sense that I think being able to work from home should be a thing that’s allowed, but at the same time I don’t think you can hate the company for it since it’s quite normal to have to come in to work

Imagine all the traffic that could be saved if you didn’t have to go to work, especially in US where your commutes seem awfully long 

& as the traffic is reduced, the people who actually do need or want to go to work can get to work even faster, saving even more time & emissions, plus less accidents 

In the big picture, if the people with office jobs were allowed to work from home, it would be a HUGE win for the public

That said, from what I’ve heard, R* had improved a lot, & no crunch hours is awesome
My comment lol😂
Because the allegedly leaked number is 2 billion. The major leaks so far have been fairly accurate too as far as we know. That, combined with my earlier reasoning is why I’m comfortable saying 2 billion, even if it may not actually be true. If the leaks said 3 (maybe not 5 though) I’d be confident in that too.
Hope the ghosting meant you learned something ;)
You're arguing with literal children, my guy. I'd give up if I were you.
[deleted]
No disposable income doesn’t mean I’m broke, it just means every dollar is spoken for. 

No reason?

Let’s see champ…

AAA games were $70 in 1992, that’s $159 today.

And the games now have so much more content than games in the early 90’s.

$200 is a bargain for gta6 and I guarantee there will be collectors editions well north of $200 and wouldn’t be surprised at all for the base game with all relevant content to be $100.
Another kid who can’t swing $100. It’s going to be a rough day for you when the rest of us are playing the full game and you’re bitterly disappointed with your watered down version.
Not much out there gives better value per dollar than rockstar games. The full game will cost at least 99$, and its day one sales will eclipse gtav even with the perceived price hike.
They should make a Bully style game about this guy's life around the mental ward.
Video game or not it's still a crime. Stealing classified videos from a company is illegal.

And if the company you stole from is as huge as Rockstar then they can do things like this and noone can do anything about it.

People don't realise how much power the gaming industry has. We reached a point where it has more income than working in the medical field.
That is very true. The only reason I have so much trust in Rockstar is because of RDR2. If that had never come out, I would be skeptical.
[deleted]
Are you saying you couldn't use ladders in GTA IV? Because you definitely could.
GTA4 and 5 were built for the same hardware. This is a different beast.
I agree with you, but I’m not speaking about the majority, but the minority of people. Every game, movie, song, art, regardless of how beloved it is, will have a few that disagree. It will likely be a very small minority, but it’s impossible to make everyone happy when this game is so hyped and the brand so popular. And video game subreddits are the best place to go and complain.

Look through Space Marines’ subreddit history as a recent example. Absolute praise the first couple weeks, and quickly devolved into criticism and demands for more. That’s just how it is.
I really do want a next year release of the game
Ahh sweet summer child...
Yes, just go to work when you literally can't go to work and you took the job because you could work from home, you're so smart. Rockstar makes good games, but their work environment is notoriously shit.
Oh shit lmao. 

Sorry i'm fucking tired rn😂
If you learned something from people ghosting you you'd be a fucking genius
So do you have an actual primary source for this number or not?
Yes, you're so smart. They should make it 1000$ while they're at it. They'll make so much more money!!!

There's a reason they've barely raised the prices for games. Because they've clearly calculated that people won't be willing to pay ridiculous amounts of money just to play one game.
If every dollar is spoken for that means you don't have a disposable income you'd be making yourself broke buying something for 200. The game isn't even out yet but you think for 200 bucks it's a bargain? Send me $300 Guarantee it's a deal giving me the cash instead
Now that gaming has become more digital....this point is dumb and you're speaking with your wallet and not your mouth.
>No disposable income doesn’t mean I’m broke, it just means every dollar is spoken for.

Thats literally what poor is.

>AAA games were $70 in 1992, that’s $159 today.

>And the games now have so much more content than games in the early 90’s.

Games were also a fairly new sensation back then and it was a pretty niche interest which is why the cost has come down over the years. You don’t know this industry as well and you seem to think you do.
>AAA games were $70 in 1992, that’s $159 today.

mfs will talk like salaries increased too with inflation.
The gaming market was a lot smaller back then, so they needed a higher price for profit. Now it's the biggest entertainment market which means they sell more copies. Early adopters usually pay more
What was the last rockstar game that shelved story mode content on release? And as far as I'm aware, all previously purchasable content for rdro and gtao is still purchasable, with the exception to timed or holiday exclusives? So, wtf watered down version of what drugs are you on???
They have one already - Manhunt 2
I feel you there. I started playing RDR2 again and, it's really easy to sink a LOT of time into it.

I really hope the gore is used in GTA6 because right now it makes no sense, namely with explosions.

And two things I wish GTA5 had are being able to pick up and throw small objects, and that was something I REALLY liked in Saints Row 2 and wish they kept doing it, and one that was kinda simple is bringing back the controllable window washer platforms, those were incredibly useful and would have been useful in GTA5.
I realize that, still some things that were removed made zero sense to me, like locking us out of places permanently[Maybe a couple made sense but most of them made zero sense at all, especially places you could buy] or that was can't interact with some things like we could in 4.
No, I'm saying that as of GTA4 we could finally use ladders.
Some criticisms are fair though, it just means that the first impressions were good, and people come to recognize areas of improvement after spending more time with it. doesn't always mean people simply want more more more.
Me too, i had a nightmare that it got deleyed to 14 march 2026
What does this mean?
Cringe
I’m not arguing that their work environment isn’t shit, I’m not educated enough on the topic to form that opinion. However, requiring employees to go to the office isn’t indicative of a shit work place, nor is it out of the norm.
You're good man😂
Thankfully Ignorance doesn't care about gender :)
$1000 wouldn’t sell, but $100 will sell no problem, and they are required to get maximum return for their investors so the actual game will absolutely cost $100.

Maybe there will be a stripped down version for $70-$80, but it will be missing some choice skins, missions and cars.

But the game with all relevant content will be $100.

I’d set a reminder for ya, but clearly this is a burner account for ya.
So here’s how my finances are, I invest heavily because I want to, but I could peel off $200 for this game and it wouldn’t affect me for a second other than adjusting my auto contribution to my brokerage account that week.

Giving you $300 would be a waste though, but I’ll definitely buy a second copy at $100 and give it to a military member in your honor.
Well they definitely weren’t stagnant since 1992.

US minimum wage in 1992 was $4.25/hr, now it’s $7.25, so that puts the cost of a game at $119.

Average U.S. income in 1992 was $25,903, now it’s $59,228 which puts the cost of a game at $160.

Average wage has kept up, minimum wage not so much, both wages show that the game should be well north of $100.
RDR2 cut a ton of content for the $60 version of the game.

Now maybe you want to say that I’m seeing it wrong and I paid extra for bonus content, but launch day “dlc” was unheard of until publishers realized that gamers have been locked into $60 games for over 30 years and the easy way to get proper amounts for their shareholders is to strip features from the base game and pretend like it’s premium content but we all know day one additional content was part of the game all along.

I couldn’t speak to online play, that seems like a cesspool to be honest.
Gotcha! The ladders and the ability to grab ledges and shimmy around led to hours of my friends and I parkouring around the city
Hopefully it won't came true
Rockstar is notorious for shit work environment though.
We're not talking about Special/Collector's editions. People are unironically arguing that the standard edition which the vast majority of people will buy will cost anything from 100 to 150 USD. This is just absurd and would lead to insane backlash, which is why they wouldn't risk it.

Maybe in 10 years it will happen though, if people like you encourage them to do so.
So you... invest your disposable income... so you have... disposable income. If your investment cycle can be in disposal for a moment. It's... disposable...
What did they cut? In fact, what dlc, aside from cosmetics, have they released at all for rdr2? 

Yes, I can agree on day one, dlc, and day one updates. They are a massive rip-off to consumers for the likes of shareholders.

Again, what story dlc are you talking about? The one bank mission?
Same. Vaultling and Swimming ion San Andreas were huge steps up, letting us use ladders was even better.
Lucia Cosplay or Real ?

It’s not hard to do, Lucia looks like 99% of women in Miami lol.
I like where this is going, it's almost time for a seperate category on pornhub.
Real? As in a video game character came to life and is walking in a convenient store just as two guys happened to have a screenshot of her on their phone?
Nvm I found out who she is just OF promo.
Why did I think that this sub would somehow get smarter after we got the trailer
Ask her if she was that bikini girl.
If you thought for a second this is real, you should probably be going outside more
Goddamn Latina women are actually the finest women to ever exist
Holy fucking shit. I am a self respecting man. But I can confidently say; I'd let her ruin me.
[removed]
givin me second hand embarrassment xd
![gif](giphy|tsS1G63wsH1xKkTtOq)
She should have carried a gun and rob the store to look more realistic. /s
It would be funny if this was recorded in Miami also
The modded version of Lucia

Mommy?
Fake af
Cosplay, up close you can tell. Besides, I’m not sure people would walk around looking like they’re about to rob a joint. 

By the way, is that black dude also one of the guys from the trailer?
Staged
Def a bbl
I put the new forgis
All fun in games till she pulls out the glock
Cringe fest lately.
Good cake

Typical Miami gas station
She should consider going to the gym
Wonderful!
Remeber kids, attention is one hell of a drug
Sending thots and prayers.
Imagine if this was gameplay graphics
Are you 14 OP?
The black guy looks like the dude in the race meet or sideshow.
here we go
Damn! She is fine as fuck!
lol. Heavy on the goofball.
OVERRATED TRASH?😮😮😮😮😮 THEORY!
Theres no wawa in florida
She likes her attention
Disingenuous content is so 2023
Nah totally real
![gif](giphy|xULW8N9O5WD32L5052)
I've seen two people that look just like whom I've seen in the GTA VI trailer.
Are wawas all just built exactly the same because I swear I’ve been in this one lmao
I would strap her on and wear her like a government issue gas mask
Wow
I think I’m in love
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I recognize that Wawa...
I love Wawa
Actual gameplay footage leaked
Who is all of this cringe targeting?
She looks like a Spanish Savanah Bond.
DAYUM
Oh god, is this sub going to be popular with trash posts like this?
Lets hope we get this jiggle physics in the game
Clickbait. Ofc it’s cosplay, the whole video is staged.
Miss this is a wawa
Wawa
Who is she? Even if OF girl whats her name?
I heard the real girl who does it has OF, so hell no
But why is she moving like a gtaV character ??
She even got the jiggle physics
You can see the make up shading and stuff to make it look more like Lucia.  Well done though.
Does it matter if cosplay or real? Its hot.
🤦🏽‍♂️😂
Neither, that's obviously Jason.
It’s not her. Relax. The real voice actor would not be posting anything like this🙄 she’s just getting clout
Pocah?
The store owners in upcoming years: Please just buy something when making those videos.
booty is my kryptonite.  and gta 6 is filled with it.
I seen this in porn hub
Wait wtf I think I know that wawa
She should sue rockstar for stealing her likeness like some other 🤡haha but for real she a baddie!
Nah man that's footage from the game
What Wawa is this? PA or FL?
Lucia is going to be the new Harley Quinn Cringe.
This sub when brown woman wears jean shorts

Okay
Jesus Christ... They're already starting
Built for BBC
I forGYATT how much I missed Wawa.
Girl better be careful flashing colours
One of those guys is from the trailer too
That booty ridiculous
Everyone’s saying it’s an OF ad… what’s the OF?
They forgot to check her beauty marks
lol they in a wawa
Mommy.
Sorry, I mean mommy. 
Fuck.
Mommy?
This is set up
GYATTT
Cringe
Am I tripping or was the confused guy Shaquille O'Neal
I miss WaWa.
I’d let her 187 me
I’m taking her down
Social media is such a joke
Hell yeah!
She defiantly has cake
ayo this is the exact wawa i was at earlier
Oh boy I can't wait for Wawa's in GTA
Give her 100 BILLION dollars right NOW Rockstar!!!!
Bro why does this Wawa layout look exactly like the one next to my house?
Why do I have a feelin GTA6 will make social media even more unbearable when it comes out?
She is hot though 🥵🥵
u/savevideo
Damn the jiggle physics are actually realistic 😂😂
that’s jaelanijade lol
Mmmm wawa
Why did i thought it's cgi at the start.
now she doing the "bryan zampella move" women edition on twitter
Wonder who tf the actors really are. It’s not that Bryan dude and the suspected female actor ended up just being Lupe from the warehouse.
She should sue
If Lucia looks like that in game idk how much gaming I’ll be doing..

I don’t understand OP’s question, what cosplay isn’t real?
Thic af
I don't understand the gyatt movement at the moment, or the instant love for booty
You look beautiful both
Hold up, is this a WaWa in Miami? It looks like a WaWa I visit frequently.
Damn she looks exactly like Lucia
Gyattttt something in my eye
Damn...
I just found an Amazon [Notebook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQNG3RN5) featuring Lucia 👀👀
Typical Miami hoe nothing serious
Stop this cringe shit please. This is so bad.
You said it yourself


Cosplay
This is so corn

CGI. Well done.
In a Wawa to.
Cringe
Where is the RPG put there butt at?
Thirsty ass Nugga!
Nah Lucia's nose and lips aren't this big
Pretty common
Gyatt IV
Certainly. This is from Lucia Echavarria on Twitter. I saw it yesterday.

A Lucia playing a Lucia. Interesting.
I could surf on her wave all day brother
Best get myself down to Miami then
This feels like if in 2013 middle-aged men started posting videos of themselves in blue shirts being like **Michael Cosplay or Real??**
![gif](giphy|xUOxeZUc8UFwMgH2MM|downsized)
Miami sounds like a dream
>It’s not hard to do, Lucia looks like 99% of women in Miami lol.

and that's the entire point.
No, 99% of women in miami looks like Lucia
99% is a drag Miami is not full of Latinos lmao it’s all different races and ethnicity
Bro never been to Miami I can tell 😂
Omw
God bless Miami
Trust?

*Trust*
I gotta rewind and count those moles first
Brooo💀 i agree tho
Now almost all of these "Viral" slightly sexual clips are advertisement of somebody's Onlyfans 

We are becoming more degenerate as the time goes on
Almost?
Hold me beer
Yeah, sounds like an OF advertisement
I don’t get what the point of this skit is. Is it funny?
Rule of thumb. It’s a fucking OF ad always
The dead giveaway was the lack of the video being actually funny and the only “content” being the woman and her appearance.. becoming way too common now, really annoying tbh.
Did you seriously think this was real at any point?
What’s OF
Obviously lol,

This is why I don't pay attention to any clips on the internet with even slightly sexual undertones
You know the rules. If she has a linktree....
Lmao we're hyping a game up about drugs, guns, hookers, sex, etc but we shit on women making money for themselves on OF. Cognitive dissonance is crazy
Hoes gonna hoe
Everyone is thirsty and always has been. Now the hottest girls of anyone’s dreams is just a couple of clicks away and sometimes a little from the wallet.
The issue is that you're expecting fans of rockstar to be smart. And no im not insulting people for liking the games (rockstar has me stockholm syndromed so i cant say im different).

There is a genuine stupidity phenomenon going on, it's especially visible in the red dead sub.
I don’t think anybody thought this was “real” the caption is obvious bait
Just saw a post saying Latina women are God's great gift upon mankind 😂
No doubt
[deleted]
Yes sir, Latino man here and can confirm
I mean seeing Salma Hayek was already evident to that fact.
She got breast too
That only happens in the Philly wawas
Pretty sure this in in my hometown a little bit north of tampa, completely identical setup
LMAOOO 😭😭
I’m sure she’s a very pleasant woman.
God forbit a woman makes porn you definitely consume.
The only thing that is gullible is you believing in our sarcasm here.
Covid the entire world walked around with masks and bandanas lmaooooo
No shit.
And it’s only the beginning
#wawa
You literally see women like her everyday, and you’re still “falling in love?” 

lol simp
Used not to, now they're all over the place. Source: i live here
P sure this is the wawa in Wesley chapel Fl
I know, I already mentioned it. she promo her OF

I’ve gathered that he’s wealthy and thinks he’s funny although he’s unfunny as fuck 

His “skits” usually revolve around him and a random thicc influencer
so is this the real lucia actor? or is it a fake?
Is that even a real person/ account?  Smells fishy
This is not Lucia Echavarria😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Why do you think your grandpa trying to get Florida
![gif](giphy|WoQmhbWcr7LoODs8a4)
As a Floridian Miami in real life is just as crime riddled as vice city whenever they introduce GTA online in GTA 6
Went to school down there. Whatever your personal preference in attractive- they have it and it’s top tier.
Honestly yeah, it’s got a ton of problems but I’m proud to be Made in Dade. Obviously the game exaggerated things but they really did an incredible job of capturing everything about the city. And yes that includes the women—sexy, determined, and yeah sometimes a little crazy. I miss them/the city a lot so I’m looking forward to being able to boot up the game and get a little taste of home sweet home.
It is.
A fever dream, Miami is terrible. Cool to visit not to live.
I lived there for a while and I can promise you it is not. Leaving was the single greatest improvement to my life, mental health, and overall happiness that I have ever made.
Southern California has some winners too
I should know, I’m a gringa myself and born and raised there… actually one of my ancestors was the first territorial representative and senator of Dade, so we go way back! It was an exaggeration lol.
Bro literally born and raised in 305 lmao one of my ancestors was the first territorial senator and representative of Dade and the lighthouse keeper of El Farito, my grandmother was one of the biggest brokers during the Cocaine Cowboys era and was the first fire commissioner. She also owned the Chuckwagon which every diehard Miamian still goes to. Her grandfather literally died building it, in a construction accident during the first real estate boom in the 20’s. That’s MY city hahaha

The world is not becoming "more" degenerate. I'd rather live today and deal with onlyfans girls on the internet than, say, hundreds of years ago when slavery was paramount and war was synonymous with mass rape and ransacking.
You really should take a look at the sexual deviancy throughout the ages. Whole lot of rape, polygamy, incest, orgies and whatnot

Punishment for crimes was torture and the whole town came out to watch or join in stoning you. They were also happy to bring the kids along to watch you be hanged 

Things are a bit less degenerate these days
It’s really perverted and sad
Being horny is degeneracy? Woof, please go back to the incel corner.
I guess so.
This is a very smart OF ad
"Don't sexualize me but you can jerk-off to me"
Yeah, I've come to the conclusion that anytime one of these involves a smoking hot chick, I assume it's an OF ad.
So…

How am I supposed to get its bait just based off the title? Lmao. You can’t blame me for not knowing if he meant it or not
Based on recent posts in this sub it’s not hard to believe for whatever reason or how ever reason they’ll believe it’s real lol
They really are imo
Pretty much the exact order in which they will ruin your life as well, which is totally my type.
This guy Latina’s.
Tbf doesn't stop them from being hoes.
Few states only have them. Mostly in PA and VA, MD only have like 3. Now Florida have them. 

Thank God I live in Virginia, and thank God for Wawa
Oooo i am confidently wrong
“i’ve gathered”☝️🤓
It's a lady sharing the name who seemingly is cosplaying the character as well. I don't think it's the actress.
Wallet is on a diet at the moment unfortunately
My tired eyes read that as *access* but success works too lol
Aye!
First you get the money.

Then you get the mud.

Then you get the women!
Maybe one day
Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Haitians. What do you expect. A melting pot of curvy women and the humidity to keep them fit. It was inevitable.
me and a couple of my college friends went down there for spring break this year hit 2 chicks while I was down there
To resurrect himself maybe?

Ohh that’s Cool !  I knew it was an exaggeration but some people genuinely think there’s just Hispanics in Miami off of GTA 6 lmao
Is this a copy pasta?
In thrust we trust
BADOOONKAAADONNNK
From white men’s perspective those were the best times for them
I never said that lol

Don't put words in my mouth
I absolutely hate how reddit defends this shit by their own weird ass logic.
 I want to see redditors' proud face as they use the word "incel" to end the arguments lol
Being horny about everything is what incels do, so what are you even talking about.
How so?

Seems really stupid
“For money of course. Oh, but I know my worth.
i mean if i could get money taking photos of myself i would. although people pay me not to take photos :(
What are you on about? The OP was asking if this was real or cosplay. Its obviously a skit/promo
Haha.  I get it now 🙏
Also, she’s almost entirely plastic so she’s barely human
Considering that they didn’t know what OF was they’re probably more godly then you
Porn especially after this OF revolution is seeping everywhere on the internet where we are spending more and more time as the time goes and it can't be healthy for a society. 

I want this game to mock the shit out of this aspect of our society.
You're confusing parody with satire. GTA makes a parody of our reality and doesn't necessarily comment on real life. The stories draw on irl elements to tell it's own story. It's a parody.
Bro it's people making an honest living. Seems to be the only people who think the way you do are chronically online insecure men.
Wawa sucks now. Food went downhill. Hard.  Bread is bad now, sandwiches suck anymore. 


-Philly
It’s not even the same girl the girl cosplaying is jaelani jade
yea i was confused because isn't there usually an NDA in place to stop the actors/actresses from coming out to tell everyone they're in GTA 6
Sorry, then you can only afford Trevor
My wallet has been battling anorexia my entire life :(
Well then your pp is gonna have to go on a diet as well
Don’t worry bro, just scam a crack head, it’s that easy in Florida
I'm sorry
I don’t know why this is said. That myth must have been made up by someone who loves dark women.
So cool.
Assaulting women is wrong don’t hit people you could go to jail
Oh yeah, everyone I know was saying they were gonna try to find their house / neighborhood… but more than that they captured the feeling. Particularly that scene where Lucia is cruising through the night with her hands in the air, the sky has that dusky purple look I know so well… I could practically feel the heat of the summer air right before the rain, the wind in my hair, music pumping, bright lights passing by, young and reckless and free. Takes me back to my wilding days lol.
In university I went abroad to Rome. We took a trip to Florence. I was shocked at the main cathedral, because I recognized everything. I forgot I’d played an assassins creed set there (2 or 3?). I was able to direct our small friend through the main streets.
Personally I thought they did a pretty good job of representation overall, there was a lot of people who were obviously Black or mixed too, even us rednecks got some spotlight.

But yea it’s a huge cultural melting pot, either way, I’m just ribbing on how many girls actually do look like that… I’m telling you I had such body dysmorphia growing up because I felt like I was the only one who wasn’t tan all over with an hourglass shape, big booty, wide hips, and legs that naturally could kick a door down lmao
I mean Miami is like 70%+ Hispanic. I'm a gringo and I'm a minority here
Hahaha no, I’m just a FL history / genealogy nerd and proud Miamian 🤓

"We used to have all the money and land, we still do but it's not as fun now...."
Forgetting white people were slaves before black people is the epitome of racism🤣
> We are becoming more degenerate as the time goes on

demonstrably not true
I want to see your face (likely complete with bulging forehead vein and steam coming out of your ears) walking through the grocery store and pointing at everything and saying "degeneracy!"
They also apparently equate perfectly natural human feelings to "degeneracy". THAT was my point.

There's nothing inherently degenerate about sexual urges.
The future!
She’s not almost plastic she’s real I met her
Calling a hoe a hoe is not in any way insecure. It’s what they are and some are proud of it (more power to them. Make money off them thirsty lonely dudes lol)
Honest living? You think perpetuating societal collapse is honest living?
never said it's wrong.  but it is hoe like and very often exactly, literally being a hoe
But now you can get an expensive large pizza that sucks, also fuck sheetz gobblers for life

Now you have my attention.
“This is 7 dollars”
My wallet died during the pandemic
Best i can do is
You better be
I personally think Ny has the sexiest women. Beauty, style, and attitude. No other states compare
That’s plus all the sexy white girls too. I don’t discriminate. I love the female form in all its variations.
Bro, what?!
Yeah ac 2 did a brilliant job of that, especially when you consider the games age so the hardware was more limited
Yes , people are playing down on how much more  Hispanics there are here and idk why 🤔
Everybody born in the USA is a gringo, even the Hispanics.
Gotcha. My family is also from Miami. Pretty cool history
Out of the two groups you listed, which people are more impacted by slavery and its outcomes? Sure, many white people were slaves in antiquity, but bringing it up in an argument about black slavery is like going into a Holocaust discussion and saying that the German soldiers had it worse.
My comment was in context of the internet and main stream social media but you are a smart redditor, interpret is however you like.
 No one said sexual urges are degenerate. Orgies, rape is degeneracy.  The fact that you can't distinguish the lines between them shows you're lost.
You realise prostitution is not a new thing?
Quit being such a dramatic fuck! They get paid and do their taxes, so no, society is not collapsing because of them!
No one calls someone a hoe because they think highly of them.
Ayo pause
No I'm sorry you're going to Florida
No the point is the black people don’t realize people are not oppressed in North America in 2023. Sure bring up some 3rd world country but screaming about it here wont solve nothing. In North America, there is black privilege.
lol don't act stupid, you knew what you were writing.
> No one said

And you're the first to mention "orgies" or "rape", so pardon me for not knowing wtf the original person was referring to. They replied to someone making a mention of pornhub. That's it.
Well if you wanna make a living by syphoning money from desperate men on the Internet that's your own perogative. The trade off for this easy money is being called a hoe for it.

The girls doing only fans know this. So why are you defending them?  They aren't asking for you to defend them mate lol.

And they're literally selling their body for money. So, yes, they are hoes.

They aren't going to sleep with you because you're defending them on reddit mate they don't even know you exist 🤣

And the reason I said they are sometimes literally hoes, is because many of them literally have sex for money.
What? You're telling me you wouldn't let Trevor plow your beanfield?
What’s wrong with Florida?
Buy me a ticket
This argument is incomprehensible, you're in too deep. Not even worth wasting my energy to argue against you. Your worldview is so distorted if you genuinely think that black people in the US have "privilege" and aren't disadvantaged at all. Have a nice day.
Please stop debating degeneracy with someone who calls themselves "SeriousCumshot".  I mean honestly.
Bruh, as I said before, don't write words for me lol
That's what would be considered degeneracy in the form of sex. Are you stupid?
I'm happily engaged thanks. I just don't get why onlyfans and women who do porn clearly live rent free in the heads of fools on the Internet.
Gestures broadly
Who’s oppressed my friend can you name me one person
Are you saying Pornhub is degeneracy?

It's either that or English isn't your first language and you're having a tough time, but doing your best. (commendable)

Or your reading comprehension (and ability to communicate, by extension) is really, REALLY fucking poor.
I have said I don't have an issue with it at all lol

I'm just saying calling them a hoe is not exactly inaccurate.
