World's quickest million-dollar round trip
Fuck. I will be apologizing to my future wife and kids for ruining their opportunity for generational wealth. I made stupid degen plays to get to 1.5m and I made stupid degen plays to get back down to 25k. Literally all I had to do was buy 30k shares of QQQ and I could've let that sit forever. I got so greedy and in turn spiraled out. I would never kms, but I understand the headspace now. The money was never mine to begin with if I never withdrew it, but still. All of the should've could've would'ves... At a *conservative* 8% return, it'd be $15m+ by the time I'd be allowed to touch it without penalty. Oh well.

This is what everyone on wsb loves to see. The folks who get lucky, didnt know they got lucky and thought it was "skill" and then lose it all
So you had 1.5m $ at one point and it wasn't enough for you?
Wait, so you went from $1300 to $1.5 million in like 25 days and then lost it all in like 3 days? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)

A little peek into how the spiraling accelerated

Edit: This was all in rollover IRA, so withdrawing would've been -10% on top of income tax. Either way, still would've been better than 23k lmao.
If you choose to invest in the future, one of the dumbest things you can do is try to replace what you had previously.

The whole ‚ÄúI was at $1.5M a week/month/year ago‚Äù will destroy you and whatever you hope to save and accrue for the future.

I‚Äôve seen many people like you at a casino, myself included. A great run followed by a great collapse. Fortunately in your case you are still like 1700% up in the last month, outpacing the vaaaast majority of investors in this place or any place for that matter.

Part of you may think wth I already lost X what‚Äôs another $24k when I started with $1400, and that approach will cause you to go to 0. 

I get shit for saying this but seriously take a day or week off. Don‚Äôt even ‚Äúwatch‚Äù anything. Get some exercise. Avoid your phone. Before you replenish your account you need to replenish what has been a crazy fucken ride the last month, both good and bad.

Sometimes the best thing you can do is nothing, and nothing here is keeping your money on the sidelines.
This is depressing

Straight to hall of fame - priority pass.
Thanks OP I all of a sudden feel much better about being down almost 20k all time!¬†


Seriously though you would have never stopped. If 100k wasn't enough, then 500k wasn't, then a million still wasn't you weren't ever gonna be satisfied.¬†


It was never about the money. You chased the high of winning like a meth addict.¬†
How the fuck do you not stop at 1M! 1 million!!!!!!!!!

I get it bro. I once turned $100 into 13k gambling and lost it all. I'm the guy who drives to the next exit if the gas is cheaper. You don't value money you didn't earn.

# "You were trying to make your life better, don't hold a grudge.

You‚Äôve just lost a large sum of money. You feel hopeless, foolish, regret. You were trying to make your life better.

You asked someone out and got rejected. You feel hopeless, foolish, regret. You were trying to make your life better.

You took a big risk and failed. You feel hopeless, foolish, regret. You were trying to make your life better.

You studied and studied but got a bad grade. You feel hopeless, foolish, regret. You were trying to make your life better.

Stop being so hard on yourself, you were trying to make your life better. Understand that you are grieving, but don‚Äôt allow yourself to hate yourself for having good intentions. Identify the mistakes and move on, but find a way to let it go. Don‚Äôt hold a grudge against yourself. "
holy shit
dependent growth sulky aware lavish tie chief touch full market
What did you invest in? It happened once, it could happen again, and now you have the extra knowledge of what it's like to lose 1m
You‚Äôve made me feel a lot better about losing $450k in a year. I appreciate your sacrifice fellow smooth brain.
This is the equivalence of some guy who won the mega lotto, then washed the jacket the lotto ticket was in and have it disintegrated by the rinse cycle
You could have owned a Wendy‚Äôs, instead you‚Äôll be giving $5 handies behind one
As much as it‚Äôs fun to meme on this sub, I genuinely feel bad for you man. Best of luck to you in the future man, and I hope you use this as a learning experience
When I was in my 20‚Äôs I stated a dotcom and was worth $6 million‚Ä¶.on paper.  It went poof.  But I used that experience to learn to recognize asymmetrical opportunities where the upside potential massively outweighed the downside risk.  (Hint:  they don‚Äôt come along often, but when they do, act decisively.). I was financially independent by age 32 and retired at 50.  Feel the pain.  Get drunk tonight.  Then starting tomorrow do a thorough post mortem of your thoughts and actions so you‚Äôll make better decisions going forward.
This is too depressing to laugh at
GRAND OPENING GRAND CLOSING
I need to save this.post for when I make money. I should take everything out when I make 100K. That's my target. The target moves as I lose more.
WSB is insane. I swing trade options and make 50-300% returns on a single trade regularly. However, my units are in the 1000-5000 range. So I will never see this in my life. As a pretty successful trader, I lose almost as frequently as I win (net after open/close position). It shocks me to see how many people on here are able to commit their life savings on one Yolo trade or a series of compounding trades. I just can't wrap my head around it as the math doesn't work. lol. Yet I also somehow feel jealousy frequently lol.
All these people saying how they‚Äôd cash out at x$ and do y with the money. 

Bullshit. You‚Äôre all a bunch of degenerate gamblers and would have done the same or worse. It never got there in the first place. 

To the OP, you didn‚Äôt lose $1.5mil because you never actually had it in the first place. You had the illusion of having it. The same mentality that got it for you in the first place is the same mentality that lost it. 

You didn‚Äôt lose anything because you still have your initial money. This is very different to plowing $500k into the market to lose $490K. That‚Äôs easy. It gets done every day by massive players who expect to then make it back on the next $500K play. 

Stay strong and take a big deep breath. There‚Äôs always tomorrow. 

I‚Äôm always happy to chat if you need to unload the guilt.
This isn‚Äôt over, just think about it, you have 23k to get it all back
I bet the early withdrawal penalty you would have had to pay on $1.5m is looking pretty good right about now

Nana accepts your loss as love
Game's not over yet you still have 23k to lose
If at any point my FD options ever get up to $1MM and i want to let it "ride" i give you mofos permission to force me to sell the positions at gunpoint

Still a really good overall return 

Did you feel any different for those 2 days you were a millionaire?
Let me guess your thought at that moment.  
  
*Why stopped at $1M when I could have $10M?*
All I see is $23,143.12 in capital to make it back in 0DTE trading
Holy fuck this was in an IRA?

It's amazing you made 1.5million because your math is fucking terrible. You couldn't afford anywhere close to 30k shares of QQQ, you could barely afford 3k shares.
Me. And I hate it every day. Every day I also wonder how I managed to lose 90% trying imo to be super cautious. Started with 150k and went to 1.1 mil down to 600k and back to 1.1 again - just to drop to 135k  rn where I started. So many sleepless nights since then. Part of it was pressure to make more money to cover medical bills and care for my mother who had a brain stroke. Semi-loss of a job, hence trying to make more to cover more and more expenses. I think all that pressure ruined my ability to think clearly. An absolute nightmare development.
If you did it once, why don't you believe you can do it again? It shouldn't take much to believe in something you've already seen. And next time you'll be wise enough to stop right?
Craziest shit ever.
So what stupid fucking dirty degen plays did you make that mooned you like that in the first place? 

Also sorry for your loss üåπ
lol fuck I would be so depress and disgusted with myself. Thank you for making my day you sweet regard.
If I had 1m in cash that would go 60% into SPLG, 20% into BND, 20% into SCHD and I proceed to live a quiet unremarkable life.  

But in order to make 1m in the first place you need to be the kind of person who wouldn‚Äôt hold 20% SCHD and 20% BND.
Sorry to hear that man. Good luck!
Thank you for your service.
crazy shit OP, hat's off
Fuck man. Hoping you come out stronger. Always stay humble on the markets
Like....god damn bro. I did this with 50k once and thought it was a big deal. You are going down as a legendary regard for this one. ü´°
What the fuck. Is secondhand depression a thing?
How much did you start out with, how did you get to about 400 K, how did you get to 1.5 million? Can you provide a few more details I‚Äôm guessing zero day to expire options?

>The money was never mine to begin with if I never withdrew it

Not to rub salt in the wound, but‚Ä¶ it was 100% yours. You‚Äôre coping with a fallacy.
You turned 1.5k into 24k in a month¬† ¬†Congrats.¬† Now withdrawal 22.5k and start fresh.¬† This is the way.
You literally lived out this Simpsons episode: https://youtu.be/h-Z8_Mzmqgk?si=83lmRtRU5S2ITazE
imaging getting 1.5M, like 120k passive income for the rest of your life btw, and still being like "nah boi I wanna gamble options!"
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd sleep for a year . Or eat
Id definitely kms but dont do it man
Crazy how my 3k loss seems so forgiving lol
please look at some of my posts on 
- taxes
- stop loss
- capital gains / loss
- asset protection

None of them are financial advice, but they do give you the basis of how to protect oneself from oneself. 

I‚Äôve been there and let greed take over from rational trading psychology. Trader greed is a killer drug that destroys one‚Äôs self. 

Even though the balance is not what it once was, you can, if you learn the right tools and employ proper risk management, rebuild. And do so unbelievably. 

I wish you all the best and a wonderful turnaround to where you are at at this moment.
Someone offered me 50$ in bitcoin for a debt they owed me. I couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around what around what bitcoin was since I couldn‚Äôt hold it. I feel for you, it gets better.
If you love something, let it go. 

If it comes back to you, it‚Äôs yours to keep.
30k shares QQQ would be $13.5M ü§°
Thanks for sharing. I woulnt be so hard on myself for losing 700k after retiring early on it. I tried buying a house and car w cash to keep me from losing it. I kept getting bad runs w options. Over the course of a year i slowly lost it all and had to go back to work. Now im abt 300k in debt. Just dont take loans out to trade with like i did. Its going to bother you on and off for a long time. I keep thinking why i couldnt just be happy with 700k? I was going for over a million for the first time in my life and wasnt patient enough to do it with stocks. Once u get on that high from winning big, it feels like u cant lose. I kept telling myself ill get it back the whole time. One good trade. I started with 8k so its not like i lost 700k. Also i wld never have made it without a risky options trade. Just keep your head up and dont be in a rush to get it all back at once. Were both gonna find the right trade again but it cant be forced.
U had 1.5 made off options
This would haunt me fr
lol I no longer feel bad about my 5k loss

Atleast it wasn‚Äôt 700k of Intel¬†
Just saw this on Twitter. Worst thing I've ever seen! But at least you're here where you belong
I would be too fucking nauseous after such a loss to post on fucking reddit. How do you walk around with such big balls OP?
greed sucks. it's a natural human emotion and the market is designed to exploit it


fuck thats a lot of money
Right grandma‚Äôs intel is no longer in the hall of fame, congrats regard. You won!
Fuck me this is greed. Even I would have sold. In hindsight.
The regardation to get to 1.5m is the same regardation to lose it all. The money was never yours. Enjoy your 19k
Bruh, GUH just got a new definition today. 

At least now my 133k to 3k doesn‚Äôt feel as bad.
We need a hotline for these types. When you hit 1M on a shitty play you can call and it's just a guy yelling at you to cash out.
Bro you made a million in two weeks and didn't sell????
Honest question, u/CircaMuse, what was your number for cashing out and lumping into SPY? Clearly it was higher than $1m, right...
Bro why not take out a mil ....
You turned 25k Into 1.5m?
Ummm. I‚Äôm not familiar with the tax system of the IRA but if you cashed out the 1M gain, then proceeded to loose it all in other trades, do you still have to pay capital gains tax on that initial gain?

Me rn
What was your play OP? What did you YOLO in? And what else did you want after 1.5M another YOLO to 15M? üåù
You‚Äôre up 500% üòä
Had 20k turned into 180k in pot stocks, didn't sell.
Yoloed 10k into AMC, didn't sell at 80k

Lost around 60k honestly trying to trade, and now I'm back with my TFSA trying to grow it slowly and the rest is in savings... It's a sad world when you realize you're a greedy dickhead. Takes 3 times to learn apparently :P

Sorry for the unrealized gains my friend
no worries, this guy is about to own 20million in the middle of August and 40k at the beginning of September.
Damn I've been lurking for a while, but this post absolutely hits different than anything I've ever seen. You are a really strong person for being able to shrug off a loss this big, I can't even imagine what I would do in that position. You had a great run, and even still you are up a giant amount! Best of luck to you if you decide to throw your hat back in there; if you did it once you can do it again. May lady luck smile on you once more!
This is fucking wild. The ultimate degen
This is special.

Literally could‚Äôve loaded up on spy or any stock and sold an insane amount of covered calls and still printed fucking cash dude.
Looks like UVXY chart
23k left for call options Wednesday before expiration. Fuckin yolo.
Someone check if this dude still alive tomorrow
Man if you bought CC ETFs with that you could be collecting like 30-40k a month without margin easily. I mean those also have there own issues. But dang.

Sorry man. Tough loss.
I‚Äôve managed to cut my net worth in half over the past month after a massive win, not even remotely as big a loss as this but can confirm the kms headspace. Thanks for showing me I‚Äôm not alone, and now we both know you should walk away after you hit a 100 bagger. Chin up my degen brother the story ain‚Äôt over yet.
https://preview.redd.it/slekeupaxqhd1.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=a29dc62bfbfa606fb8d6c0adad4c3b26da11c23a
You were in a position of "fuck you" and you let it slip away dude. Don't ever do this again and always remember you can't go broke taking profits. If you could do it with 10k or 50k you can do it again but it's a whole lot harder to undo this move. 

I don't say this to be hard on you. I say it having turned 5k to 30k and lost it all myself. The number doesn't matter. The feeling is the same and the lesson is the same. Enter with a target goal. If it hits. Cash it. Then reset and go again and don't ever fucking reach like this again.
Troy that you?
The good news is that you been there done that,  1.3k -to 1.5M. Now you have some left overs. Try to do it again üöÄ
Atleast you can say now : I was a millionaire!
What were you investing in to see that kind of explosive growth?
What were your two moves?
what did you do if i may ask
Everyone should immediately keep 1 mill to themselves no matter the investment. You could have risked the 500k but not the 1 mil
This might the the worst best thing I've ever seen here.
degen or not, i need to know how you went from 1300 to 1.5M because I‚Äôll set aside and gamble 1300 a year on this possibility lol

also wym 30k of qqq and let that sit forever? you have nearly 30k right there. no time like the present for a sound strategy
OP, I kindly suggest that you publish a weekly newsletter for the rest of us to do the opposite of.
You know son... i once was a millionare...
4 days ago you commented that you lost 150k on options in the last 4 years. It sounds like you have bigger issues than losing 1 mill.
Bro you had it made, that‚Äôs 75k annually off interest alone.

Could‚Äôve quit your job, assuming you had one, and coasted for a couple years or played the wheel.
How do I a make $1.5M? Now that you did it yourself please advise. I‚Äôll be sure to cash out though. üôè
Bro you were a millionaire for like 2 days. Congrats!!!
Easy come easy go
With these trading skills, there probably are no future wife and kids. I see a nice free stay in Tenderloin, SF.
Came for the lulz, stayed for life lessons.
My old roommate with online poker lol puts in $20 bucks, got up to 9.5k lol I go grab lunch, come back and he‚Äôs got like $75 bucks haha
At some point after you‚Äôve had some time to deal with this, it‚Äôd be great to see you tell your story on this. A trade log detailing every trade you took to get there and back down would be good lesson for new/struggling traders to see the importance of risk management. 

No worries if it‚Äôs too painful to do, but would be good to see. Potentially good for you to see as well, but I assume you‚Äôve learned your lesson at this point.
Guy went from banging models to banging co workers at Wendy‚Äôs.
U not trying to turn the 25k into more??
*NEEDS to see
Exactly why I withdrew my little $30K. I knew it was all luck and this time I actually stopped while I was ahead
I mean even Warren Buffet claimed investing is just another form of gambling.
You cannot be more right. You have to know when to start, BUT you also have to know WHEN to END
You mean every single person lol. They hit red on the roulette table once and decided that red is an unbeatable strategy and double down.
This is market makers way of saying ‚Äúhello and goodbye. Oh and fuck you‚Äù
I did that 3 times ü´†
Yep. I got super gross fuckin greedy for no reason and paid dearly.
If he thought that way, he would have never turned his $1400 into even $5k.

The reason he got to $1mm is the same DNA that got him back down to $25k
IN A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT
He had hookers and coke money and went after Dubai porta potty money and missed.  Respect the effort
Pretty sure it was in his Roth IRA too lmao, tax free gains
No bc then you start aiming for 2 million, then retire early money, then fuck you money, then yacht money, theb dubai porta potty money.  It never stops.
Even throwing a few thousand into options at a time and putting the rest in VOO or QQQ could've made this guy some good money. But I bet he yoloed it all into 0dte SPY calls.
if this is true,

why the fuck you dont put aside 1M of the 1.5M and keep gambling 500k?
i  cant imagine hitting 1m and not immediately throwing that into an etf
In fairness he still made +1600% in 30 days‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd be suicidal if I was in his shoes with this potential gain but he still did 1,300 to 25k. Way better than me. I only see red
Shits powerful when you see it. Learn it and wield it.¬† God speed regard.
In the last 2 weeks I had a chance of going from 500 to 1 mil, and wasted it because of my hardwired tendency to think it's too late to take advantage, not only in the market but life in general.
Oh my gourd!

lmao I‚Äôm saving this for future use
This is a legendary loss. Can you contact the mods and have them restore the post.
BRO. HOW DO YOU MAKE 1.1M IN A DAY AND NOT CLOSE POSITION WOW MAN
Happened to me during Covid lockdowns as well. Turned $35k to $1m+. With the $1m I bought $750k of stocks while continuing buying spy PUTS with remaining float of $250k., target was $200, at $220 SPY does a reversal and I kept losing and rebuying puts. I started liquidating the portfolio to purchase more puts,  Ended up cashing out at $140k and losing the whole portfolio, I had a family member change the password to my trading account so I stop the losses lol. That same portfolio is now worth $3m. Oh well.

Sorry for the loss. Walk away from trading until the emotions fade.
The time to stop would have been Tuesday, after losing that first 100 k. But if it's all money you made in the market in a short period, you can probably reason that it's no worse than if you had never done those lucky moves. Think of all the opportunities that present themselves every day and we fail to take advantage
700k swing in one day is sick.
Not trying to beat you up further, but what made you not withdraw *any* of it? The 1 million dollar mark seems like a pretty common/obvious goal/stopping point.
Bro was too stupid to cut losses at 400k ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Black Wednesday
What was your ‚Äúenough‚Äù number you would have stopped at?
classic wsb, up 1200x but worried about 10% withdrawal fee
Can you give us an idea of what you bought to get to 1.5 mil
Most sensible wsb comment. Thanks man. I know it's easy for commenters to dehumanize, so this is a breath of fresh air. Literally just got back from a 5k run to help clear my head.
This is true.. SPACs in their hayday took me to 115k in net worth from like 20k (most money I ever seen) only to lose it all.. I spent a long time after that living in the ‚ÄúI was at this much money‚Äù you can‚Äôt let it prevent u from moving forward
Even worse reading through his last post. Dude threw all his extra money at options for years trying to make a run like this. Easiest stopping point would have been once he hit all time breakeven. 

Can't believe he didn't stop once it got to over a million though. Such an iconic number that most won't ever see.
a great lesson in life for everyone. hope it's not too expensive it's irrecoverable.

and for all those people giving OP shit - you need to experience this in life and understand we are all vulnerable to such foibles. live a little.. no one lives like an angel their whole lives.
New around here?
It's just money
If losing a mil in the market ever becomes an Olympic event, I'm betting on OP to win gold - then lose it for testing positive for speed.
I agree. I mean he yolo‚Äôd 500k in and got 1.5M out, that‚Äôs the perfect set up to put the 1M on the side and keep playing with your 500k. 

If you are hardcore enough to yolo 500k you are already somewhat nuts. But if you tripple your money and don‚Äôt lay life changing money on the side and keep playing with the initial already gigantic sum you are just lost.
It's always about the money in the beginning and at the end, when you need it and it's gone. In between, it's about all sorts of other things
He was thinking ahead about the taxes.

The taxes!!
He wanted 2M. 2 million!!!!!!
1 million isn't cool. You know what's cool? ~~2 million~~ 25k
He had 1.5M, that‚Äôs crazy
Should be its own post
That's a gem. :)
PROFOUND take and words, you do not value money you didn‚Äôt earn. Fully agree. Easy for people on the outsider looking in to judge.
same on a crypto casino site. turned 100 into 12k overnight only to lose it all in the morning. That night I even told myself that if I turned it into 10k, I would cash out.... I still think about it. this guy is definitely punching walls in his sleep.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt value money you didn‚Äôt earn‚Äù this is why I‚Äôve lost so much money on options that I could‚Äôve cashed out for profit üòµ‚Äçüí´
I got 20k off a car accident settlement and wiped that out in a month.

It‚Äôs really a catch 22. He wouldn‚Äôt make the mil in the first place if he wasn‚Äôt a highly regarded gambling addict. And he wouldn‚Äôt lose said million if he wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ well you know what I‚Äôm going to say.
I'll gladly donate mine to help him with the pain.
I needed this. Thanks
Nah fuck this kumbaya shit, man got overcome with greed. Only himself to blame and us to laugh.
Isn't greed basically trying to make your life better?
Holy fuck shit. This guy is full regarded
Just let it sit in Webull cash mgmt, don't touch it.  75k a year ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Or invest the 1M and gamble the 500K.
Yeah like Intel¬†
easy to say when you don‚Äôt have a portfolio worth 1.5m up from 25k thru gambling
Had a 1m gain (1.5m total position) overnight on CVNA and told myself I'd let the money sit before being stupid. I waited one whole day before being a regard.
Yall all make me feel better about erasing a 15k gain by holding too long
![img](emote|t5_2th52|52627)
Drinking is a depressant therefore probably not the best advice homie
Lmao now I need to listen to this song
hey can u give me some tips

what dte option do you buy, how long do you hold option, and at what time do you buy/exit (do you buy at start of market open or end of market close, etc), when to cut loss and how to decide to hold more for more gains, etc any general tips regarding trading? thanks
I'm in your camp.  Kelly Criterion will allow us to hit our goals over the long run.  It's fun to see the gains/losses but that's the same as hearing about lottery winners.  it's just luck and survival bias that allows us to see the massive gains but 99% of those who lost their life savings are in gambling anonymous now.
Sounds like you have a brain in your skull unlike most of these "if I were up I would've withdrawn X" people. They would have never got to this point so they'd never have perspective of having got to that point. And you're right, someone just let me hold 1.5m cash, but it was never mine.
A lot cheaper than the tuition he paid at the school of hard knocks
Even a conservative 50% would've been nice. 750k would be a nice house here.
Obviously not if he kept up his old ways! üòÇgeez I understand taking half and putting it back in but all 1.4mil seems like this is just an issue of our last few generations greed is overtaking all emotions
Felt no different other than a slight boost of confidence. Other than that, life felt the same.
2m, but eventually would've have thought that after enough wins. Though enough would never come
Why buy an island when you can buy an archipelago
Hah, my dad let some company stock options ride because he wanted $35 a share.  Stock got to $33 and crashed (2008).

Whole family was telling him to sell at $27, and it was $1.2 million pre-tax. 

So to try and make roughly $350k versus what we were telling him (and holding out for an extra $90k versus where the stock was), he lost almost all of it.  Ended up with $50k because the options were mostly underwater after the crash and had expiration dates.

$1.2 million to $50k to try and make an extra $360,000.  That is‚Ä¶suboptimal risk planning, lol

And it‚Äôs even worse because we were coincidentally saying to sell before the crash and he would have had all of that in cash after selling because he takes forever to find new places to put his investments.  So he would have ended up with some solid timing
Yup, can't edit the og post so we're stuck with it saying 30k. Wrote it shortly after market close and my brain was still spinning.
Sorry bro, i turned 9k into 250k and back to 9k too. Many many of us in similar situations here, heard of a guy living his best life in a condo in Miami and had to move back with his parents too.
Felt that
You do know that playing with individual stocks and options is literally just gambling? It baffles me how you can have so much money and not do the tiniest amount of research. If you want to make money, invest in an all world index fund. Sorry, this will take long, but it is the only sure way of outplaying and loving in this game. VT will be your friend. You now got 135k, pretty good all things considered. I would put a part into an index fund, and the other part into inflation protected bonds. Then, I would put any money I earn into the equity part. This will take long, is hard, and might not work. But what do you want to do? Gamble and potential lose everything? I wouldn't do that...
You're right, but that's also the same mentality that let me blow it all in the first place
Oh yeah cause turning 1k into 1.5 mill in less than a month is repeatable. Hahah dude got lucky as shit truly once in a lifetime luck. Imagine not selling at 1.5 mill off 1k. lol greedy is an understatement¬†
Because it's not about skill? He hit the same number on roulette three times in a row.

Another piece of evidence I wasn't (still not) in the right headspace, I can't even do basic math
What trade did you make to go from 8k to 700k damn
I no longer feel bad about my $120 loss
At least it would still be in equity
Tbh intel is still unrealized.  This is realized
I had zero number in my mind for cashing out. Initially it was 1m, then I got it and thought, well 2m would be pretty nice. Constantly moved the goal post til it bent me over
Was in a Rollover ira so early withdrawing has 10% penalty. Def should've taken that penalty and just bought a house
No, he turned 1300 to 1.5M, got greedy and turn 1.5M into 25k. All in 1 month. Still up tho
If you cashed it out then you'd pay immediately. Or if not, I'd throw it in a savings until tax day
you dont pay taxes on profits in an IRA, you pay taxes on withdrawals. you can sell and keep the money in the IRA and pay 0 taxes.
Yep, this realization didn't hit me til yesterday lol. Too caught up in the sauce
At 56k rn
If you withdrew, you‚Äôre too smart to be here.

Well you still have a chance to make it all back just buy deep in ITM plays and stop with the gambling bro, there‚Äôs a 1800 number if you want me to share it with you, or else you‚Äôll be taking my order at the Wendy‚Äôs window ü™ü ![img](emote|t5_2th52|52627)
Looks like you still have 19,000 lottery tickets to me
I'm w you though... Never being enough is what sent me to prison... I'm never satisfied
Bro...... it's okay you still have 23k. You can turn that back to 1.5 m. You got this you. Everybody on wsb is a full blown degenerate just like me. I lost 26k. Still haven't made it back. But that's the goal.
I would've bought my dream car
>paid dearly.

That was your retirement money. Way to undersell it.

What stocks did you use to climb to $1 million?
I didn't have this much but I was just about 500k 3 years ago... got it too fast... didn't know what to do... held everything instead of getting advice and I watched it bleed for 3 long years... it was definitely a hard lesson but I feel in a better place now if the stars ever align again... cheers. Gettem next time.
I‚Äôve been there and i did the same thing. Keep your head up
Can relate
Means you could make it double back. I went through the same thing and came back.
You‚Äôre insanely regarded, but I respect the hustle before the fall
Damn that's life/wife changing money
I was in a similar situation as you once.


Got up to 1.7m.


I had huge plans. I wanted 5m for those plans. So I really understand where you are coming from. I wasn't even happy at 1.7m because I wanted more.


In the end it started going wrong and it dropped to 1m.¬†


The difference is I then took at 500k and paid of my mortgage. The rest I put in safe stocks.
OP don‚Äôt beat yourself up‚Ä¶. but rather (focus on), the psychological understanding you gained from this far exceeds the alternative of what you wanted (and who knows what lengths you (or any of us - if put in the position - ) would‚Äôve gone to if this wasn‚Äôt the case‚Ä¶ 

Breathe‚Ä¶

Why does the very reality change when you‚Äôre in that position yourself? There‚Äôs a deeper reason that is worthwhile for all of us to explore‚Ä¶ 

It‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶ I would recommend taking some shrooms to process, understand, love, and let go. Or don‚Äôt. 

WHY DO WE THINK ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVE WHENEVER IT DOESNT SERVE US? 

It‚Äôs not fair (to life) when we do that‚Ä¶

Here‚Äôs perspective‚Ä¶ is 20 years, you‚Äôd give every dollar you have to go back to the age you were 20 years ago. 

Use this as the catalyst ‚Ä¶ to be more present maybe? I also recommend reading the Power of Now. Or don‚Äôt.
Same bro, same. Happened to me too and now I have much less than I had before, it hurts
Nah bro hes just regarded
Had to had big balls to keep holding respect ü´°
This is what I do (with much smaller amounts).  Lock in the win
Ok - then imagine you get to 750k and don‚Äôt cash anything, and go back down to 5. 

Same logic, different limits All this gambling is about the timing. You have to get lucky so many times in a row‚Ä¶
This is prolly the way OP should think about this whole situation to keep his sanity. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
> I‚Äôd be suicidal if I was in his shoes with this potential gain but he still did 1,300 to 25k.

It is not really the same as having that money (ie positions sold/locked) and then losing it all... Shit, I am pretty sure if I add up all of the 'winners' I sold way too early in the past 5 years I'm probably at like $500k deficit at least, maybe close to a million.
My exact thought. Yes it sucks, but gains are gains
You think he is gonna take the 25k and walk away? Nope he is already got the millionaire high, my money is on him losing it all
Can you imagine the high off the gains.  And the despair back down to reality
He says in his other post he's down 150k over the last 4 years
For every "I could have taken advantage but I thought it was too late" there's a "I lost everything because I doubled down thinking it wasn't too late"
Lmao¬†
No that‚Äôs what led to this mess in the first place

I have been thinking about that man for days, I check the intel stock price just to vicariously feel his horror each day. 3.5% gone today as well poor man
Oh, what if the nana knew that her grandson would do some type of dipshit move and set him up as a joke from beyond the grave.
Lol I just picked it up about 20 min before I posted it .. granny belongs to WSB now
How do I do that?
Restore?
Because, you see, he "figured out the system". He did make a mil in a day after all, he must be smart.
Whewwww....got queasy just reading this
How do you not close _the next day!?_ Had a whole day to sell.  Or the day after?  That's still 100% gain.
Yep. Pathetic. Makes me cringe
You meant the $750k worth of stocks you bought would have been 3 million?  Sorry, it's a little unclear.
Sorry to hear that bro. What a a fukcin expensive lesson. Glad you're still alive
think of all the taxes you avoided though ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
To be clear: this is not the way you should think about it.

This isn‚Äôt just some opportunity not taken.  This was actual money in an actual account that could be turned into cash with the press of a button.

The way to think about it is simple: 1) Realize that if you are able to sell, that IS your money.  It‚Äôs liquid, and it‚Äôs yours.  2) Realize that every decision to hold is THE SAME as a decision to buy.  Same exact thing (minus taxes in a taxable, but this wasn‚Äôt taxable).

Would OP have taken their own cash in hand and replicated this position?  Almost certainly not.  And when the answer is no, the only rational course of action is to sell, not hold.

If you wouldn‚Äôt buy (after factoring taxes in as needed) you shouldn‚Äôt hold.  Period period.
If he thought that way, he would have never turned his $1400 into even $5k.

The reason he got to $1mm is the same DNA that got him back down to $25k
You nailed it, if i lost 100k I‚Äôm gone no matter how much I‚Äôm up or about to gain. That‚Äôs an insane amount of money. Out on Tuesday should have been the game plan but sadly there was no such plan and hindsight is 20/20
He did a granny in 1 day
Check my edit to the comment. Too much friction in withdrawing
Yeah Reddit wants to get the gallows ready for everyone and looks around pointing fingers when it hits too hard.

I‚Äôve never been up that much but I‚Äôve gone through the ringer in 2021 with stocks (up 150k to see most my profits disappear into 2022) and also gambling to know that I am my own worst enemy and the past can really be a cold hard bitch.

Best thing you can do is not let the past define your future.

Guess what? 50 trades with 9% return nets over your $1.5M mark if you have 24k to start. That isn‚Äôt saying to yolo everything into 0DTEs but if you look at weeklies or even a month+ out that 9% doesn‚Äôt sound crazy. The impatience and loss of dopamine is what will eat at you. Fight it. 

Games are won with a bunch of singles too and not just grand slams. This is where patience, stability and discernment really determine if that account goes higher or goes quickly down.

Take a deep breath. Life over money, always. Alive and broke is better than rich and dead. Obviously rich and thriving sounds pretty good too lol, but what you do the next few months will matter.

Congrats on the run, apologies for the fall. Don‚Äôt let it define you or that chip on your shoulder will feel like a cinder block in time.
Done something similar. Haven't lost $1m, but I've lost $100k, at the time 75% of my port, in a short time, over just a few trades, doing stupid shit and not managing risk properly, and being greedy.

One can joke about it, that it's not real, just numbers, you made it in the market anyway etc. but at the end of the day it hurts. Really badly. And it should.

Getting over it is the hard part, and chewbaccashotlast's comment is spot on.   
Take some time off, and get over it, whatever way works for you, before you try again, or you'll just lose more.   
  
The money is gone. but It's a really good lesson for the future, on managing risk and loss a lot better.  
  
Revenge trading, always thinking about getting back the losses etc. usually doesn't work, so it's better to just stop while you're still ahead, until you get over that shit, and ready to jump in again, and then start really really small to begin with, until you get some confidence back.   
  
From my experience, losing a lot of money isn't the worst part, even though it hurts. Losing confidence and having your balls shrink to peanuts is the worst part, going from betting $100k on a gut feeling to barely having the balls to put $1k on a good stock.   
  
That will pass though, with a little time, and everyone is different, some people take loss harder than others, but that doesn't really matter, what matters is the ability to get past it.  
  
Always remember the losses, so you're less likely to do it again, but at the same time you have to get over it, and not dwell on it, to be even more successful going forward.

I think all good traders at some point has lost a substantial amount of money, and that the horrible feeling and fear of losing a lot of money again, is good, as long as it isn't crippling, and it's mixed with about the same amount of greed.
All good advice here. Here is mine - read "Reminiscences of stock operator" , that's Jesse Livermore book written before 1929 . He made insane money in trading and went bankrupt and recovered. That's where the book ends. He made even more in 1929 shorting the stocks, went bankrupt second time and haven't recovered and eventually killed himself. That's second book about Jesse Livermore , "Plunger Boy". Read it too , although I found the first one is more interesting, it's more about psyche of stock trader from the words of the trader himself. Second is just a historic biography, it's also interesting, if you like history books.
You still have 23k. You are a winner

Put 10k on QQQ, 10k on SPY and watch em race20 years.

Take the 3k and have fun.

I was a millionaire once.....
He even bought 700k worth of stock to keep himself from using it and he still used it lol
When the adrenaline is flowing, and you think you are god, you will do crazy things.
Or like when it was screenshot ready to be posted online
but had ne never been reckless he would have never gotten to $2 million. he would have cashed out at $50k or something. your post suggests he could have timed the top.
I absolutely do not have to experience this to never touch options lol
And money‚Äôs just paper
This is addiction. Most people gamble so they can win 1,5M dollars, he gambled the 1,5M dollars.
Yeah, there's no rush like seeing your account increase by 6 figures in a single day.
I think he said it‚Äôs in an IRA üíÄüíÄüíÄ.
well good news then, he escaped the taxes.
The finger thing means the taxes!
and then 200 !$
Or 2.5 Million pennies.
If you were to have sold, paid his taxes, he'd have like what, 1.25 million? Stick that in a high-yield cash account for a few years and be pulling in around 80k a year in pure interest afterwarde, enough to live on without having to work if you're frugal enough, or a nice way to retire at age 40 after working a 9 to 5 for 10 years.
I think he learned that part.
Greed is usually considered excessive desire for resources, so basically the answer is no. 

  
How much $ you desire is subjective and may even be ill guided to what you actually want. 

  
Either way, OP was trying to get more $ which he thought would make his life better, whether he is right or not is irrelevant.
this assumes interest rates remain high.
Holy
Did you make the initial half million in the market or was it your savings? As for the loss, it's easy to feel like it's not even real with such a big amount, and fail to take rational action. Something I read here is that if you have a large win, best thing is to move it to your bank account and let it sit there for a while, until you internalize that it's really your money
> CVNA

Well... let it be a very hard lesson that you *need* to take money off the table on such volatile tickers.

You‚Äôre clearly a gambling addict OP and deep down I guess you already know that. 
As long as it doesn‚Äôt hurt your life it‚Äôs not that bad, it‚Äôs just money after all. 
I genuinely wouldn‚Äôt give a fuck if I was in your shoes, max I‚Äôve lost at some point is $150K (down from $165K to $15K lol) and I just couldn‚Äôt give a fuck
I doubt you will see this but believe it or not there is a way to trade without just yoloing it. It will be hard, not because it‚Äôs hard to learn, but because you saw those insane gains and so now your mind is warped to how much is good gains for the day. Settling for a few hundred a day is hard after those kinds of wins.

I will say this though, don‚Äôt give up. I could flip that 32k into 100k in 2 months and that‚Äôs probably an understatement. 

As you have seen there is mad money to be made. You can make it back reliably if you‚Äôre smart. 1000% gains in a month is great. Yeah you fucked up but you‚Äôre still up. Snap yourself out of it and never revenge trade again and never trade without a stop loss ever again. You will be fine
Greed is so powerful, it consumes humans. You don‚Äôt realize it until it happens to you. Truly remarkable
Imagine not selling at 100k. What about 250k. 500k? This mentality is a sickness that caused me to lose 1.5m.
Yes it's incredibly difficult to do this even once, almost impossible to do it twice

Here's some advice for future you. You can convert the rollover IRA to a Roth IRA, pay taxes on that, wait 5 years, then withdraw without any penalty.
Or could have rolled a big portion into a diff broker IRA ot would not trigger a tax event and gave the login to a trusted person and have no access to it

"Said every baby mama..."
It wasn‚Äôt always that way. But just like it‚Äôs extremely rare to find a person who has made tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in the casinos or other types of gambling they do exist, but they‚Äôre extremely rare and you find that with investing. I mean, there are ways to make money very slowly through investing that are more safe, but that can take a lifetime.
Stock picking is gambleing sure, but Buffet doesn't just randomly pick stocks hoping they increase.  He has factual reasons he does.

This. 

People who get here overnight aren't just lucky normally. They were greedy until it backfired.
If he thought that way, he would have never turned his $1400 into even $5k.

The reason he got to $1mm is the same DNA that got him back down to $25k
Should've could've would've. If I had one do over in life, I'd use it on Monday and transfer everything to vanguard (because it has the worst ui), give my dad the password, then just buy all VOO and wait 30 years
What do you think would have happened once the 250k was gone. That's just adding extra steps, but not enough of a deterrent

No, OP learned the life lesson that was meant to be learn. Also, please get help for your addiction. And not from social media.
That‚Äôs a very kind thing to say but everyone knows they‚Äôll never get a chance at $1.5M again

So yea...he timed that trade perfectly...when you do something like that, you must feel invincible and that nothing you do can and will go wrong
I can relate. I had my portfolio up to 1.16m in mid-Feb 2021 (mostly with high growth stocks shooting up in 2020) but slowly bled out for almost 3 years with inflation/interest rates killing the former high flyers and lost half of it. I thought I had learned my lesson in 2008 when I lost 86% with options and margin calls but this time I learned that even sticking with ‚Äúsolid‚Äù stocks and no margin can hurt when the market rolls over.
this is what i'd do if i'd win, i mostly lose

After losing 1.5mil I‚Äôd rather not keep my sanity
Gonna be hard to forget the million
Those hurt so much less than buying and watching the stock collapse, like showing up to a party and everyone immediately leaves.
For sure, and one gets to see both sides of the coin if they stick around for a little bit. Also, there always moves that can turn 1000 into a million in a day, looking after the fact. What's frustrating though is when you wake up every day for. Two weeks and see the ticker you've been watching for months go up another 20 % and not jump in. Feels like self sabotage and it probably is
I would say there are two of those for every could have taken advantage of. Maybe ten. Talking about retail investment.
If I had only picked the right powerball numbers when I had the chance!

Just imagine if you were taxed on the unrealized profit then told the loss you can only deduct 3000 a year and carry over the rest, that is the tax law change they want to make ü§£
If you make 1 million in a day obviously you'll make 10 mil the next
That's the thing with random events...you can never ""figure out the system"...never attribute to yourself what can be attributed to luck. But human nature is what it is.
The absolute gall to not think, ‚ÄúOkay, I think I‚Äôve got it figured out ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ but JUST IN CASE I‚ÄôM WRONG, let me withdraw $1.25M and use the remaining $250,000 to prove to myself I can do it again‚Äù

Same here. I felt a sympathy gut punch.
Yeah. Have I held the $750k portfolio instead of liquidating the positions, that same portfolio would be $3m+.
I thought of asking [perplexity.ai](http://perplexity.ai) for a change (usually a claude or chatgpt user). what is gambler's fallacy?

The gambler's fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is the erroneous belief that the likelihood of a random event is influenced by previous occurrences of that event. This cognitive bias leads individuals to think that if an event has occurred less frequently than expected, it is more likely to happen in the future, or vice versa. 

This fallacy is commonly associated with gambling, where people might believe that after a series of losses, a win is due, or after a series of one outcome, the opposite is more likely to occur. The classic example of this fallacy occurred at the Monte Carlo Casino in 1913, when the roulette wheel landed on black 26 times in a row, leading gamblers to bet heavily on red, erroneously believing it was due to occur.
He would've sold way before $1.5 M in that case though, right? You're right but it's also not how the human mind operates no matter how logically sound your reasoning is.

How long does it take for you to do a granny?
Been reading it this sub for a bit and really liked your comments and wondering how one person can start this. I'm curious but I've got no idea on how/where to start or how much I can invest or the minimum that it's worth investing.
> Guess what? 50 trades with 9% return nets over your $1.5M mark if you have 24k to start.

Lol so why don't you elaborate on how long a trade like that would take to net you 9% return? You'd have to go all in 50 times. It's more or less SP500 average yearly return so  your *Guess what?* is half a century long

seriously. I‚Äôd delete the app, live off the interest, and never touch any investment platform again. 

probably Move out to the woods built a small and modest home and be forgotten by mankind.

This couldnt be me though. I dont have the balls to gamble 20k let alone 500k.
Yup this lines up with my gut feeling on big wins. Not in the headspace to resume trading right after, have to let it sit
This was a rollover IRA from employer 401k plan. Account got started at 32k, then dropped to $684, then the rest is history.
I did. I sold immediately at open. It was other plays, namely aapl puts that bled me before I spiraled
It is until you wake up the next day
Have you recovered since? I‚Äôm still down like 300k
It was blind luck.

*Exactly.* (So stick to the crazy rules you made up at the start, even when it‚Äôs hard.)
Bingo. People who make these gains aren‚Äôt suddenly going to switch to the mentality of ‚Äúoh well maybe I should become a safe boglehead index fund investor and quit trading stocks‚Äù the moment their extremely high risk strategy gives them a HUGE win and reinforces in their head that trading stocks will make them millions. 

It‚Äôs the gambling mentality that wins them money and gambling mentality that loses it. Exact same reason people at the casino don‚Äôt cash out when they‚Äôre up.
People fail to understand this aspect of making huge gains
This is the only correct answer.
Precisely but sad but exactly
I admire your ability to not be hanging in a closet right now. Because I think I possibly would be. Cheers.

You would have lost it no matter what then, friend.  Family cannot be trusted with sudden huge amounts of easy cash, and that's a lesson that people usually learn the hard way.

Yeah, unfortunate. At least you had fun?  35k to 140k is not too bad either.
Depends if she picks the scab beforehand.¬†
I think that guy is less regarded.
curious what trades you had before CVNA? 

1,300 to 500k is even more impressive than the 500k to 1.5M imo.
Sorry for your loss. Can you talk more about what your strategy/mindset was on the way down?
Ah, gotcha.

Fuck not even a week
Fuuuucck I wasn't looking and thought this was in like a few hours. I could have understood that, like thinking you've got the hot hand until you don't.

Bro had 1.5 for almost a week, ostensibly at some point put the fucking app down and did something else, came back and saw 1.5 MILLION, and kept going.
A short story:
Bro had a few days to think about it and STILL fumbled.
This can't be real dude. There's no way a man loses a million within a week. This all has to be fake for karma farm, I just refuse to believe it.
‚ÄúFirst‚Äù $1M day. Lol.

He was so sure there are more 1M days incoming.
Bro no ducking way. Wtf were you running? All puts? Please explain your positions so I can do the exact opposite. You had 1.5 for not even a week? No way. This has to be a fake post
True. But the sword in this story is a meatpopsicle and behind Wendy‚Äôs

Fucking this. Rules. 

Break them was (is) fun, remember you set them for reasons.
It‚Äôs really hard. All I know is when you start calculating what your share/token has to do to get to a million, it‚Äôs usually time to sell.

Yeah it was a roller coaster of emotions and felt like I was at the casino.

Defn cant complain about $35k to $140k. Ended up transferring the $140k out.
Did not think, that was my problem. I traded (gambled) on pure emotions
I remember winning and losing $10k at the casino during a weeklong vacation and that still haunts me to this day

"First" $1M day. He was sure there were many more to come.
Gambling addiction is very real, so this is probably very real and depressing.
He probably had a position that blew up to 1M$ and then the stock immediately crashed in which he never decided to realize any sort of significant gain in hopes that it‚Äôd recover back to $1M.
Rule 1: If i'm ever over a million sell everything and never make eye contact with Wendy's again.
Yes. That is solid as well. And use percentages and allocation for mine - so, it can be painful to cut a winner running, but with contracts, at least, absolutely what is best. Also to react defensively when bad news comes for the company/project, immediately. My rule of thumb for projects is an order of magnitude less for selling, or again a percentage while keeping taxes in mind, but, so important. 

I think yours an amazing rule of thumb for taking profits. When you get to fantasizing, take some, because anything could go away at any darn second. (That said, I will still hold tight to my original in an investment, so long as thesis hasn‚Äôt changed.)
Big money or suicide by cop, my kind of way to go

I'm not sure you can just put ÂÖ® in front of ÈÅ∫Áî£ to make it "all the inheritance".

I think „Ç§„É≥„ÉÜ„É´Ê†™„ÅÆ(ÂÖ®„Å¶„ÅÆ)ÈÅ∫Áî£„ÇíÂ§±„ÅÜ also implies "lose all the inherited Intel stock", rather than the likely intended meaning "lose all your inheritence on Intel stock"

Looking through more search results, maybe you can say ÂÖ®ÈÅ∫Áî£, it just doesn't come up as much.

Stock market is the worst way to make your life interesting!
Nice.
But, wait, how you did you find the opportunity with CVNA? That‚Äôs what matters, your ability to find those. If you did it with $1.3K, now you can start with 2X and withdraw $22.4K
No, next level is giving away 10k BTC for a Dominos pizza.

For sale: Gucci loafers, never worn.
Worse it sounds like it's in their IRA, possibly Roth.
Crazy. I would've just taken that easy mill and ran. Shit, I'd have probably bounced in the 6 figures..
Thanks for the last point of holding tight to the original. I feel I tend to sell out my positions even though the original thesis hasn't changed, mainly due to wild market swings in the other direction. Has cost me $$ compared to if I held out longer
Live, laugh, toaster bath is how I‚Äôm going out
This guy Nihongos!
Nope. No one expected BTC to be worth what it is now. Wining 10k hard cash and losing it is the next level
My only question in that trade is: what the pizzaguy did with 10k BTC?:)
Honestly I think in those situations it's just different. I myself use to send and buy whole Bitcoins for a  sheet of Lucy off the web, I don't even think twice about oh what I could of had because it wasn't worth Shitall the time. This guy actually had 1.5million unrealised and jus got greedy, very different.
I dropped a piece of pizza on the floor last night and it landed topping side down‚Ä¶it felt like my life was ruined and if there is a God he‚Äôs not a friendly one.
Heh. Live, love, self-subway shove.
I am just thinking about what I would've done in that Situation if I kept them. Be quiet about it and still be a pizza guy who wouldn't be fucked by his boss? Maybe... Maybe he could own his Pizza delivery chain now
Just so I‚Äôm not the only one, you guys are in it for the money right?
Someone at firm is leaving after busy season for a boat load more money and overheard my boss say the person leaving was only in it for the money. Unfortunately, I was in office that day and hope my facial reaction didn‚Äôt give away my thoughts. I will literally leave at the drop of a hat for more money as long as I‚Äôm not going into a hell hole.

Edit: I realized from all the comments it‚Äôs because of the family and pizza parties is what keeps us at a company. Thank you guys <3 /s
Literally every job I‚Äôve ever had was for the money
[deleted]
I like what I do but I'd retire in a minute if I didn't need a paycheck.
Nah dude. We're a family.

120%. Loyalty is bought in this world, make what your worth. Never feel bad about it either, it's all about the money to them as well and they will cut your ass the moment it's profitable for them.
I'm only here for the pizza parties.
Your boss is also in it for the money
If I could work on a beach selling hotdogs for the same pay I would in a heart beat, but I can‚Äôt so I chose accounting for the money.
That‚Äôs the ENTIRE point of working
To quote Jerry‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSHOW ME THE MONEY! SHOW ME THE MONEY!‚Äù 

Seriously though put the money in the direct deposit account 2x a month and no balance sheets get hurt.
[deleted]
I'm in it for the relationships with the clients. /s
I once said if I won the lottery I wouldn‚Äôt  be back to work the next day and some people thought I was joking.
Everyone is in it for the money. The entire point of a business is to make money.
I‚Äôm in it for the family. That‚Äôs what we call eachother at the office. 

Money isn‚Äôt important. It‚Äôs the learning, teamwork, and Christian values that are important. 

Even though my salary is only $30,000, it‚Äôs enough to get by, but what‚Äôs important is that as a team, our salary together is high, with each of us earning $30k and the partner at $960,000.

How do I do it? I make sacrifices, I eat noodles, and occasionally pizza lunches that god provides, but what keeps me coming back is the team, the mandatory prayer each morning, and not disappointing our clients who depend on me.

/s
Paychecks stop coming, I stop working. Bonuses suck, I let my bosses know I'm undervalued. Make 0 mistake, I'm in it for the money.
I have yet to have a job that wasn‚Äôt 100% about the money/compensation. If I didn‚Äôt need money, I‚Äôd be on the golf course smoking weed everyday. My wife is a middle school coach - she gets fulfillment from her job in addition to the shitty paycheck. I envy that, but not enough to take a pay cut.
100% yes. Left my old job for a 40% pay increase and was told it shouldn‚Äôt be about the money but it was about ‚Äúmaking a difference‚Äù. 

I laughed out loud. They never had pizza parties either. Cheapskates
HA! We are literally ACCOUNTANTS like of course it's about the money. The fact that any firm thinks they can bully people into believing otherwise in THIS line of work is crazy.
Not just money, it's also a global passport that gives me flexibility to find a job in literally anywhere in the world, I've made friends with coworkers that are actually good people which I intend to keep long after I move on to another role... Lastly, the experience it teaches you sets me up long term ..
Yes, the money. The flexibility helps too when you got a young family and need to work from home
Yeah lol

Especially in Public Accounting

I asked a partner that said the very same thing one time what else people are in it for / what they personally are in it for and I got more or less this as an answer:

‚ÄúThe learning and future growth opportunities and prestige‚Ä¶‚Äù It was a little longer but what it boiled down to was so:

‚ÄúMake less money today for maybe the hope of making more money tomorrow?‚Äù That‚Äôs what ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù means isn‚Äôt it?

So in it for the money but we all just operate under different strategies of work vs money 

Like if the work load is less or is genuinely interesting and offers high growth potential then maybe making a little less money is okay‚Ä¶
Absolutely. I‚Äôm full of dread before bed every night and every morning when I‚Äôm getting ready. My mood improves greatly every day around 4pm then it all starts over. But then every other Friday‚Ä¶ my job doesn‚Äôt bother me too much
It's just a stupid thing to say to try to frame retention issues as something the employees themselves are to blame for.

If the partner himself wasn't just in it for the money, why didn't they just immediately match the offer and retain the employee? Since, ya know, it isn't just about the money.
Yes, entirely so.  I once countered an offer from a much larger organization who was trying to use their name ID and future advancement as a way to try to pay me less than I felt like I was worth(and what I was currently making).  The recruiters response was ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre only in this for the money‚Äù, the silence on the other end of the line when I told him I felt anyone who isn‚Äôt in it for the money is doing the employer employee relationship wrong was priceless.
Money and stability keep me here
Your boss doesn't work for free.  So he's in it for the money too.
Money isn‚Äôt a the only reason but it‚Äôs a big reason. My reasons listed:

1. Stable career, as long as you have a degree, and keep a decent gpa you can get a job, plenty of accountants are needed good career growth, etc 

2. Good pay. It‚Äôs a solid, reliable path to making $100k+/ year.

3. I chose accounting because I was already into business/ finance before. 

4. Good skillset for everyday life, knowing about accounting puts you at an above average level of knowledge about finance which can really help you and even your friends/ family in your daily life
Everybody needs money! That's why they call it money!
If your not working at a nonprofit for a mission you believe in, or in the medical field/a niche hobby you like. I‚Äôd wager most people only work money.
Duh. Even in industry some roles are not as chill as you'd think. Quarter ends can entail busy season hours, but at least the teams may not be as toxic ourside of public.

That being said, I can afford a few nice things for my interests. My friend who were lucky enough to live at home for a while eventually went on to buy condos before 30 in a VHCOL area. Kids might still be a stretch but at least they have places they own.

In this trade off you lose some but you do win some.
I called my mortgage servicer to verify, but they only accept money - pizza parties are not an acceptable form of payment.
Who‚Äôs *not* in this for the money?
Kind of that person to wait until the end of busy season.
I mean yeah.

&#x200B;

hell If I even had an unlimited grocery gift card I'd prolly never go back in there again lmao
the only reason i ever have or ever will show up to a job is money.
I‚Äôm here for the corporate culture and building shareholder wealth tbh
I'd do it for free if they let me.  GAAP is my only passion in life.  Nothing beats the euphoric, almost meth like high of solving accounting problems.
Is there some part of accounting I missed somewhere along the line that *doesn't* involve counting money? Don't mind me! I'll just be over here counting your money, but not my own. /s
Partner: ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just in it for the money.‚Äù
Me: ‚Äúand you aren‚Äôt, you cheap-ass underpaying motherfucker?‚Äù
Nah bro i just love excel spreadsheets and stupid made up rules no one follows
I mean, I want to learn and excel at what I do, so I can feel more confident/skilled‚Ä¶ 


In order to make more money‚Ä¶
That's the primary reason you should leave. If your current employer cannot match the offer, leave. 

They will end up hiring someone to replace you at the wage you wanted.
I‚Äôm in it for money. Money now & Job Security (AKA money later)
Yes, you've discovered how jobs work for 99% of people. As soon as I have enough money I'm done with this. I'm letting all my licenses expire including my Forklift one. I'm not even going to do my own taxes.
Leaving after busy season means this person is giving them 2 to 3 months notice, not two weeks. How can you be upset about that?

Or am I missing something and busy season ends earlier than late March for some people?
50% for the money and 50% because I wasn‚Äôt smart enough to do what I really wanted to do.
Nah I obviously have a deep seated passion for spreadsheets.
No this was my dream growing up. Sweatband on as my fingers danced across the keyboard making excel cum
‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna say‚Ä¶ money.‚Äù-Vincenzo Santorini
To be fair there is short term money and long term!  so it depends on your out look, if you are jumping after a year or two of experience for $20k it could be near sighted or maybe not.  it really depends on the individual fact pattern.  I agree everyone is in it for the money.  some people are able to see more strategically and long term  where some people just jump around for more money.  There are success stories and failures following both strategies.  The boss may have believe it was a short sighted move and just phrased it wrong or he made a stupid comment.  your not wrong!!
We are all in it for the money. We do what we do so that we get money to live. All professions work like that. Partners will try to convince people otherwise because they need their staff to lay their fucking lives in the engagements in return for as little as possible. 

Don‚Äôt let anyone fool you. We are all in it for the money.
Yes. Money.  I once had to scold my team for counting on the Company for something or another and made sure they knew that C Corporation wasn't their Daddy .  Their goals should be to learn enough to make themselves more valuable to get their next "higher paying" position, whether it was for C Corp or somewhere else.  That's it.
I remember when professors would go around the class and ask us why we were majoring in Accounting. People always looked at me like I was crazy when I said I wanted good pay and benefits, rather than wanting to make partner, do taxes forever, or whatever other reasons people gave.
The hell are you talking about? I'm in it for the pizza, the kind bars, and actively avoiding my kids.
You guys are getting paid?
I'm only in accounting to fuel my hobbies yes
99.9% of employers are "in it for the money" and will slash the throat of any employee in a heartbeat if it helps them make more money.  The culture of indoctrinating employee loyalty to a company is possibly the biggest scam capitalism has ever pulled successfully.  The system was built to entice employees to chase incremental increases in money, they don't get to bitch when an employee jumps at a bigger increment just because it didn't come from the houndmaster.
No, I just like misery.
Why have I stayed an accountant for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck. 'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete. I think it's because they respect me. A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the phone. That's respect.
Is your boss working for free? üòÇ
Full on capitalist
Is your boss a fucking moron? Do they think I play around in Excel all day because it‚Äôs fun? Id rather be taking my kids out for the day, but instead I gotta redo all my year end entries because legal couldn‚Äôt get the sale date right. 

Maybe I‚Äôm just cranky because it‚Äôs Monday morning, but god people like your boss make my blood boil. Of course I‚Äôm in it for the money. I‚Äôm here to complete my checklist and collect a paycheck.
My partner told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre making a mistake taking the quick buck‚Äù I haven‚Äôt had any regrets 3 years later
We are a family - and I will leave this family if I could make slightly more money with less demands at another family. I am a horrible family member.
I'd accept a job with less money for remote, working with friends or interesting projects/clients.

Also how much money are we talking about? 20k? 40k? 50k? Lots of money make many issues go away.
It's ain't for the pizza
Nobody works for fun.
In what for the money? You mean waking up and doing shit i wouldn‚Äôt otherwise do? Everyone is in it for the money
I certainly don't do it for my health or enjoyment
Everybody is there because they are being paid. Anyone who says otherwise is either lying or has never experienced true freedom. Those are the types who can say they‚Äôd get so bored without work with a straight face.
If it‚Äôs not about the money why are we underpaid and the partners millionaires?
Why wouldn't you be in it for the money?

That type of comment is only fair if both current and future positions are incredibly high paying, like 250k plus.

In non-leadership roles always take the bag if the increase is substantial. Wouldn't be jumping ship every 6 months for 5k.
Im loyal to whoever pays me the best
It baffles me that people enjoy accounting or tax. I've been doin it for 8 years and I have never thought once I would spend one minute doing this if it wasn't for the paycheck. It is the sole reason.
Its accounting, not building homes for the homeless.   There isn't some greater purpose here, of course its all about the money.
Managers keep telling me I shouldn't be in it for the money after they sign my 0.5% raise.
I‚Äôm in it for the ladies and clout
Not at all. My loyalty is to debits and credits‚Ä¶ nothing to do with the money at all‚Ä¶ mmm moneyyyy
I'm only in it for the salary and benefits.
I'm 5 years into my career and in 5 years I doubled my starting salary in audit by jumping around. Only way you make money in this career in today's job market is by bouncing. "Loyalty" cannot exist in a market where inflation is deflating the value of our paychecks every year and firms are not adjusting comp to match let alone exceed inflation.

If PA wants to retain talent they need to realize that the vast majority are not going to stay long term in a job that overworks you for below market pay compared to comparable industries that work similar hours. It's only going to get harder for them as well considering the sharply declining rates of CPA eligible candidates and people choosing to major in accounting in general when they can make bank in investment banking or tech by majoring in finance or IS instead.
I actually like accounting, I‚Äôm only in college tho so I don‚Äôt feel your real world pain yet.
I'm here for the pizza parties.
I left for more money.  I don't think that is unusual.
Doing tax accounting because it was the highest paying job I can find that will hire me.   
Have an undergrad in Accounting and a Masters in Finance and Investment Management. Applied to hundreds of jobs over 2 months after I graduated.   
Only heard back from accounting firms, and the tax offers are a little higher than audit offers so here I am 5 years later.
Wait, you guys are getting paid?
I'm in this for the 10 ft skeleton and because I love asking people for the same document 100 different ways every year.
If your manager/boss is saying that instead of congratulating them on taking the next step in their career, there's a high chance you are all underpaid and under appreciated.
Judging someone making a move that is better for them personally or professionally is grounds for complete lack of respect.  That there is a shitty boss.
Once you've been through one busy season... You're a lifer...

Nah, fam, I'll be jumping ship as soon as I qualify and can get that 10-15k payrise you should have given me last year.
We get free lunch every day, but yeah it's the money. Right now with the shortage most firms are experiencing if you aren't making good money (do some research in your area to make sure you know the market) you should ask for more and if they say no go somewhere else. I switched firms and got a promotion and a 26.4% increase in pay and better benefits. However, you do have to like what you do at least a little, or else you're not going to make it.
At the end of the day, everyone‚Äôs just out for themselves. Do you
Absolutely.
who the fuck would go into accounting for anything but the money?
ZIRP was a mistake
I used to think I was in it for the money. Then I took a job in financial reporting at a major airline. These flight benefits are pretty damn sweet dude

I do make way more money here than when I was in big 4 public accounting though, to be clear.
I‚Äôm in it for the money. Don‚Äôt totally hate it but I will try my hardest to retire by 50
There is no money in U.K. accounting
Your boss is just being manipulative, but that's his job as a people manager---keeping the salaries and benefits low.  It's a not a good strategy because he will end up with a bunch of dumb people in his team.  

For now, forget about what he said, and look for a higher paying job.
Unfortunately, your boss is an idiot!! Every employee is in it for the money! That's why it's called a job!
Yes, I am. It's literally the only reason.

Anecdotally, I'd say ~95% of the people I work with would agree. As for the other ~5%, I've heard the terms "structure" and "prestige" thrown around by them.
I don't even work in accounting and I'm laughing at the comments from OP's boss. Really? Does that mean s/he is alright giving away his/her salary and work for free? Cuz it's not about the money, right?
The difference between a job and a career is that one is something you have to do, and the other is something you want to do, but get paid for it.

At least I get a pizza party every once in a while.

Still in school though.
Everyone is in it for the money  including  your boss
It‚Äôs all about money for that boss. Firms fire people at the drop of a hat and if they could get an AI bot to replace you they would immediately.
I always wanted to acquire points that I can exchange for food, health and shelter.

In that order.
Wait, you guys are getting paid?!
my bosses think i‚Äôm working on my EA and that i wanna go for partner at the firm, meanwhile i‚Äôm starting a business at the moment so i don‚Äôt have to work for them or anybody anymore lmao
There are reasons other than money to stay at or leave a company, but let's not kid ourselves, people work because they have to. I've never faulted anyone that reported to me that left my team for a role with a bigger paycheck.
Money? Client‚Äôs money you mean
If it wasn't for the money, why even work?
Im in it for the free pizza
Wait you guys are getting paid? I get a stipend for food n rent. Will get stipend for car n house if I stay another 35 years
What money? I'm a Supervising Senior at 73k.
My husband is a staff accountant in rural Michigan and his boss thinks paying him $18 an hour is just fine‚Ä¶. Well based on the dozen interviews he got from other firms offering significantly more it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a job of course it‚Äôs for the money, why else would you go to work?
I've always looked at a job like this....

Bullshit level    ===    pay level

As long as the right column stays proportionately higher  , I'll stay . It's OK for the left column to OCCASIONALLY jump higher . Shit happens . There are times that bad things occur . As long as that's seldom the case and the money is good , I'll stay .

If it's a small family business and I start becoming invested in the people that may be a different story . If I'm actually treated like a member of the family then that could change my opinion . But those jobs are few and far between in today's world .
Well no and yes. I left a higher paying IT senior role to join a small accounting firm. I wouldn't have gone to the big four type setting, basically what I was leaving in IT.  Quality of life is very important to me and my ability to be my own boss. In the end I believe my peak salary will be higher within 10 years, while also being involved in my children's lives more than the standard 9-5 allows.

Ps I work probably more now, then when I was an employee, but I know I am building equity in my company. Like renting vs owning.
I do it for the children.
I‚Äôm in it for the pizza of course
I mean... it's good not to be in it JUST for the money but for 99% of people, it's the money lol.
Yes.  It‚Äôs all about the money.  Am CPA and MBA and own my own firm.  Did my time in Big 4 and industry and found out you won‚Äôt make money like the Man unless you are the Man.  Work 6 hours a day and pull down 250k per year.  I could double that but I don‚Äôt want the headache of additional staff.  I also digital nomad from my home overseas 3 months out of the year. 

I‚Äôm not bragging. Any CPA on here has a skill set and certifications for which small businesses will pay handsomely.   You just need to break away from the big company mindset and hang out your shingle.
What money tho. Accounting pays like ass anymore. You could be an applebees manager and make more than most accountants lol!

Let's just say, I wouldn't want to work for anyone anymore if I won the lottery.
Everyone in this is in it for the money. I like what I do, but I‚Äôd be doing almost anything else rather than accounting if life was free lol.
I'm just here for the pussy, tell girls you're a cpa and the panties fall right off!
Yes.
If money weren't a factor I wouldn't be in accounting so... yes.
Why else would you be working if not for money or some equivalent???? Do people just like to work for free???
I‚Äôm in it to provide reasonable assurance. üë∫
When I was a senior in hs, I took an accounting class. I was good at it, I found it interesting and i saw you could make a comfortable living in it.

A bachelor‚Äôs and masters later, it doesn‚Äôt bore me to death for 8 hours a day. I do it because it allows me to live and do things for fun too.

I am in it for what it pays me.
People who claim to genuinely enjoy accounting only do it pro bono for family and friends, but still expect payment in any other scenario. They wouldn‚Äôt hold that same expectation of payment for playing with their kids on a summer day, traveling the world and exploring new cultures, or beating off and having a nap. 

So yes, not a single accountant truly likes this shit. It‚Äôs just varying degrees of tolerance towards the work. Some people naturally ‚Äúget it‚Äù, so naturally, they will feel happy from being rewarded for doing a job that they think is easy and intuitive to perform. That‚Äôs not the case with most accountants, who instead coalesce around this sub to ask questions exactly like yours.
Who isn‚Äôt here for the money?
I work to live. Not live to work
That's what my sloppy ex did it for. He called himself a "pragmatic accountant" üíÄ Anyway, do it for the $ but also be a good accountant? He quit after 15 months bc he couldn't handle being a public accountant at three different firms and he worked remotely so idk how tf you could complain when you made over 70k for just sitting on your ass. But for everyone else fuck yea cheers üçª üëè ‚úåÔ∏è üëå not saying every accountant is terrible just bc my ex was a shitty person and also someone that just complained about multitasking so idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it must be a personality issue like an incompatibility issue with the demands of the job and the personality
If it‚Äôs not about the money, take a pay cut and give raises to your team.
Yes
im in it for the money, and i'm making quite a bit of it. golden hand cuffs for sure
I‚Äôm in it for the pizza parties
Yes
It depends on the work, but it would take a huge pay raise and a lot of green flags to get me leave my current firm. I also would probably do accounting for free if I wasn't getting paid for it, so that might factor in as well
What the actual fuck else is there to be in it for
If they didn‚Äôt pay me I wouldn‚Äôt go to work. I hate this toxic, top down messaging that everyone in the company has to be passionate about their career. Yeah, accounting was my choice because it‚Äôs a pretty stable job. I repeat, a JOB. I have a lot of other things I‚Äôm passionate about. I‚Äôm good there, thanks.
Ask your boss if they‚Äôre doing pro Bono work.
I rate my relationships in life by the cost of the pizza they give me.
You gotta like what you do but you have to be earning a decent amount that would support your needs.
That's known as having a job.
I work to benefit myself. I go in, do what you hired me to do, go home and collect a paycheck every 2 weeks. Although I work for the government (not dealing with the general public at all) and it's kinda nice. They don't pretend you're anything more than a badge number and I don't have to pretend it's anything more than a job.
I‚Äôm not exactly passionate about excel.
I can‚Äôt fathom how anyone would be in accounting for any other reason. It‚Äôs not a noble career. It doesn‚Äôt help anything in the grand scheme of things.
There are tiers of priorities. Example: I take pride in my work but it‚Äôs a lower level priority than the money.
Nobody is an accountant for the money, not even partners make great money
When I left my last place I told them I was getting paid a lot more and needed the money if I wanted a chance at a house lol. It‚Äôs accounting, not a lot of people are passionate about this besides money.
I like working. Accounting lets me work a lot of hours! I will also get a globally recognised qualification, and great exit opportunities to literally any company or industry I want!
I‚Äôm in it for the pizza.
Telling a manager you do your job for the love of it is the quickest way to make them love you and think that you're a moron. 

I'm totally not going to do it anymore once I've got a bit more quality experience.
Literally the only reason
We're not just doing this for money...

...

We're doing it for a shitload of money!
I'm in it for loyalty, and I value that loyalty based on the amount of money that is being offered.
Yes once I get better somehow I can move on..
I'd say it has more to do with my parents pushing me into it because they saw it as a safe and prestigious career and at this point I'm too lazy to go back to school to do something else.
were all in it for the money we all gotta take care of ourselfes
Money is most people‚Äôs main motivation for work. Anyone who reacts like this when someone leaves is full of shit.
Totally in it for the money and working indoors.
All the groupies is why I am in it
I‚Äôm thinking of leaving right after this busy season as well. I hate PA.
Can't pay bills with happy feelings my boy
Always about the money.
I am in for the cheap pizza that gives severe diarrhea
I think the only appealing thing about accounting is that it pays well
I took my current role as a recent grad looking to build valuable experience and knowledge. I always loved accounting and finance, but the real-world application at big places can be very boring. You're doing a small part of a small part of a business. In class, you're doing a lot of fun analysis and getting to understand a business. In the real world, you're doing bs data entry, double checking, and making sure #s match. The politics in the workplace are probably the worst part. That, along with the okay pay, make it not fun imo. Overall, I still think accounting is dope, but some real-world jobs on an entry level are very hard to stay excited about.
I'm here for the fast paced environment
Strictly
You just gotta be careful to avoid the toxic places.
Business is never personal
There are two reasons why I work, money and benefits.  If I didn‚Äôt need either one I wouldn‚Äôt work at all.
I had a recruiter tell me once that at some point it's no longer about the money when taking a new job. I replied, well I'm not at that point yet. It is absolutely about the money.
I had this as an interview question: ‚ÄúIf money was not a consideration would you still want this job?‚Äù

For those who don‚Äôt know that is what is colloquially referred to as a red flag.
Well I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre not in it for the counting!
i‚Äôm in it for the PITA clients and constantly moving goal posts from firm leadership myself
Money + using my brain / feeling like I'm learning something about business
in it to learn tbh, i don‚Äôt care about money
What money
Yeah, people work because they "love their work" 

In my experience, no matter how much you enjoy doing something, when you're essentially forced to do it for multiple decades, the magic wears off.

Now, I don't mind the work at all, it makes me feel productive, but I sure as hell would rather be doing other things. I will be retired at 40, and maybe at that point I'll end up enjoying it more, knowing that I have the freedom to walk away from it the day after and never need to think about it again. Who knows.
Unless you are charity, you are in it for the money. period.
No. I have a passion for accounting and my coworkers are my family. 

100% in it for the money.
20 years in and yes every day.
I'm in it for the hoes.
Everyone works for money. Everyone is a merc and will leave if the bag is big enough.
I‚Äôm in it for the money first, but the unlimited naps, remote working w/no video calls, and very flexible schedule are just as important.  Keep my paycheck turned on, and leave me alone because it‚Äôs my spa day.
Iam not on it for the money!
I only care about money and working remotely.
of all of the things I could be doing for money - this one has the best effort/reward ratio

otherwise I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole
I work for a nonprofit, but I actually work there simply due to location. There are many different motivations and combinations of
More whining.  Part of the reason to start in public is to see whether you like (tolerate) it.
Yeah money 100%. People act like it‚Äôs crazy to do that lol even though it‚Äôs literally the only thing we are there for in exchange for our time
Yes, of course.
Any job I have ever had has been for money. No pay no work.
There isn't another job I would expect to be more "only in it for the money" than accountants. That's not a judgement, just that I expect accountants to be better judges of "what's worth it" financially than most of the rest of us.
Wait, you guys are getting paid???
Well I mean, I‚Äôd take less money for better benefits, work life balance, work from home, etc. I guess I‚Äôm not in it for the money, but I‚Äôm in it for the total package.
Ha, I took on a position in purchasing on top of my accounting duties and still make under 70k on the base. Just comes with the territory
Nope. I am in it because I enjoy it and it pays me enough to pay my bills. I am definitely not in it for the money.
What money?
I would of been more passionate of accounting if the partners and firms pays me the overtime they make me work. But hey, we all can‚Äôt have everything we want in life. The rich get richer by getting free labor (not required to pay OT) for us staff. If another employer pays better I would go to them.
If the firm wasn‚Äôt able/willing to match the offer then the firm is ‚Äúonly in it for the money‚Äù
Nope, certified public accountants serve the public.  Pay is good but helping people is the most rewarding piece.
I‚Äôm really just trying to make the world a better place, one fake reserve account at a time.
I enjoy my job. I have amazing coworkers and ive enjoyed working for four of the five bosses I‚Äôve had in my career. 

If tomorrow I didn‚Äôt need the income I‚Äôd quit without a second thought.
Don't get me wrong, I love accounting and finance. However, if I were a multimillionaire, or won the lottery, I'd absolutely retire at 26. If I'm being real, though, I'd study for my CPA full-time, then get a PhD, and ultimately become a professor.
I am only in it for the money and I am actively contributing towards Financial Independence so I can retire early and do things that bring me actual joy instead of things that pay the bills
I‚Äôm in it for the pizza parties
Yes, I am in it mostly to have a better and satisfying life.
I‚Äôm in it for the women but to each their own.
Lol. I would tell my boss that straight to his face without hesitation.
100%
100%. The only reason I‚Äôm an accountant is for the money, and even then, I‚Äôm not planning to stay. Most of the careers I‚Äôm considering for passion (UI/UX design, consulting, or nursing) all pay better than accounting and are more personally fulfilling to me. I know there‚Äôs some people who actually enjoy accounting, but most of the accountants I know are just in it for the money and jump as soon as they get a better offer than what they currently make.
I would not be in accounting if it weren't for the money. It's not at the level of other professions but I am almost 40, came to the US 6 years ago so not a lot of options. Accounting is my best choice because it's what I've got and 100% doing it for the money.
Lol, who in the right mind leaves a company to join another company to make less money? Everyone will leave if someone offered way more money.  


Only time that ever happens is if you are going DOWN levels/titles and want to take a step back. But if you are fresh out of post secondary and you are working at a PA... Chances are you are leaving for more money since you are still young.
I‚Äôm in it for the insurance and pension too cmon now
My job could definitely pay more, but I stay for the work from home and also their family leave policy - it‚Äôs paid.
I'm in it for the money and benefits.

I do like my job, but I could easily get more somewhere else.  But I stay because I make enough, company is super lenient, has great benefits, I like my team (for the most part), and it's easy.

But yeah, if I got the lotto I'd quit tomorrow,,just nor gonna jump ship to the unknown for a few more dollars an hour
Spoiler alert: your boss is in it for the money.
Hell yeah I'm in it for the money and I will never apologize for that. If I get an offer for more money somewhere else then I will be gone in the blink of an eye.
Lol, why would you do accounting if you weren't in it for the money?

I JUST LOVE SPREADSHEETS AND TAX LAWS, MAN.
Banker here. If you wouldn‚Äôt do it as a hobby, you are in it for the money. On my side at least we are all honest and regularly talk about how we only do this shit for the money.
Wait, you guys are getting paid?
I‚Äôm init for the excuse to do black tar heroin
Fuck yeah I‚Äôm in it for the money. What kind of moron thinks otherwise‚Ä¶ your boss is an idiot!

We don‚Äôt get pizza parties‚Ä¶ we get work trips to Vegas (I would rather have a pizza party tbh).
You shoulda just leveled with him, when work slows down at my office and the boss asks what I'm doing, "just brushing up the resume with all this down time" oh boy that's how you get to see mangers sweat lol
Come on... you're in it for the prestige of workng for them.  And if you're not you should be!  P
I'm gonna be honest it's for the money. The dog shit (non accounting) job I just left was DEFINITELY for the money. 

Accountancy is one of those rare gems where it's relatively easy to find a role (in this very saturated marketplace) with very little barrier to entry. 

In the UK at least you can start off with your AAT with just your GCSE's (school leavers qualification) or no qualification and work up.  It can take you two to three years while you rack up work experience. 

Use exemptions for CIMA/ACCA/ACA and in another three years you're on ¬£50,000 - ¬£60,000 and upwards. 

Very few qualifications needed. As long as you got the skill; smarts and a bit of luck you can command a good salary and decent career progression without ever so much as stepping foot in a university. 

If anything I wish I made the realisation and worked harder sooner.
What motivation, other than money, would there be for someone to be an accountant?

"I love animals!"

"I'm really great working with people!"

"You see something new every day"

"My colleagues are great."

"We have an aquarium in the office!"

Seriously, it's an essential job and somebody needs to know how to do that right, I'm not harping on accountants, but why would want to do that job if not for the money?
Yeah

If I could choose any career path and had it pay a liveable wage without having to kill myself working, I woulda been a musician, some kind of concert percussionist specifically
I enjoy what I do, have a great employer, and like the people I work with, but I am fully on track for retiring by 55 at the absolute latest.
I am not in it for the money, but for the knowledge that I will get from it and how I can use it to help myself and my brother's business when I actually learned it. My brother and his wife are good at handling money but not in regulations imposed by the government, and our parents are financially illiterate, my brother always tells me that we could have a better life if only my parents have handled their money better. That cued me to pursue this course/career.
Yep it's all for the money & the insurance benefits.
What money?
If they stopped paying, why would anyone show up?
Well it‚Äôs not for the fun of doing accounting
Good comment! 
Here‚Äôs my number 
+1 760-589-8137. Hit me up with a text on signal I got good news for you
Yupüò≠
The bosses are also just there for money. Theyre just hypocrites. I mean, im sure over the years theyve done the me tal gymnastics to convince themselves they arent, but they are. Its literally what jobs are for.
Accounting pays like shit where I live.
I am just here for the pizza
I've always dreamt about being an auditor...

Said no one ever
I work so I can make money to enjoy the things I like doing. Pizza is great and all but I‚Äôm more prone to chase the money being waved in my face.
This comment thread is validating my lack of accounting career despite having accounting degree
This thread is cracking me up
money? don‚Äôt you know i love being under-appreciated and overworked?
[deleted]
money in the longer term horizon yes -- i make v. comfortable living after 9 years in the work force ($160K+ in a medium/high cost city); but i'm not done yet haha need all the monies!!!!
I would leave a job for more money, lighter work, or a better commute/fully remote
I‚Äôll preface this by saying I‚Äôm still in college, but I‚Äôm doing it because I like it
I don't get how so many jobs are paying 100-120. That's like 80+GBP, and in England that would be seen as a very well paid job, likely senior management or medical/legal after 3-5 years PQE?

But yes, the whole "in it for the money" accusation tends to come from someone who can't or won't offer more. I think every role is a combination of what you get and what you can achieve.
I do it for the people I work with. Without whom... I would have to work with other people.
Lol
This is a trick question in Accounting right?  Anyway yeah the primary (not *only*) motivation for most jobs is the money, sooo....
Boss is just salty that he didn't get a great offer. He would've bolted too.
Yes
I hate working, if I didn't need the money I wouldn't do it. It's always about the money. Leave a job and see how many of them still are your friends after.
Money is ok. I'm glad I'll always have a job opportunity somewhere. Despite the constant nihilism in this sub, I'm glad I chose a job that's in constant demand and I specifically changed careers once I learned 85% of Finance is sales.
Absolutely right, man
So how do you all explain leaving for more money in your early career ever 1.5 years?
Lamo the money is the ONLY reason.
Everyone is in it for the money. You earn or you learn. The smartest do both.
[deleted]
You don't go to work for free????

So immoral! I can't even!
Happy cake day!
Yeah, no shit!  Why would that be a surprise to anyone?

I'm pretty damned sure that everyone I work with including my bosses are there for the money.  That's what it's all about.  Duh.
The money is better as a leader, but you have more fun as a follower. -Creed Bratton
I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs a cult in every Big4 it‚Äôs just not everyone get‚Äôs to be a member

I‚Äôm guessing they recruit partner track folks from the cult
It's definitely the number one driver, but I do like my co-workers and after working at 5 different places I really don't want to work with any other group of people at this point in my career.
Currently on a camping trip with my company. Feels like Jesus camp and not in a good way
"Fuck it, I'd kill people for free."

"You understand that's not your job here, right?"
This. I‚Äôm not passionate about my job but I enjoy the work and feel like I‚Äôm working toward a better world (I work in water treatment in an area with lots of drought). I‚Äôm passionate about the issues we work towards but I‚Äôm really only in it for the paycheck & pension.
Yep I really enjoy my job, but if I hit the lotto I'd quit in a heart beat
What would you do to keep busy in retirement
Forgot about our memorable pizza parties. Sorry about that, family
I hate my family
One big abusive family. Thats the way. I make you work long hours, so in return you pay it back to the filthy minions coming in below. The turn tables all year long.
I prefer to get paid in pizza
And we work hard and play hard
Lmao this has me in tears
Ride or Die.
Vouch or die, family.
A fucked up abusive as hell family, but a family nonetheless.
Love this!
And teach them to say what you want them to say .....
This is me. I studied accounting to better understand my own finances. It's not the career for me, but I wanted to be financially literate and able to understand better the impact of financial decisions.
Fuck yes
Yeah.  Had a CEO make a comment about sticking it through thick and thin.  Of course, layoffs then occurred.  You can bet CEO didn't say a peep about loyalty.  Especially not while he was still getting $$$.
I feel like part of what I‚Äôm being paid for is my loyalty.  But if there were somewhere that valued loyalty more highly, then I‚Äôm going to work for whoever values loyalty the most.
If you are not in it for the money, would you like to trade salaries?
Exactly
This üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØ
There's things you can sell on the beach and make similar pay, tax free!
Exactly. I don't know why they want people to feel bad for working for the money.
Omg haha
Have you tried throwing a hot dog on the floor and making them fight for it? Builds character
Who among us hasn't at some point depreciated land?
Only one way to truly test those ‚Äúinternal controls‚Äù, am I right?
Business is solving other peoples problems for a profit.
Or sometimes telling other people how
much money they don't have anymore hahaha
I remember going weeks without eating ‚Äústaff 1 salary $4000‚Äù and God gave my company pizza so I finally ate something /s
Hahahaha, I cackled at this one!!!!
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Did they hit you with the "we're a family here" at any point?
I learned all about how to *count money* for... Checks notes... Pizza and family, I guess?
Very well said
I agree. I like numbers, people, and solving problems and it seemed like a good fit. Compared to what I did before it offers a way to get ahead.
Great question, looking for that person too
If you are only on accelerated filers you‚Äôll be done in Feb
My boss was bragging about how they took their kids on an expensive vacation the past summer. I‚Äôm baffled I heard them say what they said
You‚Äôre grossly underpaid, I‚Äôm a senior at $85k and have been offered $120k for a supervising senior role. MCOL and 4 YOE just passed CPA exams though
How pathetic do you have to be to come on Reddit just to lie to complete strangers about your life? Utter loser shit. Have fun fighting people on the crack cocaine subreddit lol
The guy who‚Äôs leaving my firm took all of it
Spaceballs reference.  NICE!!
Business is always at least a little personal. It may not be much, but we're all human and feelings do matter.
The person who‚Äôs leaving my firm took it all bro. Guess you have to change your career now :(
99% of the reason, the 1% I actually like reading about renewable infrastructure projects that are client invests. I've even caught discrepancy which my client was happy about. The investment manager, not so kuchen ü§£
I usually throw out the giblets when I cook the duck. Most of us don‚Äôt use the giblets unless it‚Äôs for a special part of the meal like making richly, flavored gravy. You can use it but most of us don‚Äôt.

Further proof that public accounting is a shitty cult- none of the followers are having fun
Damn. You literally took the comment I was about to drop.

fr all these people getting paid in pizza complaining must be getting shitty pizza
We don't play around in this family. Expect a discussion with your direct soon.

Even better - get your boss to donate their entire salary to you!
You still gotta claim that income, bro, what are you, an auditor?!
God bless capitalism.
And reminding them they are idiots just like their mother who started the business said.
Sure did! At staff meetings it was said often. When someone quit the partners would comment how they ‚Äúbetrayed the firm‚Äù and how ‚Äúwe are a family‚Äù and it ‚Äúhurts‚Äù they left. 

Totally dysfunctional and the managing partners CPA license expired in 2019 but he still practices. (Pennsylvania state as per our professional license verification site)

Fair enough. People on accelerated filers in our office generally rolled right into other YEs though.  Been a few years tho
Right.  I think their point still stands.  That person is giving 6 weeks notice and staying through the toughest time of the year.
I've had my CPA for 2 years at this point 5.5 years of experience as well. VLCOL for me üôÉ

Engineering and tech are good paying careers with bachelors only but it‚Äôs way more time studying
Thinking about doing this in the chemical industry in TX. 1 year schooling and start at like 100-120 working in a plant.
You went to the railroad? Am I thinking too hard here?
Damn y'all get pizza parties?
‚ÄúWe have to do what‚Äôs right for the company‚Äù - boss who is a 70% shareholder in said company
That‚Äôs insane

People hear engineer and think software engineering, which is an unlicensed profession you can learn with a laptop, an internet connection, and determination. We ought to be called programmers, but "engineer" gives people an ego boost. 

Actual engineers have to attain a professional certification, but you can usually do that with a 4yr bachelor's in a relevant field, like mechanical or civil engineering.
What is the job title for something like this? Asking for a friend‚Ä¶
Just depends what you want out of life I guess.
If you call it that. They once had to send out an email to the whole office saying there was mold found and to discard whatever you didn‚Äôt eat yet

If everyone only ate one piece, they'd probably be fine.

So you‚Äôre familiar, then not familiar, then familiar again with engineering? 

I‚Äôve met hundreds of programmers who earn $300k+ who never got a Bachelor‚Äôs degree. 

Hell, if you learn any language like Python or JavaScript well enough you can land a job making $80k, even without a degree.
Yeah everything that dude said was correct but I think he left out the effort required. Accounting is the best career as far as having the best ratio of Money/Time+Effort+Cost. Effort being key as engineering is probably the best bang for your buck if you can stomach all those fucked mandatory courses.
lol, us accountants really like doing things the easy way. to a certain degree
That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre accountants to begin with. We all collectively decided that we‚Äôd rather yell GL codes at each other and learn closing entries just to have them automated anyways. üòÇ
I Took Out $94,000 in Personal Loans to Buy Crypto: 19 Month Update
Not financial advice. 

Greetings All,  

This is my 19 month update since I first took out an unsecured personal loan to buy Bitcoin. You can find my previous updates in my post history. The first is from June 2022. 

A lot has happened since my last update, so I‚Äôll get right to it‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

First off, I managed to completely pay off my 2nd loan of $20,000! 

Work has been better than usual and I had a big job in December that netted me a $12,000 windfall of which the entirety was put towards my loan balance.

Next I decided to buy even more Bitcoin by taking advantage of some really awesome Credit Card Balance Transfer offers that appeared in August/September‚Ä¶

Two of my credit cards were offering 0% APR for the first 18 and 21 months with a one time 3% and 5% transfer fee respectively. I also opened a new card that was offering a similar deal and was approved for a $12,000 limit. That combined with my previous two credit card brought my total to $40,000 in balance transfer potential. 

Balance transfer offers are great because they allow you to simply write a check to yourself and cash it in your bank account like any other check. Also, I‚Äôm only responsible to pay 1% each month, so servicing it is really easy. 

I ended up using $35,000 in balance transfer loans and buying 1.35 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$26,500. This brings my total amount of Bitcoin purchased with loans to 4 Bitcoin!!!!

**With the balance transfer monthly payments, plus the previous loans, my total monthly cost to service all these loans is \~$800.** 

I can easily afford this. In fact, I‚Äôm putting almost double that towards these loans each month to pay them down aggressively so I don‚Äôt end up paying a lot of interest when it‚Äôs all said and done. I plan to have everything paid off in less than two years. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**As of today, of the combined loans / balance transfers I have a total remaining balance of \~$56,000.**

It works out like this:

$21,000 remaining balance from unsecured personal loan.

$35,000 from new balance transfer loans. 

This brings the total amount of loans that I‚Äôve taken out so far to $94,000. I‚Äôve paid a total of \~$4,500 in interest to date, which brings the total cost basis of these loans to \~$98,500 as of January 24th, 2024.

**I have acquired a total of 4 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$24,625 per coin: $98,500 / 4 = $24,625.** 

**As of today, January 25th, 2024, the current price of Bitcoin is \~$40,000.**

**This brings the total value of the Bitcoin I acquired from loans to $160,000.**

**This represents an unrealized USD profit of \~$61,500.** 

The math is simple: $160,000 - $98,500 = $61,500

Lastly, I‚Äôm officially done taking out loans and balance transfers. I have a nice round number of Bitcoin from loans, plus my personal stack which I‚Äôve been slowly adding to from earned income. Now it‚Äôs time to focus on paying everything down over the next 2 years with earned income. I have no desire to sell my Bitcoin regardless of how high its price goes. 

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Not financial advice. 
OP is about to inspire some huge mistakes from lesser smart ppl.
Many people do this and end up in another world..
Balls of steel.
ChatGPT'd this for lazy folk like myself.  Here are the basics.

* Total amount of loans taken out: $94,000
* Total interest paid to date: ~$4,500
* Total cost basis of these loans as of January 24th, 2024: ~$98,500
* Total Bitcoin acquired: 4 Bitcoin (~$24,625 per coin)
* Current price of Bitcoin as of January 25th, 2024: ~$40,000 per coin
* Total value of the Bitcoin acquired from loans: $160,000

Glad it worked out.  r/WallStreetBets level degeneracy and regardedness.
I've gotta ask, if your actually being 100% honest with the "I have no intention to sell no matter what the price gets too"

Then what's the point?

I see day in day out with a small group of my super rich friends (millions in their accounts), they still break their backs to earn money and yet spend hardly anything, I compare some people's attitudes to crypto the same... Do you just want to see lots of 0's on a screen?

What's the actual end game as a bitcoin has no real meaning unless it's spent surely (and I'm not against crypto, I'd say the same about real cash, it's meaningless unless it's going to be spent...)
Pay off your loans and ride on the profits!
My friend did this exact thing and put it all in ctsi. He then found out about futures and lost 150k in a month and is unemployed and completely broke with 115k in loans
If you pay it off quickly then you should be happy long term. $24k average is solid for starting in 2022
Now this is podracing
Would get equal instant divorce papers in hand from my wife if I did this. Still, fun to see. There is NO WAY I would even consider doing this (even if my wife said ok) at the current price of BTC. Maybe if it crashed to shit down to say 10k.

OP. Fuck you. And I congratulate you heartily.
I took out a $100k personal loan in early 2018 to buy the "dip" on BTC and ETH. You can imagine how that went. I was down almost 80% at one point during the lowest point of the bear market. But I held and kept buying a few hundred dollars worth every week. I paid my personal loan off in mid 2020 and my portfolio reached 7 figures in 2021.
Good for you sir! In 2016 I borrowed 20K and watched it 10X in my celsius account and ...poof bitcoin no more. I'll be done with my $400 monthly payments next year :( 

Almost went postal but I'm good now on meds lol. I'm truly close to trying again but I'm so close to retirement. Risky business. Shit happens in this space.
I remember your first posts, glad its working out so far

Edit: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vp9nuq/comment/iejhg3q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
I know this sub loves this type of shit but as someone who works in lending‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve personally never seen this go well. Most people default and ruin their credit on top of getting blacklisted. Might even get a SAR filed on you. Ya don‚Äôt do this
You had to get on blood pressure medication I bet!
if you sold 2 bitcoin and paid the loans off then you would essentially have 2 bitcoin for free and no possibility of destroying your credit rating/life
We all know how this will end...
Congrats!  I‚Äôm impressed with your perseverance and ability to hodl even during those scary bear market lows.
Jesus Christ...that's Jason Bourne.
Someone send this to r/DaveRamsey
You haven't made anything until you've sold and paid taxes.. Currently you're just in debt.
[deleted]
Good stuff, OP! More power to ya üòé

I did the same thing about a year ago, but $50k, and with all with CC balance transfers (3% fee, 0% APR for 18-21 months). I bought BTC (at $17k), ETH, and a handful of crypto and tech stocks, and have been up as high as $125k value, closer to $100k right now. I only owe about $40k on it, so am about $60k ahead right now. I'm started selling/reallocating a few of the tech stocks (sold META at its peak, up 280%) now that I've held for over a year (so they're long term, not short term capital gains), but I plan on selling most of the crypto as we find the peak of the bull run.

I've posted about it a few times here, but every time I do I get downvoted into oblivion. Even though the "borrowed" portion  of my portfolio is a fairly small percentage and I could easily ride out a crypto market crash, people still think I'm an idiot for taking on risk like this. I'm fine with reasonable risk and manageable cheap debt as long as I have a huge safety net and the upside is worth the risk. I also know the market and have been in this since 2011. 

I'm just glad that people aren't downvoting you into oblivion like they did to me! Must be because the market is way up since you bought in üòÖ
Op likes roulette
Just an FYI to anyone thinking of doing the same, most 0% credit card offers have a condition that you have to pay it off by the time the offer ends, otherwise you will pay interest on the entire balance borrowed. lol
Are people ignoring taxes
Bitcoin has almost doubled since, why not just use the gains to pay off loans. Then use what you would pay towards loan as your DCA & eliminate the interest aspect.
Glad it‚Äôs working for you OP. definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend this strategy in general though. Pretty high risk
Balls so big they created their own gravity field and started pulling in money
FYI - interest is not added to your BTC cost basis for tax purposes, but I understand the need to highlight it for overall basis for the sake of presentation.
This is what love is like on the high seas of the financial internet. God speed to whatever your finish line is.
The beauty of all this is if it didn't work out, you could just go bankrupt
This is such a bad idea, do not take out loans to gamble. The only way OP comes out on top is that they realize they got lucky this one time, they cash out right now, and eliminate their remaining high interest debt.
This is going to end well
Sell bitcoins now and pay off loans..  you are taking a big risk.  If any one step fails, all comes crumbling down.
Jesus this was stupid.
This guy fucks
You got me there,I only took out 40k on a home equity loan after ftx dumped bought at 19ish sold at 38k after fees Inetted a little over 20k after taxes and fees.
Once again don't listen to the heard mentality put a plan in action and follow through!!!!Congrats bro!!!
Got lucky it did not go downhill for you. I know quite many opposite stories. You did not say antyhing about your decision making process, so I assume there is not much difference from those other people. You just got lucky.
I would sell 2 btc and get my investment back and then let the other 2 btc go to the moon or hell.
"I have no desire to sell my Bitcoin regardless of how high its price goes." That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. When you say that you end up selling when bitcoin does a -80%. Take profits now.
Why wouldn‚Äôt you just pay off the loans with the profit and then gamble (spot trade) with the remaining BTC?
I would highly recommend putting some kind of plan in place for exiting at least a portion of your position once you get into heavy profit.  For example, just sell 1 BTC at $100k to cash out your basis and pay off any remaining loans, then let the other 3 BTC ride playing with house money at that point.  At least you could eliminate your risk altogether in that case, and still have massive profit potential with a 5-10 year hold.
What about interest owed at current interest rates?
#*‚ÄùYou got balls stick jockey I‚Äôll give u that‚Äù*
Bro, you‚Äôre like my hero. I agree with the not selling part. In 10-20 years that will be generational wealth.
BTC is a journey of Volatility. Gain or loss on the paper for the moment is just temporary. Important thing is we must hold some BTC in our portfolio and don't look back. BTC is a legit commodity with built in scarciry.
Am I in wsb?
Glad ot worked out.

But what a hugely stupid thing to do. Amd sounds like you might be suffering from serious survivor bias.
I‚Äôm surprised you can stand up with balls that big
This guy Fucks hard.
I mean, you might as well round it up to 5‚Ä¶ right? 5 is much better than 4.
Great work, I'm happy for you but isn't it more safe to sell 2 bitcoin and repay the dept? That way you will have 2 bitcoin left and almost 0 debt. If i have learned anything in crypto is always take profits and don't wait for higher prices.
That‚Äôs the smartest dumb thing I have ever read.
dude ur scary brave
Most people couldn't do it with your intellect and discipline.
Well done OP. How did you clear 12k in Dec? Also well done
Do you know how to make a million dollars and never pay taxes? 
First - make a million dollars. Then- just don‚Äôt pay the taxes!!

Paraphrasing Steve Martin here
I know this is probably a stupid question but... literally never? Are you going to keep your coin till you die so you can give to kids or loved ones? Do you just want to be able to have the coins to show off? Do you just mean you'll never sell no matter how high it goes because you're saving it for old age and don't trust yourself to not spend it now or??
Fuck yea this is how it‚Äôs done
Always book profit, don't wait or greed for higher.
You plan to hold the $160k worth of Bitcoin, which you bought with $94k of personal loans. How much will be the monthly payments on credit cards when payments start? How about selling enough Bitcoin, while it is up, to pay the loans, do you are ‚Äúplaying with house money?‚Äù Bitcoin could drop value, leaving you paying standard credit card interest. 18% credit card interest on $94k would be $17k a year.
Talk about having balls!‚Ä¶One can argue that your are either a genius, or utterly stupid. Regardless, I admire your courage and determination.
‚ÄúI have no desire to sell my Bitcoin regardless of how high its price goes‚Äù

What‚Äôs the point buying it if you never intend selling?
Great financial advice! I will follow your advice and hold you accountable
Put it all on Black
No, it's time to sell, pay back your loans and buy the bitcoin and a half you can afford to lose before you get wrecked from the unsecured loan and promo apr.
You should sell $98,500 of it right now or your playing a very dangerous game. Your free and clear that way with $60k in bitcoin still rolling and your credit looks fantastic.
Satoshi Bets
I don‚Äôt understand balance transfer I thought that‚Äôs to transfer credit card balances to new credit card
Man - I would love to do this - my wife would kill me!
I want someone to make a movie üé• on this dude what an absolute  giga chad‚Ä¶ bros a true legend‚Ä¶.
Well done! Your parents should be proud. 
It is very straightforward mathematics.
Not too hard to comprehend.
Great Post Keep up the good work
Godspeed
Huge risk = huge rewards, xcongrats
Hello dear. I am with the Bitcoin Service Department.  Employee number 98/128.

Please kindly DM me and I will help with your Bitcoin issues to make a smart and happy life with best winnings. Thank kind sir.
Nice man. Living the dream. Glad it paid off
61k unrealized gain. The tax man going to come on that. Enjoy the bill. Balls the size of grapefruits thought
this aged well, you are making it big now. How do I take a out a personal loan like you? From my bank?
You sir are a fucking legend. 

Going against all the standard financial advice. Having the balls to put your money where your mouth is and taking the risks. 

Just make sure you know when to stop - from your last paragraph it seems you do. But we all know how easily fomo can hit in. 

Only thing is, I‚Äôd like to know more but it may be too personal! Eg‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs your income, do you have dependents etc! I don‚Äôt expect you to answer but it would make for interesting reading!
I just don't see the big deal in taking loans to invest into crypto.  One of the best reasons to take out a personal loan is to invest in stocks and real estate.  It's much better than some people who take a personal loan to go on a holiday.  And there's plenty of degeneracy available in real estate and stocks/derivatives.

If one is able to service the loans with fiat-mine-money, and bought BTC at cycle lows, it's not as risky as people on /cc.  /cc just seems to be overall financially ignorant about trad-fi.
Holy shit.. someone who actually makes sense posted
By the way, I too took out a loan to buy Bitcoin. I got a loan of $15,000 to buy Bitcoin at about $25,600 price range. I DCA'd but averaged about $28,000 for it all.
Unrealized profit is nothing.
You‚Äôre damn right this isn‚Äôt financial advice. You‚Äôre crazy. I‚Äôm sure you were feeling all warm as you typed this. The fact is you have taken a huge risk with absolutely no guarantee of profit. These situations never end well. You might win on this dice roll (probably not) but your behaviour tells me that in the long run you‚Äôll get caught out badly. Best of luck.
I am super proud of you! people who truly understand good debt vs bad debt.
Come next month is he gonna be in panic mode. The question is will he hold when he‚Äôs negative 30k because it‚Äôs  coming. Let‚Äôs see what he‚Äôs made of then.
Congratulations. This is how you wealth.
What does your tax bill look like?
Dude I‚Äôm smart as fuck , 121 IQ and this is genius with someone who can utilize taking advantage of americas ponzi credit system , great for you to utilize crypto and make that ponzi credit work for you! üíØ
Doesn‚Äôt matter if you invest 10 bucks with your own money or 10 bucks with loan money. There is no difference. So, congratulations to OP! (I did the same, but with a smaller loan)‚Ä¶ up 80% in 3 months. More returns than S&P500 in 1 year. Im able to pay off my whole debt now. But‚Ä¶will pay it off during the peak of the bullrun.
Love this you crazy bastard, but taxes are going to wipe out most of your profits when you cash out no? I mean I know you made it over a year on some of it so it‚Äôs not the hardest hit, but as it grows you will come into the highest bracket where you get taxed the 30 something percent no?
I took out 20k in loans for xrp. I know I'm crazy, but it's a hunch
Can you update with total interest of the loan?

k thanks
Congrats
Excellent work

Same opportunity available now to anyone with good credit 

I‚Äôve done similar with ALGO purchases because I think it‚Äôll increase more than BTC
Im down for this, RESPECT.
Look the people who are shattered the pleb jobs are getting taken by robots ..... this is the new way new exactly what I was speaking of Utopian Society Instead of Indoctrinated slaves at the end of high school The whole curriculum is obsolete

Show me your balls so I know your Forreal
Are you concerned at all about the impact recession can do to the price of bitcoin if we were to fall into one?
Curious how all this affects credit score.. in one corner that‚Äôs a lot of credit from multiple outlets..

But if you are paying on time and over the amount due it seems like that would reflect well on your score.  But that‚Äôs still a lot of credit being taken out relatively rapidly so I can‚Äôt imagine credit score companies exactly liking that.

Either way congrats - I‚Äôd def see that 60k profit and take at least half.  Would be a great cushion to have and riding the ~1 btc for free
Can I take a $40k loan from you? üòÖ
Thanks for sharing
This is the way
you crazy bastard, I love it and you
What happens if BTC implodes and goes to zero?
God damn MFer.

Shake me to my core‚Ä¶ are you single? üòâ 

THIS is the way!
You‚Äôre insane. I love it
Can you share where you got some of the unsecured loans or balance transfers through? What kind of impact did this have on your credit score?
If you never sell your Bitcoin, then why did you buy it? Clearly some day you will sell it to enjoy the profits.
Nice!! Will follow for up date!
Buy some long calls on Bitcoin and you'll be gucci for life
What‚Äôs a balance transfer loan?
Baller move.  I'm on my 3rd go round leveraging credit to accumulate.  I did it with $1k in 2021, again in 2022, and $5k last week to max out my 2023 ROTH IRA contribution and buy Bitcoin ETFs.
I wish I had the stones to gamble like you haha
When are the current, and future interest rates on your balance transfers and loans?
Good work bro but I pray you have all this on a cold wallet
You dumb af
Just pay the loans off come on man,

You've only gone and done it. Go big or go home.

And how much was the bulldozer you drive around  to carry around those massive balls?
After being down 80% or more on nearly all of my altcoins I didn‚Äôt sell from 2021 I have the risk tolerance of an old lady.  Thank god it‚Äôs only a small portion of my crypto portfolio but I learned a valuable lesson.  I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep at night taking out massive loans to speculate on magic internet money.
Well done, congrats!
Would you sell if Bitcoin was a million dollars each?

1 billion?
So do you just think they are neat or something?
Super degen shit lmao love it
in the past what was your plan if everything goes wrong? like btc at 5000$ today
The scariest part of this for me wouldn‚Äôt be whether or not it goes up or down but if it were to disappear in a hack or something
now do it w/ ethereum
Congratulations
I‚Äôm going to do that but today
I know you're excited about your even number of Bitcoin, but you've already almost doubled your investment.   
You can save yourself a lot of heartache by paying off the loan you're paying interest on and riding the 18 month transfer.    
I'm not a financial advisor and I'm not offering advice, just my 2 sats.
You got lucky on a really dumbass move!
So 24 more months paying how much in interest per month? Also what are the retroactive interest rates on those 0% loans if they are not paid off in time?
Telling people things upsets the matrix..


You just doomed yourself
Good work.
Well done. This is what I did in 2020 roughly speaking but at a smaller scale (and larger gain.. so far). You should up the degen factor, get wBTC, put em on Aave, borrow USDC, and buy 2 more wBTC

Not financial advice

If you sold today you‚Äôd make about 30k after paying Uncle Sam:
ABSOLUTE CHAD
Sounds like a good way to ruin your life.
Not sure I believe this -as many credit card companies do not even allow you to BUY Bitcoin on Credit- and many exchanges dont allow it either. If possible sounds like robbing peter to pay paul lol. If it worked great, but def not financial advice.
What methods are you using to earn income on the BTC?
Good job. Good grief.¬†
Surely though, you have to factor in capital gains when selling the Bitcoin?
Damn.
Wow, i might consider paying off the loan if the price beat your cost basis by 4x.. Though sounds like you are in it for the long haul. Bold move, commendable.
Now sell it before they hit you with interest and walk away in the green
Wendy‚Äôs hates you and congrats you regarded son of a gun.
Best of luck..
What made you do it?
What of BTC falls towards $18-20kish and stays there for weeks? What would you do?

 Nice to see an update again from you, all is going well.
Nice to see someone follow through and succeed. I have been contemplating doing this for a few years now.
Congrats bro I'm happy for you.
What *are* your plans regarding teh BTC if you say you are never going to sell no matter what they are worth?  You wouldn't sell off some of it if it spiked to some insane price per coin?
Fuckin‚Äô G
Dont give me ideas ü§£
Thanos, is that you ?
Congrats this is amazing
Using credit cards to buy crypto it‚Äôs about the dumbest thing you can do. You either get lucky or unlucky but you are still pretty stupid
If I were you, I would sell 1 BTC at 100k, pay off the debts, then just freeroll the other 3 Bitcoin for as long as you want.
Op if this is true well Fucking Done
Congrats and well done!
I‚Äôm guessing you have a pretty high income, most people could get a loan that big to gamble with to begin. I‚Äôm not gonna offer any concerns or warnings. Truthfully I suspect where this is headed and I‚Äôm too jaded to care.
You sir have steel coated balls of pure ice. Go ahead and realise those profits and move onto something else. You already won :)
Yes balls of steel. Good Luck.
‚ÄúBanks hate this one simple trick‚Äù
Can‚Äôt have balls and brains I guess lol.
Do you just hold the BtC in a cold wallet, at an exchange or something else? 

Do you do any defi?
thanks for sharing your journey bro

Took the risk and reaped the rewards... Congrats!¬†
After taxes you will owe $1.89...
I applaud you because there's no way.
Yo, how do you get those balances transferred to a 0% interest card?
Have you thought seriously about the very real risk that this could go the other way incredibly quickly or are you just thinking about all the wonderful ways this can change your life.
Have you considered what greed looks like on you and if it is forcing a certain mindset.
Im happy for you but thats a fair amount of debt that if you lost your ability to earn an income while simultaneously BTC dropping back down to sub $20k.

All I'm saying is you should probably start paying down some of the debt and don't be greedy.

If you pay off your debt while BTC is high, you can buy more when BTC is low again
Anyone reading this: DO NOT do what this person did
I guess using half of my saving is not so bad after all. Congrats on the gain.
Sell enough to pay off the loan and hold your winnings to Valhalla
I would have just cashed out on the ETF pump and paid the loans off with a nice gain lol
Scary stuff. It could go either way.
Absolute madlad
I love the "not financial advice" at the end. You have to be absolutely regarded to do this in the first place and even more regarded to read this and think that this is something that you should also be doing.

Lesser lucky people. Taking out personal loans to speculate on risky assets will not work out well for most people.
Loan sharks love him
I actually did this back in 2017, but purely through credit card, as my bank still allowed it then, and at a much lower scale, $3k in credit card debt over a few purchases in the course of a month.

few months later that $3k was worth like $15k after fees. Paid less than $500 in interest and that was at like like 20%~ so I walked with 11k or so after paying off the CC, interest, and exchange fees. I actually got out before the run up to the new ATH otherwise it would have been like 20k off 3k for about 12 and a half minutes.

Didn't pay taxes on it either.
OP got lucky gambling.*
Lesser lucky people. There's no smart here, just luck.
OP just so happened to start at a low in a bear market.

If OP were a r/WallStreetBets connoisseur, they would invest all of these to shitcoins to moon 100x or not.

The OP did the unthinkable: taking sane amount of risk and rather insane rewards. That is considering the interest paid to date.

It's dangerously close to investing on a loan with calculated risk rather than going full ape shit on options and probably puke from stress like that furry when shorting Apple stocks.

‚Ä¢  The author of the text is a Bitcoin investor who has used various loans and balance transfers to buy 4 Bitcoin over 19 months.  
‚Ä¢  The author has paid off one of the loans and still owes $56,000 on the others.  
‚Ä¢  The author has made an unrealized profit of $61,500 as of January 25th, 2024, based on the current price of Bitcoin.  
‚Ä¢  The author plans to pay off the remaining loans in less than two years and does not want to sell the Bitcoin.
Are you me?
Some people are addicted to making money. No other reason. They just want more of it. It‚Äôs trained into people by our society. I don‚Äôt get it either. If I had millions in my account I‚Äôd put it to work making passive income to sustain my wealth and just stop working lol


Then one day blow it all on hookers n blow and leave this world an old man, having a heart attack, drowning in pussy.
You could theoretically use it as collateral to borrow from and use other cash generating assets to pay off the debt (potentially purchased with that borrowed money), or if you still work, paying off the debt with regular income. Not selling doesn't necessarily mean you don't plan to get to benefit from asset appreciation, just that you are very confident in the asset retaining its value or increasing in value over time.

The trouble is it's not currently widely accepted as collateral in TradFi, so even if that's their plan it's a bit more work to do it since you need to rely on DeFi for borrowing, usually at variable rates, then convert into fiat to spend normally.
The point is ending fiat.
Being able to buy stuff is sometimes as good as buying stuff. I dont have or need a car, it makes me happy knowing that i could buy a nice one if i wanted.¬†
Usually the story ends with them heading over to r/wallstreetbets and make some regarded decisions. Gamblers love the rush.
He won't. Probably he will get more loans and buy more bitcoin if this works out. It is what it is but there is no winning strategy. You can make money using a strategy of taking loans. Then you discover that this works and there is no reason to not repeat it again.

Yeah, I'm pretty happy about the average. 

I don't even care that it's doing so well right now as I'd like more time to stack. I actually hope we get another correction because I want to continue buying over the next couple of months before the halving.

hell yeah! congrats!
Another commenter was talking about how his wealthy friends grind, don‚Äôt spend, etc. Seems you‚Äôre the same way. 7 figures in worth and trading $150 for $135 in gift cards of a different store on Reddit at the same time. Guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm poor, if I was worth over a mil I woulda just dropped the $150 cash at the second store and used the original gift card at that store.
Celsius payouts happen in a week or two but... yet fuck Mashinsky 

\- Coming from someone who got fucked by Luna then Celsius
This week I was fortunate enough to get all of my money back from Celsius. 

While many of my other friends have theirs still stuck, I was lucky. Hopefully everyone who had theirs in the Celsius earn will get good news soon.

I only got it back because I was in the process of moving my coins to private wallets so everything was not in the earn section and just in the Celsius standard wallet when celcius went tits up.
Sorry for your loss. Fuck Mashinksy and ger whore
You can do it bro. I believe in you.
Celsius bankruptcy should be paying out earn accounts starting  circa January 31 of this year.  Sure, no where near 100%, but more than your initial loan.  All hope is not lost.  Plus you get some BTC mining stock.  Good luck and better stay on those meds if they help. Not medical advice.
Glad you got help. There are loads of us here that would be available if you need personal support. Much love my friend! *Postal* is a scary word, when did that come to fruition? Like 94-96?
I remember you too!

Hope all is well.
I feel nothing wrong with that.
Nah. I‚Äôm chill. Whats wrong with you?
Nah, no way. He's so smart, and gonna go even further and make it all worth it. surely
Those were the best times to buy. How can you see it any other way?

I wish they would return in full force so I could buy more.
You're confused. Go back and read my first thread on this...

I started buying when it was at $35,000... and I continue to buy today. I just bought $1,500 worth of Bitcoin yesterday. 

In respect to the loan, it wasn't the price of Bitcoin that mattered so much, it was the interest rates of the loan.
Great point!
I wish I would have come across your posts. I would have provided moral support.

You have to remember that the average Redditor on this sub works a minimum wage job and lives in their parents basement. These are not serious people
Those credit transfer terms are usually death traps, like if you miss a single payment, the 0 apr goes away and you immediately owe interest at the penalty rate for all the periods so far. If OP had a single unfortunate event like a medical problem, dude we paying back 27% APR interest on 100k. $800 a month turns into $2200 in a blink of an eye.
Russian roulette
Not even close.
They‚Äôd only be 15% like anything else if he ever sells (which is apparently never according to him)
Because OP looks at the higher price than when he bought it and thinks he's smart.
If he expects it to go to new ATHs in the near term, say <1 year, that's still some 70+% higher from here, selling it to pay off the debt now would be roughly equivalent to gaining the APR he would have paid on that principal, which even with high interest credit cards, is still much less then 70%
was it?
Wealthy people and businesses do this a lot it‚Äôs nothing new
So much
Smart moves.
Honestly, I also did something super similar.. HELOC, loan on 401k, and special 0% cash advance deals on credit.. the way I see it is you have to take risks for big rewards, and the math is just there‚Ä¶ it works. Obviously some people would say investing in crypto is risky, but it‚Äôs a calculated risk. Going against the grain can be a good thing and sometimes the only way to get a leg up. Luckily my husband trusts me with these decisions! it‚Äôs already proven to be fruitful, but I‚Äôm just waiting to see what this next halvening does! Good luck to you both!
It did go downhill. I started buying at $35k... and continued buying as it went all the way down to $16k... and then back up. 

I continue to buy today and will tomorrow as well.
Not everyone pisses their pants at the sight of a little volatility like you do.
Because then he wouldn‚Äôt have the potential profits of 4 bitcoins, only 1.5 bitcoins‚Ä¶.haven't you ever been to a casino?¬†
You just don't get it.
OP is about to go from $800 monthly payments to $1700 in about 3 months from what it sounds like. If he was actually intelligent, he‚Äôd sell some coins, take the 15% hit one time and avoid the 15-20% ANNUAL interest costs and disarm a potential time bomb.

Put plainly, he owes about $9k and taxes, but probably like $11k annually in interest once the promo rates end. Yea he said he‚Äôs paying it down quick but seems pretty likely he‚Äôs gonna go owe more in interest than his tax burden
Then the ball lands on 00.
Reading this was a nice soundbite for the subreddit, I was in awe of OP until I read the last paragraph. 

An unrealized profit of $61,500 is $0 in real profit if you never sell lol, holding is NOT the smart thing to do for volatile currency if you find out you‚Äôve come out ahead for the time being.
Gamblers don‚Äôt quit while they‚Äôre ahead

It is kinda... you can transfer any debt. Doesn't need to be from a credit card. It can be a lions or whatever. 

Or you can just write yourself a balance transfer check too. Basically a loan to yourself.
Don't tell her ü§´
Lmao
Yeah, I'm done. I kinda hate having debt, but I couldn't pass up this opportunity.

I answered the personal part on my lat update. Check it out.
Why would there be a tax bill when I haven't sold?
What tax bill? Hahaha. Let them find it.
Please explain to me how 30% is "wiping out all my gains"?

Regardless, that would only happen if I sold it all at once... or sold any of it. 

I'd rather take loans out against it.
Nope. Not at all. 

I mean, I would love that because then I could buy more.
The loans actually help. 

The balance transfers absolutely rekt my credit score. It went form 820 to low 700's

The reality is that a loan can still be called in at any time. Buying the bitcoin at a good time is key to this. If your average is high and the BTC price drops hard, you are in a very risky position.
The interest is minimal. No big deal. 

Also, remember that there is no chance of liquidation or margin call.
Insane reward? He risked his financial future to make 45k after taxes. He could have just worked some overtime for 2 years. Same money. Less stress.

Over leverage in a bear equals bust
It's gambling. But he also said he would never sell so more realistically he took on 6 figures on debt and lit it on fire
He was being a complete idiot. He started future as trading in November when every token was killing it. Thought it was just easy. Ended up losing some money one night and then revenge traded himself all the way to broke. It‚Äôs pretty fucking bad situation, and now he‚Äôs been contemplating suicide. I told him multiple times not to keep leverage trading but he thought he knew it all after 2 weeks of futures
I just follow the balloons, then they took them away now I'm lost

Do you have any exit strategy at the moment? like DCA out once it reaches certain high?

Well yeah, he‚Äôs either a bullshitter or all his money is tied up in crypto.

Congrats on being fortunate enough to have your holdings in custody waiting to move to wallet.
Lol Thanks.
1986, when postal workers went *postal* and killed their managers, police, coworkers and other unexpecting victims in a mass shooting.
Now kith.
I mean if he isn't going to sell, then this is literally just someone taking a loan and paying it back with no return.
It's crazy the mentality of the herd. Buying in a frenzy when price is mooning, but complete aversion to buying when the price is dumping.

Serious investors know when and how to take and manage profit whilst offsetting taxes in their favor to re-invest.  

All of which you have not shown.

I've worked from the ground up to succeed.  It's incredibly evident that you have not.  I hope someday you become humbled.  However that may be.

But I wish you incredible luck on your bet.
100%. You won the lottery.  Move on.
Just messing. You‚Äôve got big balls though but what a play. Happy for you!
15% where?
Yes, it very obviously was stupid. It is so obviously stupid that OP does not want to repeat what he did. OP knows he got lucky and that is why he does not want to push his luck again.

Actions speak more than words.
I love Bitcoin. But you shouldn't be taking on leverage to invest in volatile assets.

Yes it was.
I think there's an important point here that can be counterintuitive. Whether a decision is a good idea or a bad idea does not change retrospectively based on the outcome.

To give an extreme example. Suppose I put one bullet in a revolver, spun the cylinder and pulled the trigger at my head. If I didn't die, that would not mean that carrying out the action was in retrospect a good idea. It was still a terrible idea. I just got lucky.
Not often with volatile assets and when leverage is employed in these situations it is accompanied by hedging strategies to limit the down side
Wealthy people do not do risk their ENTIRE personal credit and personal financials..

I am glad it worked out for OP. I guess if he could afford the 100k loam if it busted it wasn't the riskiest thing ever. Especially if he's young. But let's not pretend wealthy people utilize this strategy.
My husband is pretty much stuck on Nvda and Pallintir, He plays stocks and buy bonds.This is my shit here,I'm not to worried about the halving as usually it's a pump up too the it and then nothing,There's a lag on BTC takes a bit to kick in afterwards
What's the point of building up an asset if you never intend to use it for anything?
Personal attack was kinda unwarranted
You dropped this üëë
Question for you, you‚Äôre about done with promotional interest rates and you‚Äôve got an outstanding balance of $56k and monthly premium payments of $800. What‚Äôs your new interest rates gonna be in 3 months? 

Isn‚Äôt your monthly payments about to jump to like $900+ in solely interest. And you‚Äôve dropped your credit score, are you even eligible for another promotional balance transfer to delay further?
Huh? Seriously, wtf are you talking about? 

How did you come up with those numbers?
So I can get a credit card loan on one card and transfer it to a 0% interest card after?
I know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd never be a good scammer üòî
üò¨
You have to pay 30 to 35% on the total cash out of $160k. That is $56k. You  have $5,100 left.

Government rigged the taxes so you can't do what you did. Use loans to make money on crypto.
I didn‚Äôt say it would take all of your gains, so not sure where you got that. An ya if you sold depends on how much, as well as how much you made that year would determine your tax percent for the year. I don‚Äôt know much about loans out for crypto, but in reality like a normal loan you are paying it back with interest, so you lose money no? Also if you take a loan out for say all of it, and it drops, would you have to make up the difference of it at all?
I don‚Äôt see this for your balance transfers. Just the 4.9 and 8 for your 2 outstanding loans. Make sure you‚Äôve got a good plan to pay down those balance transfers. Typically they shoot up to 15-25% apr once the intro period is done
New house buyer hate this easy trick
OP a team member in the strategic marketing team from a big bank.
I just didn‚Äôt file a tax return that year. It‚Äôs a little trick I picked up over the years.
By not reporting it and many exchanges didn't report it then too.

What do you mean "can be called in"?
Not true at all.
Why do you have no interest in selling bitcoin even if it goes high? Not even 1 btc just to cover your costs?
Lol bitcoin crashes quite often. Bitcoin does NOT protect your wealth. Highly volatile investments are the opposite of what you want if you‚Äôre looking to protect and sustain wealth.
lol revenge traded is the best term¬†
> Now it‚Äôs time to focus on paying everything down over the next 2 years with earned income. **I have no desire to sell my Bitcoin regardless of how high its price goes.**
He‚Äôd be best to keep it as an asset id think, he can always loan against it in the future if he needs liquidity. Not sure what he has setup in regard to taxes but I‚Äôd say BTC is similar in some respects as an investment property (obviously completely different in others), but assuming the thesis that price will continue to rise over time, it‚Äôs a great store of wealth, just wish there were better rates for liquidity mining with it.
[No bullshit](https://imgur.com/a/Lf2KSx2). And about 40% of my total assets value is in crypto.
[deleted]
That's the same guy in the audience that screams, "NO DEAL!", when the banker offers your $743K with a $1 suitcase still in play
dawg thinks he a genius
To the US govt? If he‚Äôs held the coins longer than a year it qualifies as long term capital gains. So that‚Äôs taxed  at a flat 15% regardless of income. So $60k in profit times 15% is what he‚Äôd own the IRS if he sold and realized the gains.
Wouldn't even call this luck really.  I'm sure there were nights he wished he was someone else.
At that point though, if OP is deciding not to push it, when does it turn from stupid to brilliant? That in itself is an action that warrants kudos, no?
[deleted]
Only people who don‚Äôt understand the way bitcoin moves and think short term say stuff like ‚Äúit‚Äôs too risky ‚Äú and ‚ÄúBitcoin is volatile ‚Äú no shit life is volatile. Any asset can lose its value , crypto is no riskier than investing in stocks if you are smart and protect your assests and diversify your crypto portfolio and don‚Äôt keep assets on exchanges . The only truly risky thing op is doing is keeping all his money in one singular assets . That piece alone makes it risky. Also Bitcoin appreciates significantly every cycle so how many brain cells does it take to buy and hold for 4 years . It‚Äôs literally that easy .
To everyone saying this guy is stupid and this is risky and bitcoin is volatile blah blah blah , do you even understand Bitcoin ? If more ppl did what he was doing there would be more millionaires . I personally would have spread it between btc and alts since alts appreciate more and have more potential upside during the bull run but stfu about the volatile bull shit . LIFE is volatile , your Bitcoin is basically guaranteed to go up if you hold it 4-5 years . It takes 0
Brain cells. If you‚Äôre scared move out of the way for the big bag bosses üçÜüòé
Especially a volatile one. There is a chance greater then zero that bitcoin goes to nothing. Why risk it¬†
You poor thing. Are you alright?
if you are doing a balance transfer thats cuz you fucked by interest. its not a smart thing to do. its what credit card companies do to take on the interest payments coming
What nobody is telling you, if you miss a single payment all that happy 0 Apr shit goes out the window and Mr Visa comes and beats you with a retroactive 20%+ rate. 

You better be financially rock solid to even consider rolling into a balance transfer loan. This isn‚Äôt some free money cheat code.

Read the terms and conditions. If you don‚Äôt understand them, don‚Äôt even think about signing the dotted line
So long as the cards are from different institutions
You don‚Äôt pay on total cash, you pay on profit (or reduce taxes if it‚Äôs a loss), and if you‚Äôve held over a years you pay long term capital gains which for anyone taking balance transfers is either 0% or 15%.

Govt didn‚Äôt rig shit, they‚Äôve declared it to be treated like a stock/property which isn‚Äôt surprising at all. Loans/financing of the purchase has nothing to do with the taxes. Buying investments with leverage is an entirely regular occurrence (ie almost all of real estate deals)
Uh... read the current post for the BT answers.
The IRS hates this one weird trick
That ‚Äútrick‚Äù works until it doesn‚Äôt. Got audited in 2017 for crypto, and the IRS agent was at my house for 3 hours downloading bank and credit statements for the prior 3 years onto a flash drive that he took with him. You up to that? Man you must be REALLY young or you just don‚Äôt make any money.
interesting
they found me and i only get disability‚Ä¶
‚Äúlittle trick‚Äù your an idiot to literally voice this
Do you have a preferred CEX? DEX?
And more
You beat meat to it
The bank can effectively demand the money back (call it in) at any point. Generally this would only happen in the event of bank crisis, but it can and does happen. Multiple banks collapsed over the past two years and the loans they had given to customers would have been called in.
Probably because the sale triggers taxes and he‚Äôs in it for the long term.  There‚Äôs no point in selling crypto to pay in cash when you‚Äôre still buying more with cash. That‚Äôs just giving your assets an unnecessary tax haircut.
What you are doing in this sub?
404 error... link not found lol
What the hell are you smoking? üòÇ
That's simply not true. If your income is low enough the tax rate for long term capital gains is 0, no tax. But after that yes, it jumps straight to 15% or 20%.

Considering this dude can comfortably pay $800 a month on debt, he'll certainly be taxed. But low income folks should know they won't be, it's a huge opportunity
The original decision remains stupid. The decision to stop is smart.
No man that's never smart. 

If he could easily afford the payments then he could have invested without the leverage.
Any asset can lose value which is why the only time you should be employing leverage is when the loan is secured by an asset not a loan that is personally secured. That is dumb any way you want to slice it man.
Use all your money go ahead. Don't do it with leverage
If it isn‚Äôt stupid, why don‚Äôt you copy him? There is no ‚Äúwould have‚Äù. You can just do it right?
Ironic that you have to call others poor when you are the one that needs to take out a loan to gamble on crypto. But sir, enjoy the 8 to 5 dayjob to pay off your loans! üòÇ
they have to cash out the $160k, they have to pay taxes on that total.
0 percent is the intro rate that ends in 18 -21 months. At that point your rate will jump, o don‚Äôt see what your rate jumps to?
Lmfao. ‚Äòyeah I circumvent paying my water bill by simply not checking the mail. Just a little trick I picked up over the years.‚Äô
You realize they subpoena banks and financial institutions for that.... Ya know, the ones that would have it without question, not the person that MIGHT have it on their computer.

 They would do that if you had a business pretty much only to check books that wouldn't be readily available elsewhere.  Oh and they have to have a warrant.  And they notify you way in advance so you have your poop in a group.
Little trick - don‚Äôt open the front door‚Ä¶
That's because they'd rather less people got disability.
The person saying this wasn't the OP.
Right now using Kraken, Uphold and Binance.us

not much difference in payment/withdraw options and overall fees. Between those three I have access to most everything in the top 200.
What more than ü™¶ üòÇ
I have signed a contract with my bank to pay back a loan at a pre-determined rate. I don't believe they have any legal right to just say "nvm pay it all back now!" can you provide any source on that? I found a specific type of loan called a "call loan", but it looks like those are issued to brokerage firms, not in the case of personal loans
OP has no assets. Only bitcoin.
When you say crypto you must mean Bitcoin because altcoins go -90 to -99% each cycle so you shouldn‚Äôt hold these long term
I‚Äôm sorry, being part of the crypto community doesn‚Äôt mean I need to simp and make up garbage about the tech. I‚Äôm being realistic. Why are you in this sub?
If only I could be so stupid
Will it be dumb before or after he makes millions ?
That‚Äôs not how it works, I‚Äôve got a series 66 and have spent a few years doing accounting and now do financial services. You pay taxes on gains, that why it‚Äôs called capital gains. Gains = profit = sell value - cost basis

A quick google search would prove you‚Äôre wrong. 

Literally google is bitcoin subjected to capital gains. Then google the difference between short and long term capital gains. If you find out anything different feel free to enlighten me
Haha, I have been dropping my water bill in my neighbors mail box, seems to be working well, although when I tried to shower this morning no water came out, may need to call the plumber

Check the small print. The vast majority of loans and mortgages contain clauses allowing the bank to recall the money at any time.
[deleted]
No?  Did you miss the part where he said he can easily service the loans, is making double payments and intends to have them paid off within 2 years?
No, I mean any singular crypto.

If I take a $100 loan to buy SHIT at $0.10/coin and it 10xes, now I have a $100 loan and $1000 in SHIT.

That means I could sell $100 in SHIT and I'd be up $900 and have my loan paid off, right?  Wrong.

We'll use Short Term Capital Gains to make it more obvious here, my tax rate is 32%. So any crypto I cash out within a year of purchase I owe 32% of my profit to the government. I'd have to withdraw $148, pay $48 of it to the Uncle Sam, then pay off my $100 loan.

Instead of $900 profit, I'm down to $852 profit.

Rather than sell the crypto and trigger a taxable event, assuming I want to hold my coins for a long time and I believe in the product and would be spending money to buy more anyway, the smart play is to just take the next $100 you would've bought more with, and pay down the loan.

Now... as you said, if I'm not a SHIT evangelist and I think it is likely to tank, I'd much rather have the $848 profit than losing my whole investment, but $900 > $848.
You just don‚Äôt understand how money works
You can, if you want. Just go ahead and repeat what he did.

There is a reason why you are not going to do it.
What's stopping you? Go take out an unsecured loan and open some credit cards.
Yep
Or you can put a solar panel in your living room facing your TV use the TV to charge the panel to run the TV.. infinity loop. üîÅ
To me, needing video sounds like an entirely different alphabet agency is requesting that.  Records are records, files are files.  

Video from inside a bank/credit union on the other hand, suggests something deeper and out of the IRS territory.
That‚Äôs usually for business loans, not consumer loans
99.99% of all consumer loans in America only have calling in loans if you default.
I did read it then, and reviewed it now. The only way they can call it back is if I break the terms.
Did you miss the part where he said he took an unsecured loan? Do you know what an unsecured loan is?
Makes no sense. So you will hold that shit coin from hundreds in profit down to being worth $1-$10 from your original $100. Sound smart. I‚Äôm going to sell my shit coins and pay the taxes because the taxes is much less than how much they are going to drop in the bear market
If you think putting all of your money into a single highly volatile investment instead of diversifying in much safer alternatives, I‚Äôm sorry to tell you that you have no clue what you‚Äôre doing. 

Best of luck out there.
Okay
I do this to charge my portable charger..
Yup.  And that can be as little of a thing as a credit score change. Or racking up any debt for even the shortest amount of time that they deem as too risky.  Those rules are ALWAYS stacked in their favor.

It's EXTREMELY rare.  They are making money off your debt.  But trust me when I say they know what they are doing.  Even banks that "failed" made money in failing.  

While we are there let's say your bank did fail.  Or,  they just simply wanted to in some cases.  They can sell your loan to another bank.  New rules (sometimes).
You truly have no idea what you're talking about.

This would be in the loan agreement.  Acceleration isn't a joke and is often the last resort even when available.
8 things I've learned (1 Year of being Profitable)
I understand that I myself am a newb, but hopefully some newbier people can take some things away from this.

  
-Diversification is the most important critical factor(1)

-Risk Management is the second(2)

-Small Profits are profits(3)

-ALWAYS forward test on a paper account(4)

-Treat it like a hobby not a career(5)

-Pattern Day Trading Protection is protection for firms, not for a small trader(6)

-There is no way to get rich quick, patience is important(7)

-Good strategies are great strategies (8)

1. Having a losing position really sucks, but if you have 4 losing positions and 6 winning ones, then you have 2 winning positions, which is twice as good as 1 winning position.

  
2. Again a losing position is BAD, but is it worse to lose 50% of your portfolio on a bad trade, or 1%?

3. Would you rather take a 0.5% gain? Or risk that 0.5% you gained for 0.25% more? Personally I'd rather just take the 0.5%. Those small in and out trades are awesome. I spent too long worrying about the buy and hold comparison. Does it profit? Then it's profits baby. Does it not perform a lot of trades? I'd hook it up to more tickers. 

4. In my earlier days, I found the Holy Grail! (aka repainting to hell), hooked it up to my account, went to work, and thought I'd come home to endless riches. Except I came home to a nuked account. Other times it had been bugged code not properly executing closes causing loss, stuff like that. 

5. This ties into #7 a bit, but I thought it was my immediate future, in 3 months me and my wife could retire on an island. When that (obviously) didn't happen, then came the depression. I thought my future was over. Now I have a more laissez-faire approach. "Oh cool, that's neat" type of beat, rather than staking my happiness on it. Mental health is going to be huge to your development. Take breaks, relax. 

6. Self explanatory, but the amount of times I've lost money when I couldn't close a position due to PDTP is absurd. Didn't want to, but wrote a check for this in my script. The law was passed to prevent GME type situations (look how well that worked) and to gatekeep small traders from becoming big ones. (Honestly not a tip for traders just wanted to rant about this.)

7.  Okay maybe there is a way to get rich quick, but I certainly couldn't find it. Either way, investment firms cream at the idea of 0.5% gains a week, except there isn't the supply for them to make trades at that frequency with the capital they're working with. This is good for you, because it means you can. 0.5% a week consistently beats even the best index funds.

8. Similar to 3 (and 5, and 7 I guess),  I spent too long looking for the Holy Grail. In reality all I needed was something that works consistently, and there is a massive catalog of that available already. I found a good strategy, tweaked it for 10 tickers, and enjoyed. Had I done that 2 years ago I'd be 2 years profitable instead of 1. 

Messy rambling, but hopefully some find it helpful.






This is amazing man. Really happy you are finally profitable! I‚Äôm looking to do the same, have a few questions for you:

1. Are your strategies purely TA based or do you have fundamental strategies and/or sentiment analysis in there?
2. Couldn‚Äôt you bypass PDPT with a cash account? Or do you use margins?
3. Do you have any wisdom to share on risk management? I.e. how much percentage of your account do you use for a single trade? Is it fixed, or a function of how confident you are in the trade?
Do you trade your strategies only on certain market regimes?  If so, how do you determine the regimes?
Where do you run your Algo ? What is your stack
Based on my experience I love this advice. Especially the themes of not over-complicating things into oblivion and managing your mental health throughout the journey.
Let‚Äôs see the chart then
Can you talk more about your backtesting and asset selection?

1. How did you select your tickers? Did you have a strategy for selecting tickers based on some backtest results? Or scanned the sectors manually looking at fundamentals? Something else? 
2. How far back did you backtest for the assets you trade live?
3. What indicators did you focus on in backtests?
Thanks for sharing all of this. And well done! üëè üëè üëè
Thank you for sharing.
This is nitpicky, 1 is a subset of 2, you can manage risk by diversifying
My man.
Thanks for sharing your thoughts. But an even bigger thanks for your engagement in the comments! 
The way you‚Äôre sharing specific implementation details is refreshing. I even saw a line of code! A lot of people would guard any and all details like it was their proprietary secret. I think your comments are providing as much help to the community as your OP lol. 
Great job!
this was incredible to read. also goes to show the advances in the industry and how accessible trading is for everyone. keep at it and try ur hand at the futures mkt, theres no pdt rules there. also look into options on futures, even better capital efficiency. there's a million ways to skin a cat, but longevity in this game is based off risk mgmt. that's always gonna be first and foremost. "think risk first, reward second" -- prof. jeff beirman (theotrade instructor)
0.5% per week is insanely high, seems too good to be true without taking lots of risk
Newbie here, what was your starting background when it comes to programming? 

Spending time at the moment with writing the code, taking long as I am not a programmer.
Any good books you'd recommend? Either Algo or traditional investment.
What is the check for the PDTP in your script? Can you override it somehow if you spot it happening? I appreciate your rant, glad you've shared it üôå
Awesome feedback, I have a similar experience. 
Happy it worked out the way you wanted!
You sir are a chad
What do you recommend for a massive catalog of strategies that work? I see a lot of concepts mentoned but nothing that express that as an algorithm (if this then...)
Awesome post! Thanks for sharing your experience. I can relate it to mine: searching for the holy grail, getting too excited, dreaming about lambos, and losing money to bugs. After a year, I've finally settled on some sensible strategies. They won't make me rich overnight, but they're good enough to pay my bills.

Could you share one or two of your recent trades? There‚Äôs no need for screenshots‚Äîjust the ticker, whether you went long or short, and your entry and exit times. That would be really helpful!
good advice, thank you
Risk management ex. Diversification > diversification for trading. Diversification > risk management ex diversification. Thoughts?
Hey, congrats on the 1-year mark of being profitable! That‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôm curious, when you first started, what kind of initial investment did you make? Were you playing it safe with a smaller amount or did you go in a bit heavier?

Also, since you're using algo trading, how do you manage your trade times? Do you let it run all day or focus on specific times when the market‚Äôs more active?

And out of curiosity, which market are you mainly in? Im from Asia so I am just curious.

Would love to hear more about how you‚Äôve been navigating all of this!
Can u go into more detail on number 6 please
What language is a good baseline for starting out?
Can you elaborate on how do you diversity and risk manage?

Do you invest in completely different instruments to diversify? Or within the same instrument class, but with some negative coefficients?

And risk management - hedging? Something more complex?

Reading more about these two, especially that you've listed them first, would be very interesting if you'd find a minute
What‚Äôs the average trade holding time?
Great post OP. Are you trading as an LLC or some other business/tax entity? Asking bc I‚Äôm nearing the point where I need to figure that out
How many different systems are you trading to be diversified? Or it's the same system on differnt markets?
Literally laughed at loud at this.
If you can afford it, you can keep $25K in your margin account to avoid PDTP. You can continue to trade only  with the amount you are using right now. You can bake that into your script.

I didn‚Äôt see any discussion about slippage. If you‚Äôre trading on 1min candles and place market orders, I assume there is crazy slippage. Do you track it? Do you place stop-limit orders instead of market orders? I‚Äôd love to hear more about how you manage it.
Great insights!
Do you import into TurboTax?
Excellent post! THANK YOU for this and CONGRATULATIONS!
Thanks for sharing and I wish you the best of luck. I've been profitable since June after starting out earlier in the year. I also use Alpaca as a broker and noticed that their short fees were really eating up any chance I had of profits and things turned around once I focused on avoiding shorting stocks directly. Also the coding bugs, was funny reading that part as I can relate to a simple mistake multiplying a loss many times over. I've got probably at least 20 sanity checks on my trades now. My account capital is probably %15 of my yearly income, but I would probably feel comfortable maybe at triple that now if I wanted. trades scale from a typical 2% to a pretty rare %10 based on market prediction for the day.
How many strategies r you using in your diversification? Or r u mainly diversifying across markets (crypto, stocks, futures, etc.)
How long do you paper trade before taking the script live?
I appreciate you sharing, and answering the various questions people have posted.
Given your coding background, do you think there's a way to take advantage of DLearning or RLearning (even MLearning)? Like price prediction or trading decisions (buy, sell, hold).
Good starting guide
Hey buddy, thanks for your post!

I concur with you. Forward test is incredibly important as a proof-of-concept, there's only so much backtesting we can do. Most of the time, if our forward results do not mirror our backtest, then something is wrong. I went through a dry spell of a few months building my algo and finally, it is delivering results on live/demo accounts on forward basis. However, I am cautious and see how each week goes. Not going to rush to monetise it, also seeking advice.
[deleted]
"Messy rambling, but hopefully some find it helpful."

I stopped reading when you sent me from 5 to 7.

Did not find it helpful, obviously.
TA paired with fundamental strategies. I don't use ML either and quite frankly I don't think I'm smart enough for that. I'm an inept coder at best and although I've given my best attempt at it I came out just more confused than before, and couldn't get it to work properly.   
Given the difference with a margin and cash account, I actually prefer a margin account. But technically yes you could, although I use alpaca which doesn't offer one. 

I use 10% of equity a trade with a 3% max stop loss,  it's dynamic and 3% is just the max. So .3% risk a trade.  
I don't set the stop losses, everything is run automatically.  I think trailing is objectively better than fixed.
>Couldn‚Äôt you bypass PDPT with a cash account? Or do you use margins?

What does PDPT stand for in this context?

Edit: I'm stupid. "Pattern Day Trading Protection" was mentioned earlier in that post.
RODC for volatility (I like it better than CE) and a high-length T3 for direction
Tradingview Webhook -> Raspberry Pi hosting a Python Script -> Alpaca  
I've been looking into cloud hosting, but haven't settled on a good option yet.
I screen them for volatility, then do a deep backtest on TradingView, I just look at what has best performed, not necessarily the right way to do it, as past results don't indicate future results, but it gives me an idea on its market structure.  I normally just change the RODC threshold value from around 30-55.
Yeah a lot of them kind of blend together. I could've arranged it better, and reduced it down to around 4 bigger points.
I run 10% equity a trade with a max SL of 3%. It comes out to 30% a year which I don't think is absurdly unrealistic unlike the 400% a year posts I've seen on here.
I had done web development previously (html, javascript, etc.)  for a short time, but not much. I did the absolute wrong thing and immediately tried coding a massive LSTM model with databases and everything and got overwhelmed. I tried tackling this again recently, but even with a couple years experience now I still couldn't wrap my head around it. Now I'm pretty good at PineScript and okay at Python.
I'll be honest I haven't read any books on the matter, countless hours of Youtube videos, articles, interviews and videos on high performers like John Neff, Warren Buffet etc. as well as your bog standard finance youtubers, however. Books cost money and I'm a stingy bitch.
It's something like daytradecount = api.get\_account()\['day\_trade\_count'\]  
If daytradecount >= 3  
return  
in the buy loop
Do a search for scripts on TradingView, then filter for strategies. Here's a good list of indicators as well.

hey check dm
Pattern Day Trading is when you have less than $25,000 in an account you are not allowed to perform more than 3 day trades a week, otherwise your account will be locked. A day trade is a trade opened and closed in the same day. When the law was implemented, they said it was to protect smaller traders, but really it just hurts them. I think it's actual purpose is to gatekeep smaller traders. Some sites I used in the past would let you open a trade if you hit the limit, but not close it.
Really up to you, I'm sure C elitists will come out of the woodworks to claim it's the only viable language. I chose python because of the amount of libraries, readability, and documentation.
I stick to stocks. Futures are very difficult TA-wise and I hate the fees on crypto. Also Alpaca doesn't allow shorting on crypto and can't trade futures either. I look for stuff with higher volatility, so AAPL is a no go. I try to avoid stuff where news can impact the price massively, like biotech etc. I use a dynamic trailing SL (max 3%) and only trade 10% equity.
Varies wildly between tickers, but anywhere from 120 minutes to 1.2 days depending.
Personal, probably should figure that out myself too.
I use a handful of systems, but different sectors. PYPL shouldn't affect the price of COIN, so I'd consider that diverse even though it's technically not in the traditional sense. When you start getting into higher numbers, liquidity becomes an issue, so rather than trading equity % I plan on doing a fixed # and dumping the excess profits into a managed funds or SPY or something.
Thanks!
I think you are under estimating the abilities of the traders in this sub.

I'm definitely the dumbest person here, I never even went to uni and learnt the math watching youtube videos. However, even I am using bayesian inference in my trading system. Bayesian on trade decisions (informative time frames) and as a model for dynamic position sizing.
Cool, thanks for the feedback!
Good thing there's no called strikes in reading reddit posts üòÅ
Thank you for that man, really interesting! So interestingly enough I‚Äôm currently in grad school for ML & AI, took a class on using ML for trading. Created a RL based trader, and although performed phenomenally on training data, it ultimately ended up overfitting, and didn‚Äôt work as great on real data.

I created a much simpler strategy, purely based on TA, and that one actually has decent returns on all my testing, in and out of sample. I was interested in deploying this one really.

Question:
1. Considering you use margin acct, do you just limit the no. Of trades you execute per week then? Or how do you get around PDPT

2. Really interesting that you use fundamental analysis too. Do you use it just to validate a trade and use TA to confirm? I have no experience with FA and have always been interested. I would love any light you can shed
For my own education, what is CE?
What is RDOC?
Google Cloud has an always free tier and AWS has a 12-month free tier. ¬†
If your python script is simple, you could do Tradingview Webhook -> Zapier or [make.com](http://make.com) -> Alpaca. That way everything runs in the cloud and you don't need to worry about servers etc.

Nice to see Raspberry Pi¬†get a mention on here!
Nice that‚Äôs a wild flow, but solid
ProRealTime is the best
30% per year is definitely more reasonable than those posts, but still incredible performance. I'm not saying you're wrong or lying, just a little skeptical. Have you measured the standard deviation of your returns? Have you backtested your strategy during different market regimes?
Thanks, mind sharing your Annual RoRs?
Interesting! Any "must-watch" bookmarks that you would feel one should watch (or read)?
Libraries though. You should look up Steven Kotlers write up on the ROI of reading books. It‚Äôs pretty insightful and might change your take on books.
Thanks! Do I read this correctly that you do max 3 trades a day? Isn't that limiting when you trade across however many tickers? I mean - for some strategies it's absolutely fine, I'm just asking if that's sufficient for the ones you're running across all your tickers.
Important note: Pattern day trading only applies to accounts capable of trading on margin. If you have a cash account you can make more than 3 trades per day. To be clear, this isn't theory. I have done it for 4 1/2 years.
I'm a bit of a C++ elitist, but IMO for retail trading, Python is the way to go unless you need low latency. It's too easy to shoot yourself in the foot with C++ even with a team of devs, and shooting yourself in the foot potentially means bleeding money.
Thanks for the answer üëç
To kind of elaborate a little further, COIN RIOT and MARA will perform similarly, so it's unadvisable to run the same strategy on all 3, as if all 3 react the same way, you could potentially be in 3 losing positions at once.
> When you start getting into higher numbers, liquidity becomes an issue

So obvious you are LARPing just based on this comment alone. You literally said in this thread that you have pattern day trading restrictions on your account haha
Doubt it, we invented the majority of the models back in the 90s. We trade to fund our new ventures and educate where needed as financial literacy has gone down the tube. I presume you also use limited order book (LOB) models to dissect the volume smashing at the door at opening of markets?
This post should be in r/daytrading or another degenerate sub. But given the downvotes, I suspect there is a lot of leakage from those subs into here.

One of the rare times when I am proud of downvotes.
Yes, Alpaca let's you access your day trade # so the script checks if I'm at 3 and if I am it just trashes the signal. It has been difficult watching my paper account go up much faster than my live account.   
I use fundamental for determining which tickers to use, TA for the trades themselves. A strategy has a shelf like of 6\~ months so you have to keep up on that. For example AAPL is such an involatile stock I don't run strategies on it.
ML4T, baby!
Choppiness Index, determines how choppy the market is or if it's trending in a direction
Rate of Directional Change

Thank you!!
The most max drawdown I'll allow is 8% (on an individual ticker) otherwise I find another ticker. I use Tradingview's deep backtesting tool so as far back as that allows. It trades on the 1 minute timeframe so I haven't been super concerned about the macro regime and I use a couple indicators to determine the current trend direction to determine trade direction and volatility for avoiding whipsaws. If the market isn't performing how I'd like it won't enter a trade and I constantly change out tickers.
30% this year, but I'm hoping to push it further this next. Replaced a couple indicators with newer ones that seem to be more reliable
I've picked up a lot of little things over time, but no one in particular stands out. There was a post on here a couple weeks ago that compiled the most important posts on this subreddit. That's a very good read
It's not enough :(, but hopefully I can get over the limit soon
PDTP is 3 day trades a *week* not a day :)
This is true, I'd also mention that your cash takes 2 days to settle on stocks, though options cash settles next day.
Yeah the issue with Cash accounts is that you have wait 2 days for the cash to settle. I get it skirts day trading, but a lot of the time the positions don't close in a day so I get to keep that trade. Preference I suppose
But not with the same money; only settled cash.¬†
I personally haven't run into latency issues, but I'm not running arbitrages or playing with a large amount of money, so it works fine for me.
did you keep reading?
Absolutely not I just watch number go up.
OK, Thomas Bayes.

In other news, Isaac Newton cancels gravity over Patent dispute with local cider farm.

>*A strategy has a shelf like of 6\~ months*

This is something I don't understand. Is this some ICT/trader talking point or is there actual merit to this? 

Strategies certainlt don't work forever, but why the 6months? Especially if it's a unique method. I mean you've been profitable for 1yr and assuming you kept the same general approach, this breaks away from the narrative right? 

I understand markets get more efficient with time, we're implying trading is becoming less profitable with time/increase in # of profitable traders (which I can agree with but not the 6month thing tbh)
ML4T FTW baby!
Do you use the default parameters?
Any chance you have that saved to share?
Ah and there it is. I told OP that he could get T+0 with a cash account but i guess that is only with options as that is all i trade... that said, it did change to T+1 for all US securities earlier this year.
Have you ever tracked the settling time on a cash account? It's been a while, but I have and what I found was that all my trades were settling in T+0 (easily verifiable within the account) and that's when I realized T+2 is how much time they have to settle your trade NOT how much time it actually takes AND even that was reduced to T+1 earlier this year... Maybe it's broker dependent or there is some other variable involved that I am missing, BUT everyone should test out how long it actually takes to settle a trade via a cash account with their broker.
Do you have any idea how much is takes for liquidity to be a problem in arbitrage trades? Hint, it‚Äôs probably at least 1000x your entire portfolio‚Ä¶

By all means keep gambling but I would strongly suggest taking your profits and stop thinking you are a genius day trader‚Ä¶
Petty petty petty petty. Bravo. 

Would you have wanted to live the life of Isaac Newton? 

I much rather would have followed the footsteps of Jan Oort or Claire Patterson. 

But in regards of Bayes, you won't find a bayesian model at a regulator and a you won't find a frequentist model at FO desk.

Oh sick! looked into this years ago so it's nice to see it's viable.
I don't think you read this thread at all, I constantly make references to how inept I am. Yes I also don't have a large portfolio. Did your girlfriend break up with you or something?
Yes, I am. Working or courses 7 and 8 right now
Ty!!
Read through all of them. Good stuff. Big takeaway for me is to look into trailing orders instead of volatility-adjusted brackets.
Someone else pointed out that settlement is longer for stocks than options. I only trade options so you may only be able to get t+1... still probably worth checking to see how long it takes them to settle the cash.
I‚Äôm just trying to give you advice to stop before you blow up your portfolio.
Would you say it's worth it compared to say, an in person masters? Especially while working fulltime? Thx
Thanks! I've done that before, I think I've included enough checks at this point to avoid that, but currently not considering stopping.
I should also note, if you want to move up in industry, I think the online version is better from and opportunity cost perspective (while continuing FT employment). If your goal is a PhD or academia, then on campus is likely, in my view, the better option.
For me, it has been perfect. the cost and flexibility of schedule fits everything i needed. at my phase of life and in my career, in person would bot have been an option. Also, the cost being so low by comparison to in person has made it additionally attractive, because as of right now, i am a hobbyist in comp sci and software dev.  My day to day employment is about the furthest thing from tech you could think of in the financial field.
feel free to dm me any questions
Good to know thanks.. I am an undergrad senior weighing my options on how to proceed.

Idk if you'd know but do you know if I were to apply to the online school (OMSCS) I could still apply to the on campus school?
Hi, I've heard many great things about GT online masters program! How difficult is it getting in? And if I may ask what are you studying and why? And how hard are the classes compared to the other uni's? ty

I'm sorry but that is the most obvious chart setup for a drop - you savages support a long on that overly pumped nonsense?!
Can someone ELI5?
No .... "Guh"?
Don't fight the Fed
I wonder if there is genuinely AI analyzing tone of voice in these announcements at this point.
They were pulling out because of uncertainty not his choice of words

Good, but not a great afternoon I guess
Leave stocks and crypto alone if this is how you react to market flux. The market will flux day in and day out. This kid doesn't have the stomach for it. Get a new hobby, or stop trying to fund your life with it.
ü§£
r/watchpeopledieinside
This dude is long? That‚Äôs not the reaction to have in a winning or losing trade. Don‚Äôt be like this guy. Also, holding a position into a guaranteed volatility but unknown outcome is gambling.
Yup
 Why tho ?
I‚Äôve heard that algorithms trade based on all info including inflections. No idea if this is true of course. But seems to check out. üòÜ
Someone gets it.

Down atrocious
JPow has you by the balls
Shoulda started with a fuck you
it rocketed the next day wut
I laughed so hard at that. I ended up scalping a couple G during that meeting, but I know exactly how that guy is feeling, though.
Press conference = sell
I vote that he start with "Fuck your puts, regards" clearly telling us its directed for us and giving us a direction.

Opens the Wendy‚Äôs application app.
You are supposed to sell before he talks. Then wait first move. Honestly I traded quite well that day. If only I could do that everyday lmao
Wow this kid is worried because he‚Äôs doing forex and there‚Äôs a little price movement? Lmao homie better get thicker skin if he‚Äôs going to be doing forex
Did the harsh winter not affect the orange harvest?
Hahahaha
The cold weather has apparently *not* affected the orange harvest.
"live" actually can be up to 20 seconds behind real time. Enough lag for some sneaky traders to profit from that
This right here ladies and regards is a PhD thesis of this sub. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
blame yourself being a regard !
you can always sell before the meeting !
this is why i don't play the earning games, 
i go casino to gamble, it's more fun !
GUH! moment
Someone knew and put the tissues there for crying? Or other things?
‚ÄúGood afternoon‚Äù should put the fear of god in you
this is what this sub for. dank memes while we are all dreading
Yeah that pattern was begging for a drop
Why? Does he always say that before a rate increase or something?
Why ppl trade on conferences, this is fucking gambling
He should've started talking about [post office boxes](https://youtu.be/uFpK_r-jEXg?si=-X4f9YMWhyZWg2uj)
Yeah and no one made out except the sellers.  Who saw that coming.

Good lord, what was he holding?
When will ppl learn not to trade during news
That is the funniest shit I've ever seen.
Who could have guessed that sometimes in gambling you lose??
It sure was,maybe he needs to start off with a little smile

Hedge baby, hedge!

It was always about the puts and calls. Always has been. 
Always will be.
Just put in your stop losses before your trade and hear the two fastest open and close alerts in the universe and be thankful you didn‚Äôt lose more.
Jpow! Likes to destroy!
"Live" TV is not really live anymore. There are delays of a few seconds for lots of reasons.

But the dude's chart is probably live.

So the chart is moving because of something that was said a few seconds earlier, but broadcast a few seconds later.

Like when you're at the bar and some dude (with a phone in his hands) shouts that his team scored, but you only see it on the TV a couple seconds later

What he doesn't understand is Powell let's his hf buddies watch the videos on no delay while the plebs get the delay.

You know there's a delay on the TV feed by a good few seconds. Lol
Is that direct market access or just a bucket shop app? They know leveraged junkies are watching, and they only need to move the price around in the middle of bid and ask to mess people up, lol.

Run the stops, Jim. Yes, sir!!!
Lol
Why?
Can‚Äôt be further from the truth, amen.
It's a game to stock manipulators.  They use events like Powell's briefings to give them cover to manipulate in their favor.  When you finally understand that, you will see it more frequently.
Does anyone know what app he‚Äôs using to track the market by the seconds? Sorry, new investor here
Everytime somebody tells to get into the stock marker I‚Äôm showing them this.
He had you at hello
Regard gambled jpows speech.
Get got a purple tie aswell
Thats why People use STOP LOSS when risk is high so you dont crash
I have no sympathy when someone loses their money from gambling
This is why the stock market is nothing more than a scam.
I‚Äôm a complete beginner and have absolutely no experience with stocks bonds or trading but I am interested in learning so excuse this dumbass question. How does this work? Do people just mass-sell on purpose without an actual economic reason? How can a person simply speaking or putting out a tweet drop the price on a stock? Would love a basic explanation and plz forgive me once again as I have no experience in this field üôÅüòá
I think this is good. it‚Äôs good that our entire economy runs off of benevolent king who is appointed and not elected. it just makes sense to have one all powerful ruler tell us if we‚Äôre going to be rich or poor.

Usually if you don‚Äôt get the joke, it was never meant for you.
Fake news. He also said "fuck your puts, too" after that
He actually said "fuck your positions, it's sideways from here on out".
It depends where you‚Äôre watching it from, this is the dubbed version. I think you got you saw the original live broadcast.
Fake as fuck.

It was the morning.
It was the purple tie indicator
Market priced in his 'good afternoon' so it immediately sold off the moment he said it

Jokes aside it's because it already went past daily RSI and priced in everything positive he's going to say, so big boys started offloading and repositioning just in-case he says something bad while also killing all the 0dte atm calls. It recovered in the next 2 days.
He said it with a tired face, quiet voice.
TA goes out the window with any big market moving news events, otherwise, it‚Äôs worth taking time to find at minimum the strong support and resistance levels.
Eh hem.  Allow me to explain.  
  
The one line crossed that other line, so you lose all your money.
You‚Äôre like a guy on the beach when they blew up that whale. Whale chunks and blood just spraying everywhere and you turn to the guy next to you and say, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt wait for all the weathermen here to explain this one.‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I would explain it, but you still wouldn't get it.  Would be a complete waste of my time honestly.
He‚Äôs just gambling on one of the lowest timeframes during a news event there is no TA here

All random Asian dudes are technically the ‚Äúsame guy‚Äù.¬†
Sell the news, a story as old as time
This happens every single time he speaks regardless of what he actually says.  I believe it is heavily shorted right on the dot to make it look like a bad reaction however the following morning the market will often be in a completely different spot, just like the last time.
I like to think there's a guy in each wall street office staring intently at a TV all day yelling "BUY!!" or "SELL!!" and everyone else's job is to just sit and wait for his cue
Every news starts with a drop the rest depends on if the news are good or bad
JP is never that nice, people figured he had bad news for us..
Honestly, it depends on how he ends it. Im bullish on -a. And bearish on -er.

Ooh, that makes a lot of sense. It's also just cheap karma farming because it's basically just an excuse to repost obvious jokes.

Not 100% sure. But i think I get it
- Jerome Powell is the old guy on the TV
- Jerome Powell is the chairman of the federal reserve
- algo traders tune into Powell‚Äôs speeches in real time and react
- eg this could be based on sentiment, etc, as the fed has ability to adjust interest rates and interest rates have big impact on market
- some random dude has his phone open with some stock open
- lots of people who don‚Äôt know anything are trading stocks and overleveraged options because they think they know something that they probably don‚Äôt
- the joke is something as trivial as saying ‚Äúgood afternoon‚Äù impacted markets and lost the dude a lot of money on his position

I hadn't thought about it consciously before, but yea there has definitely been a MASSIVE increase in the amount of /rPeterExplainsTheJoke Posts that I've been seeing near the front-page in recent months.

Even just a year or 2 ago I'd see a Post from those subreddits maybe once per month or so, nowadays I see ~3 Posts per day.
Nope some of us are just really stupid
Same with literally every sub. Every sub I follow is chock full of weird survey style questions.

What don‚Äôt you like about [product]?

How do you increase [something] without decreasing [another thing]?

Is a [thing] enough, or do I need [other thing]?¬†

Where is the best place to [do something]?

When do you [do something] when [another thing] happens?

At first I thought it was general reddit neuroticism, but stepping back and observing multiple very unrelated subs, I realize it‚Äôs just scripted QA scraping answers about things to train LLM.
Is it really possibly that instantaneous? I've seen crypto move like that...  But never the stock market.

Wtf do i even google when seeing this as a not american person? Who is this guy that is speaking?
It's worse than that. Karma farmers post extremely obvious things and pretend not to get it because it baits engagement.

Technical Analysis, kinda like horoscopes for traders
analysis of the stock market lines to give insight into how the market will behave in the future 

There is mixed evidence on whether it works any better than random decision-making. 

I think high-level institutions with entire teams of analysts with advanced degrees and decades of full-time experience probably do gain some sort of small edge. But random guys with a $100k account and a 200 millisecond lag probably are just gambling and the survivorship bias is on full effect.
I wouldn‚Äôt get it. I promise.
Couldn't respond to the other comment, so I'm placing it here.

I don't trade stocks. Stocks is a different beast altogether. Stocks require a lot of knowledge of the market in general, a different type of fundamentals and a different kind of sentiment than FX. I don't know anything about it, and I'm not interested in it either. I trade XU exclusively and I consistently have a positive PnL.

I have watched XU in action on a daily basis for a very long time. I haven't said anywhere that I don't lose sometimes. That's part of trading. XU has a unique behaviour that can be read fairly accurately, especially _after_ the news releases that have a high impact, because it has an almost 1:1 correlation with DXY. People generally combine TA with FA and SA, and that's necessary, if you're staying in trades for an entire day or more extended period of time. I don't do that. I scalp shorter movements, rarely longer than 20 minutes. Those movements can be predicted fairly accurately based on the general behavior of the instrument.

I don't understand why people have such a hard time understanding this. It's not rocket science, and it's right there in front of you. It's a combination of market structure, price action and a lot of experience with a single instrument. I find pattern recognition fairly easy, and I'm not talking about double tops and double bottoms kind of bullshit, I'm talking about identifying unique recurring behaviours of said instrument. Such as, when pivots generally happen, how far they tend to pull back, and how far they tend to stretch. Nothing else is important because this covers the E, SL and TP. The biggest mistake people make is applying general rules to every instrument they trade. What works on one instrument probably won't work on another instrument.

I'm not sure why you're trying to convince me that what I'm doing isn't working. Am I dreaming right now lol? I guess MetaTrader is glitching.

Trading their way to try get some üêà
well it can matter, ie. a .50% cut WAS a surprise when .25% was expected but the whole point of this post is making fun of how the market has irrational reactions before he even speaks.  so the solution is to ignore it unless you are taking dumb super short term positions.  So stop checking your phone for constant minute by minute updates.  if you ignored the market for the past two weeks for example, you would have been better off.  but you're in here learning from compulsive gamblers betting like it's a horse race, not from investors.
this is more advanced economics
Imagine him walk in wearing a tracksuit, Durag, and a 14g blunt in his hand. He doesn‚Äôt say anything for 5 secs. Just pulls out a zippo and lights up. *first drag* *exhale* no cough at all. He looks directly into the camera and says ‚Äúmy -as‚Äù
Prolly dip, rewind, then go up instead
As someone mentioned if its ends with -err the market would nuke ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
Who can give him a pass? Anyone? Anyone?
Oooops I see who I am dealing with here....farewell brother.
No it was not pre arranged it was just a matter of habit that someone recognized.

This is Jerome Powell, president of the stock market and planet Earth's economy. The whole market moves based on his good afternoons. It's all in the intonation. Good afternoon! (Fuck your puts) makes the market go up. Good afternoon...(Fuck your calls) does the opposite.

Yeah, it's got an interesting history.

Here's a rather good podcast on it.
I used to work on the CME and CBOT trading floors for 15 years. That shit is exactly how it was and it would go right back up just as fast sometimes. Some of the craziest shit I‚Äôve ever seen happened on those floors.
I've tried to trade on news before, by the time I notice it there's always already been a huge move and if I try to jump in it reverses as people take profit
Reverse image search the TV
Dawg the context is the graph on his phone going red. You don't have to know literally anything before going into this video to get the joke.
I would do an image search of the dude on the tv, I think that would give you sufficient information to go off of

Google en passant
If you‚Äôre being serious, this is Jerome Powell. He‚Äôs the chairman of the US Federal Reserve. I assume this was when he announced cuts to interest rates.
He's just a random old dude who got through security by wearing a suit and acting like he belonged.
Edit: I have been made aware that people get this post recommended even without being on this sub, so I changed my comment

~~How can you be on a trading focused sub and not know who the head of the American central bank is? If you don‚Äôt care about finance/economics you likely wouldn't know who Jerome Powell is, even if you are American. If you are into finance and economics, you should definitely know who he is, regardless of your nationality given the importance of both the dollar and the American stock market. I doubt that the average European knows who Christine Lagarde is. This has nothing to do with nationality~~

It's less about being American, and more about being interested in finance and economics. The average American is as unlikely to know who Jerome Powell (Chair of the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the US, and the guy in the video) is as the average European to know who Christine Lagarde is (President of the European Central Bank). If you are into finance and economics, you will definitely know who Jerome Powell is, regardless of your nationality due to the influence of the American economy and the dollar. Monetary decisions in the US have knock-on effects in many other economies due to the interconnectedness of the global financial system.
Well first of all, I'm not talking about this post I was referring to a different sub, and this might be had 1% that's justified.¬†


Second, you can reverse image search a still of the guy speaking and you'd very quickly find out he's chair of the federal reserve and hopefully can put together the joke of the stock market overreacting to his words.¬†
Worse than that, it's to train AI
Modern version of Facebook posts that say "I'll bet you can't name a city either the letter "A" in it."

Yeah I gotem on my car!
Even the expensive hedge funds don't beat buying and hold an S&P 500 index fund. Since 90% of daytraders lose money and one can come to two different conclusions from the same chart using TA, I'd say it's safe to say that TA doesn't work lol
‚Ä¶.
Except if you were you wouldn't need to post on Reddit to get some validation you were doing the right thing by showing it to people you want to think you're cool.
r/catdistributionsystem is rather robust with solid continuity
Yup. They don't teach this at the Wendy's. You gotta go to the red lobster for this level of economics.....oh wait.

The prostitute outside the clam chiming in. The joke is porn. Prostitute out
Your account doesn‚Äôt have enough porn
I remember when it was a dude explaining jokes as a user, then the sub took off, then it really tanked. I really enjoyed it early on
This is great, thank you!
thanks for posting this, im gonna check it out.
Holy hell
Nooooo don't train the AI
Reddit is like TikTok and Instagram now and serves you shit you didn‚Äôt sub too. Hence why I‚Äôm here
They are probably here from r/all like myself
I was checking the popular section of Reddit and stumbled upon this post.
I'm just here for the memes and loss-porn. Don't give a shit who might be the head of the American central bank.
Regard moment
As he scurried back into the walls
the whistles go WOOOO
As opposed to anyone else to share their gains or ideas? Why does one have to exclude the other? Why can't you do well and share it without being bashed for it? God, this place really gets worse by the day. Fuck off then, won't share shit then.

Really, I'm deeply sorry I tried to be helpful and show a perfectly working strategy around how to trade the news. I guess _traders_ on wsb are allergic to anything but fucking gambling.

I"m new to this sub.  Pray tell what do these seemingly random numbers mean after some posts?
You know you‚Äôre regarded when you know exactly WTF this means. üòÇ
ah damn didn't know
Yeah, it escaped my mind that people see the posts without being actively on the sub, thanks for pointing it out. I edited my comment
Yeah, I edited my comment a bit; but out of curiosity, why would you be into loss-porn w/o being into trading?
It‚Äôs just for decoration maaan, it‚Äôs only decoration
Totally rational responses include things like "perfectly working strategy" seems like you're right at home...keep on keeping on

Don't deprive us of this perfect strategy...oh no what will we do *wrings hands*
It's an image

don't worry you can only see those if you're using new reddit and new reddit is for hippies and drug addicts
They say don't fight the FED right? So?
How can you be on Reddit when you don't even know how it works?
Lol it was nice of you to edit yet we can still see you were being a dick
Big number in the negatives makes me feel good about my small number in the positive. Don't want to play the game, loss-porn reinforces my decision, since I'd be the one posting it if I ever got into this.
Perfectly working strategy - Perfect strategy

Two different things, Copernicus.
I know. I was in the wrong, so I rewrote but didn't delete it because to me that felt like being disingenuous and not owning up to the mistake
W take, cant disagree with a word you said
Yes, looking back at a success can be called a perfectly working strategy when you pretend like you had a strategy going into it.  Or you gambled like the rest of the wsb people and came up with the DD to explain it after the fact when you hit it big and had to explain it to someone on Reddit to get your credit.

As I said if you had a perfectly working strategy you would content in your gains and you wouldn't need to prove to someone else they were wrong
I wasn't trying to prove anyone else wrong, nor do I need anyone else's or your validation to know my strategy works because I've been doing it a long time. But then we have people like you who project their own behavior as a textbook standard on others. Just because you think it's all about validation and looking cool, doesn't mean everyone else does. The primary comment made a remark about TA, in a way of it being an invalid way of trading the news. I was showing that it's not invalid at all, if you know how to apply it and understand how a particular instrument reacts to the different news events.

I use TA primarily as a confluence trading XU. It has a repeating almost identical effect _almost every single time_. Stands to reason I'd place my trades exactly the same way I do, every time the news comes, because it works. Isn't that what a strategy is? Finding an edge based on high probability setups? My biggest mistake was sharing it on Reddit. This works for me, no matter what your opinion on the matter is. See how that works? You can keep writing here and make clever comments, but the end game is that I win my trades on the news using pure TA, and you're a keyboard warrior.
An actual post by the firm‚Äôs recruiter on LinkedIn 
I couldn‚Äôt think of anything else I‚Äôd rather want to celebrate the end of busy season than some pizza!
The jokes write themselves
Why is it always pizza? Why can't we have Korean fried chicken  on something.
At least my firm had the courtesy to take us out to a restaurant and lubricate me with a couple margaritas this afternoon lol
I feel like a partner saw how much we talk about pizza parties in a sarcastic way and thought ‚Äúthe staff clearly love pizza with how often it‚Äôs talked about!‚Äù
imagine finishing a busy season, walking into a break room and seeing that fuck ass A4 sized live love laugh poster stare at you while you grab a paper plate from the garbage liner covered table. You go to open the only box of "roni" and its all gone cause Linda from HR wanted to take a couple slices home for her kid. I would end it
OMG- that‚Äôs so bad. 

We all log off at 12pm on 10/15- then we go to a swanky restaurant with a catered sit down multi course meal apps and unlimited alcohol. Then an after party with more alcohol, all paid by the firm
Love the sign in the background

iN tHiS oFFIce We dO ~FrIeNdShIp~
imagine posting this as some kind of flex. i hate corporate bs.
It‚Äôs still daytime. If my Forvis days were any indication, they are a LONG way from being done
This would make me more depressed¬†
Who did the ordering!?!

2 PLAIN

2 BBQ (barf, seriously)

2 pepperoni

1 Buffalo chicken

Prosciutto and arugula

Like, there's 3 good pizzas here. I hope not many people are working there.. lol

Whoever ordered this likely thinks that a family size bag of Funyuns is the right chip to bring too.. lol
Dude said ‚Äúweareforvismazars‚Äù like he is Optimus prime calling out Autobots.
Yes, they are all actually this tonedeaf.
I hate shitting on a nice gesture but holy fuck man... that is one depressing photo.
They literally did the joke, unironically, and posted it. Legendary
I must be the only person in the world who still gets happy when I get free pizza.
No bread sticks?
My buddy works there. 

I hang out with him every Friday for movie nights. He told me after the deadlines were done, he‚Äôs gonna drink himself into a coma this Friday and see how long it takes them to notice.
Accounting is a profession  that is just stuck in a vortex of never being able to culturally progress. Firms thinking pizza after people working non stop will make them want to stay in public is wild.
As fucked as it sounds I would welcome pizza on any of our tax deadlines but we only get a meal when its someone's birthday lol.
wait you guys get to celebrate?
tax assoc., got more work assigned to me today, unbelievable.  was really ready to "study for the CPA exam" for the next 3 months.
I am convinced they understand how insulting that is. The behavior is intentionally designed to break your spirit.
Honestly if you don‚Äôt like pizza parties you‚Äôre in the wrong career
There‚Äôs an accountant shortage!!!
Mazars is French. Why not good French food ??
Awesome, now we know who not to work for. This is a good post and I like knowing what companies to avoid.
I interviewed with forvis and didnt hear back yet :(
And you losers emphasize PA after graduation.
Dont let the picture fool you. There‚Äôs no pizza in the box.
This is why I always bring my protein and greens infused shake for lunch at work. It's quick, easy, and I don't spend the next 2 hours fighting the fatigue after a heavy meal (like 2 slices of pizza). Plus, most companies immediately default to the *cheapest* pizza place in the area that delivers. Which usually means the cardboard the pizza comes in tastes better than the contents.

I was born a pizza snob, and I'll die a pizza snob.
Lol they're self aware. They know what they're doing
Who needs RSUs at a Tech company like Nvidia or Apple when you‚Äôve got this banger lmao
When I worked in public, your lunch and dinner was on the company for the two weeks leading up to the deadline. Then you weren't expected back in the office until a week after the deadline. The team would usually go do something together too, like go bowling, laser tag, really anything they wanted on the day they all returned.
How you deliver appreciation is so important.  This picture lets you know how much effort they put into their job.  

I had a company give me tickets to a show on a Thursday night at 9 PM at the Fox Theatre.  I was a single dad with twin 5-year-olds at the time.
They fucking brag about this?

>Forvis Mazars, one of the nation's leading assurance, tax, and consulting firms, today announced revenue of $1,685,539,000 for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2023. This represents a growth rate of greater than 13% over the previous fiscal year and places Forvis Mazars as the eighth largest U.S. firm.

Where is your beverages to gargle your boss's balls out of your mouths?
We need an r/linkedincirclejerk, this is some top tier jerk material.
No joke.

Our company has no budget for social events so even the joke that is pizza parties is too expensive for us.
Sad as it is- better than my employer did- nada
Ours got us jersey mikes at least instead of pizza.
Are dinners not a thing anymore in the industry? My firm has always done dinners from the start to the end of busy season, from what I‚Äôve heard from peers it‚Äôs the norm, or at least was?
I‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôm not in tax anymore
At least you guys get pizza.  

Though I do appreciate the occasional vendor gift that includes food.
I'd rather go home early than get a free pizza
My old firm closes on 4/15 and spends the day drinking on the golf course followed by renting the clubhouse for dinner and open bar all night. Was a hell of a way to end tax season.
#Sad
Instead of profit sharing they do pizza sharing
The first CPA firm I worked for ordered PF Changs
My employer stopped the pizza party . Replace them with "Indigenous day" pot luck parties. Now we're expected to buy the food cook it and serve it. Dystopian days. I'm in Mansfield 30 miles down the road from Boston.
I'd certainly not want to celebrate with Forvis Mazars... I've had to process a bunch of k-1s that they prepared this year and they were all major pains in the ass üò°
No orange drink?
People complaining about free food has always kinda made me cringe. If you don't want any, don't take any. Someone was thoughtful enough to make it available, and it's usually not the guy or gal at the top who did. Myself, some free grub is nice. No need to bust Carol's balls for being thoughtful. hehe
This looks grim, like something from a Warsaw Pact nation in its final days. The FDJ-blue tablecloth and propaganda on the wall really hammer it home. Just need a framed picture of the managing partner from the 1960's to complete the scene.

Enjoy your Buff, Roni and Proc + Ahao.
I think I'd quit.¬†
Mazars sucks!
BIGFOR treats people right.
So dumb
Hard work with pizza? What cheapasses
This is so depressing‚Ä¶
Specialty pizza - ballin out of control
Better than Little Caesar‚Äôs I guess. I had a manager bring that in once.
So sad
I could eat pizza everyday mate
Chipotle catering worked well and didn‚Äôt make us feel like like crap besides the restroom visit an hour later
The jokes aren‚Äôt jokes anymore
At least take them out for dinner and drinks. GTFOH with the damn pizza
The blue tablecloth really adds a festive touch
Just reached home after my manager gave us a pizza party as the busy season just ended.
To make matters worse, the pizza probably had pineapple as a topping.
They don't even have a table big enough to spread the pizza boxes out?  So you have to move boxes to get slices of the one you want?
WHOOOOO PARTY
The sign in the back saying we do caffeine üòÇ
A $100 bill as everyone walks out the door and you have the rest of the week off works much better.  But u need a partner that doesn‚Äôt give a shit about the other partners bitching at them for being to nice.
If ur not wanting to be an accountant by age 9, don‚Äôt bother
Why can't we get some actual catering or something?
bloody hell thats depressing as fuck
The lack of self-awarness is stunning
Look! They also have a blue tablecloth that matches the color of their logo! So cheerful! I don't need a pay raise now!


/s for the idiots
üíØ for honesty.
Ooh a tablecloth! So much care and effort! I can almost not see through it too!üòç
Nice of them to use a blue tarp as decoration
2 Slice maximum!
So sad
I‚Äôm not seeing the problem with them giving their employees pizza boxes full of cash bonuses
Give enough money to your employees to pay rent and buy groceries to celebrate, most importantly and sincerely, fuck your pizza party.
Do they have cheese only though?
wait, Sweet Tomatoes still exists? damn. I miss that place.
Didn‚Äôt expect to see my favorite pizza place just scrolling Reddit today. I don‚Äôt have anything to add other than to say Sweet Tomatoes is GAS.
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
why is this so damn funny? our firm did the same thing lol  I swear someone needs to make a movie
We got nuthin
OP ‚Ä¶. Is this why you left??!
Delicious! üçïüçï
U kids have no idea how good u have it
Dear lord at least take the staff out for a night on the town.
Looks like what we got when I was inducted into my school‚Äôs honors society ü§£
How to pizz Accounting off!?
No Hawaiian?
My firm does like a rotation of mexican, subs, pizza
HR doing HR stuff
I'd laugh if it wasn't true
If it doesn‚Äôt get me drunk, I‚Äôll still be thinking about how much I‚Äôm sick of busy season.

Glad I‚Äôm out of public now tho ü•∞
Funny enough, this is my old firm and everyone I met was pretty much a delight. I can't say the same where I am currently.
This is actively making me rethink that FM intern offer this summer

This is trashy
One good thing about Forvis is that I got a bluetooth speaker during a recruiting event, so that‚Äôs cool. This image makes me laugh
A better reward.  ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a gift card for a great pizza place, take the whole Friday afternoon off and have dinner with your family.‚Äù
Workers: ‚ÄúPlease, I can‚Äôt keep up with inflation. The profits have skyrocketed for you.‚Äù

Company: ‚ÄúHere, damn‚Ä¶ üò°‚Äù *cue LinkedIn post*
Forvis Mazars? More like fart-vis bizarre‚Ä¶

I can say that because I work there lol
Is this Alfredo‚Äôs cafe or pizza by Alfredo‚Äôs because they‚Äôre not the same
I‚Äôm so confused. Why is this bad or weird or funny?
Yesterday, to celebrate 10/15, we left the office early and today, I took the day off and went to the spa from 10am to 6:30pm. It was great lol
Its funny box retail stores give the same thing to all the temps that do inventory the night before they let them all go. I wonder if management here feels the same way
What‚Äôs the occasion? A bit out of the loop
At Deloitte we would get wasted on the firm's dime
I think I'm more horrified by the live laugh love poster on the wall of an office
Isnt Forvis actually a good firm? Atleast if you are beginning of your career
Yay free pizza...
Hard work pays off üí™üèª
Meanwhile the partners are celebrating with Lamborghinis, Michelin‚Äôs
The Boomer partners just assume that everyone wants pizza
Why do employers think they can throw us a ¬´¬†bone¬†¬ª of some cheap pizza at the end of a high stress deadline and think that is payment enough‚Äî- considering the fact everyone is salaried and all the fricken overtime worked nearly HALVED our hourly take home rate??

Come on! How about one-to-one hours worth of COMP time and/or a nice fat BONUS??

Anybody listening??
Pitty pizza I like to call it. Congrats for making the big kids money. Here‚Äôs your droopy slice that everyone touched and breathed on. But hey! Free pizza.
Is this an accurate picture of everyone that wants to be there?
Should have been adult beverages ...
Just have a dietary restriction and order glutton free vegan specialty dish.
Honestly, if you don‚Äôt like pizza parties you‚Äôre in the wrong career. üòÑ
2 of 8 plain pizza isn't a good ratio. Need at least 50% plain for general office pizza.
HR and recruiters will be the first against in the wall when the revolution occurs.
Oh my word they are so clueless üòÜ
I‚Äôd complain to HR that it wasn‚Äôt inclusive. I‚Äôm diabetic. Where is the KETO option? ü§£
Can confirm, that firm sucks. All they do is merge left and right, dump the influx of new client work on their seniors, pay them below market, and try to get you to not say anything by making you feel like you're about to lose your job at all times.

The smaller offices are not too bad though, alot of supportive seniors, managers, & even SMs helping out. But never go to one of the biggest offices of a small company.
Is this real? Did they delete the post cause i cant find it
Well, doesn‚Äôt that buffet look enticing!
"IN THIS OFFICE" on the wall.
No love for pineapple eh?
Did anyone say it yet?‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúAww come on, what‚Äôs in the box??!!‚Äù
Leave my glorious forvis alone üòì they are active on my university campus üòîüòî
It‚Äôs like the backrooms but worse
Take that pizza and show it up your HR ass.
100% they had the pie cut into 16 slices. Probably one mini slice a person
I learned a long time ago that I don‚Äôt have to eat the food they provide or if I do, I‚Äôll gain weight because it‚Äôs always carbs and fat lol. It‚Äôs totally ok to say no thank you :) I‚Äôm in the accounting department
This one truly does. So ironic that it's not ironic at all.
I‚Äôm never leaving this place.
I am not yet in accounting but I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I heard the ‚Äúpizza party‚Äù complaint on this sub! lol
> The jokes write themselves

I'm not sure how many people know.  But this is actually Trump's former accounting firm that withdrew their opinion on the audited financials they produced of the Trump Organization.
Correction: HR writes them for us, right before announcing layoffs for all of our hardwork
According to the movie Inside Man pizzas encourage people to sit together, single serve means people go sit by themselves. So for hostages ‚Ä¶. Pizza is a win.


Really I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs more like lazy efficiency. Most people like pizza so you get say 2-4 types, a generic salad, some bottles of soda, and are good to go.
Too expensive. Budget does not allow for anything other than pizza.
I've been in middle management, here's my reasons I went with some random pizzas:

1. I often had to pay for it out of my own pocket. Pizza is usually the best bang for your buck to feed a group easily. I wasn't high pay management, I had people under me that made more than me.

2. If you can't all eat at the same time it's one of the more forgiving foods to eat cool or easily reheated.

3. (Almost) everyone will eat pizza if you offer them some. I could order some with meat, some veggie, a vegan one, and everyone could have something to eat. If I were to order Korean fried chicken or whatever some people would complain and not eat it. They'll still complain about pizza but not as much.

4. I tried letting them all decide what food to get once when they complained it was always pizza and they argued most of the morning and couldn't agree on any other restaurant then finally decided back on pizza.

5. Even giving the choice of toppings would result in a lot of arguing as nobody could agree on what to get. Joe wants pepperoni and mushroom, Jim hates mushroom with his pepperoni and wants olives but Sarah hates olives. If I just ordered a variety though Jim would choose slices with mushroom despite refusing to get it if offered a choice when ordering.

Eventually you realize you can't make everyone happy with the budget you have available, but you still want to do at least something so you get a stack of random pizza and set it out for everyone.
Ya know what I‚Äôll take the pizza because my place keeps doing donutsüò∂
One time my previous firm ordered something other than pizza and people got food poisoning (supposedly from undercooked meat)
Sometimes my firm brings in other foods.  This month it was Indian
How do you feel about Jimmy John's and crumbl cookies? That's what our office did. üòÇ
Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza. Poor people love pizza. White people love pizza. Black people love pizza.
Pizza is probably the cheapest way to feed a large group of people.
Pizza is the classic microeconomic example. You can spend 30 dollars for a large pizza if you arent aware of the coupons but if you are aware of the coupons you can get the same pizza for 10. The supply and demand line exist differently for different people. In the case of PA you can almost guarantee they use the coupons because there is a low willingness to pay while also pretending it is a gourmet option since the same order could have been 3x the price.

Or it is someone with little to no self awareness setting this up.

Or both
My better half has to deal with these sad Co events and it comes down to what the broadest range of what people will eat.

Low/mid level pizza is something 99% of Americans will eat.

Korean? Too spicy. Anything not bland AF? Too _____

Go all out with fancy food trucks, or just Costco pizza - its all BS 'team celebration' time that only comes down to 'free food' for most.

The office pizza party is an interesting representation of where the US has fallen as far as productivity, and making shit worth caring about.

/stepsoffpizzabox
Or KFC
I love ordering pizza for group events. It‚Äôs so easy to just buy one pizza per 3-4 people and distribute leftovers. It‚Äôs way more work trying to buy actual sandwiches or fried chicken or something. Plus it‚Äôs usually cheaper & it makes the check signers happy. 

I get lots of complaints about too much pizza and someone on my team took ordering from me so we can get some variety lmao.
Pizza is really cheap for how much food you get and it's reliably delivered
Everyone likes pizza and it‚Äôs pretty cheap per person
I've worked with middle aged guys that got skidish about shawarma. People are surprisingly picky eaters. A quality I find pretty pathetic, unless you got something. But alot don't.
I would work so much unpaid overtime for Korean fried chicken!
I didn't get an offer but I did interview one place that does taxes and audit. They said the audit managers cook all day for tax filing weeks for all the tax people in the office. Like belgium waffles, eggs, bacon for breakfast, ribs and brisket for lunch, the works. I was like now that I can get behind. They're like yes we expect you here from 6am to 8pm but you will be fed and fed well the entire time.
Pizza is good even cold, which is true for very few other foods.
Our firm before tried other food before because people asked why is it always pizza. We had mixed grill once and  fried chicken & pasta the other time. I‚Äôll tell you, I think pizza is the best choice for those small office jobs events.
-its easy to eat, even standing up and requires less utensils
-most people are fine with pizza. We have colleagues who don‚Äôt eat meat or don‚Äôt like vegetables or don‚Äôt eat beef etc. and there‚Äôs a pizza flavor for them.
-it has the least amount of trash afterwards as compared to other food.
-
I love korean fried chicken
Pizza is cheap and requires little pre-planning.
Pizzas are infinitely divisible
Because pizza is just easy in group settings. It‚Äôs a hell of a lot easier to order like no I said I was at20 and all you focus on is toppings.
Back in the days when my uncle was Controller of a major medical industry business, they did Thai food, or high end Chinese, or sushi.
Thats what im saying! I want some burgers!
I'm ngl, I love office happy hours. Stay out to 2am getting hammered for free w some people who I've genuinely become friends with.
Right, at least wine and dine us before trying to fuck us
Yes lol mine took us to happy hour and bought us food and drinks.
This lmao, after something as stressful as that, the only thing I want is some alcohol, atleast some beer with that pizza would be nice
Nice!
"Hey ChatGPT - what's the #1 way to motivate accountants based on reddit posts?"
It's morbin time!
I mean, there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with pizza parties as a show of appreciation. Pizza is great! The problem is when the pizza party is the *only* way they show appreciation.

WE WOULD END IT. WE ARE A TEAM
Yeah wow this is depressing af
What beautiful prose.
Fuckin Linda
‚ÄúIn this office, we do caffeine‚Äù makes it sound like they‚Äôre snorting lines of caffeine powder from their desks or something.
This is truly a dystopian nightmare in an image
"well we had to invite HR too, it would be rude to eat without them"
Please immediately report to your department health counsel for a mental+risk assessment
Sounds about right.
üòÇüòÇ
Damn, your firm knows what‚Äôs up
Similar to us. Whenever the last return is out we all go hit up a local bar on the firm‚Äôs tab. Usually happens on 3/15, 9/15, and 10/15.
In B4 you are still sending returns at 11:30pm on 10/15.
"We're a family here"
The sign makes me want to dry heave. ~We Do CaFfEiNe!~
Hawaiian shirt fridays
"We do caffeine" sounds kind of ridiculous given the context. I mean it's accurate, but do they have to phrase it that way?
I mean it is definitely a flex. "Our workers made us millions and all these morons got were some cheap ass pizzas!" That is one hell of a flex tbh.
Lmao I used to work there
It's like The Office episode where Michael ordered subs with bologna and ketchup.
BBQ chicken is the best though
No, Roni means they are Macaroni pizzas. Ever since Little Caesars did it it's the latest craze
At least you didn't list pineapples.

DO NOT BAKE FRUIT. IT'S GROSS AND THE TEXTURE IS DEMONIC
The hell is a plain pizza anyway?
BBQ is the best...and I live in Memphis, where we have the BEST bbq pizza.
Pizza parties are great just not when they‚Äôre in lieu of a real dinner party, happy hour, or even worse, a bonus.
yeah im always down for pizza idc. im a simple guy, easy to please
Yeah provided the workplace is actually a good place to work, it's a plus. Last employer did a monthly barbecue, plus occasional pizza days. It was always optional, and those who wanted to attend were allowed to push their tasks off till later to make time (within reason). It wasn't some underhanded corporate ploy to get the staff to accept mistreatment.
Then you should ask your employer to pay you in pizzas and not dollars.
Every exploitative manager is breathing heavily, visibly sweating, and is rock hard from reading your Reddit simp porn comment.
Glad I could help :)
At our firm dinners were the norm until covid hit.  It never came back after restrictions were lifted though.
A mousetrap has free food
It is not about free food. The hard work they put in is rewarded with a cheap pizza rather than a wage increase or a bonus.
I actually like Little Ceasars. Maybe we grow up eating only that pizza.
It‚Äôs so good
It was due to work life balance 100% but its shit like this that shows how little they actually care about you
Weird sentiment since in comparison to CLA or CBIZ, FM has barely any M&A activity.
Yes, this was posted by one of the firm‚Äôs recruiters, not on the official company page. Would be wild if they posted that though
Defund HR!
Why would you leave an office where they... \*checks sign\*... do friendship?
Those statements were not audited financial statements.

Also, if you limit people to 1 slice, you can feed everyone for $2 each.¬†

#4 is the biggest...should #6 people will find a way to complain about something no matter what.
6. I have work to do too. I don't really have time to be a waiter for the team and take people's orders and if it's a significant meeting I'm also preparing for that meeting. I could delegate to other people, but they've got work too and I don't have a secretary or something to do that for me.
Preach. I‚Äôve gone non pizza multiple times and people still complain.
I understand and agree. I‚Äôm also one of the few who will refuse pizza, any type. Lactose intolerance and a solid sheet of mozzarella cheese do not mix well, vegan options are trash when there is such a bounty of food options without dairy. I‚Äôd fuck with some breadsticks and marinara in the corner tho. And the little pepperoncinis are all mine too.
The only thing you should pay out of pocket for is booze
Once saw an entire client BoD get food poisoning at a board meeting including our rep who was attending.

The venue tried to blame the caterer and the caterer tried to blame the venue.
There's a pot head working in admin services!
The follow up ‚ÄúDo black people like pizza‚Äù makes the scene
In what universe is this  perceived to be a ‚Äúgourmet option‚Äù or premium option of any sort?

Just wait til ur 35 with two kids
Yeah until they are mandatory and you have kids
Pass. Inside work hours I'm all for it. If it's extra curricular I'm taking my ass home lol
They are fine as long as employees are not voluntold to come
‚ÄúI heard you guys love pizza! It was really tough finding money to pay for these. Especially since we had NO money to give raises above inflation this year!‚Äù
WE DO FRIENDSHIP
We offer unlimited ‚Äúending it‚Äù as part of our benefits package
They have been doing this a long time- and being a smaller firm it‚Äôs not overly burdensome to find a nice place that can hold about 30 people.
We can‚Äôt on 9/15 or 3/15- too busy but we do 10/15 4/15. We also have a Christmas party which is similar and an August pre busy season appreciation party with significant others invited too as thanks ahead of time for putting up with busy season with us.
A very good reason not to go big 4. Many of our clients use big 4 too- or come to us after leaving big 4. We are pricy as heck but provide very good service for it- we specialize in international so not a whole lot of competition.
That's the type of office where you work in a cubicle next to a person for 2 years, and you've never once said a word to each other.
Sorry, I picture whoever handles the ordering must live on monster or mountain dew and just copious sodium to be this taste blind. 

All the grownups in the building fighting over that proscriutto and arugula.. lol
We all did
Yeah, exactly.
Granted, I haven't tried Sweet Tomatoes version, maybe that one is good. 

Most of the ones I've tried use the cheapest BBQ sauce imaginable, like Great Value BBQ sauce, just tastes like a weird corn syrup and chemical glop.
WHAT?!? 

I mean, granted, I would try a slice of macaroni pizza. I've never tried one before. 

So, this place didn't order even one regular pepperoni pizza?
Accountants do NOT need that many carbs.
There is nothing better than a bite of warm juicy pineapple alongside a crispy piece of bacon swimming in a sea of gooey cheese.
Cheese pizza would be my guess, so a vegetarian can enjoy something as well.
That I do agree with, more so the bonus. It should never be in lieu of that. I know you hear the meme online, but has anyone ever had a company actually say we were going to give you a bonus but instead are doing this pizza party? I highly doubt it‚Ä¶
People get so defensive when people talk about this topic and I have no idea why. I didn‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt want to be compensated for my work with dollars. I said I still get happy when I get free pizza.
I‚Äôm easy to please. Must be why I have done well in my career.
Because obviously the $100 in pizza is being done *instead* of a raise of several thousands of dollars per employee.
Funny of you to assume I actually work hard. hehe
In this instance, my manager was bragging to us about how cheap it was to throw this pizza party.
2 years ago they were BKD / DHG. Now they're Forvis (actual merger). Then they became Forvis Mazars (really just glorified praxity alliance).

I'm not mad that they merged, Crowe did that when they were Briggs & Veselka. My complaint is they'll do this massive merger, take on much more complex client work, and dump it on their seniors without hiring more people. And the seniors getting overworked aren't even getting paid market prices, let alone above market. It's embarrassing.
Yeah i was just dumbfounded. Not too dumbfounded though. My experience (different office) was similar. They just threw food at you to keep you in the office and their idea of office culture was being able to wear street clothes to the office on saturday and sunday. True story.
Hope AI will replace them all soon.
Not exactly.  I just think Mazars has a bad track record.  [https://www.accountingweb.co.uk/business/financial-reporting/bdo-and-mazars-slammed-for-unacceptable-audits](https://www.accountingweb.co.uk/business/financial-reporting/bdo-and-mazars-slammed-for-unacceptable-audits)
That‚Äôs way too cheap. I‚Äôve seen Jurassic Park, can‚Äôt under feed the staff if you want to keep your arm.
Less, if you divide one pizza to 12 kid slices instead of 6/8 slices.
If you get pepperoni hot and ready pizzas from little Caesars, they are a jaw droppingly cheap 6.99 here, cheapest large pizza by 5 dollars. You can serve each person 1 pizza for roughly 87 cents a piece.
Yeah bro it's me. üòù
Once you hit 40, there's a two beer maximum on any given night. The hangover + screaming kids in the morning is **never** worth it.

The firm I was at was like a family. But it was more like a 1960s family where you heard about sexual misconduct about one of your uncles that there was never any punishment for. You knew not to go near him but also always wondered why he was still invited to Thanksgiving.
Been there, done that.
maybe go to a real pizza place and not papa johns?
I honestly don't know lol. But I'd be disappointed to open the box and find out it's NOT macaroni
Yes there is. Literally everything pleasurable ever experienced in the entire universe for all time is better than that.
Add jalape√±os to this mix and you‚Äôve got a slice of heaven, literally!
"we short changed you on your yearly raise, but remember all the free pizza we gave you?"
Newsflash. There is no such thing as free pizza.
We were missing the JP scene where Hammond announces that the pizza party is cancelled since they didn‚Äôt hit their launch window and Nedry making up his mind
Does anybody else do this?
* Apply for positions that list 20-30k under market for the position.. I apply knowing I'm overqualified..
* They call or message immediately for a phone screen and ask salary expectations.
* I ask them what their budget is.. and they respond with the low number listed. I tell them "Isn't that too low?" or "Oh no, that is way too low."

I've been doing this on and off. Need to give them feedback.
Not all heroes wear capes.
Honestly, imo, everyone should be doing this... they're wasting everyone's time.. I don't have a problem wasting theirs. 

&#x200B;

I have 2 scheduled phone screens this afternoon.
Doing the lords work, bless you
How do they respond?
I like to attach my salary to the spot price of gold. That way if they hedge it right there's a savings.
I got an erection just from reading this.

You sexy things
Dropped this üëë
Just saw a position for half of what my pay is that I‚Äôm thinking about applying for just to try this.  It‚Äôs 70-93k for accounting manager for a city with a $1B budget.  I get that it‚Äôs government but come on, has 2 direct reports and 9 indirects‚Ä¶
"we pay $18-25/hour"

"Oh, so 18. No thanks"
Talking to people (especially without needing to) gives me anxiety so no, but thank you for your work üôè
Just saw a staff accountant position in a SaaS for 65k and they won‚Äôt even let you continue the application if you don‚Äôt check the I have a CPA checkbox. Delusional
I do this too.
Thank you for your service
Nice
I have and will continue to do this!
Lmao, only in this profession would people still defend an employer for offering an under market salary.
I‚Äôm applying now as a recent graduate. Thanks for this, and the double benefit is that when I see 30-50 other applicants, I can hope they are all people like you gassing me up. It has been a tough time applying, but I think I applied at THE position for me this morning. Cross your fingers for me and good luck to everyone else!
Doing the lords work.
Yes I do it occasionally. Are you sure you are looking for an accounting manager, because that was my salary as a Senior Accountant 10 years ago there must be some mistake‚Ä¶

I once had a contract replacing a Senior Accounting Manager, and they posted a job for a Senior Accountant to run intercompany, AP, and Fixed assets. Complex organization. The guy I was reporting let me know all somber because the contract could end anytime, I said I saw the posting don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll be here for quite a while. Contract went for 14 months until Covid crushed the hotel business and they got purchased by another company (guessing they were in sell mode anyway hence the absurd let‚Äôs get a Senior Accountant to do this move)
Eff outside recruiters. They are leaches on the profession sucking money out that should rightfully be paid to staff. 

They encourage you to jump ship and switch jobs frequently using the same trope about work/life balance. They get paid more frequently the more people move around. Used car salesmen trying to earn a commission.
Saw a senior accountant position requiring 5 years of experience for $65k, total joke

Thank you for your service
I do this too, can I get upvotes pls
I just applied for a position that the pay range  was already very low, but I was like you know what its fully remote and I like the company, 2 interviews later they came back with an offer that is 20 % bellow the lowest in the range, Im overqualified as well, wth is going on !!!
Hey I did this!  I called about a job that was in line with my previous job‚Ä¶ and their max offer was $100k lower than my salary! So I told them that. ‚ÄòGood luck finding someone at that price.‚Äô I was nice about it though. As nice as you can be telling someone they‚Äôre off their rocker.
Im being contacted for positions with lower salary not the other way around üòÇ. At times its good, so that you will know the market rate.
this is borderline sociopathic behavior but i love it
I like this.  Also, whenever i see an ad for something for sale that indicates ‚Äúserious inquiries only‚Äù. I get the urge to call up with a bunch of ludicrous questions that are clearly not serious ü§£
Pure alpha behaviour
Doing god‚Äôs work
What a lovely accountant
God bless! üòÅ

Appreciated from all accountants
Dog you‚Äôre basically our Batman
That's funny! Keep doing it, please.¬†
Literally did this today. They wanted a senior accountant with 6 yoe at b4 in HCOL for 70k lmao. That‚Äôs under what A1 makes now where I am‚Ä¶
This is actually really good to do, eventually management will ask why they couldn‚Äôt bring your badass profile on board. Recruitment will say it was due to low salary, and if enough candidates do this the company will raise the entry rate for the position. 

KEEP doing this and making jobs equitable.
We need an AI that does this all day every day
Great idea
Good man!
I get lots of requests from recruiters on LinkedIn. I always tell them that way too low and hang up.
I‚Äôm gonna do it lol
Bless you king.
You are a gentleman and a scholar
I usually respond to recruiters when the role doesn't offer flexible working, even hybrid where it's 3 days a week in the office I'll say I'm not interested purely because of that in the hopes it makes a difference.
I get so many LinkedIn messages for jobs. Since I‚Äôm in California, if they post the job description, it usually has the range. 

Even if I‚Äôm not applying, I will tell them the range is far too low and that I pay seniors more than what they are asking for a manager role.
Post some of the job postings!
Are you commonly seeing them give you the budget for the role up front or are you asking for it in the screening call?
Nope
"Does anybody else do this?"

Proceeds to explain the most specific task I would never think to do. I don't even have the time to think of something so specific.
Wow, that‚Äôs one way to flip the script!
Pretending to take jobs is hilarious.  You should post your responses.
You are so helpful. And have too much time on your hands.
I have one scheduled today lmaoo
I turned down an offer that paid $10k less than I was currently making. I was like good luck feeling that position, especially when your benefits are horrendous on top of shit pay (5 pto days, $300 a month for health insurance, and fully in office).
I've gotten a few messages/calls/smoke signals about similar positions that pay "up to" my current salary. I've gotten in the habit of letting them know 1) I already earn that, and 2) I'd be happy to consider a role that pays about $30k-$50k more. I've gotten traction a couple of times, but usually they back down.
I'll do this. Thanks for the idea!
Realistically you could wait until after the interviews so you could get that as free practice?
This is amazing.
I go through the entire hiring process then let them pick me then throw out an outrageous number after they‚Äôre madly in love with the idea of having me on staff.
Do you honestly believe that your feedback is going to change anything?  Why would you apply to jobs for which you are overqualified only to give them your feedback which won‚Äôt change a damn thing?  Waste of everybody‚Äôs time.  You should be thrilled they posted the salary (obviously some states here in the US make them).  You used to HAVE to waste your time to find out they were under market, now you can choose to just pass them up and not waste your time‚Ä¶.and you choose to fuck around?  You have way too much time on your hands
Don't apply for jobs like that. Apply for jobs that fit your salary range if they post it. If it isn't there, and they contact you for screening, ask right away before even proceeding to do a phone screen. If it doesn't align with what you want you can walk away. Do not believe anyone at the company who says it's rude to ask for salary upfront. They are just gaslighting you into getting lowballed. That's not an employer you want to work for. It is totally acceptable to ask for salary that's an important part of why we work, to make money and support ourselves.

Apply for jobs that fit your salary range. I applied for a job that required 2 years of analytical experience. I don't but I now have an interview tomorrow.
Stop it. They just like the attention.
This is amazing. Props.
I love you lol
Sadly their reaction is becoming ‚Äúoh damn! We can pay an entire team in India for that price!!‚Äù
I work in government and recently found out that our HR documents all instances of this. After a certain number of them is when they (HR) will start considering that a higher rate of pay is needed. Before that if the dept wants to pay more, it's a battle against hr.
Isn't it wasting your *own* time though?
Unlimited Amazon gift cards for you ur the real MVP üëèüëèüëè
üêêüêêüêê
Great way to keep unemployment as well
They're not wasting your time if they put what they're willing to pay up front.  You are deliberately choosing to waste their time.
Thanks for the idea again.

I will do it more during non busy season.
Am curious to see some of the job postings which you have done this for
It's usually pretty mixed, but I have never had a bad interaction because I'm always respectful during the screen.  

It usually goes..

* walk me through your resume
* you seem overqualified, what salary range are you looking for. 
* That's way above budget.. I respond that seems to be the market rate though, or the range you're looking for is on the low side. 
* Some awkwardness - and then tell them, good luck on their search. 

Have never done this with large firms (don't be dumb). Large firms usually pay near the market rate or above anyways. (besides public accounting)

 It's usually the small / medium firms looking to save a penny or two.
My state, illinois, is gonna start mandating companies to disclose wages in job ads in January 2025

I can't wait for Job with listing that says 7-33/$ an hour
Geez, that‚Äôs like a starting salary. Not going to get anyone with any experience for that low. They‚Äôll cost way more than the money the city will save by hiring an inept accountant.
Only time I haven't seen that be the case was on a state government position. They put a range on the header of the job posting, but in the actual body of the job posting they gave an exact number in no uncertain terms and it was the max of the range. When I went through the interview, that was what the offer was and they were unable to negotiate higher due to experience/pay bands.
Shouldn‚Äôt it be the opposite? I gives no fuck if I talk to someone that I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù to, and it‚Äôs good to build up self confidence for when I do need to talk to those that matter.  I‚Äôm not saying to be rude, but to have natural conversations without fear.
Highly suggest toastmasters if you plan on conquering fear of public speaking 

I personally had great experiences

Better take that bad boy and put in no more than 10hrs/week of work. See how long you can keep it going.
I think that you missed the point.
No keep going. I need the attention.
love you to
Ahh yes "pay an entire team in India", have to use 3 US FTE to double check the work. But those aren't my direct reports so I saved money! (Truly genius logic)
"Cool, do it!  Why are you posting job offers for American Accountants if you don't intend on hiring them?"
It‚Äôs for the greater good!
I try to schedule all phone screens during my lunch times around 12:30. If i have a phone screen scheduled, I'll watch twitch in my tesla and answer their calls.

It helps to know that I am eating while their lunch is probably being delayed, but yes, it still does technically take up my time. 

It's enjoyable though, and I think if enough people do it, there will be some discouragement against ridiculous job postings.
You could think of it as community service
Not if you enjoy screwing with clueless idiots and I do lol
Nah. Petty revenge is its own reward.
Going on interviews even if you don't plan on taking it is good
I am 100% choosing to waste their time. 

I believe what they're doing is worse than wasting people's time. 

They're pushing down wages for the profession / industry.
Yeah, they can always go to their boss and say ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking at with the budget I‚Äôve been given. But for $X more I can get THIS guy‚Äù. 

Headhunters always do this. Gives them a choice.
I've done similar with interviews that I went on which posted a salary range. Then told me when I got to the interview that they only hire at the lowest number of the range.  

I go into the interview, everything goes well, they throw out the lowest number of the range. Then try to preempt any negotiation by saying: "We can't pay you more because Ms. X , makes that and she's been working here for two years."  

Ms. X is very young.  She's obviously a new accountant and na√Øve otherwise she wouldn't have taken this job. I tell them: "I can't work for that.  That's well under the market rate.  If you don't want me to be paid more than Ms. X you can always give her a raise as well."   

I turn to Ms. X: "You wouldn't mind that would you Ms. X?"

Ms. X: "I sure wouldn't!"

The manager hems and haws while acting weird for a minute or two.  Probably because he's never had a worker stand up to him, has no leverage over me, and doesn't know how to handle it.  Then quickly ends the interview.

If you waste my time and try to pit workers against each other; then I have no problem calling you out and making you look like a fool in front of your direct reports.
I agreed until‚Ä¶

If they are always saying you‚Äôre are overqualified then they aren‚Äôt under market but rather you are over qualified for the role they are hiring for.
Ya and that's why governments have had 50% vacancy.
Excellent advice! Agree 100%. It goes in the same line of ‚Äúit‚Äôs best to interview for a job when you don‚Äôt need the job‚Äù because of all the confidence you have that nothing is on the line if you fail.
If I need to, I switch to my talkative persona and get the job done, but yeah I avoid it. Different case with my closest friends of course (sometimes lol).
We should go walk around Wall Street and point at guys in expensive suits and laugh at them.
Just did some more research looks like they‚Äôre a polish company so might explain their unrealistic criteria.
Uh what's the point then? There's no point in applying for jobs that aren't worth your time.
Just wait until the AI get good enough.
Lol my team in India is far more accurate than my onshore team and for 15% the cost.
Legally required to in some instances. Already have someone to hire but have to post the job for some reason to appear above board on hiring.
The greater good
The greater good
You should start a youtube channel like that guy who exposes scammers you can expose bad jobs. Just record the interviews. I‚Äôll subscribe
That sounds like an awful way to spend a lunch break lol but as long as you're having fun, that's what matters!
You could have just said "in my car" but go off sis.
Im proud of you
Thank you for your service!
Revenge against what? Y'all need better hobbies lol
You are one of the good guys, i guess.
Again, not all heroes wear capes!
Why are you blaming the employer for the low wages. Shouldn‚Äôt you blame the people that take the job(s)?
Only if qualified people accept the wages.  Having said that... the world is smaller than you think, so keep it up and one day that person you're talking to today may be the gatekeeper of a good job you want tomorrow... and may remember you... and not in a good way.
I think he means that the market rate for that position is higher than what they're asking
Tinfoil hat time,

I think it's done on purpose,

So they can always pick up overtime whenever they need and always have job security, even after a major fuck up
The point is to show them how off base they are with their compensation offer if they want to hire someone with the qualifications they‚Äôre asking for.
When AI gets good enough to understand the nuance of accounting codifications, every white collar professional should be scared.
You should fly to India and suck each one of them off then
Good luck catching them killers then‚Ä¶
Greater good? I am a CPA. I‚Äôm the greatest good you are **eva** going to get.
This, definitely do this.
Hi I'm Chris Hansen.  Have a seat.
I'm going to just wait a month of two.
"The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time"
Hey buddy I want to bite ur banana suit
wallstreetbets avatar, opinion disregarded
Maybe? But if they always tell him he is overqualified then OP isn‚Äôt making any point other than more qualified candidates would want a higher comp which they likely know.
I guess but if you aren't gonna get the job anyway I don't see the point in wasting time. Companies do this because people settle for this shit. If you apply to jobs with the salary you want only, and be firm with how much you want, companies will eventually see less applications if the salaries don't pay. People are not doing their research and companies are taking advantage of them.

There's a reason why so many roles stay up for like 9-12 months because they pay so low and then the employer complains that "no one wants to work anymore". Nah, we definitely want to work, but for the right wages.
I'm still waiting for the white collar professionals to get good enough.
I'm dynamic like a motherfucker. I'll be making money in the nuclear wasteland going door to door selling watches, purified water and thermal blankets if I have to. Bring on the machines.
I'm not sure if that counts as training, but if it does be sure to coordinate with your colleagues.  India has some draconian immigration rules for offshored companies coming to train the outsourcing provider.
Didn't realize this sub was so xenophobic. Upvotes for your dumb fucking comment?
It‚Äôs just the one killer actually
Oh you were here first! I'm early, I'm early.
Jobs pay less than the market.  OP is overqualified for the job to ensure a callback.
Yeah, he's overqualified, I would be a better candidate to do what he's doing. Except, with my qualifications, they probably wouldn't even bother interviewing me...
Again, you're thinking like a partner with a deadline coming up. Not everything is about YOU. This is you putting in time and doing something clever to help others and the system itself.

The idea is that we need people to communicate that we need more money for what we do. Its about pushing for change. Not just plodding along to get some awful job that's probably as bad as your last one.
That sound better than my plan of selling my ass to the highest bidder

Tantric misstatements.
Bitcoin reached $69,420 today.
Well boys, we did it. How does it feel to achieve the goal?

It's what we've all been waiting for, for years. $69,420 Bitcoin has finally been reached.

All the pain and suffering and grinding during the bear. We didn't care, we stuck to our guns and persevered because we knew that one day, we would reach that magic number.

Anything else seems pointless now, the ambition is gone. We can all exit crypto. It's been fun.

I'll never forget all the friends I made along the way, we made this happen together and I love you all.
Bitcoin [pros](/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1b9r54e/bitcoin_reached_69420_today/ktyz1ja/) & [cons](/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1b9r54e/bitcoin_reached_69420_today/ktyz2d7/) with related info are in the collapsed comments below.
Now we wait for 690,420
It tapped 70k like jumping up and tapping the door frame in school ü•π
There are so many sell orders with that meme value that it's the third time (second recently) that it just tanks after reaching 69,420
Now let's drop back down to 19k for a few days just for fun, and then back up!
I'm going to go smoke some weed, and wait for the wife to get home.
Nice
Prepare for 100 comments of ‚ÄúBUT THEN IT WENT DOWN!‚Äù
I have a screenshot of the price uploaded to my profile if you want to use it for your post
Bitcoin nodes were designed to start shutting down when the price reaches 69,420. Soon we'll see it all shut down, crypto has reached nirvana.

The great journey is over. \*solemnly bows head\*
It hit 70k.
69420>80085>420069>696969  


Funny number moar gainz
well, I did nothing actually, just living my life and suddenly here we are.
This post alerted me to the fact that my sell order at $69,420 actually filled!

I was watching live in 2021 when it came within half a percent and then tanked. Kicked myself for years for not taking any profit
OP, there‚Äôs one more milestone you‚Äôre forgetting- 696.969,42
Embrace the highs and the suck and the fomo, you ain't seen nothing yet....*PSA .... history as with BTC....repeats itself..üöÇüöÄüöÇüöÄ
lol and then it drops
Aint putting more money in...uh when do I take out lol
what next?80k?
100k is probably the next sell off
Nice
Was introduced to crypto in fall 2017 just before the run-up when BTC was $4k. We joked about this price target then, and here we are now in just under 7 years, amazing.
What's up with the wall at $70k?
No,no,no...one million dollars! ü§£
I am watching the charts like it‚Äôs a horse race willing BTC to bust through $70k. Go you good thing!
2021 is finally over!
best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago
80085 when?
I wish I still found this stuff funny. I hate being in my mid 30s ü•∫
Which exchange we talking about?
Time to pack up and go home
70199
6,942,069,420 - See you on Mars
ü§ùüèªü§ùüèªü§ùüèª
And back to 68k
screenshot or it didn‚Äôt happen
We are so back
Welp, that's it. Back down to $69.42 we go...
Holding till 100K, then cash out
Ah yes. This was my most shared post last cycle. Just happened to be up smoking crack and saw the first news article hit.

Congrats everyone! Hope you all learn to stick to your strategy and not fall to temptation üçª
After almost 3 years waiting for this moment, I finally took my 1% profit.
That‚Äôs pretty meme üöÄüåï
Where's the fucking screenshot i need it
42069 incoming?
Yeah, I saw it today too, and I'm sure it'll go up to $1,000,000 a BTC
Crypto following the Meme-onacci levels.
Screenshot anyone?
It sure did! üòÉ
Now onto $6,942,000
nice
Nice
So did anyone buy at the bottom?
Thank you for playing sir
Do we have a screenshot of that?
100k by Christmas is back on the table. What year is it?
Were are all the 69.420 memes? I need them more!
Wait...JP Morgan and Jim Cramer said that bitcoin was going down.


I'm confused now...
surprised elon didnt tweet BTC 69420
Binance high was 69,990
Soooo bullrun yet?
We touched the magic number in 2021, but today we get to bask in it
I‚Äôm pretty sure most people will cash out around $90k because a lot of people are saying hold until $100k. It would be a lot more beneficial for everyone to wait even if it takes 10 years and hold.
My favorite numbers. Me n the old lady celebrated by gettin stoned and‚Ä¶
What a time to be alive.
Tbh woulda been funnier in 2019
69 hehehhes
Ahh so it reached and surpassed but didn't hit it and drop, leaving 69,420 as the high? Baffles me how all the exchanges run so closely together!
Keep going up!!
Halving hasn‚Äôt even started. Give it a month and it will be at a new all time highüï∞üîú
I own no Crypto and ALMOST made a big investment right before the ETF approval in mid January. 

I have the money to do it.

Reddit people‚Ä¶. WHY AM I SUCH A PUSSY?!!??!?
Coincidentally, my portfolio hit 69,419.88 today and I'm 95% in alt coins
WAGMI EOY'21 finally
Yep- sold some to rebalance after not checking my portfolio for 3 months.  Owned btc since 2018 and been a key part of my gains in my savings.
I just want to take the .0000654 seconds we‚Äôve had before total liquidation on both ATH breaches and give ourselves a great pat on the back. ü§°ü§£üòé. lol. Been a wild ride since CZ (ü•≤) ‚Äúrescued‚Äù crypto and bought the bus load at around $15K. What a great year‚Ä¶.Or 12‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs been time.
this is a good sign to the bullrun
$69,690 is next
Nice
Next up, $80,085
I wasnt around during the bear, nice assumption
$69,420 is not just a price; it‚Äôs a cosmic punchline. It‚Äôs the Fibonacci sequence high-fiving the moon. It‚Äôs the ghost of Satoshi Nakamoto winking from the blockchain.
Is it gonna dump again so I can buy more?
Next stop... $694,200! üöÄüöÄüöÄ
420 we lit boys
Nice
This will be considered a major historic moment
Everyone told me to sell - and I didn't listen. Smiling now as I hold my bag and watch it prove everyone wrong.
If you  bought Bitcoin in 2015 or any prices under that you the üêê or plugged into the sovket frfr  üòÇ
nice
Damn,  I remember buying almost 30 of them for 150$ (used them to purchase off of the dark web lol)
The level of Bitcoin relative to fiat is to me largely irrelevant. It is it's own asset class. 1 bitcoin today is the same as 1 bitcoin in 2014.
Nah next milestone is 80085
Alright let‚Äôs work our way back to zero nowü´°
Next goal is $694,200
Bitcoin, after it reaches $69,420: goes back to zero
 (Everyone sold it after it reaches the goal)
It also reached 
$69,420.69
$69,694.20
$69,696.90
$69,900
I bet you sniff your farts and giggle still‚Ä¶ I remember when I hadn‚Äôt grown pubes yet.  üôÑüôÑ
Nice
It was 70000 in kraxken
Deja‚Ä¶.. hits 69,420 and then drops fast to 66ish. Still think it‚Äôs all the sell orders at that amount
Too bad crypto was a mistake and an environmental disaster
42069 next........
Thanks for jynxing us.
Bitcoins OK but I like Hbar , Algorand and Filecoin

–≠
Noice
Nice
Is a bull trap, we are going down real fast soon
Nice
Broke $70k
I came
No way it will ever go down, right? Right?
What side coins should I invest in? Any interesting articles or research I can do . Want to diverse my portfolio
You mean 696,969
Double backed funny number first: 420,420.69

2025
Next week
80085 will be the next wall. Guarantee
OOH! New goal. Let's go!
4,200,069
what about 92k? its half of 99K
I thought we were selling at $69.00
10 more years for the mil.. if society holds out that long
Commenting because of 69,420
‚ÄúJust the tip‚Äù vibes
watching it jump $3k up and down like $0.03 a year ago is surreal
I'm here today because of a one time tap. To the moon!
All jokes aside, we gotta get through 80085 first.
üòÇüòÇü§Ø
I was so mad when it got that low because I knew it was a great deal and I just didn't have any money to invest. Same with ETH when it dipped below $1k in the summer of 2022
Same, but will be waiting for both my wife and her boyfriend üöÄ
Solid plan, does she make a good sandwich?
Nice
yeah, but not 10K like previous ATH, only 5K.  maybe next one will only be 2.5K drop.  then after that, for no good reason... 20K.  

crypto: come for the gains, stay for the losses.
Getting past the 69k meme is no easy feat. So many of us nerds put sales orders for 69k back when BTC was under $1k lol.
%2 phone battery.

My guy risked it all for the perfect screen.
Satoshi is so proud of us¬†
Didn't bitcoin already reach $69,420 back in 2021 though?
But it hit $69,420 on the way!
[deleted]
More pleeeze ü§ó
damn. My $69,420 order actually got filled in 2021. guess I was lucky
You enjoyed kicking yourself for years and want to kick yourself for many years more when it keeps climbing, right?
I guess there's always a new goal!

We fight on to $696,969.42.

And then we reach the summit at $69,420,420.69
It basically wiped out all liquidation on both directions: https://www.coinglass.com/pro/futures/LiquidationHeatMapNew
It might as well drop, after $69,420 there's no reason to go higher.
That's the neat part
Real talk now. Bitcoin IS the money. You never take it out unless you have to pay for something in legacy USD shitcoin.

It's going up forever, Laura.
In like 10 years or so?
100k fasho
It‚Äôs crazy reading the old Reddit posts‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWill bitcoin ever hit $1000?‚Äù üò≥
Whales are dumping the price back down so they can buy more at $69,420.
All of them!
Holding till 99K, then cash out.
Add a zero
wait for the dip
But I bet you can't remember having any fun at all...  
It's a post tagged as comedy, you can go and impress everybody with your maturity elsewhere.
Nice
Nah next milestone is 80085
420,069 first boys
That's the correct mindset
The ultimate resistance level
next is 420,420
696,969.420

That‚Äôd be as noice as a noice can noice.
That‚Äôs my sell limit .69 too
Nice
$100k Q14 2021
no, 420.69 c'mon get it right!
Lmao exactly üíÄ
Same I was only able to get up by about .1 lol which is great still.
Same here, it was infuriating for me. It just came at the qirst time for me financially. And don't think I didn't notice Coinbase, Microstrategy and miners at the time too.. I was dying to buy this stuff up. Just couldn't do it. I was stuck in alk my crypto positions. I averaged down where I could, but fuck me.. I could own three or four whole bitcoin right now if I hadn't bought before the crash. I just had no money to spare.
100% - I feel your pain...
I hear you. I'm smoking up the boyfriend while we wait.
Wallstreet bets is leaking
Nice
Thats sums it up
Apparently it was a recent upgrade. Or it needed to hit it twice? Once to honor 69 another time to honor 420.
Yes

Edit: Long-time lurker here. I was here 21 when it hit a bottom resist at 42.000 and rose in 4-8 weeks to 69.420$
Dude.

That's the only thing that matters.
It was only a small percentage. DCA in. DCA out.
üéØ

But for real someday ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
and back up! lol
You
>Real talk now. Bitcoin IS the money. You never take it out unless you have to pay for something in legacy USD shitcoin.

Yeah . . . that means it's not money.

Oh okay thanks for keeping us on our toes
My little brother told me that it would all be over and Bitcoin dead if it went down to like 10k again. I told him I would buy Bitcoin with everything I had and he looked at me like I was crazy. He bought the top and sold the bottom on Dogecoin, along with my Sister and Mom. I never told them to buy any so I'm in the clear, but they are all anti-crypto now.
Ahh, good old days.. punch it in the calculator and turn it upside down haha!
There once was a woman with [69] boobs on chest. It was too too too [222] many. So she went to [51]st street to see Dr. [X]. She had [8] operations. Afterwards, she went home, turned her bra upside down [turn calculator upside-down] and it equalled [=] _______.

Has anyone successfully made money from algorithmic trading?
Is it consistent earning?
Yeah dude, buildings full of people in NYC, London, Hong Kong.
I've been trading 5 or so strategies for about a month and am ahead of QQQ by about 8%, have been using StrategixTrading to trade them, saw them on another post a while ago and it made it pretty easy to just implement my ideas. One thing that's been working has been using inverse ETFs and that seemed to basically negate my losses during the recent down turn
[deleted]
I currently make money year over year with the strategies that I deploy. Currently I run four different strategies in production and I don't share specific details about them simply because sharing details would lead to them being ineffective. Some sharing their algo will see a dip in liquidity, or worse, banks using your strategy for liquidity. The key is to develop a decent strategy, with 60% or better average W/L and trade adequate risk profiles. Balance that over a period of the with other assets. That's the most that I can give without giving away too many gems. You don't realize how many times I had the backspace and delete things that I really wanted to say.
Yes, been at it for years and now have 70 different systems I can deploy based on what's working or not.

The past year I've tested 450 different systems and about 425 of them led to nothing
concerned support skirt shy continue arrest smell complete divide worthless

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
I do. Not a single losing month in a year, except July 24 due to the correction in tech and too many strategies deployed. Still up 20% YTD tho. 
Have corrected my issues and did a better risk management setup, should be able avoid losing months now. 
It was a lot of work to get a profitable system and mostly consistent, but now it‚Äôs mostly supervision and minor adjustments every few weeks. 
Making money is the boring part actually lol
I have. I succeeded in finding recurring option pricing patterns through extensive backtesting. The algorithmic trading implementation is actually very simple through my broker‚Äôs API and Microsoft Power Automate. The difficult part is understanding how options are priced, finding patterns, thoroughly backtesting ideas to exploit them, then forward testing in paper trading for months  to validate the backtest results.

For me, the key to success stop wasting time with TradingView indicators and other commonly used tools. Instead I focused on finding recurring patterns in derivatives to predict future prices.
I don't actually trade using any bot, but I have a system that 1) optimize indicator parameters for every component of a couple indexes that I track, 2) scan for on-going setups based on my strategy and 3) give me alerts about entries and exits. I do the trade by myself, sending the order, setting up stops and keeping an eye on that. I am currently swing trading at weekly level and my performance is not too consistent. It is withing 2% to 10%/month.
For a couple of months and then my strategy died.
Yeah this girl called Jane, cant remember what street she lived on though, Oh and her cousin Hudson - he lives by a river
Jim Simons. He pretty much invented algorithmic trading and made billions from it.

Read about him. It is amazing.
Yep, it‚Äôs not about algo trading though it‚Äôs about the strategy behind the algo. Code can only do what you tell it to do. Consistency depends on the strategy‚Äôs at play. For example I have a bot that does risk free spreads. The bot is just the tool to get into risk free spreads that are greater then the risk free rate before options prices revert back to that of no arbitrage opportunity‚Äôs. That is to say anyone could do this without an algo but it would be damn hard as compared to computer program that can scan a bunch of options chains all at the same time to find and fill such opportunities that may only appear for a couple seconds.
1) yes
2) consistent 
3) api with various brokers during earnings

Consistently. Questions feel free to ask (I'm institutional)
Yes. Damn near every day.
There is a guy who made money. His name is [Robert Carver](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/?m=1)
[deleted]
Yup.  Started in crypto markets as a hobby and as a long time developer.  Tired of the volatility went into Forex and after a year or two of testing went live and been happy with it since.  Still toy with it from time to time.
They are people that do but it's very hard, and do not expect that someone is going to give "one method works for all" because if they really were to find some genius indicator, strategy etc. they would not share it and most likely trying to scam you.
Look into the German YT from Rene Balke.
i did for a year until it gets fucked by the market last year. now its still floating loss and still trying to save it.
I do. Its a combination of algorithmic trading and options for risk management. Win rate is very low but profits are very decent.
Still working on my algo so not at the moment
Yes, there‚Äôs just not enough liquidity in the market to make me a billionaire. Especially market impact and TCs
Define make money? 
10-13% cagr over last 7yrs - absolutely
Yes but they don‚Äôt hang out on reddit
Market makers
The people selling the Algorithmic trading software.
Trading around 8 months. First algos were very hit and miss, made big gains, lost all gains later, but at least I was always break even. Been using a new algo for the last 3 - 4 months and it's performing 30% better than the market. So promising start let's hope it stays this way.
Well, actually learning and analyzing data in my spare time, therefore I hope so jaja
But I believe people won‚Äôt share how they made money from it
Yea
Yes, but the income is unstable. It very much depends on the strategy and the market phase. I think the best way to achieve stable income is to create a portfolio with different types of strategies.
Thank you python
If you want to make money in the stock market, the key is to make fewer, more strategic trades rather than constantly buying and selling like algos do. 

By trading less, you avoid the risk of the law of large numbers eating into your profits. With limited resources, sticking to fundamentals is more likely to pay off.
there used to be quite a few profitable alg traders on this forum, both private and institutional.  right around the time the crypto goofs showed up, they stopped posting.
In the earlier days of BTC and some of the alt coins I did at home but beyond that - no.
Nope you‚Äôd be the first. /s
anyone who did, won't say it here. It is my belief that as a retail you can find some edges here and there and get a decent return, but you have to think outside the box (using other kinds of datasets etc.), just using historical data about price/volume/volatility etc. is probably not enough.
Good post about algorithmic trading.  Love this.
Yes, I have been using Zapant and managed to beat QQQ by a lot this year.
I wrote my own custom program and had two $4,000 + days in a row last week. This was amazing to watch!
The acquired podcast did [an episode](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/renaissance-technologies) on Renaissance Technologies, the most successful company at algorithmic trading. They have never lost money since their algorithm was officially deployed.
I sell put and call option trades, earn money from time value, steady and slow. I have my algorithm and my margin is big (selling 2 million dollars put trades), so I earn $200k last year, and $120k the first half year. I have my algorithms explained in my videos (YouTube channel: MathPhdTrading) and open source code: https://github.com/bluedabadi/SchwabAutoTrading. You are all welcome to check it out.
I tried almost everything available out there. It turned out that diversification is the way to go, get some forex bot, some crypto bot and some indicator for stocks. Try to remove correlation between them, f.e. don't use two mean reverting bots for same security. Try to find bots which are in initial phase, because they will probably dry out with time.
[deleted]
It‚Äôs very hard. I‚Äôve been testing algos with ex guys from citadel and millennium.

Went over 270 algos. None meets min requirements. Market is overloaded with algos.

The best way is private data feed and collocation placement of servers.

Then you‚Äôll figure out it‚Äôs better to provide financial services instead of algo trading in that infrastructure. For example helping to close big positions with min slippage or clear arbitrage strategies well optimized that are making 0.04% daily :)

So I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs very tough and competitive space and requires very solid infrastructure- which is 70% of success.
I'm trying, starting to feel sketch about it though. Does anybody use Alpaca Trading currently (like today)?
Yeah, it depends how smart your strategy is. Most arr only momentary and algo traders always try to find new edge
Yes but it is 0.34%
Yes but it is 0.34% profit, I would like much more
I have been close to working 1.5 years on developing a prediction model, but to no avail. Still going strong though. Got a strong sense of fundamentals now. Anyone open to collab?
There will be lot of fluff but no proof if anyone made any money using bots. Dont trust.
I have "all" my trades through various APIs live.

I don't do point and click. 

I can't imagine what life would be like to stare at a screen for 10h. 

It gives me time to find other opportunities and hobbies. Like I found an anomaly in Hungary and with PDD (Temu) between 14-18 October this year. So I automate that and go on with my life. 

The idea of point and click is just wasting time. No?
A very interesting discussion. In my opinion, it would be ‚Äúthe easiest‚Äù for you to develop EOD systems on portfolios in the US stock market, e.g. all stocks or a basket from the S&P 500. Not only one individual stock or so. A portfolio of about 100 stocks or more. In addition, you should be very intensively involved with the system development itself. There are many pitfalls here. Examples include survivorship bias, in sample/out of sample and robustness tests. You can make a lot of mistakes here if you don't know what you're doing and how to do it properly. However, I can reassure you. If you take enough time and deal intensively with the subject matter (the principles of successful system development), you will achieve your goal. There are also numerous good books on this subject (e.g. by Perry Kaufmann, Kevin Davey, Prent Penfold and many others). Martyn Tinsley also has some very good videos on system development on YouTube. In addition, you should not have exaggerated expectations. Consistently getting 100% with 10% max. DD from the market is an illusion. The Jim Simons mentioned above had a return of just nearly 40% (after costs) over many years. And he was one of the best. Or look at the performance of all the legends like Warren Buffet. They are all between 20-30% p.a. (ok, Buffet is not a system trader but he is a benchmark). As a private trader, however, you can definitely achieve a performance of > 30% p.a. with EOD systems on US equities (averaged over many years, i.e. there can be years with -5%, but also years with 100%). That is more than realistic. In addition, you should definitely aim to trade several systems at once (e.g. 5 or 6). This smoothes the equity curve and reduces your risk. Before I forget, you also need a good data provider. If the data doesn't fit, your system won't work in reality. That's it in a nutshell for now. Just write if anything is unclear or needs explaining. Please don't be annoyed if an answer takes a little longer, but I will reply in any case.
I have and still am
Yeah for over 5 years ongoing.

Ask me anything
I went through 11 months of uncertainty and struggle before finally hitting a breakthrough with my algo. It wasn‚Äôt easy‚Äîthere were definitely moments where I questioned if all the effort and server costs were worth it. But now, we‚Äôre seeing results.

I just shared my journey and the live results over at r/daytrading: [Sharing My Algo Building Journey with Results](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1flwdxf/sharing_my_algo_building_journey_with_results/)

The key now is to keep pressing on, seek feedback, and continuously refine the algo. It‚Äôs a long game, but it feels like we‚Äôre on the right track.
I just joined gemalgo.com they have years of proven results and I was able to sign up for free. I am averaging 9 percent a month going on 3 months
I do. But mostly using options instead of stocks.

My broker has been making bank off me for years.
There are a lot of caveats here. They mostly avoid trading on exchanges, preferring to cross trades internally, take retail flow, hit dark markets or bank internalizers, etc. You have access to none of these, and the shit that actually gets exhausted to the market really is shit. They also have the trader's option -- their real revenue comes from management fees moreso than performance fees. Most investors are happy with an uncorrelated 1.0 sharpe, but you're not going to get rich on that. There are quite few who've gotten significantly *wealthy* on trading alone. It's hard to really do much at a size that can generate real wealth.

- a dude at a $200mm hedge fund running on ~3000 signals and only achieving around 2.0 sharpe
Yup it's the business model of a lot of very fancy financial companies. 

If you ask if a private person without an army of math quants has made money in the last couple decades the short answer is NO. The long answer is NOOOOO. 

To compete with those fuckers you would need a blue ocean case like the dude who made a billion algorithmically gambling on horse races in Hongkong. In stocks you have not a sliver of a chance. The moment you make significant amounts of money one of the algorithmic trading firms will figure it out and screw you over with low latency access to all stock exchanges and powerful server farms running software written by c geeks.

https://youtu.be/4B0mGYZqElo?si=wS6evpnHPb9OoWJF
I feel like they make more off commissions and fees for their services than profiting off their algorithms
Aren't those people making the most profits from fees on money people who think they can make money in the market give to them?
Nice, beating QQQ by 8%, that's actually crazy. I'm also them and it's super easy. Been messing with inverse ETFs to handle the dips as well. Having a set strategy really helps when the market gets choppy

ive been wanting to start algo trading for a long time but couldnt find a good broker. can you recommned a broker where i can also daytrade
A poker game?
When you say "not enough liquidity", you're talking about limit orders? I've always used market orders to guarantee instant fills, and the spread from limit orders isn't even that noticeable for me
I disagree. My algo runs close to a 40% win rate. I still make money. It comes down to effective risk reward/ratio * Win percentage.
Do you compare your performance against any benchmark? If yes, would you mind to say roughly (a range would be more than sufficient) how is it performing?
I know this is a difficult question to answer without sharing too much info, and I don‚Äôt want you to feel pressured to give away too much, but how do develop strategies in the first place? Do you look at the thousands of strategies people have published and then tweak the ones you like until it‚Äôs profitable? Or have you kinda just come up with your own from your own understanding/niche?
What do mean by ‚ÄúBalance that over a period with other assets‚Äù? I don‚Äôt understand that bit.
I‚Äôm new so excuse my ignorance.
Don‚Äôt you just need the winners to win more than the losers lose. So is a 60 or more win rate even necessary.
If sharing details here on such a small group would make them ineffective, then it‚Äôs very questionable whether they even have any edge in the first place. Ppl have shared plenty of strategies on YouTube or books widely and still they work well as markets are huge
would you be willing to share at least approach? what I mean by that is, is it ML, systematic, NN? Btw 60% for 1R seems extremely high, I feel like 55% would be enough to overcome fees, slippage and make decent return, at least when playing bigger moves.
70! Thats some diversity. Nicely done
do you use SQX
I thought I was being too optimistic having tested about 100 

I have only 3 from those 100 and was getting kinda discouraged
Do you use in house system to back test?

What data goes into those systems‚Äîfeed data? Like polygonio? Or other data?

Thank you @snailnaked6842
can you recommned me a good broker where I can run my trading algo for daytrading. all the brokers i've found had this pattern day trading policy
How long did it take you to get there? Also, what would you recommend to someone starting?
Isn't this just buying the trend. And as crypto's been on an upward trend generally you're getting profits?
How did you think of this
Possibly a stupid question but 2 mod 4 and 1 mod 4?
You just discovered Bitcoin's 4 year halving schedule around which all major market moves are based. Doesn't take an algorithm to figure that one out lad.
If you don‚Äôt mind sharing, could you provide some insight into the risk management strategies that you recently employed?
How many years did it take you to learn this or did you already have a background in it.
Could you share a little bit about the ‚Äòminor adjustments every few weeks?‚Äô You don‚Äôt have to share the specifics, just wondering what you would have to adjust for since I read that strategies based on moving averages gets overfitted easily, tuning it every once in a while might make it even more overfitted? (I‚Äôm new to this)
Is that after taxes?

I've had no trouble finding and implementing (other people's researched) strategies that have upside over indices. It's always the taxes calculation that stops me from putting much money into any of them.
> Still up 20% YTD tho

Significantly less than if you just bought BTC at year start.
You using bot to trade?
TradingView is underrated in my opinion. My custom strategy has 10+ built in indicators that I can tune to the financial instrument I‚Äôm trading to improve/filter my trade signals. Alternatively, I can plot and send the unfiltered indicator metadata on my JSON payload for more advanced handling in my Python code. It is more robust than most people give it credit for - aka, it‚Äôs not ‚Äújust a simple charting tool‚Äù.
I agree with you on the looking for patterns in the data. Patterns that are not noise. Patterns that repeat into the future. Myself, I look for patterns in ETF EOD data. I'm curious how you go about finding the patterns. Would you describe it as a pure data mining process? Do you do it manually or automate it in some way?
Can you give us an example of what kind of patterns? Something like correlations? What kind of tools are you using? ( math topics )
What‚Äôs your rationale for not deploying a bot?
Great guy.
How do you know and measure when your model is overfit vs if it has generalised when optimizing/training? Thank you!
Can you share your strategies? Can I dm?
This is not how it works.

* People with successful algos love the game, so they are always trying new things
* People with any algo are afraid of things melting down, so they are generally plugged in when the market is open.
* Creating a successful algo is hard, and isn't really done by people who are lazy and dream of doing nothing. If you want money, with as little effort as possible, algotrading is not the best option.

P.S.

I have a successful quantitative options strategy. I've been working on it since 10/2021, and profitable since 12/2022, though with a significant drawdown in Q3 2023.
What broker api are u using?
Yes, it‚Äôs the systems that don‚Äôt work that are sold.
I second this
Just another waste of time YouTube ‚Äòguru‚Äô selling programs‚Ä¶right. If he were actually successful, he would not be on YouTube and he would be focusing on his actual algo investments.
Agreed!
Very similar situation for me. I am hoping the same. Good luck to you!
Correct. Test models by data gathered, if not correct outcome reserve judgement and try again. Don't believe anyone unless you can do so yourself.

Not sure about the other replies, but yes, tonnes Algo traders institutional made money consistent and Ive explained in various articles of my - subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/RossRiskAcademia/s/7AnjcMLeMp -as it's because they exploit the exuberance of retail investors.

being restricted in our PA was a lot more stressful than I realized until I got laid off. after a coupe of years I have gained the confidence to try to make money actively trading again and I am pretty pleased I learned some new asset classes and have made money though I spent a fair amount on "tuition" too. but now I am growing the trading and putting more capital into my own trades and at least for now it feels great  I no longer have to say I am unemployed o raspy weird things when people ask what I am up to
My friend and I do it daily.  I made a few grand ttl in ES and NQ today but my buddy made $28,000. He was way more active and focused on NQ. My best trades were NQ too. Meh, I'll kill it tomorrow. 

We are "pros" but trade our own money so technically = retail. 

We (I) only trade 4 to 8 at a time. Never hold anything overnight. Code is C++. I do not consider putting indicators together an algorithm. It is not.  I use math... lots of intense, sophisticated math.

Why am I reading these reddits? I'm wasting time at a bar so why not?

My quant teacher used to work in Japan in the golden years of Japan‚Äôs economy. He said that they used to hire artists/ right brainers who can interpret the chart in a support/resistance/ ichimoku way/ TA way. And that was even faster than any math calculation out there. He admitted that while he was still doing the calculations, the artists saw through the movement of the charts in an instant ( apart from black swan events )
This simply isn't true
From what I can gather, profitability is possible it you trade strategies that...

* have a relatively long holding period (i.e. not intraday), so that you are not competing with HFT
* have a relatively low capacity, so that you are not competing with traditional and non-HFT quantitative asset managers
> the moment you make significant amounts of money one of the algorithmic trading firms will figure it out

I think you vastly overestimate them and also overestimate the amount of money that is ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù to an individual. Five, ten, fifty, a hundred million dollars isn‚Äôt that noticeable to these corporations.

I do think it would be extremely hard to make money, you can‚Äôt just use the low hanging fruit, you have to have a very atypical idea paired with a lot of luck paired with a vast amount of technical knowledge. But these companies aren‚Äôt nearly as omnipotent as you believe.
This is mostly true but not entirely. Small guys can make good money if you focus on strategies that don't scale. To a quant hedge fund or HFT firm these trades aren't worth the time it takes to monitor them but they can be very meaningful to an individual.
This seems odd. Like if I had an algo successfully trading at most five ES lots, you think an algo firm will work to specifically undermine my algo?
How do the firms have the power to screw people over with the low latency access? They have that kind of reach with the brokerages? Seems highly illegal
No, this is Reddit
Eventually the big players are so few as liquidity dries up it really does feel like a poker game
that's because you aren't trading over $200 mil.   
but also your paying the bid-ask spread even on a $5 market order so idk what your really saying.
My assertion is for most people getting into algo who typically start with a strategies that are not refined for market conditions. Can you make 40% work? Of course! But it means your targets have to overcome the the losses by quite a bit. I find when teaching, over 70% leads to too much ego and blind spots, while less than 50% for too long will make prospects simply quit. I offer 60% because it eases the burden of recovery while quelling ego. Just personal experience. I understand your disagreement if you have a good foundation on both trading and algos. Most in this group are not profitable with their endeavors and looking for help. I would almost assume OP falls in this boat to some degree.
I‚Äôm with you. Mine is a 95% win rate but losses wipe me without risk management.
Let me answer for OP. 

Is the strategy still working as expected? If yes, do nothing. If no, figure out why.

You should understand how the manager is doing relative to how he/she should be doing. But if you're running your own money, all you care about is if the strategies you are running are doing what they are supposed to.

This leads to why backtests are helpful, but not useful. That's a discussion for another day.
Apologies as I am just now seeing this. There are two approaches to me finding any strategy. The first is typically me looking at other strategies and making adjustments. The second would be me layering indicators on a screen and pruning them away when they don't fit my trading type. Most often, it's just a matter of applying the right filter. If you're dealing with too much volatility, add a volatility filter. If you need to figure out the trend, add a trend filter. Same goes with momentum and everything else. Just think outside the box. Sometimes performance can change with something as simple as moving to the 15min rather than the 5 or vise versa.
Some people use higher risk and trade one asset. I cut my trade size and play multiple. Like instead if just the SP500, I will also trade BTC, XAU, and etc. Usually about 15 to 20 for most strats. One algo plays everything since signals only hit maybe twice a month at different times for each asset. Hope that helps.
Reading down and 60% is not a requirement at all. See my reply for my logic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/s/DuPvsl9Mob)
Not the person you replied to. But yes, win rate doesn't matter. What matters is whether the strategy has positive EV. That's it.
The more crowded trades are - the less it‚Äôll return / higher chance of reversals etc.
the best strategies work no matter what (in the long term) due to stylized facts

For context, I just buy and hold NTSX along with some other etfs and am up 15%. For me the work required for algos is not worth it when a no work buy + hold performs as well. I don't have a math major nor am I part of a 100 person team with a phd doing this for a living. Keep in mind this is reddit, I can say I am up 1000% this year by buying on a full moon and selling when my goldfish hits a button in his fishtank, doesn't mean it's true.
Split my capital according to performance of each strategy, cutting half of positions at the end of day if they are still open
2 years of algo trading, 10+ years or trading and investing
Performance is always before tax, but personally I have 0% tax on capital gain where I live
I‚Äôm not into gambling and need my monthly perf to live
Yes, algorithms I created
I suggest moving away from ETF EOD data. Everyone and there mother is looking for patterns in those prices. It‚Äôs been arbed to hell. You need to look at intraday data in another instrument.
I like to take a look in the charts and news before proceed. Specially close to quarters ends, there are some times that it is better to extend the trade for a week or so, or buy something to profit from dividends, or even avoid an entry point due bad rumors.

The price movement discounts everything but it is purely reactive to events.
By ensuring when I connect my api with my vol box - I always have a pay off diagram. 

To see where I am vulnerable; and I pick up non correlated stocks/assets/synthetic options that percentile wise very much cover my downside (can't be 100) but a very high 98/99% percentile. 

But don't get me wrong; I have this for high liquidity ones. 

Like ITI makes options chain makes no sense to me; so an EWS Algo prevents making that trade based on a collapsed gibbs sampler and a inverse wishart distribution.

So my prior doesn't satisfy the risk/reward - given (prior vs posterior) - is thrown out (by simply taking out top 5-bottom 5 as anamoly).

Yes, of course, go ahead.
Risk per trade is set at 2% with a risk-reward ratio of 1:1.05. The average monthly ROI is 21.2%, excluding NFP gains. When NFP gains are included, the ROI increases to 34.25%. The maximum drawdown is -4%, and if this is hit in a single day, trading stops for the rest of that day (though this rarely occurs). I've never had a losing week or month, though I have experienced a few losing days. Most money is made on high impact news with my algo.
Think it got reposted, the link should be in my profile
Most of my options trades are defined risked. I have a few strategies I deploy. For example one strategy starts the day out with an iron butterfly on the SPX. Then as the market moves (this is where the algo earns its value) I might sell part of the butterfly and make it a credit spread. With a butterfly later with a credit spread I know my max loss. This strategy has a 80% win rate. Average win per trade is about 20% of max risk. On the 20% that go south only a few go to max risk. Certainly have some draw down periods but when the algo is on fire it does well.
I also have some strategies where I use options like a venture capitalist invests in start ups. Based on filters I might buy a handful of put or call options every day. Only risking like $250 per option. Some of these options will go to zero and be worthless. Some will return a little, but a few might return 10x. Risk is always defined by making very small bets.

what assets types ? I have been writing java but used to have a c++ based system for stat arb but it was a huge pain. I also enjoy reddit its entertaining and I do learn things wherever I go even WSB sometimes
I think you've hit upon something that took me an embarrassingly long time to understand. Algorithmic trading doesn‚Äôt automatically mean day trading, high-frequency trading (HFT), etc.

The confusion, I believe, arises from institutional algo/HFT users trading based on order flow. To me, this isn‚Äôt speculative risk-taking in the traditional sense; it‚Äôs closer to front-running, as in most cases, the buyer/seller is already lined up before a trade is initiated.

This confusion then trickles down to private traders, who don‚Äôt realise that these algos/HFT strategies aren‚Äôt trading the market per se, but are trading their own customer order flow. Private individuals don‚Äôt have customer order flow to trade against, so when they try to replicate these strategies, they fall flat. I‚Äôm not very popular in r/futuresTrading because I‚Äôm always reminding them that in decades of speaking with banks, clearing members, exchanges, etc., I have never come across a single long-term (5 years+) successful (100k+/yr) day trader‚Äînone.

I‚Äôve even seen people from banks who were considered rock stars crash and burn once they started trading at home. When you‚Äôre outside that bubble of order flow and privileged information, it can be very humbling.

Back to the topic, while stories of supercomputers and HF/microwave links might make great PhD white papers, for the average non-institutional trader, your chances of making money go up exponentially on higher timeframes. It‚Äôs embarrassing, but the little old lady with a share certificate in IBM that she keeps in her sock drawer and checks once a year has a better chance of making money than most futures/FX day traders.

If you‚Äôre a non-institutional trader, drop the obsession with day trading, and absolutely drop the obsession with HFT.
It is possible on shorter time frames
I guess that makes sense but that sounds more like factor investing to me. But I guess potato potata.
This. You‚Äôre not going to win if you go against HFT, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt win if you think more long term.
I have a swing trading bot. it was doing great until about a week ago XD
In the professional context, algo trading tends to mean high speed market making or execution trading algos (vwap, icebergs etc). 

Automated trading/investment strategies would generally be referred to as systematic trading.
Right brained people tend to be better traders than left brained people. The book In The Zone covers this and it‚Äôs fascinating why.
What do you mean by low capacity in this context? Do you mean high capacity trading might end up competing with big players, making it difficult?
This is 100% true. 

Otherwise, there will be no new Quant and HFT funds. 

Everyone starts somewhere. 

$10 million is nothing to these funds but for an individual thats a lot of money
what's an example?
The exchange doesn't care? They make money if people trade? They don't really care if the other side put their servers on the other side of the street and invested lots of money in low latency data processing? At one point goldman Sachs was faster than the exchange itself because there is a slight delay in fully applying transactions after They are visible and goldman sachs was faster in reacting to them than the actual exchange. Also if you would regulate that where do you put the line?
Drawdown is exactly the problem, with a risk of 1:165 for 10 consecutive losses at a 40% win rate and 1:9536 for 10 consecutive losses at a 60% win rate. That‚Äôs why, for most home traders, a 60% win rate makes more sense.
How are you managing risk?
I do understand your point. I usually have two targets in mind: it should be more profitable than buy and hold and protect me from inflation.
benchmarks are actually a huge obsession for institutional allocators not just retail
Have to disagree with this. I mean to some degree I agree in terms of obsession with comparing to benchmarks and backtests. But on the other hand, opportunity cost is a real thing. You say it's fine if the strategy is doing what it's supposed to. In vacuum maybe but realistic if you have a basket of strategies there is always the possibility that you are running one strategy instead of another and the one you're not using would give you greater risk adjusted returns in the current environment. More pragmatically if you're investing a bunch of time and resources in algo trading but your risk adjusted returns are lower than the S&P then why bother? You might as well buy and hold SPY at that point...
Benchmarks are there so you don't waste your time. If your strategy doesn't do as well as some benchmark, then invest in that benchmark instead
You pretty much just summed up my approach. It‚Äôs always nice to know the way I approach something isn‚Äôt crazy.
Yes, it makes sense. If you deploy your strategy across multiple assets you can then only trade the best setups. Thank you.
Thank you.
Like all things in life: EV, Std Dev
positive skewness often accompanies a low win rate, its nothing to shy away from as long as you have other positively skewed and uncorrelated alphas
thanks
Fair enough
How long have you been at this if you don't mind me asking?
It revolves around the halving pretty consistently (lag back and forth of around 6 months generally for specific sub-cycles) take 10 minutes to draw out the ATHs in the four years cycle and you'll notice they're very close in time distance (literally exact same day distance for last few)
i'm on this sub right now because i just discovered algo trading like 3 hours ago and want to learn more (dabbled with crypto since 2012 on and off and understand basic TA yada yada), and "there looks like pattern" had me dying

only reason I was able to make considerable profit (on relatively small investments) back then was because I used TradingView, slapped some wavy lines and random indicators that looked cool on some random new cryptos that will "totally revolutionary the world of finance" (not) and said "looks neat, place buy"

I wish I got this advice three years ago. You could have saved me countless hours of efforts and a boat load of money.


For many people, me included, a decent portfolio of cleverly selected ETFs and some hedging is the way to go. Yet people will keep chasing rainbows and for what?


I could dump my money to SPY beginning of this year and make a lot of money. Instead I traded every single day and to float around break even. F this. I‚Äôm going static long and doing the scalping on the side from now on
Did the 10 year help in algo trading ? I am also trying to get into it but I have a cs background and free time.
PR?
Can you share your strategies? Can I dm?
I thought we all learn from reading the Market Wizards books that there are many, many different ways of being successful at trading.

You obviously have a successful intraday strategy, I wish I had one too. I've worked with intraday data looking for systems but I have had much more success finding systems using EOD data, so that has been my focus.

And surprisingly, there are many repeating patterns to be found using daily OHLC data. Jaffray Woodriff, a Hedge Fund Market Wizard, has been very successful finding patterns in secondary variables derived from just daily OHLC data.
Great information. I‚Äôm newer to the space, and I think I have found alpha and edge in my strategy, but I‚Äôm 100% heads down on risk management at the moment. Would you say in your experience that ‚Äúdiversification across assets/sectors‚Äù is ranked high for you when it comes to minimizing risk and max drawdowns?

Sierra Charts ?
Ah okay. Makes sense.
Are they real ALGORITHMS or just a few indicators strung together in a bogus trading program... that u call algos? 

This is the correct sub for real algos but from what I have seen, 99% of the tools on Reddit think 2 fkg moving averages working at the same time = an algorithm.

So beware people...  !!
I transfer money out of my account to my bank every month. I don't want to be left holding the bag for a failed broker/FCM... or getting screwed by a jagoff like John Corzine fleecing his clients. 

Therefore, I usually start each month with 30k. My avg risk per trade is $1,200. My WR is ~ 68% each month.
Financial futures only. 

No stocks. No options. No crypto.


Yes, I believe the higher timeframes can be a better option. I'm sure these institutions are farming money through their HFT bots though.
To professionals algo generally means speed and execution trading. And systematic trading would be automated rules that run on longer time frames and are trying to take directional risk.
It gets better with hedging. Let's say you have phone location data. You could long hotels in areas with high traffic and short hotels in areas with low traffic. This would be a way of isolating yourself from the general "hotel factor" and seeking to gain pure and direct exposure to your alpha (phone data).
Until the pullback?
Why?
Yes. Big players need to move tens of millions to billions of dollars, so they are only looking for high capacity strategies. If you avoid these, then you won't be competing with them. I think.
good point! also important to think about the fact that with equal TP, the SL for 40% WR will be much lower than for 60%. So 10 losses in a row for 40% WR and 60% WR will yield much different drawdowns.
Having a low percentage works in a strategy when the highs overcome the previous losses. But for the average trader, I just want them to beat "buy and hold" or a simple coin toss.
Machine learning algo that indicates when to close mainly
That's totally fine. You have to understand that those are completely different mandates, though. A strategy can do neither of those things, but when added to a portfolio, can make it more effective for both.
No, they are a huge obsession for the boards, not the managers.
See above "is it running as expected" 

"should I replace it with another strategy" is an entirely different question.
100% agree. I‚Äôm outpacing the S&P 500 by a fairly wide margin, and that is my main benchmark. If I‚Äôm not beating that significantly with my tax adjusted net profit, I‚Äôm not going to bother trading.
It's hard to make generalizations, but it really depends on the mandate, the asset class, and the strategy. 

I know PMs that don't even check the market. I also know some that check it religiously. It really just depends.
We are all here for social discourse and learning... at least in my mind.

If you are uncertain about risk management; draw (on paper); helps cognitive wise; your strategy; even if it contains 33 assets. 

You will see exactly what move, where, at what point, your exposed to (potential) losses. Right there - is the gap (if for example a fixed loss like a bond that goes bankrupt) or infinite - you seek a opposing trade to offset that. Bit old school but it works.
He has a live account started with 15k and it is now 26k with his EAs. This is overperforming the 
Markets by a lot. But 99% of redditors do not want a 85% gain they want a 10000% gain within one day ‚Ä¶ . And this guy is showing what he is doing and why.
As long as possible.
What? Not following.....
[deleted]
Yep, didn‚Äôt catch that one. While it‚Äôs a little disappointing, I‚Äôm fine with it. It‚Äôs not a perfect algorithm. So far I‚Äôm out a little bit ahead anyway.
Gotcha, that‚Äôs a good point.
How big are your losers in comparison to your winners?
I like it, thanks for the insights! 

I do have a trade report that I've automated to pull:  
1. Trade history  
2. P/L for each trade  
3. Indicators settings that applied to each trade  
4. Timestamp of each trade

I've spend some time, but I think I need to spend much more time on analyzing the data...which times and days do I experience the biggest gains and losses, what market conditions, etc.

As you stated, I need to have a mixed bag of financial instruments that may be able to offset losses with another instrument. I hadn't thought of that before since I've been so focused on development and getting my code to work properly. I'll see what I can find and try to implement what you've suggested.

Thanks!
Fair
Alright il be in touch
An automated strategy can be, again, 2 moving averages from the 1990s. Big deal.  

What types of algorithms are you using?  I don't care about the code, just the category of algo.
Yeah, the size even caught some of us out who had expected it. I‚Äôm looking at creating a model, so would be interested in knowing how complex is your model is and how you went about creating it please?
Each win is about 3% of the max loss. So it‚Äôs pretty important my code does what it needs to do. I lost about 60-70% of my portfolio before I wrote it.

Not super complex. Rules based in python. I use vulr to run the python script using chron jobs that does decision making periodically throughout the day. I have a logging system locally using sqllite.
Once again you have not answered my question.  Red flags, anyone?

Do you know what a random forest tree algorithm is?

I'll wait for you to Google it.

Great work. Another "why didn't I think of that" moment fir me! 

Gave you another star, buddy! Kudos!
Hook this up to an ML model for sentiment analysis regarding a stock?

Edit: Starred!
Bravo!  My only critique is in your description.  It's certainly a nice and lightweight package.  But don't call it "happy".  I barely saw it crack a smile.
This is awesome! Do you do any proxying to avoid being banned?
Congratz! Those types of packages are what we need :D. Long live to the Open Source community
Brilliant work. Just like newsapi, but free!
does it circumvent Google censorship?
Absolutely useful for both qualitative and turning qualitative content to quantitative measurement.
Thank you for your great work!
Congratulations! More advance and tools useful for the retail army
Great work! Will check this out.
I am working on some code to do sentiment analysis on seeking alpha articles. I definitely want to check out your tool. Thank you for sharing this!
Very useful , many thanks
really nice, I will probably use it on my own open source project. thanks for sharing it with us
Can this be used to warn me of FED meeting or events where I should sit out volatility? 

I don't care about bias only the times os the significant events and NOT insignificant news
Cool. How would you use this to help with algo trading?
My FIRST thought as well, lmao. I already have a webscraper for this, I'm just gonna plug in this package now and see if it's easier (probably is)
Those dates are published on the FOMC's website.¬†
News sentiment analysis on a stock.
This already exists. Check out FinBert.
Hasn't finnhub had a similar thing for years now for free? Or is this different somehow?
Leave it to huggingface haha

I do more with the text than sentiment analysis usually, but if finbert can help extract the financially relevant text more consistently I'll definitely give it a whirl
I don't think this can replace FinBert.
Not replace finbert but be used as the data aggregator for finbert
$11k into half a million in 3 days. thanks AVGO
put 11k into avgo post er. cashed out today at half a mil

I made $7.34 shorting it yesterday and today.
That's disgusting.... I turn 11k into 500...
now this is a classic WSB play, well done and fuck you
Fuck me. I gotta stop looking at these gain posts.

Nice work OP.
What the actual fuck.
Now wait until January to lose it all so you can face off against the final boss the IRS.
Bro take that money and run.
Holy Hannah that‚Äôs wild. Like we dream of 10 baggers or 30 baggers and you cashed out a damn near 50 bagger.

Probably a stupid question but does it mean someone on the other end lost $500k?
Sounds like you had $11K to light on fire ü§ë
Legend
I was so close bought long at $912 and sold at $945

I wonder how many people will go into debt because of this post lol
Congrats and fuck u
SEC it's this guy right here
The trade was coming from inside the house
What kind of insider crap did you have to know for this?!?!?!?
Congrats! Now just the final boss of the IRS to face
Wow congrats my man... I had calls for last week the 980$'s of course should of bought further out :/
Holy fuck this is insane

This has to be insider trading
Don't go outside
Do you plan to do something special for your wife‚Äôs boyfriend with your newfound wealth?
Can someone explain to me (in a way that a 3rd grader can understand) how this happens. How does someone turn 11k into 524k in 3 days like this? I am regarded and don't understand anything more than the basic concept of 'buy low, sell high'.
Just have my gf while you're at it
Wow, amazing submission! Congrats on the big win! It's inspiring to see such success.
Jesus fing Christ put everything in ETFs and never touch options again and then come back to this comment and gimme 500 when you realize how thankful you are that you did that
I just choked on my Wendy‚Äôs.
‚ÄúHello?  SEC?  Yes, this post right here.‚Äù
Mods better flair this man
That‚Äôs fucking incredible man fuck you
Inside trading, but who gives a f***  congrats and enjoy.
Sell and buy a house
The SEC will be paying you a visit
You bought Dec 15 1000 calls but the 2nd pic shows a Dec 23 call? Confused
Conginsideratulations!
Can you please take me on this train next time please? ü•≤
Insider trading is a hell of a trug
Cash out and quit gambling bro. You won.
lol so fake everything round numbers?
That's a lucky win. Do yourself a favor and stop gambling on options because the way you guys are playing it is literally negative RoI in the long run.
I never believe a post whenever it's got perfect 00.00 in it.
how was it only a dollar and up 50x when the underlying is only up 2%+
Bro how the hell do people do this, like what do these people know that I don‚Äôt that enables them to invest like this?!
"11k into 325k, while I prepare to obediently hand the Feds 175k for doing nothing."
Damn, AVGO took you on a wild ride! Congrats on that insane return. Just remember, lightning rarely strikes twice, so don't let it go to your head! üöÄüí∞
Now in typical WSB fashion, OP isnt going to cash out, he's going to lose it all pretending like this can happen again tomorrow.
Fake asf
so what's your next play?
https://preview.redd.it/4ldda1t8ey5c1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2db0a6c97e23a9f3c0f7ee3bcf1001bf180b4878

Same. This was 2021. Pennystonks were mega-hot-fire. Wanna know what‚Äôs worse?

I never sold. I got like $60k out of this whole deal. Devastated.
I‚Äôll give you 5.5k for $250k, deal?
Now don‚Äôt be an idiot and blow it all in a week. Really take everything except the initial 11k out and put in a high yield interest account. Otherwise you‚Äôll be tempted to trade with that amount of money
How does this shit happen? What convinced OP to make such a trade? Inside Info?
The IRS loves you!  Congrats!
I just saw this post cause it made it to the front page. I've never bought a stock in my life. Got curious and looked up AVGO's stock price history for the week (Broadcom?). It was $906 a few days ago and is currently $1,071.64 so roughly a 10% gain? Obviously I'm missing something, can someone explain this?
I have $11k to burn someone teach me what to do. You regards dont tell me where to YOLO
Is this 100 contracts? I‚Äôm not quite sure how to see what happened here
SHOT it a sleeper !
Should be in the green $711,800 as of AVGO's close price today.  Did you close the position early?
I borrowed $250,000 from my wife's boyfriend yesterday to buy another McLaren, but after seeing posts like this, maybe I should use his money to do something similar? He'd be real proud of me if I turn it into 1 million.
Dope teach me the way master!!
Lmk next time you want to do something like this
You get a dividend on 12/19 if you‚Äôre wondering
 close and gtfa while u can
NVDA next
Would be millions with morphosys calls
Congratulations, and fuck you.
Congrats, don't forget Uncle Sam his 35%
I love Reddit. This guy posts a half million win and the post above this was someone asking an illegal way to make $5 so he could buy nicotine
Insider trading?
Avgo to the moon
As a homeless person.. all I can say is.. way to go!!! Enjoy.
If your post is real, how come the spacing between the 0s is off in your strangely rounded figures?
[deleted]
Mods this shit fake or nah?
why'd you pick AVGO to dump 11k into? help a regard not be a regard pls.
How much was the option premium? I can't tell
I call bs and then some fucking clown..
Whatcha going to do with all that money now?
How did you know Broadcom would pop 20%?
I made 1,500 in one day , but thats the beat so far
Nice trading!

On paper![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)
Well done!! üëè What was your rationale for the trade?

Where was the heads up? üòÖ
These calls are at $104.45 a piece now‚Ä¶ AVGO even up premarket again too.
If he stayed the position is worth now probably like 1.5 million

I wish i can try his trades

He clearly has great trades
These are at $147 a contract. Are you still holding?
wtf has happened to this sub lmfao, this is clearly fake ash
I‚Äôm sad now
F.U.
lol I have AVGO and immediately checked my stock after this post. Can confidently say this person is faking those numbers
How is it possible ? There days ago avgo was 945 usd how did he made half a mil when it‚Äôs only ~1050 usd now ?
Where can I See which stocks / crypto‚Äôs WSB is choosing next?
Please stop posting sh*t like this. You are inspiring people to throw money away at financial instruments they don't fully understand. Just don't.
I don't believe that. Sorry.
congrats and fuck you
Wait‚Ä¶7.34 *MILLION*?!
I lost 3 cents. :(
Proof
I made a poop yesterday
The real hero
Teach me!
How many contracts
AVGO laid me off two weeks ago. I win.
5.00***
Ye I mean the chance of a stock going up +10% a week AFTER earnings is very slim.

I wonder what were OP's justifications of going all in?
This is the way
Lord ive seen what you‚Äôve done for others
The movement it is not yet done, but if he returns to zero in a couple of days, then he will be an honorable member.

&#x200B;

For real, OP don't be greedy, cash out profit and retire from gambling. I have lost million dollars in stock market and real casinos. Don't be that guy.
[deleted]
I just need to keep reminding myself that this is effectively gambling.

Yes, this guy won the lottery but most people lose.
I was having a bad day and now I feel skull fucked after having gambled my own money away in the stock market and seeing this post. Fortunately, I was always fairly broke to begin with so wasn‚Äôt a great loss.
What did he do?
Incredible. I don't even know what options are.
Don‚Äôt trade in December lmao
Yeah there is really no safe way to go about this unless OP puts away his tax liability and puts the rest of his gains in an ETF and promises never to trade that again lol. Otherwise he‚Äôs going to lose it and just have done it for uncle sam
It just balances out against the 500k op lost earlier this year
Cash out in Dubai,UAE instead of US. Gg ez.
If they trade 10K at a time, they would have to have 50 losses in a row to lose at all
Did this before... At least they offer payment plans, lol.
The pro strat is to just lose it all before next year and don't worry about the IRS, easy
2nd health bar is the SEC - half a milly is enough to get their attention but not enough to make them be your buddies.
üò≠üò≠üò≠

The house always wins (eventually) so before they do, stop playing
And it wasnt a 100 dollars into 5k move either. This guy just rocked it
[deleted]
Yea. But they‚Äôre price-insensitive players ie. Citadel and others

Not to say there‚Äôs maybe some retail bozo who sold an AVGO call and reached the hands of the big money who pumped the shit out of this (or the retail who followed, like OP)
Yes and no. A market maker almost assuredly sold those calls, but they're also selling puts / calls / you name it, at every strike, every day, etc.
Yes, but it's likely that an institution sold the call as a hedge against holdings, in which case both parties profit
They didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlose 500k‚Äù as in they are in debt (unless they sold naked calls). Instead they miss out on making that money buy selling the shares themself. They must sell the shares for $1k each to OP. Or in this case someone/s else bought the calls off OP for that price.
Yes because technicality but no because money is made up
Yes. Most folks who bought put options. Also ones who bought the call option may not make money. It's a zero sum. Someone is selling to op (they lost money if they hadn't sold) and then someone bought from OP.
yes, just like someone winning at the Casino means the Casino lost money, but the house still wins overall, they play the odds game, and odds are stacked in favor of the house.
Absolutely
this.  I would imagine someone having $11k to buy a single scratch-off would also not change their life over winning $500k
Nah I bet he‚Äôs just a degenerate gambler
Only $11k?

If the price went down he wouldn't have just lost 11k. He would have to pay extra money instead right?
Similar lol, sold before er and didnt buy back next day. Atleast i didnt lose
Dump it..
Watch out Wojack
can someone give me a quick gestalt?
underrated comment.
When some loses $11k on a trade they are regarded, when they hit a grand slam it‚Äôs an insider trade?
They'd just bought VMware, it wasn't exactly hidden.
Exactly. He only won 239k and a lot of nice toys for the irs.
Needs to be higher up. OP needs to cash out the IRS payment and just send if off in advance... Don't delay till Tax time (even if the interest would be excellent..)
It's 'should have', never 'should of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
Nice can you teach me haha
Why avgo has been on an absolute tear the past 6 months
Or someone with balls of steel and conviction
Why is this getting upvoted?
There was a guy on here about a year ago who made almost half a mil on a $6k bet with Netflix puts. 99% you‚Äôll lose every cent on a trade like that but grand slam trades do happen once in a blue moon.

Edit: sp
Lmao you mad!
Op bet $10k that avgo was going to go up 6%+ in a week which is a batshit insane bet

Avgo proceeds to go up 20% over the next 2 days making op rich

He threw $10k on a lotto play and won, don't expect to be able to ever replicate something like this, for every 100 that tries something like this, 99 of them lose
Basically OP entered a contract with a holder of the shares to buy them in bulk at a premium fixed price wether the shares go up or down in value. However the shares rose in value  very quickly & now the holder(s) of the shares need to pay higher premium to void the contract so they can keep them. OP sold those contracts at a higher price so the holder can back out of the contract. 


This is basically how it goes.
You could also turn 11k into nothing in 3 minutes‚Ä¶
Instead of buying the stock with the 11k, he pays a fraction of that stock's value, so he is "trading" with a lot more shares than what he would have gotten if he bought directly with the 11k. Giant risk is involved in this because he is assuming that the stock will go up and if it doesn't he would have lost a huge chunk if not all of the 11k paid. It's basically buy low sell high but magnified with a lot more risk of losing everything.
options. fuck around with $100 and find out.
The key to making a lot of money in the stock market is to buy low and sell high. In order to do that, you need to find stocks that are undervalued by the market and then sell them when they reach their true value.
I thought we buy high, sell low
Ok, thanks bro she cute?
> inspiring 

oh yeah for those new here this is ez as fuck

first one is always free. so make it count!
I feel inspired to yolo my kids college fund today!
There's nothing inspiring about degenerate yolo gambling. Entertaining yea foosho tho
Sell it, pay the taxes, buy a cheap time machine, take the rest and travel back in time 4 years and buy a house
dec 2023 monthly call = dec 15.  third week of month
That's the year.  He bought 12/15 1000 calls
They bought Friday afternoon after a week of being stagnant in the low 900s. Stock is up like 15%.

Couldn't have bought at a more perfect time.

It's especially remarkable because it's not like AVGO is one of the tech stocks that took a beating and is coming back up. It just lept like 15% to fresh ATHs the last 2 days and OP bet on that.
Stock was around 943 when he bought on Dec 8. It is now 1065. 

Up over $100 in 2 trading days.
He bought those on the 8th.
Mostly luck. For every guy like OP, there‚Äôs dozens of highly regarded people who lose it all cause they bet on the wrong company. 

It‚Äôs like playing roulette and asking what does the winner know that you don‚Äôt that enables them to win like this?
[deleted]
To be fair he didn‚Äôt either.

they retested an area near prior resistance which should have been support, it did and it just moved. I'm thinking a lot of people saw this move and started buying which sent the price up. maybe even some hedge funds as i add volume on the chart they get huge burst of volume around earnings. buddy did his homework!
There is no spacing between the 0s in my figures. The reason they appear rounded is because I am using a very sophisticated algorithm that takes into account the viewer's perceptual biases.
Plenty of ppl on twitter pumping this I‚Äôm not surprised
I was just thinking this today when I saw my avgo holding pop again. OP's post history indicates some large trades, but he often does spreads. Has me wondering if he did something similar here to cap is risk but also the reward (and that we're only seeing half of the trade). 

&#x200B;

Still, holy smokes if OP was still holding just a portion of that call. Unreal.
options, don't play around with them, unless you're a degenerate gambler, it's not like regular stocks where you have something at the end of the week, it's like going all in in a poker game when all you have is a pair of pocket 2's, the flop is an ace, a queen and a king, and the river is a queen.
Options. You're in WSB
The gains do seem a bit suspect. Such differentials are rare. This wasn't even that OTM.
To make it easier you can just Venmo me any money you plan on lighting on fire
This is the way
billion
Correcto
You belong here, I guess
Pesos
Poor bastard.
Someone unironically needs to ask OP for some proof because his gains are clearly fake AF. Am I the only one who is going to point out how unlikely it is that both his gains and position value are perfectly round numbers ending in all zeros. OP is some teenager Larping who‚Äôs too dumb to even make a believable fake post.
[removed]
Congrats and fuck yeah
Finally something I can relate to in this sub
3 shares yesterday 3 shares today
-$5000.00
yeah lord spare this guy the misery and just take his life and money
For real. $500k is a life changing sum to some people, bank that shit.

At least waste it all on H&B.
He already said he cashed out today
Agreed!
Diamond hands until 12/16 or GTFO.
Don‚Äôt fall for the tortilla on the side trap. Costs extra now and is like 300 cal
I'm sitting here looking at my -$3,800 doge coin "portfolio"
Damn you can afford Chipotle? Baller
Think of it like Roulette.

Normally, the stock market is like approaching with $100, but only betting $5 a spin; if your number/color comes up more often than not, you win a bit, if it's not, you lose a bit. If you're _really_ unlucky you can lose it all, but chances are it won't happen all in a row.

Think of what OP did like putting $100 on red, winning, then putting _all_ the money back into red.  Over and over again.

If it keeps winning, the payout is _astronomical_.  But 99% of the time, that's a horrible strategy because all it takes is one bad spin to lose it all.

TL;DR:  OP is a god, but don't do what he did and expect to actually make any money.
You are now a mod of /r/wallstreetbets
if you're regarded, and wish to be highly regarded, throw everything into Options, it's like gambling, but for true degenerates when they know nothing about anything.
Wall street scratch offs
Same
you have the option to learn
We‚Äôve got ourselves the new head of the FTC
For your own sake, keep it that way and run from this place
Same. I don‚Äôt have the knowledge, the money or the balls to dump money into them. I‚Äôve seen people make decent profits even when they are throwing ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù levels of money at them but I just can‚Äôt figure them out
Trading in December is fine as long as you set aside money for taxes before Jan 1
He won‚Äôt be able to help himself because he thinks it can turn to 77M
Only trade for a loss in Dec. to lower your tax obligations.
My most profitable position were bought in December. Don't sell in December, just buy.
i am aware it‚Äôs all going to uncle sam but i did it for the thrill
I have been donating AI generated NFTs. I sold like 100 of them for $3 dollars a piece to get the FMV and then generated and donated 200K to various charities.
Or, risks it all for some aggressive trading (or a large portion) if he loses it before Dec 31st, he won't owe jack shit.  But he could turn it into a lot more.  OTHERWISE, he would pay taxes, then lose the difference if he traded it away afterwards.  

I would rather take the risk before having to pay the tax, not after.  if he makes it into say 2 mil or 5 mil or even more (pure luck I am sure) then he will then just pay the taxes, BUT theoretically he would have less "risk" as paying the taxes on it then risking it is just taking possible profit off the table.
I bet I can do that
The IRS wins because he just generated $500,000 in taxable income, putting him in the highest federal tax bracket
options for $100?
‚ÄúTheta Gang‚Äù
Well assuming the call was stock-backed, it doesn't actually cost the counter party anything besides missing out on the profit that this person made minus the premium.  

If it wasn't backed, I hope you have nice lips.
They do. They sell Covered Calls and Puts both. They just keep the stockbase stable. They earn ether way and the price doesn't matter at all. Everything is hedged.
Yea they still win. This is an expense for them. Or ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù on their profits
Ya, it is like asking a Bookie if they lost money when a 5000 to 1 event pays out. The answer is technically yes, but they will come out ahead the other 4999 times, so it more than makes up for it.
wait.....it's not possible for everyone to profit right? someone has to tank a loss for sure or do i not understand options well?
I think you severely underestimate the morons in this sub who bet their entire life savings, their retirement funds, their kids college funds, EVERYTHING, into a bet that goes under and lose everything. I love those posts. Makes me feel better about working
No, he bought options, not sold them. The worst case scenario is you wait for them to expire out of the money and their value goes to $0. He had until 12/15 for the price to go above $1k and be in the money. AVGO went up a bit more today so now they'd be worth ~700k.
What's er?
Please help me find this video

Yes. Did we stutter bitch?
Yeah and they're going to turn it into dogshit just like everything else they acquire.  I guess in the short term they're extracting some great value for the shareholders though.
Explain?
Only 239k haha what a fucking chump
Why? Explain like im regarded
he shouldn't of made that mistake
Good bot
irrelevant. He bought on 8th Dec..
He made 250k on AVGO puts 3 months ago lol. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16og88o/avgo\_gains\_closed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16og88o/avgo_gains_closed/)
Serious. Unlike that meta puss
Because I refuse to believe that someone on this sub profited off the market legitimately.
Can you explain what options he bought im so confused
> every 100 that tries something like this, 99 of them lose

I like this odds
I‚Äôve witnessed that myself first hand ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I‚Äôm also regarded. Could he have gone in the negative and owed money? Or, only lost the 11k?
Yeah I fucked around with like $20k in 2022 and found out. Now I stay away and just spend that money on life instead (it was a nice realization I could ‚Äòafford‚Äô to lose that money)
but that's not what options are right? that's just regular trading?
Nah
Now he can turn that 500k into billions on his next move!
Why squander the time travel ability you might as well go back further and just mine thousands of bitcoin
How much were you willing to lose all 11k?
This is the best explanation in this whole thread. 

The hard part or the reason why more trades like this don‚Äôt happen often is because it‚Äôs not easy to guess exactly when a stagnant stock or one getting beat will BREAKOUT.

i need plays that expire in 2 weeks just like this one

you think we get an nvidia rally?
It sucked so bad.
Was talking about big dreams and what to do with that Money with the wife.

A few days later, WAAAAAHP.
Watched it drop. -$95,000.
-$60,000. -$120,000. Etc. that whole day.
Nothing mentally prepares you to watch your portfolio move by the TENS of THOUSANDS of dollars in a matter of seconds or minutes.

I was frozen. SURELY it‚Äôll stabilize and swing back up. 

LOLnope.
Yea I even saw an article with a title about a cool company with the ticker avgo I kid you not. It‚Äôs getting pumped hard rn
Was the risk 11k or more than 11k
10% OTM. Is a lot for one week to expiration

If you look very, very closely, it looks like the second and third 0 are spaced differently to the third and fourth, in open market gain on the first pic

& in Open, at the top, it‚Äôs the same spacing problem but the other way around
He bought and sold 100 contracts with limit orders at 1.10 and 53.50. Not market orders. I use limit orders myself at set prices and set gains. He made a big gain and set a limit order to sell at 53.50 and it executed. Simple as that. Looks legit to me. Contract traded higher today and closed at over $73. OP left almost $200k on the table.
It‚Äôs like when you stop the gas pump right at a whole number, but with selling options
That's how options work dumbass
The brokers round up for you üòÉ /s
Uhhmmm you clearly have no idea what you're talking about. This is totally legit and there's nothing even suspicious about these numbers.
Actually with options it is very common for your cost basis and gains to be an evenly rounded number because the contract bid ask sometimes has a minimum spread of 5 cents.  So if you try to buy calls for $1.07 it would be $107 per contract but you can actually only bid in 5 cent increments so you would have to bid $1.10 or $110 per contract.  Which is exactly $11,000 for 100 contracts.  Same with when you sell.

500k is life changing for 90% of the planet mate
If I can pay my rent on Jan 1st it will be life changing.
That's like +2250$/month with a HYSA alone. It would definitely mean not having to work again for me, as I'm disabled and bills are low. Though id probably still work a few years, have an extra 75-100k in interest and buy a home. Some day, congrats to OP!
Yea, that $300K or so after taxes would be enough to settle down somewhere with cheap rent and live comfortably for a decade.
Save some for taxes though!  After tax won‚Äôt be quite that much but still life changing money.
I read that as ‚Äòwaste it all on SHIB and spit out my coffee lol
$500k is life changing to anyone that is not already pretty rich

No shit? Was telling my friend the other day that he should never buy a burrito cause he can just get tortillas for free.
I looked up the stock it shop up from 900 to 1000 in the last month, so he bought a bunch of contracts saying the stock would go up? But why did it go up such a crazy percentage wise, I thought with puts and such the most you could do was 200 percent?
I laughed out loud

Oh thank God, so I‚Äôm not alone on this one lol
For real tho what did he do
I'm fucking dying rn
I just go into a casino, throw chips on a table and say "Do something with that."  The dealer takes the chips and just continues to do whatever and I walk away.

Options are no different.
I‚Äôm in.
its like gambling, but only for the truly regarded.
time spent learning is time you could have used buying FDs
Do I need to learn a hundred things at expiry?!?! I sold that educational call to this idiot.
Trading in December is fine if you're not regarded and know how wash sales work**

fixed it for ya
Trading in December is fine, so long as you're ~~gambling~~ investing with your HSA funds
And with the rest you buy SCHD.

Wait, this is wsb.
Don‚Äôt have to pay taxes if your stocks only go down. SMRT fml
Far from all of it. What is your income tax rate? That's what you'll have to pay
After tax you can pop the rest in a 5% account and make like 19k a year on it for just sitting there.  It's not f-u money but still better than losing it here haha.
Nah you‚Äôre good bro. You keep like 60% as long as you put that shit away. Congrats! Pop a bottle for me
trade in your roth ira next time like i do :)
Hello sir. I am your Uncle Sam. Hand it over now..
Learn how marginal tax rates work, then reevaluate your comment.
~~The vast majority of options contracts are not held to assignment, they are closed early.  So there are almost certainly folks on the other end of OP's position who took realized losses.~~

Edit: Whoops, I posted this in reply to the wrong comment..
They'll still win because they'll buy OPs calls back at the bottom of the spread and resell the same option to ten more regards on here at the top of the spread.
Options are zero sum. The covered call seller hits max profit at the strike price, and the call buyer reaps any remaining gains that the seller would otherwise have made on the underlying.
Only need one chance right
It grounds me. It's crazy money but crazy risk. I'd rather work and do the time for a secured 11k than throw it all way. That feeling sucks worse than all.

I agree that the company will likely turn whatever it acquires into dogshit, but in the short term shareholders will benefit from the increased value of the company.
VMware is already dogshit
They‚Äôd just bought VMware, it wasn‚Äôt exactly hidden.
It would normally be stupid to lose out on 4 month's interest on 200k+ because at 5%, that will be more than 3k dollars. But there is a good chance that OP has a gambling problem, and may lose the tax money on a bet, and then end up owing much more to IRS later. Plus, what's a 3k profit to OP? Means nothing.
We're in December. Unless OP loses all them gains by Dec. 31st they will owe hundreds of thousands in tax. Here's how it generally goes... Op goes into Jan. 1st with most of his gains, the 200k owed to taxes is a sure thing now but he then continues to try and make more. Loses hundreds of thousands before April. Still owes 200k to uncle sam he doesn't have. Uncle Sam (IRS) doesn't forget this ever, they can also garnish wages and do a whole lot of things that typical debt can't. Bankruptcy also won't wipe it. Happens to business owners and celebrities all the time let alone strike it rich guys on WSB.

I mean, theres multiple articles talking about potential from the 7th, 8th, so on. Here are two of them, one specifically mentioning it passing 1k on the 8th.

Ya that‚Äôs called YOLO
In a few months we‚Äôre gonna read a Bloomberg article about some regard making 7 figures off inside trading AVGO and was caught because he kept posting it to WSB üòÇ
He‚Äôs probably got AVGO on watch and is betting MA‚Äôs and RSI levels
AVGO 1000$ calls.
Only lose 11k.
Nah short selling can drive you deep in debt because you are in fact borrowing shares and those shares may end up becoming a lot more expensive and you end up needing to add new cash to give them back. Oh also naked selling of options (without collateral, without actually having the cash or asset) you do it to earn income from premium payments but if they actually get exercised, it can get real ugly. He was just buying here, not selling.
I did that with 4k one monday, got amc options, went all the way to 50k, didn't sell, like an idiot, and walked away with 2k by friday
Options are a bit like stock, except they are contracts to sell or buy 100 stocks @ a certain price. 

So you can have a contract (call option) to buy 100 [stock] @ [price] on [date]. You can imagine that contract will be worth a lot if the price goes higher than the price that is on the contract. 

Now you sell the contract to someone else and make a profit. That's option trading. You're buying and selling an _option_ to buy 100 of a stock at a certain price with a specific date of sale.
RIP king. Still a warm hole.
i mean it was a week out.  at worst theta -50% by weds if avgo stood flat and i may or may not have given up / or double down
You think gambling should be tax free?
I‚Äôm wondering the same about nvidia. I believe amd will climb until eoy though
So I wonder if shorting is the move since this has been on fire breaking all time highs plus you know what possibly coming
The risk was $11k but it‚Äôs not all or nothing. He could sell at all loss before the options expire
This is not the way
Nah he‚Äôd be spending $100k on some OF girl just to have her block and roast him
omg that‚Äôs fucked up where are these pics of his ex wife?
This is the only way to interpret spending power
He'd update with a pic of him and his new McLaren, but the custom paint is on back-order still.
You're right, they are! I'm so smart and observant.

He needs to hold back his power so he doesn't make TOO many gains and leaves some shares for the rest of us

Gambling with HSA funds is a terrible idea and you will almost certainly lose all of your money.
Sensible advice. Ban.
Nah. Drop half in SPY and half in SCHD. That is what I did.
Gamblers cannot do this. It's pathological, like sky diving or wing suits. People do it because they need the rush, not because it's intelligent to jump out of a perfectly good plane.
Wait what the fuck why does nearly half go to the state? Are US taxes on steroids or something?
Can you even do options in your Roth IRA?
I did, and lost it all. Now I can't claim any of it.
I understand just fine, everything after $231,250 of income for an individual is taxed at 35%. If this is his only income for the year he‚Äôd owe $150,000 in federal income taxes alone‚Ä¶
Assignment is not really the topic here I think. Even if they closed early, if the other party had a covered position then some of those stocks got sold and money was transferred. So the other party just lost out on the gains (or gave them to OP), but didn't actually lose anything themselves (and maybe even gained something from the premiums?).
I was thinking that. Posts like this should come with a huge disclaimer for newbies, ‚Äúdo not buy these contracts now that you saw this post. It can and will go the other way after this post‚Äù
Then in this scenario... who loses? OP is making bank, Citadel still sells their shares at a profit at the strike price (although not as high as it would have been just holding original shares), but there is still a deficit somewhere.

Like every other developed country, the US has progressive tax rates.

Assuming this is taxed as income (I just looked this up, stuff that‚Äôs held for a year or more is taxed as capital gains) it would essentially be added onto whatever salary he made for the year. He‚Äôs going to rapidly fill out each bracket since this is such a large sum of money. 

For most ‚Äònormal‚Äô incomes US taxes are quite low. However to the tax man he basically just made a salary of ~$500k + whatever his normal job makes, so he‚Äôs going to be filling out the higher brackets and therefore is paying a higher effective rate. 

The issue is I don‚Äôt think a brokerage is going to withhold money. Most people end up getting a tax refund as the withholding  on normal income paychecks overshoots the actual tax liability, but in this case he‚Äôs going to have to pay the tax on this come April out of pocket. So people say to set some aside, like doing withholding manually.

how else can we continue bombing brown children and not helping our citizens at all?

Yes, but you won't be able to do short calls or margin cash secured puts. You can do long anything.
Oh, so just 11k into 350k? Damn. Not worth it. ^/s
And? He's still walking with 350k profit. Woe is me. I pay much more than that in taxes every year between income tax and payroll taxes for my employees.
So dump my life savings on puts? Sorry I'm new here
Take all of my savings. All $50.
 They‚Äôd just bought VMware, it wasn‚Äôt exactly hidden.
It‚Äôs a contract to be allowed to purchase something at a specific price, in this case, stock of AVGO at $1000. You can imagine if you had a contract like that, and AVGO went to, say, $1050, your contract would be worth some money.

The way they‚Äôre priced is very complicated but it‚Äôs basically placing a bet that the price of a stock will be a certain price on a certain date. The value of that contract is what you make money on. Someone was willing to pay OP 500k for the contracts to AVGO because they could turn their $500k into $600k or something, because they ‚Äúexercise‚Äù the contract, buy AVGO for $1000, then sell for $1050 (or whatever the price was) and make the difference (minus the cost of the options).
He could have lost -50%. How can that be done every week?
My dad figured out French fries are cheaper on the app, and his friends love him for is tech savvy knowledge
No one tips at chipotle. I save 5 dollars by tipping 3.

These people are easily trainable. Win win.
Basically every bet works that way. The less likely something is to happen, the higher your payout if you bet on it and it actually happens. 

You can bet that Apple stock will be up 1% a week from now. Totally possible, not a lot of money to be made with options. Now if you want to bet that it‚Äôll be up 10% a week from now, you could make a ton of money if it actually happens, but it‚Äôs relatively unlikely.
The options would be worthless so unless you bought on leverage, you‚Äôre down 11k (cash)
With OPs luck, the market would tank that very day giving them an even bigger windfall lol
Can't you just pay 100% of what you paid the prior year instead?
[VOO and VTI (and probably SPY too) in effect have a 0% ER.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-05-17/meet-the-portfolio-manager-overseeing-1-trillion-video)
CA more than 40%, less than 50%

Pain
We have no capital gains taxes in Texas.
What the fuck are you talking about. CA is like 13.5 max. Are you combining federal and state?
The ‚Äúsystem‚Äù is called ‚Äúability to pay‚Äù. Which he has atm, until if and when he punts it away prior to paying his uncle off. Not hating though that was an incredibly sick trade OP congrats - so sick to the point I had to do a little deeper dive and be like wait wtf how?!?!? It‚Äôs legit, numbers check out, he ain‚Äôt fronting. Could be but not wrong bout the numbers and numbers don‚Äôt lie. He bought roughly $75/share below call target, sold roughly $75/share above target with theta/time remaining. On 10k shares that‚Äôs about a 1.5M swing in share price x shares. Not insane that the options rose about 33% of that total rise (500k) or 67ish% of above 1000c target (500k). Not sure about the breakeven price but guessing the half a million was +/-100% of that‚Ä¶ thus the breakeven price was probably about $1,025+/- per share. That‚Äôs how it works folks. We just wish we were him. He must be basking in the I am him moment he‚Äôs got himself in right now. Good shit
"You keep 60%"

"At most OP will pay 30-70%"

That's right. 60+37=97%. Just shy of 100%. So yes, people do know what they're talking about. They just round because it's easier.
Unless they live in California, then it could be up to 50% (37% fed, 13% state.)
Why webull over fidelity?
Considering the amount of risk people put up with options, and the fact that you can only use losses over $3000 per year to offset other gains, yeah it‚Äôs something to consider.
60% of the time it works
Sexplain?
But if OP had a contact for 100 AVGO at $1000, isn't that $100,000? So does he pay $11k for that price point guarantee?

Then when ACGO goes to $1050 that's $105,000, why would someone pay $500k for that contract?
Infinite money if you only lose 50% at a time
so was it obvious that the stock would go up or just actual gambling?
If you made roughly the same amount, sure.  If you had a windfall or your income significantly increased, they want taxes paid at the end of the same quarter.
He held his options for like 4 days. Ain‚Äôt nothing long term about that regard. Taxed as ordinary income. Denser than your mothers Christmas fruitcake
Idk regard. What‚Äôs your intuition telling you lmao. Some of y‚Äôall denser than solid granite
[deleted]
because some of my trades happen when i'm taking a shit and i'm more familiar with the mobile ui. :^)
AVGO is VMWare‚Äôs findom
Maybe easier to think of it in terms of a single option. A single option relates to 100 shares of the underlying stock. OP paid $110 for a single contract. The contract is now worth $5350. If you bought one of these contracts you‚Äôd be able to buy 100 shares of AVGO at $1000 which would be worth $100k. So you‚Äôd spend $105350. At the price of $1050, that wouldn‚Äôt be profitable(you‚Äôd be negative $350), but the reason people are willing to buy the contract at that price is because it hasn‚Äôt expired yet, so they must expect the price to continue going up before expiry, allowing them to profit. That, or it could be people who have the opposite position and want to correct it. Again, pricing of options is a pretty complicated function that has a lot of variables.

Edit: also the reason OPs gains are so stark is because it was highly unexpected movement of the underlying stock value. Betting on a 6% swing in a short amount of time is priced very low because it‚Äôs less likely. Then it came true. That‚Äôs why people equate options trading with playing the lotto.
1 contract = OP has the right to buy 100 shares at 1000 strike price per share (because it's in the money, aka share price went above 1000 strike price)

the contract OP bought on Dec 8 was for a price of 1.10 (per share). We know 1 contract is for 100 shares, so really that means a single contract cost a total of 100 shares x 1.10 per share price = 110 (plus some small broker fees unseen here).

They didn't buy 1 contract tho, they bought 100 contracts. That's 100 contracts x 110 contract price = 11,000 for all the contracts. And that's 100 contracts, with each contract saying they can potentially buy 100 shares per contract = 10,000 shares total at a guaranteed 1000 dollars per share. This price is fixed, per the contract..

Share price right now is sitting at 1072, so they could technically exercise the 100 contracts (buy 10,000 shares) at 1000 dollars per share, and turn around and sell each share on the open market for 1072. That's 1072 (them selling) - 1000 (them buying) = +72 per share x 10,000 shares = +720,000 profit if they can exercise.. minus the 11,000 fee they paid for the contracts themselves, so not a bad return at all.

Alternatively, the contracts originally valued at 1.10 per share now go for 53.50.. so if they don't have the cash to buy and sell all those 10,000 shares (10k shares x 1000 dollars = 10mill), they could just sell the contracts for 53.50 each. 53.50 - 1.10 = 52.40 x 100 contracts x 100 shares = 524,000 return.

Hopefully that makes sense.
He bought 100 calls. So 5k x 100 = 500k
That's the fun - it's always gambling. But it's not necessarily blind gambling. Some people do crazy amounts of research into a company's valuations, what business they're doing, and what upcoming news might lead people to think the stock is worth more (driving the price up like this).

So it can, in the best cases, be an informed gamble - kinda like counting cards. The catch of course is that many of the best sources of info for making an informed decision also qualify as insider trading - if you expect a stock to go up because you know someone who's drafting their quarterly report and they tip you off, you just go to jail for cheating (unless you're in Congress).
Yes.
Wrong.  Google ‚ÄúSafe Harbor Rule Tax‚Äù

If you pay 100% of your prior year tax liability or 90% of your current year tax liability, you avoid underpayment penalties.

https://www.irs.gov/payments/underpayment-of-estimated-tax-by-individuals-penalty
There's a provision for windfall as long as you didn't have a liability prior year to prevent a penalty
So you will get the interest penalty? Don't really care what they "want" me to do...just want to not pay until I must to avoid penalties.
Texas has no state income tax.
I never assumeanymore, I just get burned. Your statement wasn't clear.
It doesn't matter how good of an accountant OP has, an accountant isn't going to be able to write down short term gains. There's just practically nothing that's deductible against it. OP is going to get raked over on taxes this year.
Best reason i can think of lol
I cannot believe WeBull doesn't have this listed as a product differentiator from competitors. What a missed opportunity.
Thanks, this was really helpful. Seems super risky - if the price didn‚Äôt go that high, no one would any of his contracts, so he‚Äôd be out $11k then?
This is a real helpful, detailed and understandable explanation. Cheers! :)
Thank you and the previous posters. Was wondering this also.
So the $11k is the contract fee? He paid that to be guaranteed the 10000 shares at $1000? 

But now that it's $1050. Someone pays him $500k for the contract rights, and then they buy 10000 shares @ $1000 and make their money that way?
Yes, they will penalize you something like 0.5% per month.  I've paid small penalties to the state for slightly underpaying a quarter.

If you're looking at 5-6 figure windfall, that .5% can add up, and I would talk to an accountant to figure out IRAs, etc to minimize taxes and then make an estimated payment.

Yes exactly, think of a contract as an actual piece of paper. Even if you paid 110 for that contract today, that doesn't mean it will be worth 110 in 5 minutes, 5 hours, or 5 days. It depends on many different variables that influence the price (see: greeks, underlying share price, time/DTE, delta, volatility, etc on investopedia)

In OPs cause he bought 110x100=11000 a few days ago. There was a few days of time decay.. but the underlying exploded and added a ton of value. If the underlying stayed the same
price or went down, it could be worth pennies instead. The person/people who he paid the 11,000 to would have OPs money and OP would be left with a worthless piece of paper.
Yea but minus the premiums paid on both sides, buying the contracts @ this price, you would still be negative. It has gone higher as of now though.

Nailed it. Stinging.

I'm gonna use ChatGPT next time I need to lower my self-esteem.
someone needs to tell cathy woods to buy low sell high.

Also what about my neural network with 5 hidden layers?
100% correct
This is unironically the best GPT content I‚Äôve seen¬†
I do something like this at work. I‚Äôll ask copilot to find flaws in my documents / arguments. Then I‚Äôll ask for how to argue against those flaws if they are ones I intend to ‚Äúkeep‚Äù. Ready for prime time after that beating lol
killed it actually.
No shit I saw an indicator that was measuring volatility as part of machine learning but actually did nothing with it. The machine learning algo was one big bollinger band

"All math and no market sense" -CGPT 2024
Omg that's gold.
Damn...gotta say I haven't seen much discussions about ARIMA-GARCH models here. Do they work well??
GPT forgot to mention posts like "I gathered 100500 TB of historical data, set up extremely fault-tolerant infrastructure in the cloud with Docker, Kubernetes, and Mongo. How do I create a profitable algorithm?"
Now do one where it discusses actual profitable strategies¬†
This one deeply hurt my feelings üíî
This is spot on.
More like natural intelligence.
I'm laughing because my first try was indeed a 4layer NN
That hurt real bad.
Shut down!
Roast r/algotrading subreddit please


Oh, r/algotrading, the sacred temple where everyone is an undiscovered Wall Street genius with a budget of $200 and a dream. It‚Äôs like the Silicon Valley of financial fantasies‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs convinced their Python script will outsmart Goldman Sachs. The place where the phrase ‚Äûbacktest‚Äú gets thrown around more than common sense, and everyone‚Äôs a self-proclaimed expert until they‚Äôre not.

It‚Äôs hilarious how every other post is about someone‚Äôs ‚Äûrevolutionary‚Äú trading bot that can predict market moves with stunning accuracy‚Äîuntil it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the land of Reddit where people think they can turn $1,000 into $1,000,000 by running some code they found on GitHub, all while ignoring the minor detail that if it were that easy, everyone would be doing it.

And let‚Äôs not forget the endless debates about which programming language is superior for trading algorithms. Python vs. R, with Matlab thrown in for the old-school crowd. As if the language is going to make any difference when most of these bots are getting crushed by transaction fees and market slippage.

Then there are the ‚Äûgurus‚Äú who show up with their 14-step programs to financial freedom, conveniently only asking for a small upfront fee‚Äîor better yet, access to your account. Because who wouldn‚Äôt trust a total stranger on Reddit with their life savings?

In summary, r/algotrading is like a digital wild west of wannabe traders, each one thinking they‚Äôre the next big thing while mostly just contributing to the noise. But hey, at least it‚Äôs entertaining!
Damnnnn fr
Gold and right on. The new o1 model?
That is a diagnosis first, and a roast second.
It forgot add the part where people randomly ask chatgpt to roast the subreddit cause they bored and one random dude will mention "chatgpt forgetting to add" in the comment section!
Hahahaha
Totally seen. Perfection.
Spot on. For some reason most subs that have something to do with trading are insanely allergic to actually learning about markets.
Damn roasted

chatGPT even with online capability can't access reddit posts so you must have given it some things to roast in advance.
What‚Äôs the sharpe ratio and beta exposure of the 5 hidden layers tho
Haha so true!
Not the bollinger bandü§£
Shhhhh, it's Ren Tech's secret model.
Much better than neural nets imo, as a time series analytics expert. Because you can actually interpret what's happening. You can get proper market sense, if you engineer features properly.¬†
Ah yes, the "let me set up my Jira board, github repo, CI/CD pipeline, and automated horizontal scaling"-approach to writing a 10-line python script.
Have a buddy who is waaay better than me at engineering, he does kubernetes grafana stuff now. I'm BI DE.

I've had probably 10 conversations with him about devving an algo together, but none of those convos does he want to talk about... the actual algo lol
Tried it, it was actually quite good

"1. Hybrid Mean Reversion + Trend-Following: Combine low-frequency mean reversion with trend-following to adapt to different market phases.
   
2. Market Microstructure & Statistical Arbitrage: Exploit inefficiencies in trade execution and order flow.

3. Regime-Switching Models: Use machine learning to detect market regime shifts and adapt strategies accordingly.

4. Deep Learning for Feature Extraction: Apply neural networks to extract subtle patterns in volatility and momentum.

5. Adaptive Portfolio Optimization: Use dynamic risk-parity or Kelly Criterion for smarter portfolio management.

6. Agent-Based Modeling: Simulate market participants‚Äô behavior for emergent trading opportunities.

7. Asymmetric Information Arbitrage: Leverage alternative data sources (e.g., satellite imagery, social sentiment) for unique market insights. 

Skip the retail-grade strategies and go for hybrid, adaptive, and data-driven approaches"
All those stupid humans need to do is trade the 19X44 EMA cross!
Amazing! The roast generated for me was somehow superior I believe but this ai this getting wild.
It‚Äôs been trained on Reddit‚Äôs content mate¬†
Could you suggest some resources to explore this topic further?? Specifically, the application of Time Series analysis to algo trading??

A famous one: walmart parking lots more full ==> can guess quarterly reports before they are reported.
Yes?
Fuck!
It was actually just a dissertation.

My bad, phrased it wrongly.
This is the best career sub on reddit
I am not an accountant. I am an electrical engineer. My job is not as exciting as you think it is. I spend the majority of my day at a desk going over planning documents. You guys actually make really good money when compared to many engineers and a lot more than other professions considering barrier to entry. More on that below.

I have browsed all the major subreddits for careers and this is easily the best one. 

You can post freely in here about advice, resume, salary, homework, or even memes. As long as as it's nothing illegal, you're good. The EE sub is controlled by an authoritarian regime that limits posts and what memes are allowed. 

Here you can post about your night at the getting drunk at the strip club with the partner at your local CPA firm. Not something you can do at many other subreddits

Salary time. You guys seriously make fine money for a lot of you. I know there are many different types of accountants, geographic area, CPA or not, etc. but seriously $70k to $80k starting in MCOL is super solid. That's what many engineers are getting these days out of college. Many of you can hit 100k in about the same time as many engineers do. Yeah some places pay more like biotech, oil, and aerospace, but those jobs are super limited. Also WLB depends on where you work.

Don't compare yourself to others.

You guys have it good 
The problem is this sub is the best thing about being accountant. Only gets worse from here
LOL nice try AICPA you guys are really putting membership dues to good use.
This is great to hear, we've always made it a point that the community members control the community with what content is shared and discussed and the direction it takes through the voting and reporting system.

It's been important to us to maintain a stand back approach to moderation. Our main focus of action is monitoring reports and removing spam, solicitations, and addressing disrespectful and uncivil comments. Aside from that we don't like to interfere and are regular members of the community like everyone else.

I'll leave you with a favorite quote of mine from Futurama that sums this up:

>When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
>I am an electrical engineer. My job is not as exciting as you think it is.         
      
Don't worry, I know engineers and already knew your job wasn't exciting.
One thing about accountants is that we are great at sharing our thoughts‚Ä¶.in anonymity.
Marketing guy here.. i hated accounting classes at university.. never wanted to learn or become one. But i am following this one for some reason. And i agree its the best one..
Lol, you had me until the "fine money" part. See you Monday boss.
One thing I like about the accounting sub is that we're all a bit cynical. Other groups get so defensive about their professions whereas we will openly acknowledge the flaws.

For example, one time I commented that a realtor was way too invested in someone using a particular lender and maybe they were getting a kickback from it. So this loan guy jumps in all "we would Never" and "we have Ethics" and "banks are highly Regulated" like he's being personally attacked. Meanwhile in the accounting reddit, if someone in or out of the profession asks if something is sketchy, people will evaluate it based on what's described rather than jumping to "CPAs have a code of ethics!!"
I never understood why folks don‚Äôt think we make good money- sure there are always more lucrative examples but on average out of my friends group, wife‚Äôs friends group, most people interact with etc‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm usually very well set and don‚Äôt have huge risks with layoffs etc. additionally- sky is the limit as I see it. At 33 I no where believe I am close to my top earnings and do quite fine.
This is the best subreddit in existence, I can agree with that. But I shouldn‚Äôt be so surprised, since us accountants are known for being kind, incredibly attractive, charismatic, and humble. I suppose it‚Äôs just par for the course in this esteemed profession
We're all just trying to survive out there. This sub gives a reprieve from our actual jobs. lol.
Something that is wildly underrated and under the radar is that the moderators on the sidebar today are the same people who started the subreddit.

They obviously don't want to burn themselves out running it, or curating it, or running big things. Just quietly maintaining it, day over day, month over month, year over year. It's worked for them, and for us.
Found the tax partner.¬†
r/accounting really is the best
I have a ton of engineering friends and I always get surprised from their starting salary. They have a ton of technical knowledge and experience but they either get paid the same or slightly more than entry level accountants.
We need more positivity like this here
We band together when needed. 

Don‚Äôt stand for illegal activities (pizza parties excluded). 

Remember when we banded together to make a ‚ÄúA=L+E‚Äù section in that Reddit pixel art thing. I was sitting at my desk placing my little bricks like clockwork. We defended our spot for so long.
[deleted]
I am not an accountant either but an industry that share some similarities of :overworked and underpaid, chronically understaffed, ruled by favoritisim üòÇüòÇ
This means a lot, thank you :) it can seem bleak when you spend too much time on this subreddit with all the stories, so it‚Äôs easy to forget about the good parts that come from this profession.
I see what you're saying but it seems the only option to get good money is to get a CPA, which I don't think I have what it takes to do.  I also got into this career bc I didn't know what to do and my parents suggested it and I wouldn't know what to switch to.

Idk maybe I'm just depressed lol.
Your whole post was comparing us to engineers and you end on "don't compare yourself to others."
i switched careers and hated being a CPA, and this is still one of my favorite subreddits.
I work around a lot of EEs in my industry. I can confirm I‚Äôm 100% cozier. They‚Äôre 10000% smarter.
Would be better if we changed the lame ass logo
Lol. Fine money. Shit, I had to tell the bathroom kiosk guy at the mall that I can't put in a new bathtub yet cause I still rent. I'm a poor staff accountant.
Oh. Wow. Thanks, OP. This is the validation we were seeking. And from someone who knows nothing about the profession, no less. 

Neat_spiderman.jpg
Sounds like that EE sub has totalitarian dictatorship vibes...lmfaoo! ü§£üòÇ
Nice try Aprio partners ü§£‚ò†Ô∏è

No way in hell engineering has busy seasons. Yes I said seasons bc from what I‚Äôm hearing busy season never ends in public now. Pay is ok for hours, nothing to brag about. You‚Äôll reach upper middle class and cap out at earnings if you want to be a good father/mother/spouse.
Can confirm. Have friends who are engineers who make about the same as me. Give or take a couple thousand.
Yea I love this sub just for the memes. It also cracks me up the number of non accountants that come for them too haha.
We‚Äôre the r/golf of career subs
I love this sub. It feels like I‚Äôm talking to my accountant friends when we vent. BTW, we all love the stability of the field.
An electrical engineer is appreciating what an accountant does. I am shocked!
Us accountants are wound up pretty tight so we have to let loose somewhere!
OP typed out what I like to call misinformation
Agreed.
Well listed points. Totally agree as well!
/r/Electricians is also great for pictures of fucked up jobsites.
As an engineer, you will want a detailed explanation of your tax return, I‚Äôm sure
POV: You live in the UK and you constantly see posts about pay and if is so much more than we get paid :((
The best üëå üëç
I work as an auditor and now accountant in industry. My side hustle is a engineer compliance support for a tech company. Is it true that to get up the engineering chain and actually take part of building requires a masters or PHD. My coworker says I do basically what electrical engineers do when they graduate?
Welcome bubba, I‚Äôm not even an accountant anymore and I still chill here.
Shhhhhhh don‚Äôt spoil the secret bro
AICPA down bad with the ads
Former accountant turned sysadmin turned CISA I do quite like r/sysadmin and r/cybersecurity.
Buddy, have you ever met an accountant?
I frequent the construction subs, a bunch of trade subs, stuff like that. It's just interesting. It's cool to see that other professions also look at this one just because it's interesting.
this is a nice post, thanks for sharing! nice to hear an outside perspective. What I like about this sub is for the most part we all agree that accounting is f***ing lame. But we do it for the paycheck and nothing else. there is certainly ZERO ego involved with being an accountant!!! but you know what is actually great that we don't discuss either - maybe because we take it for granted - but IMO it's easy to stay employed. Seriously I have tried to "retire" twice and my last 2 jobs have literally come to me when I was like "this is it, I'm done, just me and my vegetable gardern from here on out" and then bam. get a phone call with a job opportunity. then it happened again. so yeah...it's lame but it's a practical and reliable profession and the pay is pretty damn good considering how easy the work is.
r/recruitinghell
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to compare accounting to engineering; I think it‚Äôs equally unfair to compare disciplines within engineering to each other. Petroleum engineers when oil and gas prices were high and independent producers were drilling like crazy? Lots of money to be made. When the price per barrel was negative on the options market? Not so much. Nuclear engineering was hot 60-70 years ago. Chemical and electrical engineers are in high demand; not so much mechanical and computer in many markets. YMMV.
Is SEC reporting accounting?  Yes it is but no one discusses it here‚Ä¶.?
Yeah, the lost generation sub is so heavily moderated that it‚Äôs not even representative of the people that are qualified to be on it
Thanks for making me feel a little bit better about myself
It's a lot better than the IT career subs for sure.
OP advises we not compare ourselves to others. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard when you see how much your clients make. Or your other staff (I run payroll for my company). 
I still agree with OP. ‚ÄúComparison is the thief of joy.‚Äù
Idk man, working 60-80 weeks for 4-5 months of the year isn‚Äôt all that it‚Äôs cracked up to be.
I agree with you.
You're statement is one big fraudulent rant.

Engineering is a real science. Accounting is not and never will be.

Every engineering project provides tangible economic benefits and enhances social well being. Accounting is rooted in bureaucracy/compliance and always will be
Work hard play hard mothafucka!!!!!
Haha, basically. I never realized how many funny accountants there were out there. This sub makes me laugh more than most "funny" subs.
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs cool. Because the job sucks universally most places. 

When you first get into a job, you‚Äôre glad to have a paycheck. Then they keep working you and they lean out the team. 

Then you realize you‚Äôre being fucked with the pay and hours. However you also realize they fucked themselves by becoming dependent on you, so you start dropping projects, telling people to fuck off, refusing long hours, etc. 

It results in a very jaded group that are relatable because they don‚Äôt have to be as fake as other professions. 

You‚Äôre gonna fuck me on the raise and the promotion anyways. So why would I work any harder, who cares.
I remember the first year sucked so bad.  I would be on the elevator down and realized I forgot my phone on my desk but I was like fuck that I‚Äôm not going back.
Everyone on this sub sounds like Marvin the robot in Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. And this comment is a prime example.
Truth. So much truth.
God, I love this sub
This comment SENT ME üòÇ
HAAAHAHAH
I‚Äôve never noticed it before‚Ä¶ and much like a good accountant it, if you‚Äôre not thinking about them they‚Äôre probably doing a good job‚Ä¶

Yall are a good moderation team never hear shit talk about yall

Thanks for that! So many power trip moderation groups on this site. Luca would be a proud boy
I mean this as the highest form of praise when I say that I‚Äôve never thought about you once. Keep up the great work
I have been in a lot of career sub reddits over the years. I genuinely do believe this is the best considering activity and size of this one. I make new accounts every now and then so my account age isn't old, but a lot of them are too serious. All jobs suck to a degree so having a place to unwind and bitch about what's happening in our jobs really helps a lot. 

I see a lot of posts on many sub reddits saying "I wish I studied engineering, nursing, accounting/finance, or anything that else that will allow me to actually afford to live while having disposable income."
Given the major issues with accounting recruitment I'm surprised the b4+ haven't tried shutting this down.

Great work you've done building such an active community as I'm personally feeling more and more convinced I am not missing out by going out and starting my own business as opposed to going through the accounting route
I‚Äôve been in and out of this sub for 4-5 years, never seen the mods be unfair or do/say anything stupid. Thank you and keep up the good work!¬†
Thank you for the good work guys!!!
Been on here since less than 1,000 subs and just want to say thanks for managing it so well. Pizza party for you¬†
The best referee is the one that‚Äôs unnoticed
I work exclusively with chemical engineers and they make my job look exciting üòÆ‚Äçüí®
I dunno, I personally found it quite shocking to hear.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüëç
Depends. Going big 4 you can make 100k after two years assuming you pick up senior. It‚Äôs only up from there.
By gawd it‚Äôs almost like we had professional skepticism preached at us for 4+ years üòÇ
Agree. Every field has their scum bags!
The vast majority of conversations around disappointment in compensation are from people in the first few years of their career still in public accounting working excess hours not knowing where their future is leading and misunderstanding that a career lasts ~40 years.

For some reason a big misconception has evolved believing accountants make great money straight out of college. That has never been the case for the profession, which has consistently shown that it typically takes ~5-7 years to start earning at the level society thinks all accountants make.
Agreed.

I have a pretty diverse professional friend group: IT/SWE, CyberSec, accounting, finance, marketing. All of us central Florida. Roughly the same YOE give or take 1 year. All of us from UCF or USF. 

We (accounting) are consistently at the top comp-wise, except we sometimes trade places back and forth with the CyberSec guy.
It's their little garden of shit posts.
Well, almost all the moderators in the list, there was one more at the top, but their name seems to slip my mind!
>As for the profession, yes, some people work dog shit hours with unrealistic expectations. But here's the thing; they do it to themselves! You can work at a smaller firm. You can work in tech. You can work for the federal government, a municipal, or a hospital. You can do audit, tax, FP&A, finance. You can pivot to an entirely different but tangential role like supply chain or procurement. 

Will this continue to be true? The only thing keeping me going as a student is the hope that I can find something reasonably chill with ok pay, and I'm worried about B4 outsourcing/layoffs making it harder to get into those roles.
Honestly overwork and underpaid is a consistent theme in the workforce anymore as it is.
I don‚Äôt have a cpa and I‚Äôm making $170k a year as a controller. My advice is work your way to small companies, big companies want big 4 cpas, small companies don‚Äôt even know what the big 4 is.
I don't know you, but if you made it through an undergraduate accounting degree, the odds are good that you are capable of getting the CPA. I know it's a pain to take more classes, and pay for them, and it's a pain to study for the tests, but I believe in you. It has been so helpful for my career. I wanted to have higher income because my partner went from a lower income career (teaching) to being self-employed and (first handyman/now electrician). So I wanted the stable income and powered through it. Honestly I have ADHD and using the Vyvanse my doctor prescribed helped me. But you don't have to have medication, you do have to have commitment. Dedicate all of your time outside of work to the credits and then studying for the tests and YOU CAN DO IT. I had a master's and took the tests the first year out of school so I could get the credential so my salary progression without it vs with it can't be measured easily, but I know that I got a promotion in public, a new job, and two promotions at my industry job with it.
I failed FAR 2x and REG 1x back in 2021. Gave up and just worked 2022-23 and didn‚Äôt attempt or study for exams.

Studied and took FAR in March 2024, found out I passed with a 91 couple weeks ago.¬†

Take your time to study for the CPA exams and truly understand the topics before you take the exam. Don‚Äôt rush it. I spent like 3.5 months studying for FAR while working full time and still had a social life outside of work/studying.¬†
I know you can get yours. I have one and I‚Äôm not great at it.
Another option is FP&A, generally they make decent money and don‚Äôt care about CPA certification.
I don't have a CPA and I made it to senior to public, quit and made it to manager in industry. Pay is ok, hours can be shit sometimes but with this career you make sacrifices for stability. No one cares that I don't have a CPA as I'm in a more operational than technical job. In other words, I work with systems and processes more than guidance.
Nope, I don‚Äôt have a CPA and I make the higher end of controller salary range. We have 4 controllers and 2 of us don‚Äôt have CPA license, we worked our way up.
What‚Äôd you switch to? Longer I‚Äôm in this job the more I want to try something else out, but I‚Äôve yet to find a career im qualified for and pays me enough to keep my lights on.
Fr get rid of that stupid shit. Never seen anyone wear a hat like that
I just came back from a trip to the UK. While there I decided to look up wages for shits and giggles. My God, you guys get paid PEANUTS compared to us. How in the hell are you affording to live out there?! 

My jaw dropped when I saw the UK wants to pay entry level staff accountant salaries for a CPA senior position. Unbelievable.
Your*
None of us have ever met each other but we‚Äôve all been bonded by a shared trauma of busy seasons . Hell I haven‚Äôt done accounting work in 10 years and I still feel part of the gang
One interesting thing I‚Äôve noticed is that a lot of weird artsy people with a twisted sense of humor end up in accounting. It‚Äôs a safe career and often a backup plan when your creative gig falls through, if you‚Äôve got half a mind for numbers. 

I just wanted to write stories for a living. :(
Most of the people I work with are super funny people, in a twisted way. I think that's part of what keeps us sane... The dark sense of macabre humor always pulls us back from the edge when things are at their bleakest. 

A sense of humor is sometimes all we have. I'm done going home during tax season and crying because I'm so effing exhausted. I find something funny every day, because human nature is inherently funny.
[deleted]
That's how it should be, we're all just a bunch of anonymous accountants finding community together through our shared profession.
That would require the partners to know what Reddit is and to care about what the peons say or think‚Ä¶
I did this myself. If by only up you mean to the roof to eventually jump off your spot on.
real estate definitely is high tier scumbag factor compared to other professions, as do most low barrier to entry fields unfortunately
And also know literally nothing but expect to be paid as if they came from MIT and are working at google. 

Been there myself.
Never understood why people in this sub in their first 2-3 years of PA who make 60-80k a year think they‚Äôll be making 60-80k a year for the rest of their lives
The problem with accounting is that switching is harder than I would have expected. 8 years in tax and absolutely sick of it. My skillset doesn‚Äôt translate to much else without going back to making 80k. All my friends who did marketing or sales, engineering, switch around and get huge pay raises in the process. One of my friends went marketing and has done two different things in those 8 years and makes roughly 30% more than me still and I gave 8 years to tax.
There's also the (West Coast) Canadians in HCOL areas racking up student loan debt from universities and CPA PEP debt from their workplace until they realize the pickings are slim for accounting jobs making over CAD$90k with upward mobility unless you start your own practice or move.
The biggest slacker of all of em :) Got laid off.
[deleted]
This was my thinking while I was studying for the CPA years ago. I've met some downright stupid (while in college at least) CPAs before, and if they can do it so can I!
It‚Äôs not easy to get into FP&A as an accountant. Maybe when the job market gets good it will be, but right now a lot of the FPA positions I‚Äôve looked into all require financial modeling experience.
I definitely will explore other career options that are possible with this degree. I don‚Äôt want to make any drastic decisions about going back to school.
I guess the issue is less about the cpa and more if wondering maybe if it‚Äôs not for me. I was heavily encouraged by parents for it and never really knew what I want. I kind of enjoyed some parts of my financial accounting classes but other than that idk. So that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs tough. I‚Äôm prob gonna speak to people however.
firefighter
Thanks asshole
That‚Äôs a really interesting observation.  A lot of people I went to school with said that they chose accounting because it was ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and they didn‚Äôt know what else to do.  I wanted to be a comic book artist lol
That is me, oddly enough. I'm a guitarist, and I figured I'd be the next Eddie Van Halen by now. Instead, I'm Milton from Office Space.
I feel seen.  Anthropology major in college, forced to get an MBA/ CPA by graduating during the terrible recession in 1989.  Definitely artsy/creative but with a very practical bent.
I believe it. I was taking accounting classes at community college and there was a decent number of folks that got a degree in something unrelated and were pivoting to accounting.
Hey, wait, stop describing me.

Turned passion into a job, job killed the passion. Now I bill my 30-48 a week and get creative in my free time (without worrying too much about bills, and never worrying about finding a new job).
my parents helped lead me to this field but it‚Äôs definitely got a fair amount of flexibility to it. it seemed like the best way to still be able to control my destiny, especially since the traditional pro musician route is pretty soul crushing. i‚Äôve since worked for various nonprofits i‚Äôm passionate about and one day could do taxes and stuff for my music and artist friends
You still could.
I feel so attacked. I just accepted that I have no talent for art and kept accounting as my funding source for my side gig
This is me. But I was a music major initially. üé∂ I love telling new young staff that I play 10 instruments or blowing partners away at karaoke nights. I do find something amazing about beautiful and balanced financial statements, though.
This resonates with me : ) Glad I‚Äôm not alone
They cut one of my staff and forced a nepotism hire who doesn‚Äôt do anything. 

I didn‚Äôt finish May close and left it wide open with discrepancies across the board. 

Now they‚Äôre looking for people to fire, but they can‚Äôt fire the nepotism hire, and the rest of us are crucial. 

Yes, this is what‚Äôs going on for me right now. I‚Äôve been trying to leave but no good solid opportunity has come up.
How is an industry built on checking other people's mistakes and holding them accountable so well unaccountable?

Who's watching the watchers? Bec it seems Iike they're corrupt at the wheel
Work is work
You could go into estate planning or financial planning that requires a knowledge of tax but it doesn‚Äôt rely 100% on tax
üòÇ, we miss you!
What I meant was that I feared laid off staff accountants fleeing for government and making it harder to get in there, in the same way that laid off SWEs have oversaturated IT.
Are you already working as an accountant? Do you like it enough so far if you are?
lol you‚Äôre welcome troll
No need to lol. I do comics and tax. It‚Äôs doable.¬†
Gibby Haynes from the Butthole Surfers worked at KPMG prior to his career with the band.  I like to imagine we‚Äôre all undiscovered rock stars, quietly reviewing PBC list documents.
Same, except I was gonna be Jimmy Page. Glad I didn‚Äôt though, turns out he‚Äôs a massive creep. Lol
Failed English major here, it was when I was trying to write a novel and smoking weed nonstop and working cleaning hotel rooms for minimum wage that I decided to just sell out to a practical business degree. :C
I feel seen too. I have 17 chapters of a book on a hard drive, that I'll probably never finish. I've been a life-long musician, and I miss it... 

All things being equal, I should be in the middle of the ocean doing shark research, or in Africa on a dig... You do what life brings you to.
This was me. Had an artsy degree and moved horizontally for 10 years traveling and freelancing, then picked accounting as my backup plan and did a certificate program at a community college. It‚Äôs great in that you can do accounting anywhere in the world, any industry, and even remotely full time.
My theory is that there are very few people who get into accounting on purpose.
I do on the side but it don‚Äôt pay the bills!!

Downside to being a gay art nerd in the industry: I am well paid enough to be able to patron the theatre regularly so like why make that risk
The PCAOB is who watches the firms. But remember, the firms are there to generate an opinion for _investors_, external audit has nothing to do with being accountable for morally ‚Äúgood‚Äù activities. ESG is about as close as it gets and that‚Äôs full of fudge and paper tigers right now.

And for advisory stuff, it‚Äôs all about maximizing profit, that‚Äôs it. Auditing your practices to find gaps and inefficiencies isn‚Äôt about keeping people accountable, it‚Äôs about optimization.

When people get fired from audit findings it‚Äôs usually because they broke a company expectation, sometimes a real law. So if the companies make rules that allow legal but unsavory practices‚Ä¶ the audit is to the design, not an ideal.
Boomer logics
Not yet, but I have a job lined up for the fall.
If you wrote an entertaining comic or graphic novel that explained tax law (or accounting), I would pay a probably unreasonable amount of money to buy it!
Started guitar after the CPA exams were over and done with, and extremely sad to report that there is at least one case where this is untrue
Wow I never knew this. Love ‚ÄúPepper‚Äù
Me in college, I'm going nI to economics for the economical theories I get to ponder, unlike those stupid accounting majors!!


Me in my career: fuck Me I went into accounting without even realizing it until it was too late...
So I hear that but at a certain point when the market cant trust the financials because there are not enough qualified cpas because the "market"  didn't work since they didn't make the job palatable enough for new hires and now there aren't enough people to train/teach/available to be potentially trained what happens?

At what step does someone step in and who/what would it be?

Bec rn I'm seeing bs advice like "don't call it busy season" or "accounting is actually a very fulfilling career" though pieces being published every other day now.
Realist logics
That‚Äôs great you have a job lined up. Good luck and I hope you enjoy it more than you think you will üòä
I do Canadian Tax. ¬†Market feels too small. On the topic of tax books have you read the Pale King by David Foster Wallace?
 You're adding to my data set! üòÜ
You can‚Äôt trust the financials‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs pretty much always been the case because there are LOTS of ways to tweak them within the rules to hide weakness, especially short term.

A qualified opinion is only going to catch the worst offenses or the stupid mistakes.

Have you also considered that the FUD of ‚Äúnot enough CPA‚Äôs‚Äù is spread by these people to drive folks _into_ the profession to keep wages low? They hate competing with each other and a limited resource means they have to take actions to keep the resource. It‚Äôs just a bunch of rich people attempting to get you to do what they want regardless of the message.

Offshore and automation will solve the scut work, that chops a lot of FTE out of the process. Same thing has been happening in factories for decades. They still employ people, just not in the same roles.
Corporate logics
I‚Äôm nervous bc it‚Äôs mostly my parents that led me down this path as I never knew what I wanted to do. So I‚Äôm kind of just going through the motions. I have plans to speak with a therapist and a career counselor in the future.
I haven't! In fact, I had to look it up. It sounds like an interesting read! Thanks for the suggestion. 

I've actually read a few fun graphic novels covering even more obscure topics (I have one about Kierkegaard and another about public broadcasting), so who knows -- you might find a niche audience! Maybe one about general accounting? Anyhow, just an idea!
Fud?

I definitely hear the idea they're spreading this. Again I'm mostly doing accounting so I have a really solid (financial) back up plan.

I'm doing ‚ú®Ô∏èaccounting‚ú®Ô∏è and giving financial therapy a shot instead rn lol

Quiet quitting got me a bonus and a 15% raise
I work from home and stopped trying about a year ago. I do monthly closing entries (10 hours of work), but other than that, I hardly do anything. I take my time responding to emails, decline meetings I don't have to join, etc. Since we were acquired and there's been turnover in management, my boss doesn't know what my job involves, and is also weirdly-averse to delegation (workaholic type), so I don't get assigned to anything.  Since I'm just chilling all day with my dog, I'm holding out here until they replace me or until kids come along, maybe in another year.

Well my boss called me up today to tell me I'm doing a "great job". We exceeded targets, so I'm getting 2x my bonus (20k, target was 10k), and a 15% raise (100k to 115k).  Que sera, sera..
[deleted]
Impact>Effort is the name of the game. I barely work but since I close books and manage staff, it‚Äôs a very visible job.
Your manager sounds great. Head of the accounting function at my work emails me to say ‚Äòcan you email person x to ask them xyz‚Äô. Then ccs said person into the email. She‚Äôs an absolute goon.
It's about making impact and just being present to upper management. Hard work alone never gets rewarded lol. That's why I leave at 10AM when I realize my superiors are not at work
Sounds like this is what life is like when you don't have to bill your hours, account for every 6 minutes of your day, and have yourself judged by efficiency reports.

I've always felt that us reporting our time has nothing to do with what they actually bill the clients. Its just your batting average/OBP/SLG.
That‚Äôs great now time to never speak of it again.
love that for you, you go glen coco
I'm in the same boat as you. Truth is I do around 40 hours of work during the 5 days of close, then maybe 10 hours over the next 3 weeks. Loud speakers to notify me of Teams and emails coming in, and a mouse jiggler to stay active. My job requires a lot of access to medical records so I'm 99% sure they can't use any type of tracking software. Anyhow last 3 years I've gotten good raises and exceeded expectations on annuals. Unlike you I've made a point to answer emails asap and volunteer for any project. The thing I think I'm messing up with though is turning down promotions. I was a manager in my last company, and dropped to senior in this company purely for the full remote job. I just love the ease of the job I currently have and don't want to be over 4-5 people on a team.
Meanwhile, my managers arent delegating any work and are pissed that I ask for more work and listen to podcasts instead of staring at a blank screen
If I were you, I would turn in my resignation immediately. 

Before you do, please tell me the name of the company.  üòÇ
In the old days they used to refer to "quiet quitting" as "working"

Then cell phones became a thing and now they've got access to us 24/7
Trynna be like you
Bro are you me? Literally the same situation with roughly the same pay. Do you not get paranoid constantly that the end is near?
I always believe in a quote "When you are winning, keep your mouth shut".

I am so glad that you have been doing that. Congratulations for your achievements.
I work at audit and i usually work 1 to 3 hours a day. 12 in rare busy parts of the year. I just spend my time staring at the computer doing nothing
Some days I don‚Äôt do much but when we close a project after a few weeks or months we can net the company major savings or productivity increases (or both). One recent project we netted 300k savings across the company that will be year after year, that‚Äôs what pays the salary. 

Getting used to this was weird because all of my previous roles had been execution based with many daily tasks being repetitive. New role is more planning, development, bid and contract negotiating. So yeah as some people have said, impact over effort.
Living the dream. Proud of you.
Could I ask what industry this is?
Friend, you and I just had the exact same year. Except I changed jobs to this company, they didn‚Äôt want me to hit the open market because of my experience, yet had nothing for me to do yet. (Longer story there)

I was with it because at my old job I did basically everything. So to do significantly less while getting paid more to do it? You son of a bitch, I‚Äôm in.

Then at my one year after barely doing anything (but making a big impact whenever asked to finally do something) I got a raise and bonus.
Accountants at my org still use excel and pdfs to manually reconcile information. Some still print pdfs to look at them.

Entire management team is made up of dinosaurs so in first hour of my work day using Tableau i am able to do more than others take a week to finish.

In some cases older managers take months and still don't turn anything productive as they continue to "ctrl c+v" data in Excel while my work automatically reconciles even their books.

I do nothing 80% of the time outside of that.

Unfortunately no advancement opportunities, management is mostly an "old friends club" flipping burgers.
I could automate everyone's job but 90% of people are not willing to change or learn new applications. 
I've come to accept that and became happy to occupy 80% of my time doing non-work related tasks. Having hobbies is what keeps me going.
Meanwhile I‚Äôm over here working over time and ‚Äúneed improvement‚Äù
Dont go outing urself on reddit girlllll !! Touchwood for you and keep ur skills sharp for the next job whenever thst may be...take up some part time assignments maybe?....and delete this post !!!
This can happen.  For a long time,  I wondered why companies only give 1%-5% raises, when anyone they are giving raises to, could jump to another job and probably get a 15%-20% raise.  


Like, why would they do that?  Isn't it less expensive to pay your existing employees more and inspire loyalty, than it is to hire new people and train them?  


Well, I have the answer to that above question.  


The answer is that 90% of the professionals do not job hop, and never will.  They stay at the same company for 10 years, 20 years, etc.  The "Loyalty" a company tries to inspire is code for "We get to pay you less, drone".  


I recommend to anyone starting a professional career in most things that they want to job hop about every 3 years.
Good for you!

I'm not an accountant, but it reminds me of one tale from early on in my career.... I am a cook (chef now), and had an a-hole sous chef. It was a shit night, dishwasher didn't show, prep didn't do the work they should have... it was frustrating all over the place, and when I brought it up to the sous, he was very dismissive. So, we're mid-service, I have a stove with 8 burners and cooking all my stuff, but I'm pissed, so am leaning back against my table - back to the sous chef expediting - and kind of stewing. But I'm doing my job. He yells out, "Hey, John! Turn around and look like you care!"

So, I turn off all my burners, turn around, and say "I don't" and walked out. I went to the bar around the corner I'd usually get a post-work pint, but this was about 7:45pm... bartender says, "you look like you just finished your last exam" (we were in a college town). I said, "No, I think I just quit my job." I have several pints before getting home, and this was mid-90s, so there was a tape answering machine, and the chef left me a message, "John, it's Jo, call me back". Well, I was a bit pissed... in either sense of the term, so I just went to bed.

I woke up in the morning, put on my nicest clothes because I intended to knock on doors for a new job. But first, out of respect for the chef (who I love to this day), I stopped by to apologize for walking out. 

She said the sous called her immediately and his first words were "Chef, I fucked up". And she didn't blame me. 

Now, self-aggrandizing shit or whatever you want to call it that I was, I asked, "but what will my punishment be". She said none. I actually argued that, saying we just had two new hires, we can't let them think my behavior was proper. Ed, the GM, was our for the weekend, so she said she'd touch base with him when he came back. I worked the weekend.

So, Monday comes, and I ask if she spoke with Ed, and she said "yes, and he agrees there shouldn't be any punishment." For whatever reason, I said, "I just don't want to set a bad example to the new cooks." So, she asked me, "well, is there a day you want to be suspended?" And I was scheduled 6 days that week, so I said, "Honestly, I could use Wednesday off." And she said, "OK, you're suspended on Wednesday."

So, no raise or bonus, but doing something I still think was wrong of me, I did get a day off of my choice.
Lmao my idol
QUE SERA SERA, Y SIIIII
This is the way.
I knew a guy that worked for two large corporations at the same time during Covid late 2020 into 2021. He did it for 8 months. No one at either company knew about it. He would be double booked for meetings but would only attend one and use a medical excuse for missing the other. He made a lot of money. He should write a book about it.
i gotta get that bonus bread.
You are a legend!
LOL, lucky you! keep going
How big of a firm is tbis
Lmao... Man's living the best life. He has escaped the matrix. Infact, HE IS THE MATRIXX !!
Nice
That is awesome lol. Congrats.
r/overemployed
Well done!
Awesome. The movie office space anybody?
I had a very similar incident. Boss consistently disparages my work and my opinions/contributions are generally ignored. I was ready to leave upon receiving my annual review. Turns out I was given a great raise, bonus, and additional stock options. It‚Äôs so good that I don‚Äôt think I can leave. So wild.
Please don‚Äôt quit this even when you have kids lol. 

Just keep going until they fire you or you retire.
Sounds like the plot to the movie office space. Straight shooter right to the top.
Meanwhile in public accounting, I went over budget on a first-year audit and the senior manager was so upset he ended up leaving me a bad review and getting me put on a performance improvement plan. It was a bs plan with no set timeline or deadlines, and I had to deal with it for about 5 months, but they cited that as a reason to give me less of a raise this year.
I hate this. It gives more ammunition to the argument against working from home. If your situation is like this, keep it to yourself.
"Accounting Manager" but I don't manage anyone
Sounds like Kizaru haha
My boss just literally sent me an email a couple days ago asking me to email someone a certain question. I sent the email copying him on it and wording it the way he asked. Apparently the question wasn't good enough to get the answer he wanted, so he replied to the email clarifying the question to get the right answer. So that's five emails to get an answer that would have taken two emails had he just asked the question directly while copying me on it...smh
Taking ‚Äúyou leave when the boss does‚Äù to a whole other level.

Honestly respect, I worked for a tiny firm with no wfh and office closed at 5:30 not 5:00. The owner made a point that I‚Äôd leave at 5:30 on the dot during the slowest part of the year and how disrespectful it was to leave before him.

Needless to say I quit maybe 2 weeks later after what was probably 3 months of applying around.
lol, there was one week when my company's upper management flew out-of-state for an acquisition deal, and 99% of people decided to WFH that week... I didn't get the memo, but that's when I knew nobody really wants to be in the office and just does it to show face to leadership
Based
Solid!
As with most metrics. It starts out as a way to find where issues lie in efficiency. Then it‚Äôs only ever used to punish once they create a baseline for what they think people should be at.
Setup a teams meeting with yourself and then change your status to available. I do this everyday I don‚Äôt have anything going on or days I don‚Äôt feel like doing anything
I‚Äôm in a similar situation to yours. The last 2 years have been pretty smooth sailing. My job is pretty simple, and my manager and director both have praised my work. I feel like I‚Äôm not really working hard, maybe a couple hours of work stretched out to last a day. 

I‚Äôm on the fence of taking a promotion, the incremental pay is probably 15% more money, but the work load will change quite dramatically. I‚Äôm also getting kind of bored. Why haven‚Äôt you worked your way back up to a management role?
‚ÄúIf you got time to lean you got time to clean‚Äù
I see what you did there....
Shit, you are living the dream!!!
lol, why would he be worried he just got a fat ass raise. 

Look, I‚Äôm not going to give someone a big ass raise if I think they didn‚Äôt deserve it. Therefore, he is legit doing what they are asking of him, nothing more. Ain‚Äôt no shame in that game.
Hey buddy y u got a green dot buddy

What is this magic you speak of? I know all of the tasks I do are incredibly repetitive but I don‚Äôt know how to do it more automatically. I‚Äôm building spreadsheets of reports bc the software we account on doesn‚Äôt give reports how we want to. How can I learn to automate stuff?

‚ÄúSomehow I manage‚Äù - a Michael Scott story
Fucking rad, you have hit the sweet spot if you are into an enormous hourly wage (dollars per hour worked)

I do the same but with consulting projects. Every once in a while I get a tough one but it‚Äôs usually director/st manager level. Now I do mostly universal cog work. But doing your shit well and on time is something bosses enjoy. 

I like to work a solid 5-10 hours weekly after an initial period of intensive rebuilding of all processes involved, which is 2 months usually to get it dialed in. Then barely work and crush close. Occasionally a miracle, look I did these 100  bank tie outs for the auditors last night. Stay up late Thursday and dip out the entire Friday and golf while the kids are at school. Basking in the heroism of meeting the impossible deadline.

Then eventually reveal my plop and upload recs and JE‚Äôs and glom on to some mega project where I don‚Äôt need to do those things for a while. Mega projects have more meetings though, location freedom is diminished.
Are you at a CPA firm??
Hell yeah
Lol same
Lmao. You manage to account for things.
You manage accounting, it's the dream ü§£
Congrats, I'm happy for you! But tbh 100k is kind of low for an accounting manager.  You def deserved that raise.
That's what I call boss training.  Make it more of a hassle for them and they're less likely to ask again.
I just copy and paste the email into a new email and cc the manager in üòÇ it‚Äôs a very strange interaction
Hey.  Listen Justin.  That was necessary.
In short it's about 25% more money with 3x the work. I know if you can work up to director or vp levels it's a lot more money, but I'm a simple guy. No family I need to take care of and no desire to get one. I just don't need the money and it would just get dumped into my 401k/roth, which is already set at 20%.
I think it‚Äôs the disconnect between him and management. If you‚Äôre a director managing 20+ people, it‚Äôs kind of difficult to know what exactly everyone does. If management found out how much he‚Äôs actually contributing, he probably wouldn‚Äôt be there. I guess it‚Äôs the fear of having someone find out?
Depends on the company. Some dole out raises to everyone in good years. Then, in a down year start to take a hard look at where all the money went. Don‚Äôt make the mistake of thinking all these companies are doing things for a logical reason vs ‚Äúthis way is easier / more familiar‚Äù.
ICON?
Get/learn better tools, Tableau, Power BI, connect to your data source, create a job that can extract what you need periodically. If you cant use any of the certified data connectors or have shitty IT, learn to extract data using python or if you have a license, power automate. There is a tool for every job, just like in trades, you just need an appetite to learn them, many provide free trials which you can showcase.
I agree! I‚Äôm basically manager 2.0 and taking on so much. The worse part is I‚Äôm the capable one. Even when I train and delegate they still have to rely on me.
I took 10 paper extensions to the IRS today, took an hour total.

Billed each client 1 hour.

So I did ‚Äú10 hours of billable time‚Äù in 1 hour.

Why am I billing it like that? Because if I took 1 of them in, I would have spend 1 hour regardless.

Therefore.  17 hours in 1 day, essentially.

Chapter One: Everyone Likes The Guy That Offers Them A Stick Of Gum.
No chance. The way they hyper analyze realization, you‚Äôd never end up getting positive feedback, a raise, and bonus while quiet quitting.
That‚Äôs fair. Sounds like you are in a pretty sweet spot then.
Thanks! I have the appetite, just hadn‚Äôt heard of any of these before. I‚Äôve been working in small companies. I appreciate the recommendations. I‚Äôve started trying to learn Python. Do you have any suggestions on subreddits to follow or resources to start learning automation tools without a coding background? I‚Äôll take any and all guidance!
You work 10 hours in 1 hour? That guy on TikTok who lives 4 days in 24 hours has got to go to your seminar!
You've heard the one about the guy that dies and goes to heaven, asks God, why did I die so soon, I'm only 35? God looks at his notes and says according to your timesheets you were 120...
My firm is run by complete buffoons.

No one cares about realization.

I saw the timesheets of a coworker, 50% of the total billed time to a specific company was him ‚Äúreviewing‚Äù intern prepared work which was 20% of the total billed time.

Total number of hours was 100 hours in project.

No way in hell the intern fucked it up so bad, you had to redo the entire project‚Ä¶ twice.

Before he later gave it off to a *reviewer* himself.

I saw him prepare 1040s with no differences than last year (when he also prepared them) in 3-4x the amount of time.
I don't have formal IT training although i know web is full of courses like udemy and the likes.

I just google and youtube now, although I was forced to learn by working years in IT, next to dev and dev ops, plus nerding it out in junior and high school trying new and pirated software.
If you like it, you will pick it up, just try to learn best practices in whatever language and tools you pick up. 
If accountants knew 10% of Excel 365, their jobs would have been better even using tiny bit of macros but they prefer to insert notes, highlights and manual inputs. It's really a mind shift with or without new or old tools that already exist. If you have it, you can do it.
For the easiest and most straightforward start, get the book Automate the Boring Stuff With Python. Make sure it's the last edition. It'll give you more or less step by step instructions to build basic programs to do basic tasks.

If you'd like more flexibility and ability to mix those blocks and to build more custom programs, do CS50P. It'll teach you basic Python in general. Do the basic exercises and try the advanced ones. It'll feel like you have no idea what you're doing. That's intended: a lot of programming is searching for solutions. Every question you get had likely already been answered a thousand times: you just have to find it.

If you like to understand things you do a bit better, I'd heavily recommend to start with the first three weeks of CS50 (without the P) before moving on to CS50P. It's for C, not Python, but it'll teach you some basics about how computers and code operate that Python sources like to gloss over because Python sort of handles that stuff automatically for you, but that will bite your ass at some point when you start doing more complex things with your data.

After that, you just have to program stuff and learn as you go.
It‚Äôs about as rediculously stupid as it sounds.

But I‚Äôm also nearing hour 40 and it‚Äôs fucking Wednesday  as is.  So fuck it.
I‚Äôm at 24 true hours, 39 billed this week so not quite as good but we doin alright.

my millions will be made by opening up a shop that modifies Model Xs to have snorkels people can use to breathe from when the car is submerged
üöÄ $tsla üêÇ
Wouldn't the X have a mechanical door release? At some point as the car fills up with water the door should open
Bullish for TSLA
were supposed to believe that she drowned because she reversed way too far into a pond and made no attempt to stop or open the door/window to get out?

im not buying this at all
Should have called some San Francisco bippers, would have had those windows smashed in record time.

In all seriousness pretty horrific way to die.
She called her friends instead of rolling the windows down‚Ä¶can‚Äôt help stupid
Sounds like an iRobot scene
BULLISH! BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY!
Bro imagine dying by drowning in a pond on your ranch. Why didn‚Äôt she drive forward?¬†
So the headline wants us to believe it was the reinforced glass that prevented rescue, not the response time to a submerged vehicle. Sure üôÑ
Just about every premium/luxury car brand uses laminated glass for side windows for wind noise reduction, but it's news because Tesla.
I gotta get one of those for my wife! Step one: insurance policy on her. Step two: buy her a model x. Step three: park it next to a lake cause let's be honest she can't drive for shit so I know she'll accidentally back right into it.
And also the rescue teams were afraid to get electrocuted
Calls on Resqme tools.
That‚Äôs one of the trade offs with armor. ¬†We lost an entire M1 Abrams crew when they went into a canal. It happens.
>As her car began to submerge, Chao panicked and called a friend to explain her situation. Over the next few hours, rescuers arrived and made valiant attempts to free her.

Wait, they had *hours* and they couldn't figure it out? Like, just roll down the window or open the door with the emergency manual door lever, and swim out.
Holy shit! I just realised - these are every firefighters nightmare. Trapped in a car and you can‚Äôt split it open or break glass to get out.
Brain breaking at how dumb the commenters are, chum the water with anything slightly negative about Elon and all of a sudden people think they are smart.

I have a certification in vehicle extrication and it's nearly impossible to open a door on a submerged car. Nearly all cars that aren't manual windows will short (not just EV'S). ¬†Having weak glass is only beneficial in this one instance, it's a positive in most everything else.

Lady drove into a pond on her own property. ¬†I get so tired of the political hatred focused on everything, get a fucking life people.
Sorry but this seems like a complete failure on the rescue. They didn't have a cable long enough. How deep was this pond ?!
My Honda from 2012 rolls down the windows automatically as soon as water is sensed near the top of the engine. Does a model x, costing roughly 4 times as much not have this basic safety feature?
This is a bullshit story. The entire family literally said it's not a TSLA thing.
The article says they tried for several hours to get her out?  LOL.  What?
Sounds like the water found a way to break in.
> Angela Chao, the billionaire sister-in-law of Sen. Mitch McConnell, tragically drowned in a pond at her Texas ranch. It is speculated that she may have accidentally put her Tesla in reverse while attempting a three-point turn.
I guess this cancels out the boeing murder
First of all, have you tried to break any car's window? It's not easy, especially if it's underwater and pressure is pushing in while you're striking out. Unless you have a ceramic breaker point, you're unlikely to break one with your hands. 

Second, has anyone confirmed that she didn't have bulletproof glass? Entirely possible a billionaire modded their car with bulletproof glass
As a voluntary firefighter I can't really understand how they couldn't open the car. I don't know what sort of equipment they use in the US, but if the car wasn't meter deep underwater and you could more or less stand on it, plus you had a bit of time I'd argue I could have found some way to get the thing to open. 
I am sure the guys did what they could and I might be underestimating the situation, but I just can't see how there was nothing that could be done.
Very high journalism standards when they're quoting "ULTRA Pepe Lives Matter üê∏" from TwitX.

>The ranch where Chao died is owned by a corporation tied to her husband, Jim Breyer, a venture capitalist and part-owner of the Boston Celtics. Breyer's net worth is estimated at $2.9 (¬£2.26) billion.

Wow, it gets deeper, so to speak. If you look into that guy he's been connected to some very interesting things such as In-Q-Tel, essentially the venture capital arm of the CIA.
[deleted]
If you fall into a pod/river, lower the window. I think people panic and think about unbuckling and opening the door. Dumb. Very difficult to open a door. If you find yourself in water, open the window before you do anything. You can swim out the window. Or at the bare minimum don't waste any time trying to open the door.
My model 3 windshield cracked a month into owning the car, I refuse to believe the windows were Telsa stock windows.
This sounds horrible. She had time to call her friend who came over to try to break the glass. She was basically just waiting there, watching the water level slowly rise and drown her.
IKR at least those guys died with their dicks out 20,000 leagues under the sea, she literally drowned in a puddle lol
‚ÄúWe have a Titan sub at home.‚Äù

There, I said it.

This is exactly how the show "Upload" went on Amazon.   When is that next season coming out?

Cocaine Mitch's Inlaws own a huge Chinese shipping company. One of their ships was busted with cocaine on it headed to the U.K. do you think anything was done about? Nope no charges, no nothing. Cocaine Mitch probably made some calls and got it handled.
Wow.

A friend got there first and then 1st responders got there within 24 minutes and she was still alive a significant time after that.  It took them more than 2 hours to get into the car.

And she still went down like the titanic submarine

Lol.
At the end of the game, the king and pawn go into the same box
I'm sitting here thinking why would you drive if you were a billionaire, I'd have a driver and be chilling in the back of a rolls royce, I'd never buy a Tesla even if I was a billionaire
She was drunk as shit probably
This is actually pretty common.

People realize they are in the wrong gear and panic and try to slam on the brake. They slam on the accelerator by mistake.

Sounds stupid, but it‚Äôs a real thing.
People panic when startled sometimes.
She didn‚Äôt FLOOR it necessarily.  Look at the article - she was on a narrow causeway with a steep embankment.
Also, why wasn‚Äôt window rolled down?
And if you‚Äôre heading straight to the water surely your first instinct would be to open a door or a window, not grab your mobile to ring someone
The thing that's interesting is that she allegedly told friends that she "did it again."

Turns out this a super common issue due to how you shift into reverse--[you push the stick all the way up](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/2015_2020_modelx/en_us/GUID-41E02406-1983-4511-BBB4-158DD94796C6.html).

Yeah I wouldn't wish this as a way to go on anybody. But it being a billionaire, I felt bad for a second and have decided to go grab an ice cream bar and play some more Fallout.

Then to add insult to injury you get memed by a thousand degenerate gamblers.
Damn yall got a tldr
Holy shit!!!!!!!!!
I read jim brewer and choked on my coffee
She was 100% silenced. For what?  Figuring it out is part of the fun !
You‚Äôd expect that in the first few seconds her windows would work before the water could get to the motors, or they should automatically go down after sending impact
If this happened in Oakland, she‚Äôd be alive‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
The porcelain trick doesn't work underwater which is what most thieves use. Some attach bits to gloves.
Yeh or it was special bulletproof glass because she's a freakin billionaire.¬†


I only know one billionaire, and their security detail makes us clear out of certain areas like an hour before they arrive. The hardest part for me to believe is that she was driving herself.
I've seen this plot.
There are much quieter ways to do that.

Hacking a tesla to drown itself is much more likely to be discovered over inducing a medical condition, or just straight up staging a suicide.

&#x200B;

In 1975, the CIA were (supposedly) shown to have a heart attack gun which would leave only a small red mark on its victim.
She asked for a refund, so it drove into a lake.
No no, there was just a glitch with the FSD, don‚Äôt worry!
Anything is possible nowadays.
Bitch was just drunk
[deleted]
She literally had a rescue team aiding her and they couldn't get her out. They watched her drown.

I'm not going to comment on how she got into this situation, but there's no fucking a way the fire department would have difficulty getting my drunk ass out of a Honda.
[deleted]
True.  Good point.
Link to source?
If the glass couldn't be broken*

Lets not ignore *why* she couldn't be rescued.
And the fact that ‚Äúglass breaker‚Äù tools don‚Äôt work on virtually any laminated car windows in any modern car.
Too bad she didn‚Äôt have a Frisco crack-head with her at the time.

No matter how much money you have you can never have all scenarios covered.
There's a video out there on the Cybertruck where thieves try to break the glass. They couldn't and gave up.
That‚Äôs with standard tempered glass on most cars. A spark plug or window breaking tool basically causes it to explode on impact. But with laminated glass, those pieces are basically held together- and the whole point- they couldn‚Äôt break in.

Obviously with time and many whacks, you can eventually get through, but it is a deterrent against smash and grabs. Less effective when you‚Äôre trying to desperately save a friend underwater though.
Damn.  Lol
The model X isn‚Äôt the cybertruck.  Normal
Car windows aren‚Äôt easy to break underwater either.  You can get a $10 little car window ‚Äúbreaker‚Äù that is a super high density tool that will break a window on tap.  For a normal women, you won‚Äôt be able to break a car window with just your arm or fists.
ü§î
Thats crazy 

And she has ties to Mitch Mcconnel?

The odds
Terrible way to go but for a fucking change they get to reap what they sow. Typically, billionaires' BS trickles down to the plebe only...
Here I was, thinking all people of school age and older knew that opening a car door on a submerged car is close to impossible unless the car is filled with water.
There's mechanical on all tesla doors.
It does though.
I'll do the calc in imperial for the Americans in the audience. Let's say a car door is about 1000 inch^2. At an average depth of about 3 feet you'd get an average pressure on that door of about 1.5 pounds per inch^2. That's about 1500 pounds of pressure on the door. I don't think Chao was going to be able to come up with that kind of thrust. 

I don't know why she just didn't breathe the air bubble at the top until the pressure equalised and the door opened though.
Iirc it was after midnight and she was coming from a bschool party she was throwing on her ranch, so probably drunk, and after she fell in she made a phone call from inside
On new Model X‚Äôs you shift by using the touchscreen to swipe up or down. I mean‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not saying this caused it but damn it‚Äôs a terrible design decision.
You won‚Äôt be able to open the doors. Open a window immediately if you can. Once underwater you likely won‚Äôt be able to unless you can break it
[removed]
I wondered the same question. It seems likely that the car wasn't completely submerged at first, so why not simply roll the windows down?
[deleted]

Actually you‚Äôre dumb because you genuinely think that wasn‚Äôt tried.

If you live in remote areas expect longer response times. This isn't anything new. Technical water rescue isn't as easy as you probably think it is. :\

It‚Äôs news because this bitch was worth billions
also have her put lotion on her hand so it looks like she struggled with the touch screen

Upon some research. Looks like standard firefighting procedures do not work on laminated glass. You are just SOL unless you can get to the backseat glass which is standard tempered.
I have a certification in touchin jambalaya
You read some bs article and believed it to be true. Honda came out and said their cars don‚Äôt have this feature. It‚Äôs not a basic safety feature lmfao

Edit: source for ya morons https://archive.nytimes.com/wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/windows-do-not-automatically-lower-under-water-honda-says/
Probably because they own a load of TSLA
it's easier to open once the car is full of water

thanks mythbusters https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YaMEW30bv4
[deleted]
Actual practical advice in wsb? I think it's something about the water pressure working against you opening the door if your car is full of air.
yeah, if she really was a billionaire, that shit was surely reinforced aftermarket.
A fucking billionaire and she calls her friend first. I'd be fucking calling Dwayne the rock johnson to come with a sledgehammer and his roided up arms.
I still don‚Äôt understand why she wasn‚Äôt able to open the doors in light of that tid bit.
This happens with non Tesla vehicles too. It's a slow death. Often die on the phone with 911 or family.

Mythbusters showed that if the car flips upside down, there is no possible escape.

You would think someone would've thought of a solution to this problem already.
It's weird because the article states she drove the car in reverse into the pond, which means her car would be sinking rear first. I'd assume she'd have enough time to either open the door or window before the car completely submerged.
She was afraid of being electrocuted, which is why she never opened the doors and swam out like a normal fucking person. Seems like a prime candidate for Darwin awards here.
Drowning is nothing like imploding, drowning takes way to long. Those guys in the submarine didn‚Äôt even realize they died
This is pedantic but I'll share because I think it's interesting.  The term "20,000 leagues" from the book is actually referring to the distance the characters traveled while under the sea, not the depth they were at.  A league is 3 miles, so that would be 60,000 miles, which certainly is not a depth that is reachable on Earth.
Stronger windows on the Tesla though

nepotism oligarchy runs the world...so sad.
The timing of his retirement seems quite‚Ä¶coincidental.
Dw guys this is exactly what he meant by drain the swamp
Don‚Äôt forget about a boat that belonged to Elaine getting busted coming into Miami with like 80 kg of cocaine.
Is this a leopard eating face moment?
Is the car a stock tesla or a modified one? I can't imagine a billionaire just buying an off the shelf model y, without it going through Teslas version of overfinch etc.
Tesla doesn‚Äôt follow IATF 16949 standards, that‚Äôs why their QC sucks and they have all these issues. There‚Äôs no law saying you have to follow it but majority of automakers do.
Although ironic, reinforced glass seems like a safe thing in most conditions. I‚Äôd think the part where we transport dangerous chemicals on dilapidated rail system is a better example
They own fogo de chao.
as a turtle, Mitch can stay under water for 4-5 hours
More ‚Äúget shitfaced drunk and drive over an embankment into a pond because you didn‚Äôt bring a driver‚Äù circumstances, I think.

She had time to call people from inside the car while it was in the pond. Police were the first responders to arrive on the scene, though it took them a while to locate her. Not exactly mysterious circumstances‚Ä¶
Chinese/Taiwanese but Chinese/Taiwanese ties are not as black and white as Americans make it.
Morals? Man is a US senator, what morals could he possibly have had?
And shipping is how you transport drugs and sex workers, hence the Epstein and Glisane connetion.
Holy shit, this is genuinely terrifying.

What a terrible way to go.
If only the secretary of transportation had bothered to force Tesla to use safety glass like every other car manufacturer ever.
Jup a lot of dumb people in this thread are making fun of her saying its easy to get out a submerged car. 

That might be the case, if all goes well and you know exactly what to do. I have had trainings in which a prof diver set next to you with a extra o2 tank and holy fuck it was one of the hardest things i ever did. Without that extra o2 i would have died for sure and if im ever in the same scenario its likely that i would die.

I woudlnt be suprised if the car malfunction due to hitting the water and she wasnt able to get the windows down. That means that you either have to break the window or front panel (which was impossible) or that you need to open a door. Which can also be impossible if you car is in the wrong possition (water is hard to push away, ground is worse).
Nothing really says she was alive for most of those two hours
I think the weirdest thing is they didn't manage to just pull the car out of the water, I mean all those cops drive those big overpowered SUV's these days, it shouldn't be that hard to attach a cable and just drag the whole thing out of the pond, or even just to the edge, once you have the car nearly out it stays at the surface, water stops going in, victim doesn't drown, you can crack the car open at your leisure to get her out. Seems pretty straightforward. Of course it's easy for me to say, I wasn't there, don't know the shape and size of the pond etc.
you could have towed the whole car out of the pond with that much time
A Laplander? Like in a human living in Santa land or is that some kind of animal?
Oh Frank!
"Nice beaver!"

"Thanks, I just had it stuffed"

Actually parachuting and having the wind push you into a lake full of aligators is even better! 

üòéFun fact: There's a video!
The doctors say she has a 50/50 chance of living... But only a 10% chance of that
Drowning is the preferred method of death for the homies?

Mabye I‚Äôm not as down as I thought.
A reminder of the funny ass original name of that sub which was r/waterni**as before Reddit deemed it too offensive and generated a bland rhyme which uses another racial slang albeit of a less polarizing nature

When your tesla gets stolen. It will automatically lock the vehicle and drive you to the nearest lake.

Elon musk can manually control this feature to assassinate anybody that owns a tesla using the hidden conspiracy feature.

Should have made the titan submarine out of teslas, apparently
 In a Tesla Model X sleek as night,   
I met my fate, oh what a plight. 

Designed to shield from harm's cruel touch,   
Its fortress walls proved too much.

Irony, thy way is this,   
Drowned in a high-tech abyss.   
Windows tough, refused to crack,   
Water surged, no turning back.

Elon's dream, to provide a save,   
Became my watery grave.   
In electric chariot, my last breath,   
A futuristic marvel sealed my death.

Not by speed nor crash I fell,   
But by the very shield meant well.   
So here's a tale, both sad and vex,   
Of my ironic end in a Tesla X.  


>!\-never too soon for chat gpt!<
Same lol
Can you still buy those new? I'm about to go car shopping and want to go as old school as possible with as little extra technology as possible. Just heat/AC and a radio is all I need.
And how does the queen feel about that?
This is the answer.

" Chao was driving her Tesla home after an evening with friends when she accidentally put the car in reverse. " She was wasted, I'd say a 99% guarantee.
People seem to want to leave this out in the reporting and present it as if the car killed her.

I don't have any interest in Tesla cars, but she basically suffered a Darwinian death

Yeah it even caused a whole fake panic about Toyotas accelerating uncontrollably, when in reality they were just pressing the wrong pedal and panicked
Ya, your foot is on the wrong pedal, but you think it‚Äôs on the brake. Happened to me before. It takes a second for your brain to be like, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre pressing the wrong pedal‚Äù and by that time, you‚Äôve fucking floored it cause your pressing the ‚Äúbrake‚Äù harder to stop.
What‚Äôs not common is having a pond in your yard
That‚Äôs not exactly how it goes. Let me ask you this question. Your foot is in the brake. The car starts moving. ¬†What do you do?¬†¬†

¬†You press the brake harder, but car still moving! Your instinct? Press harder!¬†

¬†Your brain ‚Äúknows‚Äù your foot is on the brake‚Ä¶ so you don‚Äôt question it and that‚Äôs why you keep pushing harder. Only problem is your foot is on the accelerator and you didn‚Äôt know it.
So she didn't floor it, it floored her
I would imagine that the electronics to roll down the window don't work when wet.
My Tesla Model X electronics (12 V battery powered ones) worked after 3 hours of fire and water pouring on it. 

I think she was afraid to open the window being deep submerged.
I‚Äôm surprised there isn‚Äôt a safety feature that rolls down the windows when it senses the car is going under water.
Selfies for the gram, bro
It's ridiculous that we've had simple designs for shifting gears used for decades and yet we now have a bunch of different designs in different cars, many of which don't provide tactile feedback of the gear position. The Chekov actor died because of this.
[deleted]
You can't become a billionaire without exploiting thousands of other people through wage theft. I feel more sorry for all the people struggling to get by after decades of wage suppression despite productivity multiplying over the last few decades.
I‚Äôm sure if you‚Äôd heard the news of a non-billionaire drowning in their Tesla you‚Äôd have sat in quiet contemplation of the apathetic universe for the rest of the day.
Jim Breuer but same lol
Nah it's designed by a South African for South Africa,  robbers might impact the car to trigger the windows lowering.

~~DEA EDIT:~~  *HOMELAND SECURITY* lost two agents in Mexico when their up armored SUV unlocked it's doors when it stopped
They did this in Upload
Epstein did not drown himself
The CIA also learned to communicate with dolphins in the 80s and 90s. Then it‚Äôs a 10 year campaign about Orcas being super smart murder machines and Sea World goes downhill.  Now we suddenly have Orca attacks on yachts. Hmmmü§î. Operation Free Willy is playing the long game.
Frozen pellets of tetrodotoxin fired from a pneumatic gun disguised as a cane, as I heard it.  The tetrodotoxin is active in such minuscule quantities you‚Äôd never detect it when diluted in blood.  And even if you were looking for it specifically you wouldn‚Äôt find any within about 30 minutes after death as it will have metabolized away to nothing.
it reminds me of that episode of "The Office" where the GPS mistakenly directs Michael to drive into a lake

so maybe the Tesla navigation "mistakenly" directed the self-driving feature to plunge into a lake
Well, except making money with NVDA options...
Do "glass-breaker" products work on them?
Apparently the logic is that in the much more common event of a roll over they stop people from being flung out the window and dieing. Though I doubt that's very comforting for the people that do end up drowning.
I do wonder if her windows were standard glass and not the bulletproof kind?
This is WSB. His DD is just tweets from assmuncher2002
Sober people don't drive into a lake, then call their friends instead of try to escape.
Model X uses regular glass. If you could have broken it in any car, you could have broken it in that one.

EDIT: Tesla uses a laminated, noise reduction glass on side windows. This is not uncommon, and has been on cars for decades. Buick, BMW, GMC as far back as the 90s, and Mercedes in the 80s.
Um did they try to break the class within 1-2 minutes of her going in?
More and more cars have laminated side windows. I know my car does.
> You can get a $10 little car window ‚Äúbreaker‚Äù that is a super high density tool that will break a window on tap.

These dont work anymore on standard laminated glass which is what the Tesla' has and most new cars have. 

You cannot break through those kinds of glass. You need to break it and melt/twist it away from the lamination.
Those devices don‚Äôt work on laminated windows which are used on the Model X and many other cars

The entire shift of vehicles (even base model cars) having everything be electronic is insanely stupid

Just wait, shit it going to start breaking on these cars, and instead of a car lasting 2 decades it's going to be borderline unusable after 10 years

I love my 2012 base model Honda Accord. No fancy electronics, just a solid car with a reliable engine

It's fine for some things, but putting a car's actual controls functionality in a touchscreen is regarded
Who approved this lmao
This made me laugh out loud, that's absolutely ridiculous! I don't even like having to use a touch screen for music volume control, nonetheless *essential mechanical functions of the vehicle itself*. Who the fuck wants to shift with their screen!?
If you‚Äôre trapped after trying all windows and the sunroof, the goal is to try your best to remain calm and wait for the car to become fully submerged so the pressures equalize. Obviously easier said than done but‚Ä¶

another option is to keep a window breaker in your car
To keep the water out. /s
Also, she might have been drinking.
There's a manual release.
Would you expect the headline to say the make and model of the car if she died in a GWagon ?
Yeah although that seems way riskier. This video proves you shouldn't do that. You have to wait too long, Adam ran our of oxygen before he could even open the door. This is terrible advice.
[deleted]
Top gear also did it but you can‚Äôt open it until the pressure equalizes so you need to be on the bottom and it takes to long to hold your breath.
Still takes too long‚Ä¶. And the door may become obstructed by the time the vehicle fills with enough water
Most Americans cant hold their breathe for 30 seconds

I keep a seatbelt cutter with a glass break hammer end in the glove box, $10 dollars off Amazon if I never have to use it great, it was only $10 bucks.

Edit: TIL This doesn't work on the laminated glass the Tesla's have.
The windows are 12v on a tesla, 12v stuff runs for a remarkably long time in just about any car.  I've had cars that had doors literally full of water because the window seals were bad that the window still rolled up and down just fine.  There are lots of videos of cars submerged with the hazards and other lights still going.
Lower the window when you start falling, not when you're already dead. Every little bit counts, because even if you can't get it open enough to swim out of, it'll help equalize the pressure faster so you can open the door.

But this is also why you should have a car with as much manual control available to you as possible (or as reasonable, since I don't think anyone's bringing back manual windows). Tesla's the automation meme company, so uh... Try not driving a tesla.
And you want to do it quickly while the electronics are still working.
The article says the Model X has reinforced windows.
But why? Are random billionaires *that* at risk of being attacked or something?
If I were a billionaire I wouldn't drive or own a Tesla
If only we had emergency services on call who are trained to and allowed to rush to your aid as fast as possible and kitted out to help in such situations.
Teslas have a button to open the door. Opening the door is not that intuitive with no power https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modelx/en_us/GUID-AAD769C7-88A3-4695-987E-0E00025F64E0.html

Also, you need to wait for the car to fully fill up with water or else it will be difficult to push the door open.
I can understand panicking in the circumstance but once the water gets high enough she should have been able to just open the door. No need to break the glass. At the very least it should have been attempted.
The door unlock touchscreen buttons aren‚Äôt operational during a system update.
Well that's the point, you suffer less AND you get to be a permanent fixture right next to the titanic, whereas nobody gonna visit her pond to see her remains

When the car went into the water it had a total electrical failure. Tesla's have electronic doors. Unless you know exactly where the manual releases are (literally tearing the door trim and seat trim apart) and are drilled enough to do that in an emergency situation then it is no surprise she couldn't get out.

Teslas are literally death traps because of this. If this was any beat up shitbox from the 90s she'd of been able to open the doors since they're manual.

Most cars don't have the safety glass of the old days any longer.

My Toyota's don't.

This whole story should really be about laminated side windows not Tesla. The AAA study they cite even has a very long list of models with laminated non-windshield windows.

https://www.aaa.com/AAA/common/AAR/files/Research-Report-Vehicle-Escape-Tools.pdf

>In glass-breaking tests, four of the six tools were successful in breaking the tempered glass. Two of the
tools, however, failed to break through the tempered glass (the type most commonly used for vehicle
side windows). None of the tools were able to successfully break the laminated glass, which stayed structurally intact even after being cracked. The research indicates that it is nearly impossible to break
through laminated windows without specialized equipment.
[deleted]
Wrong. You open all the windows first and it fills in >100 seconds. Genius.
Gets worse. The new model 3 doesn‚Äôt have a turn signal stalk. It‚Äôs a haptic button on the wheel. For the turn signal‚Ä¶
Wonder if Tesla can retrofit future models into submersible versions.
Yeah no one knows about that
It's definitely less ideal, but if you're stuck in that situation and can't break your window, you may not have a better option.

As a reminder - make sure your car has a window breaker with seatbelt cutter in it. It could literally save your life.

While you're at it, make sure your spare tire isn't flat.
ahhhhhhh right. does the door have no "manual" door mode?

There is a manual release.

I heard recently those glass break devices don‚Äôt work against modern windows
Just a TIL. But if you were to be in a situation where you need to use that little hammer. Aim for the corners, not dead center. Its almost impossible to break it dead center on modern car windows.
Test it out before you actually need it. I'm not going to tell you whose car to test it on.

Edit: who‚Äôs to whose. I am ashamed, but at least I caught it myself.¬†
If your car has removable headrests, remove and use the tip of the metal rods.¬†
I have one in the glove box and one in a compartment to the left of my steering wheel. Got them along with a few other emergency items after getting ideas from an Ask Reddit thread
The Tesla in question has laminated windows to prevent breaking when hit with a human during a collision. The glass break hammers don't really work on them.

That's literally why this was a problem and 1st responders couldn't break the glass and get her out.
Don't keep it in the glove box.  Keep it somewhere you can find it even if the car is upside down and pitch black.

Also, the hammer type ones don't work well, you need space to swing it hard.  I recommend a resqme, the glass breaker is spring loaded and just need pushing against the window.
I have one clipped to the headrest.

https://resqme.com/
All cars have laminated glass, that's just how car windows are made. Tesla roof glass is much thicker than side windows and designed to maintain structure even when cracked. They're idiots for wasting time thinking that was a good idea to try breaking the roof. The side windows of a model X, S, 3 or Y aren't harder to break than any other car.

The Cybertruck is the only model with special glass, but no-one has yet tested a CT to see what a window break hammer or sleeting loaded window punch will actually do.

If they were trying to swing a spike hammer under water, then I can imagine they had some trouble there. Spring loaded window spike is the only way to go in that situation.

Of course, this whole story sounds super fishy. She had plenty of time where she could have rolled down the windows.
If your seatbelt tensioner went off, the buckle won't release and you need to use that cutter to get free, you're not going to be able to lean over to get to your glove box... Terrible place for it.
Tesla's have manual releases
It doesn‚Äôt. It has laminated glass like practically every other luxury brand out there to reduce noise. The glass is hard to shatter because it has a plastic layer sandwiched between two panes of glass. Look at the glass in nearly any Mercedes and you‚Äôll see the same thing.
If I had thousands of millions of dollars I would definitely have a team of mechanics that would upgrade and maintain my whole fleet of vehicles.
Most of them are scared, yes. A lot of them have private security that sweep their homes/follow them or some crazy stuff, like reinforced panic rooms,  panic buttons at every corner.. etc.

Maybe you should read the article, the police, divers and a tow truck were on the scene for several hours before they could finally get the car out. Its a remote ranch so it took 15 minutes to get there, but by calling a friend she had people trying to help her until emergency services arrived.
If only you could read an article before rushing to post your dumb judgement.
Tesla engineers must be sleep deprived 24/7, I don't know how else you would come up with this shit.

"carefully remove the speaker grille from the door and pull the mechanical release cable down and towards the front of the vehicle. After the latch is released, manually lift up the door."
That is the stupidest shit I have ever seen.
So teslas are poorly designed
Tesla has a weird design for how their doors work making them very unintuitive. Being in nearly pitch Darkness and disoriented from the situation and the depleting oxygen supply and it's not hard to see why
This is mostly a myth. By the time the pressure equalizes, you are under water holding your breath. Most people will die and be unable to escape. Happens all the time.

Inside they have a manual door lever right under the door button.
You are correct
Don't listen to them. Depth doesn't matter for whether you equalise pressure to the surrounding water. When your car is full, you have equalised to your surroundings

If your car is full of water at 1m depth, you've equalised to the surrounding 1m deep water. If it's full at 10m depth, you've equalised to your surrounding 10m deep water

Realistically though, it still takes ages to equalise. So you'll probably be on the bottom. You just don't have to be, e.g. if the car was snagged on something
They did it in a pool so realistically probably didn‚Äôt have to hit bottom first but it took so long that they were on bottom for a while before it worked.
now do it while you are panicking
It ends with the termination of the estate.
Good thing I also keep a battery powered jack hammer. The battery sit in the passenger and is always hooked to a charger.

That fucking glove compartment will be pried open.  

If all else fails, I bought the metal ball from the same batch as the one used in the cyber truck demonstration. It‚Äôs kept in the arm rest.   

PS: some people response too seriously. It‚Äôs taking the fun away from this sub
Lifehack - test the hammer beforehand.. If it doesn‚Äôt work, use progressively more penetrating tools. That way, when you find the correct one, your window will be pre-broken, and you will never again have to worry about drowning in your car.
You are correct.  Older cars used tempered side glass which shatters when hit with the emergency tool.  Newer cars but not all have laminated (same as windshield) side glass which makes the tool useless and the glass extremely hard to break even in normal conditions.
This only matters when its a Tesla.

In the Tesla I was in the door open button looks like a window open button and is in the same place as the window buttons in other cars. Just seemed really stupid.
You don‚Äôt have to remove anything. The manual latch is literally right on the door handle. It‚Äôs actually how most people open the door before they learn of the button.
Probably, they're definitely overworked and can be fired at a whim if they're not unionized. My understanding of Musk's "management style," is that he proposes some stupid feature or design element because "epic, lol" and engineers have to scramble, often last second, to implement those changes or risk being fired.¬†¬†


It's probably not a good idea to have an already arrogant, sleep deprived guy on a Ketamine and amphetamine cocktail make executive engineering and design decisions.
The rear door one is actually criminal.

So if a kid is stuck in the back of a burning car post accident they‚Äôre supposed to get their automotive trim kit removal tool, pry open the speaker, find the release line and tug on it?

Like what insane person though ‚Äòyeah that‚Äôs fine‚Äô.
I had this exact same thought when I first got out of one. It actually ruined the entire experience I had of first getting into one.
Everything fully electric and with touch screen is poorly designed. I pray I don't get in an emergency situation, like someone attacking me or in situations like this woman got into, because my phone would be useless. Wouldn't read fingerprint to unlock, would skip on gesture, would display "don't cover your earphone area" blocking you to do anything, would pop some ad or some notification, would rotate and make you start the Angry Birds game instead of phone call, which would then download the update of course.

With older phones, you could have a speed dial, and call your brother or a police from your pocket.

The doors and windows absolutely must be mechanical, and the most used functions must have a physical button.

And what is damp may never dry
I‚Äôve almost drowned, and fuck all that. It was the scariest and most panic inducing thing I have ever gone through. I got taken under by a rip current, and didn‚Äôt have time to take a breath before I went under. I will never forget the burning sensation in my chest because I needed to breathe so fucking badly. Swimming as hard as I could trying to reach the surface. I could see it, but it seemed to take forever. I remember thinking ‚Äòwhat a stupid way to die‚Äô, then as I was breaking the surface, got fresh air, and some water too. Still made my heart race thinking about it while typing it.
the point at which you really start shutting down is peaceful. everything before that is not. Like everything in your body will be telling it to get oxygen and you will swallow water, just into your lungs where it will be an excruciating pain, and then at that point your brain kinda figures out like yea this is it time to float off and at that point it becomes extremely peaceful. But anything that is starving the brain of oxygen is going to bring out the flight or fight response
[deleted]
She had all the cards against her on that one.
Triple negative in the driving category.
The driver panicked and that‚Äôs how she died. Also they said first responders didn‚Äôt get there until 24 minutes after the call. So it seems to me she lives way out in some secluded area and that probably led to her demise as well. If she lives in a city. They attach a winch to that car and pull it out saving her life.
One third of cars sold have this. It‚Äôs the same glass 100% of cars have on their windshield
Appreciate your knowledge. If I'm ever trapped inside a tesla I'll remember you.

Some people are not super capable in the best of times, much less emergencies. Yesterday my sister called me freaking out because her oil light was on, and the the car smelled like burning, and was making a weird noise on the highway. Once she got to a gas station I had to explain how to check the oil with the dipstick. I thought everyone knew how to do that. If i had to explain to a 40 year old woman that you should not drive a car with no oil in it, and explain what a dipstick is for, then the manual release process for the door is too complicated. Especially in an emergency. I know I wouldnt be able to google shit while about to drown.

Only if there is a pressure difference. If the car is full of water, there should only be the drag from the water.

Man, even reading this was a bit of a ride. I feel like I went through it a little bit. Damn
"yeah I took the rope meme literally, I actually discovered it increases my orgasm, so drowning must be nice right at the very end, right before the option to live is about to expire. It's the same thing right?"

The hell are you all talking about
I haven‚Äôt watched family guy in so many years but this just awakened me.
Warning, that is only for the fronts (unless it changed). There are manual ones in the back, but they are a bit trickier to access. The thought was probably not wanting kids to grab and pull, as they are emergency use levers.
6? .2? I don't know a single thing about crush depth ratings.
Multiple leviathan class life forms detected.  Are you sure whatever you are doing is worth it?
The dealership will let you know.  Just don't tell them that you're asking, and go after dark.
From the inside tho, to be sure. So break in one window (passenger), unlock it and get in drivers seat and try to break it from seated position. Now you are confident but not sure, could be a manufacturing defect so it's best to run the test several times.
That‚Äôs a great point and what about the self driving and safety systems of Tesla, couldn‚Äôt it and shouldn‚Äôt it have prevented this kind of thing?
No rations needed in the panic rooms cause you can always EAT THE RICH!
jeez
[removed]
Nahhh drowning cases have been documented and quite well. I was just summarizing those. Never tried autoerotic asphyxiation
The model X has the gullwing doors so I doubt those things would do anything if you went underwater.  Best thing is still to open the window, as is the case for literally any car.
So normal door handle somehow becomes emergency levers that need to be protected from kids? I think we have solved that a while ago with door locks.
"excuse me, sir, can I come up to the front? no??? ok, I guess we will both drown"
What if the electricity shorts out?
Child-safety locks in the rear doors have been mandatory since 1985. Makes no sense why they decided to make teslas have difficult to use manual levers to protect kids.
Boeing is so Screwed
Alaska air incident on a new 737 max is going to get the whole fleet grounded. No fatalities.

Lmao another article says they are asking for an exemption from a rule on a smaller plane. Where ‚Äúif pilot forgets to turn of an anti-icing system , the engine will break apart‚Äù.
Ya fr. This airplane is brand new, manufacture completed in November 2023!
Idk how they keep fucking up their airworthiness of their planes so frequently- an absolute joke
Do they allow smoking with this inflight feature?
Who ever was in that seat gets free airline tickets for life.
Boeing wants FAA to exempt MAX 7 from safety rules to get it in the air

[https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-wants-faa-to-exempt-max-7-from-safety-rules-to-get-it-in-the-air/](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-wants-faa-to-exempt-max-7-from-safety-rules-to-get-it-in-the-air/)

Great timing
Airline should‚Äôve paid extra for the premium door construction.
Yeah here‚Äôs the aviation link - this is wild https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/s/crqfrYQ2bz

Order of operations:

1) good no one died

2) option chain
"The supplier is at fault."
Someone didn‚Äôt stow their tray table in the upright position before landing.
Nah that's supposed to happen
Puts it is boys
737 max. Yeah that‚Äôs a nope for me dawg.
Lmao another 737 max with issues.
McDonnell Douglas bought McDonnell Douglas using Boeing's money and turned Boeing into McDonnell Douglas. Boeing used to be THE trusted name in the aerospace industry...
Window became a door. Good time to retrofit the aircraft
An airplane build by clowns supervised by monkeys
The side fell off
There‚Äôs a Reddit post I actually viewed of a guy actually on the plane when this happened
Wait that entire hole was a window?
I'd appreciate the fresh air
Priced in
Suicide doors are trending. *Bullish.*
[deleted]
I knew a guy who was responsible for signing off on plane safety before they could be sent to the buyer. He was very angry about how his bosses would pressure him to approve planes despite them not being safe. He retired in early-mid 2023.
I will NEVER fly on a 737 MAX. This is the plane with the bad software that had 2 crashes very close together and several mid-air emergencies. I always check to see what my plane is going to be before I head to the airport. I love Alaska Airlines, but if they go to an all 737 MAX fleet, I'll stop flying them.
Ever notice that news like this only occurs after market close?
Putssss.  Which is too bad, Alaska is one of my fav domestic airlines
Alaska didn‚Äôt renew the door option subscription.
Bullish
Finally, a window seat
Cash for clunkers for the entire fleet
i wonder what is the experience of sitting next to a hole in an airplane.. is it like the movies where you are actively getting vacuumed or is it like a rollercoaster
"max" is to Boeing what "Jaws 2" was to "Jaws 1" or something (somebody please rewrite this the way I want it to come out tyia)
Boeing is not an aircraft manufacturer. Boeing creates value for its stockholders and executives.
Symbol of everything in America. Rotting for corporate creed or political corruption
Just Boeing things
It's basically the highest its ever been since covid anyway although a far cry from pre covid levels.
My husband works at Boeing.  I‚Äôm not surprised to see their quality go down.  Their work culture is toxic.  They more about DEI than good quality employees.  He knows 3 people who took huge pay cuts to get away from toxic managers.  One guy transferred to another job because his manager wanted him to lie on official paperwork and threatened to write the guy up if he didn‚Äôt.  A bunch of people left and went to Lockheed Martin for a huge pay increase.  They are promoting people based on DEI that have been with the company only 2 years while others who have been there over a decade keep getting the shaft.
They downloaded the extra door DLC mid flight
Coincidentally BOEING was the sound the fuselage made when the window became a door
All of these planes need to be permanently grounded. How many times does someone have to die because Boeing pushed these freaking planes through production too quickly? Boeing owes these passengers millions. If you can‚Äôt hang with Airbus stop making passenger planes!!!
Watch MFers pump the price 10% on Monday morning to f*** logic!
Warning light went off from the previous flight. Interesting article. https://theaircurrent.com/feed/dispatches/alaska-737-max-9-that-lost-deactivated-exit-had-recent-pressurization-issues/

‚ÄúPreliminary information about the accident remains scarce, though two people familiar with the aircraft tell The Air Current that the aircraft in question, N704AL, had presented spurious indications of pressurization issues during two instances on January 4. The first intermittent warning light appeared during taxi-in following a previous flight, which prompted the airline to remove the aircraft from extended range operations (ETOPS) per maintenance rules. The light appeared again later the same day in flight, the people said.‚Äù
Boeing puts it is!
Jack Welch's hand trained monkey did well at Boeing! Cost saving measures working as planned.
Just got back from out of the country. Moment I landed I saw this pop up I immediately checked if I was in a max lol
More revenue for the airline:  Passengers pay extra for a window(less) seat.
Oh so you're telling me Boeing re-hired the DC-10 engineers?

Puts on $BA
Yep ,that was it for me
I will never ever enter this shitty max Boeing again.
Have always felt uncomfortable being in that plane.
Prefer much more the airbus a320 Neo.
Its stable,quite and safe.
Fuck Boeing.
Boeing was on thin ice on my book after they max mcas crashes.  I'd genuinely pay more to take an Airbus.
LOL BOEING IS FUCKED. 

https://www.npr.org/2023/12/29/1222228617/boeing-737-max-jets-faa-loose-bolts-nuts

Days after they tell people to check their planes for loose bolts this shit happens.
Next time, I'll stick with Andersen Windows, no blow outs!
It‚Äôs a feature. Haven‚Äôt you read the fine print in the Boeing catalog.
Boeing CEO "Nothing to see here..We riding dirty."
Can someone explain to me who has hardly any knowledge of planes why Boeing is more widespread and popular than Airbus? Any airline that I‚Äôve flown Airbus has been much nicer and from news stories safer and more reliable than Boeing.
so ... 737 is like 666 then?
[deleted]
Smh I bet someone had their cell phone on
Air Bus sales will increase buy some calls on air bus and puts on Boeing
Boeing keeps fucking up, seems almost everytime a airplane has emergencies it‚Äôs a Boeing
I highly prefer flying on an Airbus.
Does the Max stand for max pain?
Boeing engineers were pissed from the beginning of this debacle.  The decision to "upgrade" the 737 was not made by the designers.
You must be new here. This is bullish. Look at every other time they have an accident
Was on an Alaska airlines 6 hr flight 2 hours before this happened lol. My wife sat curled up in a ball by the window, we‚Äôd have flown out together if it was ours.
My mom is a flight attendant and I want these boeing fucks held accountable
I read a couple of articles like these this winter: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-10-11/fake-parts-found-on-boeing-airbus-jets-plague-airlines
It's the shit** plane again folks
Buy American, die American!

Looks to be about the same quality as the 30k mile Buick I rented last summer that already had a whining CV axle, a rattling turbo, and a coolant leak.

Good old American "woah now!"
Long Airbus
Airbus is cackling in Europe right now.
But why would any company buy a 737 Max?
Sooooooo Boeing has a major catastrophe every year it seems‚Ä¶
Shrug national security interest to be bailed out. Boeing has the f15, f18, f22, b52‚Ä¶. The federal government won‚Äôt let them fail because somebody has to design the next plane or helicopter and run it over budget for a decade!
Boeing will always be in business as long as humans wanna keep killing each other. Relax, paper hands
Southwest ($SWA) has plans to buy 600 MAX by 2031. They are all in on the plane. 

Puts on SWA.
Another reason to solidify my hate for flying.
Let me guess. The 737 max?
Corrected the old saying:
‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs ~~not~~ Boeing, I‚Äôm not going.‚Äù

This is what happens when MBAs take over an aerospace company..
[https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-wants-faa-to-exempt-max-7-from-safety-rules-to-get-it-in-the-air/](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-wants-faa-to-exempt-max-7-from-safety-rules-to-get-it-in-the-air/) literally yesterday
The case of Boeing is a perfect case of corrupt government agencies i.e. FAA. Why would Boeing be so confident to ask for such a ridiculous an exemption. We are being fucked by these government agencies. It‚Äôs all over, be it FDA, FCC etc. Fuck this crap, nobody was held accountable for the deaths caused by this flying coffin.
correct https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38882358
anyone flying lately now going to change flights if its a boeing max?
No fucking way that's real... r u serious?? (Fly all the time, always on Max's and am freaked out)
Imagine all the heehaw Americans that would be losing their f‚Äôing minds if this was an Airbus having one problem after the next.
Alaska AA glad to know it is still under warranty--
FAA certified in late November and first flight in mid December.
Their pressurized cabin premium subscription lapsed
Bathtub curve. Most faults happen when it's new or very old.
Probably built in SC. 

That assembly line is absolute fucking dogshit
Sounds like Boeing should already have been screwed. 

>The 737 MAX suffered a recurring failure in the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), causing two fatal crashes, Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, in which 346 people died. It was subsequently grounded worldwide from March 2019 to November 2020. The FAA garnered criticism for defending the aircraft and was the last major authority to ground it.[6] **Investigations faulted a Boeing cover-up** of a defect and lapses in the FAA's certification of the aircraft for flight.[7]
They failed to pay for the no holes monthly service for 5 dollars
Some poorly trained minimum wage assembly line worker is going to become the scapegoat and take the blame, while Boeing leadership write themselves another bonus check for all the ‚Äúhard work‚Äù handling the incident.
There‚Äôs a documentary on Netflix.
Because it‚Äôs no longer an engineering culture. They farmed out the manufacturing to 3rd parties and they‚Äôre an ‚Äúintegrations company‚Äù now.
They literally fucked up the safety culture deliberately after McDonnell Douglas was merged in. So many idiotic leaders to do this.
The pay sucks as well for A&Ps for having to live in Seattle. I really wanted to work for them but unless you already live in Seattle, it seems like a nightmare to uproot your life and move there.
They are no longer run by engineers....
Seems like monopolies might be problematic...
That shit doesn‚Äôt fly
US military contracts might explain how they continue to operate. The fuck ups are getting out of hand though.
They are a skeleton of what they used to be. They apparently sacked their Quality Check crews.
It's well ventilated, shouldn't be a problem.
Cabin depressurizes, everyone screaming.

Me: Well.. Now I'm definitely hitting the vape now and there's nothing you can do about it!
Just step outside.
Yes with this feature you get optimized airflow as well it quite literally makes you take the entire cig in one draw
Me to the people around:: hey seeing as we might die do yall mind if i rip my vape? Its the one tjing that brings me joy.
Video circulating says that seat was miraculously empty
No one was thankfully.
Best Alaskan can do is treefiddy.
No one will make fun of me for wearing my seat belt on planes anymore.
Yeah, they definitely went flying for the rest of their life ‚Ä¶
Wow, if that gets passed, the EASA should no longer accept FAA certifications.
The ceo of boeing deserves jail time
Alaskan probably forgot to pay the Boeing+ monthly subscription, which ensures parts don't fall off mid flight.
The fail-safe subscription was only $9.99/month.  Cheap bastards.
You see, the problem is that not enough passengers on board opted for the premium door upgrade. It‚Äôs on them.
Might watch that after my 15 hour flight home üò≥
Sounds like something Boeing would say.

Fuck them.  Break that company up into tinier companies.
They turned off airplane mode.  Everyone knows what keeps the doors on.
Or they didn‚Äôt put their seats in the upright position.
"It's within specs."
Say this instead happened at 7am pst on Monday and you're a pax on that plane. You load up on BA puts before the news hits.  Would that be considered insider trading?
It will be priced in the first millisecond stock market is open
It‚Äôs so strange, the 737 is such an old platform‚Ä¶. It really shows how low Boeing have sunk. Clearly cutting corners and safety is not a priority anymore.
Hard no
>737 max.

me2
How is this series still allowed to fly? Oh wait, the FAA and Boeing got caught colluding before and nothing happened to them.
Have a family friend who does final inspections for Boeing, he personally shat on the new Dreamliners built in SC so much it was insane lol. At least Seattle is a hub for Delta and they mostly fly Airbus and seem to be phasing out Boeing so that‚Äôs a relief.
It was actually a door turned into a window. Then back into a door by rapid decompression
lol I remember that.
I thought they had strict no cardboard construction rule. And no cardboard derivatives
At least it wasn‚Äôt the front
Is it supposed to do that?
That's not very typical.
[Interviewer:] But, why did the door bit fall off? 

[Boeing CEO:] Well, wind hit it. 

[Interviewer:] Wind hit it? 

[Boeing CEO:] A gust of wind hit the plane. 

[Interviewer:] Is that unusual?

[Boeing CEO:] Oh, yeah‚Ä¶ At altitude? ‚Ä¶Chance in a million.
What‚Äôs the minimum crew?
The boom at 20k feet guy? Pretty sure that‚Äôs who i snagged the screen shot from on the aviation forum.

Door.
Automatic emergency door. 

It opens and now it‚Äôs an emergency
Or that sweet sweet oxygen from the mask
üòÇ
Bullish
He should go public if he has documentation to prove this. Whistleblower protection should keep his pension safe. It‚Äôs always a tough call depending on how much proof and how much of his retirement is at stake‚Ä¶.
what do you do if it's max, rebook?
Jetblue doesnt fly any Boeing planes, so that's what I use.
Me too. But I avoid Boeings completely. So, that‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt travel pretty much anywhere in USA because of this. I‚Äôm glad at least Hawaiian airlines have Airbus üòä
Its going to be hard as Max orders keep coming in.  Delta Airlines put in an order for 100 Max-10 variants in 2022 and they had been the only US airline that hadn't ordered any of the planes at all.

Alaska Airlines is currently the 9th largest max customer (and third in the US) in the world though well short of what United and Southwest have ordered.
Classic market manipulation by door.
On a Friday too!
Imagine being on that plane seeing the door get ripped off and going balls deep on Boeing puts. If that fight was at 11am someone was walking off a millionaire. Next time I'm on a 737max I'm buying the in fight wifi every time. If the plane goes down at least my family will be rich
I believe it‚Äôs consistently one of the highest rated. Not their fault here.
this may sound like a joke, but it's not far from Boeing's way of thinking. When the 737 max crashes occurred, investigations revealed that Boeing would nickel and dime airlines for SAFETY features that should've been standard. I remember for example they had all the hardware installed for the angle of attack to be displayed using the cockpit displays, but that was a something like 20k option to get that enabled. Digitally, of course. Similar story for other safety equipment in the cabin.
Usually not.

You will feel a very strong wind when the pressure inside is equalizing to the outside pressure. That doesn't take very long and once it settles, the vacuum effect (which is very very very exaggerated in movie) disappears. After that, it's just windy and chilly. Kind of the same as rolling your window down when on the highway, only everything is a factor X more. When really close to the opening you might feel quite the draft and you may want to hold on to your glasses and your beer and sandwich. But only when you're in the seat directly next to the hole. The outside will try to pull you out. But it's not as if you have to actively dodge suitcases.

If you need to pee, instead of unbuckling your seatbelt and walk to the toilet, you unbuckle your pants belt and whip it out right there. People walking below you might feel a slight drizzle but that's not your problem, really.
Yes
you actually summed it up pretty well. there's lots of potential jokes here..."we're gonna need a bigger parachute".
Just like the NFL/CFB. Fuck the spirit of the game. Let's see how much money we can squeeze until they finally get fed up enough.

And Music concert tickets. And Christmas for god sakes... Only since the 70s has loading kids up with an unmanageable amount of toys actually been a thing. Death by consumerism and maximization of profits.
As far as I‚Äôm concerned this isn‚Äôt a maintenance issue, it‚Äôs a QC issue. This airframe is a month be a half old.
Fresh air, extra $1000
I heard the people responsible for the DC-10 are now running Boeing. Yea, it's going to be a shitshow.
Depends on which model, the old ones are great
Outside America its not really, Airbus has been outselling and outdelivering Boeing for years.
Because Boeing is backed by the US government.
Boeing used to be the best by a wide margin. They're not anymore, but in certain industries there's an inertia to brand loyalty. Planes last decades. Easy to train mechanics and staff on one plane platform. Easier to buy one bucket of parts from one company. Events like this are rare and it takes a bunch of incidents to shift public perception to the point that airlines will get rid of their 10+ year investment and switch their institutional knowledge to a different platform.
Boeing has existed for a longer time, so there might be more Boeing planes overall. However Airbus typically outsells Boeing every year, since the early 2000s
If you're 737 then I'm 666
666 max
[You are not wrong](https://i.imgur.com/Gjm5QMJ.png). Stock basically traded flat after the 2 MAXs crashed.
Seatbelts on at all times for me
Sacrificing human safety for profit should be illegal
Boeing engages in stock price manipulation. Every time there is bad news, such as this, their stock price goes up instead of down‚Ä¶ every ‚Ä¶ single‚Ä¶ time
Market closed for the weekend.
Boeing low key happy this happened after hours
Harvard Business School literally has one of the highest body counts in modern history
The plane came with automatic windows. 

They just do not re-wind back up.
this one was really bad and **fully Boeings fault**: 

["Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302, a Boeing 737 Max airliner that crashed on 11 March in Bishoftu, Ethiopia, killing all 157 passengers and crew](https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-boeing-737-max-disaster-looks-to-a-software-developer)"

Basically Boeing saw Airbus make a larger and more fuel efficient engine. They wanted that too. The thing was: the Boing 737 was a little lower to the ground than the corresponding Airbus, so a larger engine would not fit. 

That meant that Boing had to change so much on the 737 that it would basically become a new airplane regulatory wise, and that would be expensive. They struggled for a while to fit the larger engine onto the 737 and eventually came up with a solution: mount it a little further in front of the wing. The airplane could stay the same and the 737 Max was born. 

Moving the engine further forward did have an impact: it caused the stability of the airplane to change. The 737 max would now push it's nose upwards. This was a change to the 737 that would mean pilots would need new training - and that is also expensive. 

So what did Boing do? they kept this raising of the nose a secret and instead installed a computer system, that would make the pilots feel they were flying a normal 737. 

The computer system MCAS would simply push down the nose, when the nose normally would push up. The MCAS would simply correct the pitch of the airplane without the knowledge of the pilots. 

We know that the pilots onboard the 737 max of Ethiopean Airlines were struggeling to keep the nose up. We also know that the MCAS kept correcting the nose down. Eventually the MCAS won and the 737 max crashed straight into the ground nose first. Killing every single person onboard.
what does this actually mean?
Boeing and the FAA have extensive secret corruption cases
I fly all the time. I've never been on one on purpose. I pay a lot of money sometimes to avoid it.
Boeing: Looks more like wear and tear to us.
I think it's still under the extended holiday return policy
If not they‚Äôd be pissed about not picking up that call to extend their warranty
Wow.  
And some of the jets we fly in day to day are 30+ years old.
Don't worry someone definitely went to jail for this gross negligence and criminal cover up.  

Right?

RIGHT?!?!
The American greed episode is also great. 

TLDR: they gave up the company culture of the best engineering for shareholder profits. 

The reason the 737-800MAX had so many incidents was they removed the back up sensors to save money. Lol
Downfall:The case against Boeing is the name for anyone interested in.

Bottom line when they merged with another company the leadership changed and the culture along with it. It went from ‚ÄúBe the best engineered flying machines in the world‚Äù to ‚ÄúThe bottom line is our focus‚Äù and hundreds or more have died as the consequences.

Why is the Max series the way it is and not a new series like a 797? Because modifying a 737 means less training requirements for pilots which reduces costs for the airlines. So instead of a new aircraft you get a decades old design that‚Äôs been highly modified in ways the airframe was never intended.
Aye, RIP to the Quality Manager‚Äôs career after appearing in that documentary
The documentary is great but troubling.
Airbus too, yet you don‚Äôt see incidents like this! So I think the problem is more with the profit focus and huge overhead Boeing has.
Joke was that McDonnell Douglas bought Boeing with Boeing‚Äôs money.
Airlines pay much better for an a&p
My dad who grew up in Auburn was telling me about how awesome working for Boeing used to be and how his friends were basically set for life just from working for them. Not like that anymore unfortunately. All that money has to go to the top for those fucks insatiable greed.
To be fair depending on where your office is located you won‚Äôt be living in Seattle. If you work north there is cheaper housing and if it‚Äôs south there is cheaper housing
A huge amount of employees commute. They make up a massive amount of thr daily traffic on the freeways lol
I am shocked the US government has allowed all the aero and defense companies to merge. They basically have no competition anymore.
[If enough things go wrong, the plane will start smoking all on its own.](https://youtu.be/m3CQCme95Ac?t=2)
Sir! The no smoking sign is still on. The captain hasn‚Äôt announced, ‚ÄúSmoke em if you got ‚Äòem, yet.‚Äù
No! No joy, and Karen over there won‚Äôt have it. Also vaping is for middle school emo kids.
Airlines figured out how to deal with all those people who aren't real.
And people call me crazy for staying buckled the whole flight. Easy fix to not being sucked out.
[deleted]
No one in that seat, but a boy and mom in the next 2 seats. The force was so strong the boys shirt was ripped off. Hopefully that family gets a payday. That kid will never want to fly again and I can't blame him
Beefore or after the door busted?
Crazy.
Wel‚Ä¶ no one is anymore, they took flight out of the new feature hole ü§´
If Boeing asked the FAA for a blowjob they‚Äôd still give in. Spineless bitch ass regulatory body.
Please don't give ideas to Tesla.
> Break that company up into tinier companies.

thats what theyve been basically doing for years, for extra profit
Unironically they will say that. Spirit aerosystems builds these fuselages if I remember right
The pilots were trained wrong.
It's by design.
No, because of the window you are technically outside not inside
No.  And you'd also be dumbfounded when you somehow lose money on the deal because Boeing.
I always wonder if someone bought puts the second they saw one of the planes hit the towers on 9/11
If you were sucked out of the plane and made the trade on your way down, technically it would be an outside trade.
Somebody holding a laptop and little transceiver will be jumping up and down in the dark by the CME/Fermilab antenna out in Aurora trying to get in that first bid on Monday morning.
The entire MCAS debacle was because they couldn't even fit new high-efficiency engines on the ancient 737 body without throwing off the flight characteristics, and they just decided to "fix it in software"

They deserve to have their lunch eaten by Airbus. They should have been designing an all-new 737 replacement 20 years ago.

You can only serve warmed-up leftovers so much before they start to rot. 737-Max is rotting leftovers.
dude name is same, but its iterated so many times its like on the 6th different version.
My husband‚Äôs father worked for Boeing for 25+ years and says the downhill spiral really started when Boeing decided to become a ‚Äútrillion dollar company.‚Äù This led to the outsourcing of manufacturing many parts to other countries and thus frequent decisions about whether or not to fix the mistakes made when those parts arrived outside of tolerance or eat the cost of sending them back.

Probably the even bigger issue is that they stopped putting any value on institutional knowledge. Guys who had been there for 10+ years became a cost liability as opposed to an asset and they slowly chipped away at skilled labor and middle managers.

And the death knell was moving a big portion of their manufacturing to South Carolina to avoid labor laws/unions - except building planes is skilled labor and they can‚Äôt find enough people in SC to manage the factories so they have the Washington State based staff constantly flying back and forth and high turnover which meant very little continuity in oversight.
When it‚Äôs not falling 90 degrees directly into the ground it‚Äôs literally falling apart at the seams. Options expiring in the short term will be interesting for sure.
its Absurd and I can tell you why it's probably still allowed to fly, to cut costs and save Boeing, because it's an American company. The deadly incidents earlier happened with Indonesian and Ethiopian flights, if it was back-to-back American ones, Boeing would have been in the hole with this model.
They won't be very very soon.
Sadly, my company no longer buys corporate tickets for any 737 flight. As per policy in place for four years now, only A320‚Äôs. I did get an Embraer ticket last year.
How do I know which dreamljner is built in south Carolina vs Washington?
'Dreamliner' sounds so cosy and safe though!
It seemed like Delta was and then in 2022 they put in an order with Boeing for 100 737Max10s plus an option for 30 more.  Though I think the rumor mill is they are likely to place another order with Airbus in a couple of years for more A320/A321 variants as well.
RIP John Clarke.
Well yes it is suppose to do that but only after its service use and after it‚Äôs been decommissioned so yes this is not too out of the ordinary
Link?
Module for exit door for full coach config but Alaska did 3 class config so that module is just a window.
The mf kid in the middle seat opened the door!
Window.

Edit: Apparently it was a plugged door.  On the inside, it looked like a window.
The door fell off? Is that typical?
pretty much any airline will tell you the airframe before/during the booking process, it can change but it will be the same 99% of the time
The door has to close calls it bought before blowing up.
They blow the doors off the competition
I would say it is. This specific aircraft had a pressure warning. This means the pressure system detected something wrong. What did Alaska do, oh we'll just remove it from flying to Hawaii (ETOPS). They didn't even bother to check it in with maintenance on why the pressure system was giving a warning. 

So from deduction, this door was under extreme streets from the internal pressure the plane needs as it climbs. And as all things go, after enough stress it fails.
Flex Seal.. THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE
There is only 2 reasons why Boeing is even in the market at all right now:

1) Airbus can't even build enough planes at the rate the orders are increasing

2) Several Airlines don't want to rely on one single manufacturer, for reasons LOOK AT THIS POSTS PICTURES

Germany's Lufthansa made a large purchase of Boeing planes recently, simply to not be at Airbus's mercy. In terms of quality and reliability, there is no question right now where its going.

Double bad for boeing: even their defens section is nt running well, in the biggest defense spending spree since WWII. They have to get their shit together, FAST.
The days.
Sounds like the entire stock market.
They  likely purcase their own stock to minimize the stock damage. It's not manipulation though if they simply buy their own stock. Eventually, they will run out of options to buy. 

Without it, Boeing would be failing big time against Airbus
Good summary. Pathetic shit.
Jesus christ how were they allowed to get away with this
The best part is them not telling the fuckin pilots, like ok, cool tech, it can compensate, sooooooo when it has an error or failure you got a bunch of pilots dealing with a known issues they weren‚Äôt aware of thinking something else is wrong also‚Ä¶ like, is that when they get told???? The more I read about this kinda stuff the more I hate my long term stance on capitalism‚Ä¶.
It means they tried literally a day before the incident to get an exemption to a problem on their planes (no relation to this incident). It just really shows the nerve of Boeing.
 Boeing: Did you purchase the extended warranty? The manufacturers warranty only covers defects while on the ground. This clearly happened from water damage while flying. Accidental damage is covered by your extended warranty. It says here we don‚Äôt have your extended warranty on file. So if you purchased one, when you‚Äôre ready just go ahead and bring in the paperwork and we can get your claim started. Alright? 

NEXT IN LINE!

Oh hello sir, thank you for purchasing your 737-Max, how may I help you today?
"OH, it looks like you used this plane for business, our warranty specifcally only includes 'normal personal use'"
It‚Äôs crazy watching the nosedive that company did. New management that cut corners instead of focusing on quality. 

Wrecked on of Americas strongest brands.
*Mr Boeing slaps fuselage* 

"Well, see, you drove her off the lot and this really looks like operator error here. Best we can do is half price labor and you gotta keep the thicker folk away from the windows.  Of course if you get that extended warranty it covers midair window displacement, but I don't see that here on the original order"

Boeing: we told you to check the bolts that some of them are loose


This isn't a joke. This actually happened. Boeing sent the message out at the end of december for airlines buying this plane to check for loose bolts.
Boeing: You didn‚Äôt pay for the exit door subscription so we reclaimed it.
Yup, those were made in the days that the CEOs were actually airplane people not financial types that only care about short term share prices.
Have you ever heard of the bathtub distribution of failures when it comes to aviation? 

Failures happen either right after a service interval or when entering the fleet due to maintenance or construction errors, or right towards their service intervals due to premature part wear.
They were built better back than before companies decided they need to cut any cost anywhere so their profit lines can infinitely go up. Cheaper materials equals more profit, cheaper labor equals more profit, and less workers equals more profit.
Which makes them more reliable. The hardware and software are ancient, but there's less that can go wrong. Not everything needs to be an AI enhanced smart device with dual quantum core IoT integration. There's a very good reason why airplanes lag far behind most other things when it comes to being upgraded with newer tech.
More specifically, Boeing used to be an excellent engineering driven firm. McDonnell Douglas was a shitty exec driven company.

They merged, and kept McDonnell's shit management and got rid of Boeing's Engineering culture instead of doing the obvious long term move.
Boeing was one of those rock solid companies, you knew if Boeing were behind it then it was made by some seriously brilliant people. Their name is in the trash now, all for a couple of years of green numbers.
Fucking up the bottom line for short term profit? I call that the Jack Welch. Time to buy puts.
The aviation industry can‚Äôt operate if it puts profits above safety. It doesn‚Äôt take an MBA to recognize people won‚Äôt fly if there‚Äôs a perception aircraft are unsafe. 

Their thinking was nuts because cutting corners destroyed shareholder value in the long-run.
As an engineering student focusing on aerospace, this makes me sad. Boeing seemed kick-ass back in the day. Now, all I see is greed, and I can‚Äôt support that
Which cost way more money in the end but it doesn't matter because some middle manager is long gone with his annual bonus for staying on budget.
Not quite. They made the 3rd AOA sensor an option that can be purchased. It can still be fitted.

Which is fucking stupid when your system is MADE to query all 3 AOA sensors, and go with the 2 that are closest to each other.
Once Boeing moved it‚Äôs HQ to Chicago they became unserious about engineering.
Literally same thing happening in Raytheon right now due to a hostile takeover. Can‚Äôt wait to start seeing anti-missile batteries to just randomly not fire.
I love how enshittification isn‚Äôt limited to just tech platforms but is just a reflection of ultra capitalism generally
The fact that none of those assholes is in jail is astounding. It was greed that killed everyone in both those crashes and those guys knew what they were doing was dangerous.
These major engineering companies are all being run into the ground by accountants and lawyers now. 

The focus is squeezing every last drop out of developed risk free IP instead of creating new IP to continue to profit from. Living through late stage capitalism sucks.
It's so fucking stupid that a company can't just be happy with moderate to low growth while employing thousands of people and making great things. You could go on for hundreds of years. But no, risk everything for max profit. üòï
That‚Äôs sickening. 

Symbolic of 21st century USA though. Sacrifice quality for profits. üòë
ironically the best thing for shareholders is to have safe planes xDDD
If they followed the Costco way of focusing on the customer, they would be a lot better off now in term of profits.
>for shareholder profits

there are few words I detest more than those
Whenever I had to deal with Boeing engineers I always wanted to slam my head on the desk
Iirc the key difference is that airbus owns or part owns the different components companies dotted around the EU and so they have a huge stake in those companies failing, where as Boeing went the parts car route of ford and GM and just sent everything over the fence to complete third parties and they have no skin in the game - contractor fails and they move onto a new one.
Airbus was conceived with this structure in mind, consolidating most of Western European aircraft manufacturers in one consortium. They know how to manage a structure like that and how to keep quality standards up when your manufacturing is spread around a shitload of different companies in different countries. Boeing clearly does not.
I‚Äôve dealt with airbus safety engineers before and was impressed (I‚Äôm a chemical and process engineer).  But Boeings behaviour makes me shake my head. I‚Äôd love to be able to choose to only fly airbus, but airlines seem to change planes with how far I book in advance usually (I need to try harder).
Yeah it seemed so hey. I‚Äôve heard many say they won‚Äôt fly on 787s not made in Washington cause the safety of South Carolina is so bad. The 787 deliveries were also stopped when the 737 max thing hit and was kind of kept in the background news as well.
They do but Boeing life I'd a bit different then airlines...

Airlines, 3rd shift xmas eve changing tires.

Boeing...  10 paid days off around holidays M-F off by 230p
Truth, but you would think the people who make these planes would at least be competitive.
They actually encouraged it.
It is not shocking if those that allowed the merger are also those who bought tonnes of shares and options before the merger
It‚Äôs funny you bring this up. While supplying Ukraine, this became an issue. The military says it is concerned it be a bigger issue when it‚Äôll have to support the US mil in a bigger war.

I leave it on but loose most of the time, so I don't even notice it. Snug it up for takeoff, landing, and notable turbulence.
No one calls you crazy. That is a totally normal and recommended thing to do..
The passenger was safely ejected outside of the environment.
So one flight
UPDATE: Boeing have investigated themselves and found no wrongdoing. No free seats for anyone.
Solution is easy, parachute in the seat. Cheaper than recall
Even more crazy there were only 4 seats open on the entire plane.
Emergency exit seats about to be cheapest on any Boeing flight
Regulation can only be as powerful as voters make it. They dont magically grow on their own.

If voters vote for 40 years of deregulation and regulation body de-funding after Regan made "regulations=bad because its dems and anything dems do is bad" then there is no surprise when regulation bodies are weakened into nothing.
Tis but a scratch
I could just imagine some wsb dude on a plane "Oh shit, we're about to crash!!!" *buys SPY puts*
Boeing getting caught flat-footed when Airbus revealed the A320neo is squarely the fault of Boeing upper management.
Airlines also pushed a low-cost replacement to the 737. Building a true successor to the 737 wouldn‚Äôt have been low-cost.

It‚Äôs also why Airbus launched a Neo version of their 320 family instead of engineering an entirely new plane.
They didn‚Äôt develop a new 737 because pilots would need to recertify.

The problem was they kept doing that, incrementally modifying the aircraft so the type rating didn‚Äôt change.  MCAS was a step too far.  If they had just bit the bullet years ago, they‚Äôd have beat Airbus at their game.
Have to say I've been very impressed by Embraer planes - they're brilliant. 

New duopoly perhaps
They moved all Dreamliner production to SC now, so anyone built after 2021 is made in SC, pre 2020 I think it was a toss up but every 787-10 is/was built in SC.
[Here‚Äôs one of em.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThatsInsane/s/Et3DdC0Keu) Idk if they‚Äôre referring to a different video, though.

Well obviously not

DiSasTeRs aRE pRicEd iN!
There is no way in heck the stock market is going down unless I buy in big.
Stocks only go up
It‚Äôs all insider trading at some level. It‚Äôs always strange how the CEOs always know how to manipulate their 6 month withdrawals perfectly every time.
So painful but so true rather gamble on inverse phsicology

>Without it, Boeing would be failing big time against Airbus

As a last resort the US Government would step in, they can't allow Boeing to lose big against Airbus.
It's only "not considered manipulation" because the Reagan administration changed the law with Rule 10B-18. 

Buybacks had been illegal since the 1930s when people investigated the great depression and found that stock buybacks were "obvious stock price manipulation".

They still are.
I‚Äôm imagining the offices of Boeing after this news broke.

Top execs running into the office like "QUICK, EVERYBODY BUY ALL THE BOEING STOCK, WE‚ÄôLL PAY YOU BACK NEXT QUARTER"
You have to have an approved stock repurchase for this (which they might always) and eventually you run out of money to reinvest. Eventually....
Except the taxpayers subsidize Boeing because "its too big to fail" "too big to lose to Airbus" 

Taxpayers literally give Boeing money so they can spend it on stock buybacks.
Here's how:

"Although the FAA is responsible for the safety of any airplane manufactured in the United States, it delegates much of the certification to the manufacturers themselves.

It has to in order to get anything certified at all, says Jon Ostrower, editor-in-chief of [*The Air Current*](https://theaircurrent.com/) and a former aviation reporter for *The Wall Street Journal*. Boeing already has the people and the expertise, it pays better, and it isn‚Äôt susceptible to government shutdowns. The FAA, meanwhile, says it would need [10,000 more employees](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-airline-congress-faa/faa-tells-u-s-senate-it-would-need-10000-new-employees-1-8-billion-to-assume-all-certification-idUSKCN1R82FT) and an additional $1.8 billion of taxpayer money each year to bring certification entirely in-house."

[The many human errors that brought down the Boeing 737 Max - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18518176/boeing-737-max-crash-problems-human-error-mcas-faa)

So for $1.8 billion a year, we could give the FAA full control and not rely on manufacturers like Boeing. Sounds like something we should've done yesterday and passed the cost onto the airlines.

US Air Travel is $155 billion a year.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/197677/passenger-revenues-in-us-airline-industry-since-2004/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197677/passenger-revenues-in-us-airline-industry-since-2004/)

Would you pay a 2% surcharge on each airline ticket to support the FAA doing everything in house?

I would.

Also, we need to pass a law eliminating government shutdowns. There's no bill, the debt simply grows, that's it.
And 5 months prior to this, the first MAX crash was a MAX 8 on Lion Air Flight 610 killing 189 people on board. The highest death toll involving a 737. 

And I still remember the media tried to portray that the deceased pilots had lesser training than American 737 pilots and did not indicate anything wrong with the plane before the actual investigative reports came in.
That isn‚Äôt an emergency exit that‚Äôs a speed hole! Makes the plane go faster!
Sorry it looks like the condition was pre-existing and we can't cover you for that.
More like: this unit is for showroom only.
A lot of boomers say that America has changed and is not like it was before. I have not seen that "before" state. But for the last 7 years I have observed this country, your phrase 

> cut corners instead of focusing on quality

describes 95% of products and services I had experience with.
The boards response will likely be to lay off line workers and then take a reduced bonus.
Never should have left Seattle. Maroons.
Let‚Äôs be real about it. They died the minute they lost their most lucrative contracts with the government. They spent a ton of money suing the government over it only making the government admit they were wrong about picking Boeing all those years ago 

Their cash cow is gone and this is what happens. 


https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/02/business/expentagon-official-gets-9-months-for-conspiring-to-favor-boeing.html
I haven't watched the video, but the response to a loss of pressurization is a nose dive to get under 10000 ft ASAP.
You keep the thicker folk by the windows, and hopefully they'll plug up the hole.
Did you, actually, fly the plane? - Boeing probably.
Yooooo.. what is the deal with that! A bunch of assholes that "surrond themselves with the best" but even their people is stupid clueeless
You on WSB bro, it's all we care about. Doesn't matter if those planes fall from the sky as long as share price goes up
That‚Äôs why over ocean planes need x number of flight hours before being certified to fly over ocean. Also why I avoid brand new planes.
They were made during a time where perpetual and exponential profits weren't an expectation.

Companies used to have bad quarters where they operated at a loss or broke even to ensure the quality of product. Now its just a never ending cycle of CEO's who trim fat to keep the books green, get their bonus and move on. We're at the point where the CEO's have no fat left to trim, so they move in and have to start trimming the lean meat, which results in shit like this.
And one incident like this means massive losses. You‚Äôd think if they can engineer on this level that they‚Äôd recognize some corners aren‚Äôt worth cutting.
[deleted]
That's great, but there's another side to that formula;

too much cutty = more crashy = less profits
[deleted]
This is quite common in aerospace even in smaller shops it starts out as a company that does well because they care about the products then ownership gets rich and sells the shop to a corporate entity and they come with their spreadsheets and cost analysis and start looking for efficiencies and applying "lean manufacturing" principles.

Not that lean manufacturing is wrong but when the people applying the principles don't understand the process in general is where you have problems because they're surrounded by yes men who tell them it's a great idea that if they use 4 bolts instead of the 8 it was designed to use well save dollar amount x and for the entire run it saves y million so we've increased the margins, boom share price goes up and we get huge bonuses for increasing profits
All firms have execs. It just depends on the background of the execs. Long term engineering execs are typically solid.

Finance, supply chain, and legal execs always focus on no risk profit draining of all existing IP to maximize the quarterly numbers. Short term thinking is running this country into the ground.
Yes I remember reading stats back in the day that most plan crashes were airbus related and I tried to book flights only on Boeing. Now I try to make sure I‚Äôm either on an old Boeing or a new airbus.
Jack Welch's dude,  James McNerney, literally ran Boeing into the ground with the Max, and his vision of bringing Jack's strategy to Boeing.  They keep cutting, get rid of the most experienced people, outsource, cut R&D, quality, future product streams, lie to regulators, and retire with a big payoff before the house of cards collapses, while leaving a hollowed out shell for the next guy to try and fix, hopefully with a huge government bailout and layoffs.
Omg I thought Jack Welch was a made up guy for 30 rock.
3M is sinking the same way, both touched by Jack Welch‚Äôs cronies.
Yea, but in the short term...
It‚Äôs possible it takes a non-MBA to recognize that
Boeing used to be the pinnacle for engineers.  Now, it's thought of as a good first job out of college before moving on to a good company.
Most of the innovation comes from the key system integrators/technology firms that supply the engines, flight control, communications, etc, rather Boeing itself.
Nah middle managers are just fall guys.
They are all incompetent especially the program managers running the uncle sam projects‚Ä¶ the just overrun costs, say sorry, tell sam the new cost is 20% higher than we bid, rinse and repeat every single fucking year.  Sam keeps paying.  Except for Air Force one.  If there is anything Cheeto should brag about, it is definitely the fixed price AF1 contract.  Fuck Boeing
I work at one of those places. We make solid products. 

I dunno that I‚Äôd fly in something we make. I‚Äôd def drive our parts (and do). It would be cool to feel like an actual part of the pipeline. To have the auto manufacturers rooting for our success. But we‚Äôre one of many. Do it better or do it cheaper. Usually, cheaper wins. Preach on.
How do u know when a 787 is made in which state?
Plus decent Christmas bonuses and union reps that hunger for managements tears.
They‚Äôre not, never have been.  And honestly with all the trouble they‚Äôve had I‚Äôd steer clear of Boeing.
The last supper.
Consolidation seems to be ruining just about everything in this country and producing a hellscape.
That‚Äôs at the end of the flight!
They'll tow the wreckage outta the environment
Then died of natural causes. Because naturally you will die if you fall of a plane
To another environment?
/r/ulpt what to do when you have expiring puts on boeing
It wasn't even an emergency exit door if you can believe it.  Just a random panel of the plane with a window

Edit: not a random panel after all - but a plug covering a spot where an optional emergency exit could have been installed during manufacturing
It helps Airbus and the European economy, so it ain't all bad
A scratch? Your panel's off!
It‚Äôs not typical, I‚Äôd like to make that point.
normal fact far-flung unique alleged memorize axiomatic sulky correct zealous
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who puts some of the 737M blame on airlines.  

Airlines were the ones who said a clean sheet 737 replacement would be too expensive. They didn‚Äôt want to train pilots for a new type rating, invest in new maintenance infrastructure, retrain flight crews, etc. They told Boeing that if there wasn‚Äôt an updated 737 that they wouldn‚Äôt be interested.
Don‚Äôt get your hopes up, Boeing has been trying to buy Embraer
No, you're a door hole!

Yup, the worst of the worst is the housing market (expensive AF and shit quality) & health care services (at this point it is straight up extortion), which are two of the mains ones that directly impact common folk and their quality life. Food is a big factor too, but idk enough about chain supply to explain why McD's costs about the same as a regular restaurant.  My insurance has only gone up despite never having an accident.

I dont see how cartering to the top 1% makes our lives easier... but lets keep voting in their favor in case one of us gets to sit up there, and in the meantime, lets focus our hatred at the bottom folk who are eating our budget with their communist demands
Too many people figured out if they stack all their points into charisma they can climb the ladder. We grow further away from a meritocracy day by day. Just look at politics.
Boeing ‚Äúacquired‚Äù McDonnell Douglas, but MD leadership launched a soft coup and pretty much took over Boeing.
Fairly convinced modern American companies make so much money they‚Äôre to the point where they appoint a CEO to maintain the business direction rather than disrupt the model. They are so ingrained that a monkey could give guidance and they would still be profitable.  
Not to discount the education or training those people have received, but more to bring to light that the ground breaking has been done and it‚Äôs their turn to ride the wave into the shore.
"Surround themselves with the best" = surround themselves with yes-men who will agree with anything they say and never push back on anything, even if it's a major safety concern.

After all, only *poors* fly commercial, anyway.
>Till you buy one with your gains and you're the one falling from the sky.

Just kidding, I know you have no gains.
How do you find out how old the plane you are flying is?  Like when you are purchasing a ticket
Yup. That is one of many things that let the FAA allow airlines to use 2 engine aircraft for overseas flights instead of 3 engine aircraft. 

I have my PPL and I refuse to fly any plane that is less than 5 hours post service in flight hours. Im not going to be a fucking maintenance test pilot
So that's why Air France keeps putting those sweet sweet new A350 on some weird routes that no one takes ! 
Makes so much sense.
Yeah when the boss only cares about profit you start to get questions like, "well these wings are really expensive... Do we need 2?"
Hey CEO thanks for your 2 years of work, you haven‚Äôt done anything or improved anything so today you are fired. Here‚Äôs $5M cash as a sorry and another $10M in stocks. Bye.

Engineers have been raising alarms about this shit everywhere and are ignored everywhere.

Quality and reliability mean less profits.
The problem is it‚Äôs baked into the cost of doing business.  These guys are assholes - don‚Äôt care about anything except money.
Got a source on this? Sounds funny in a bad way.
But that would require thinking longer term than anyone does anymore.
Lean manufacturing is amazing when done right. Sadly, most companies can‚Äôt get it right. 

I worked under an executive (well my boss was under him) who was Japanese trained, all about maximizing profit, and actually a super knowledgeable & generally made awesome decisions. He couldn‚Äôt get the company to raise wages for factory workers, so the turnover was horrible. We had the numbers showing it would save the company money to increase wages for factory workers. Couldn‚Äôt get it to happen. This was in aerospace/advanced composites. 

Lean done right is amazing. You have standard work written (we can easily predict how much of xyz product can be made), we take ideas from the workers, engineering, etc. see if they save time, continuously improve, and make sure everyone‚Äôs voice is heard. 

It seems like companies focus on the ‚Äústandardize‚Äù part, and not the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù aspect of it
So many problems are rooted in the high up decision makers not understanding the business they are making decisions on.

I don‚Äôt understand how accountants and MBAs keep exclusively running manufacturing companies.
Changing the product like that isn‚Äôt lean. 

Lean manufacturing is more about optimizing work flow, and standardizing work processes. not cutting corners on actual products. 

Now I guess some exec might come in and say that‚Äôs Lean or something, but he‚Äôs misusing the term. 

Toyota style lean is fucking great, incredible stuff for business. But most businesses slap down some shadow boards for the brooms, call themselves lean and call it a day.
It‚Äôs literally all they taught me in business school. Profit over everything baby. It‚Äôs so fucked. Quality goods are unimportant. I sell medical devices and disinfection technologies. I can literally show people endless proof of a product being better quality and how it‚Äôll save them money in the long run by avoiding healthcare acquired infections. They still will choose the cheapest option 9 times out of 10. Especially government owned entities, it‚Äôs always the lowest bidder that gets a contract. So our country is literally being built up on the worst products available to the market to save some money now.
Boeing is a military defence contractor, so they'll get that bailout. No harm done.
Why does the entire financial world love Jack Welch? I don‚Äôt get it. As you posted, just gut everything for the bottom line. Ridiculous
A huge part of that show is making fun of Jack Welch and his dumbshit management strategy. I highly recommend listening to the *Behind the Bastards* series on him and then rewatching the show.
Jack Welch INVENTED being afraid of the dark. A monster in every closet and a nightlight in every bedroom.
The previous Boeing CEO was from 3m‚Ä¶
damn, 3M is as blue chip as they come
I buy a lot of 3M consumer products, especially whenever there's an adhesive involved because Chinese manufacturers can't seem to get the glue right. If it's supposed to stick and it doesn't, what's the point?

Anyway I bought a 3M window film kit like I do every winter, and instead of 3M branded double-sided tape it came with a Chinese-branded tape (inside a 3M package mind you) that DOESN'T STICK. If that's not a red alert, then I don't know what is.
This sentiment is applicable to many aerospace companies right now, not just Boeing; GE, RTX (Pratt & Whitney, Collins, etc.), Honeywell, to name a few.
This is it across many industries. The large big name companies used to be places you aspired to work at your entire career, now they are places to
Resume pad and move on to a smaller company that provides the earnings and career progression most people want. 

In my field (Civil Engineering) I‚Äôve heard horror stories of people working for the big name companies. I‚Äôve always worked at mid-sized local companies and it seems that despite specific small company issues, when times are hard the owners are more willing to sacrifice for their staff. Not lay people off the second a quarter doesn‚Äôt meet projections.
As someone who works as a supplier to Boeing, Boeing typically operates differently from the other primes in that they want to buy individual components and own the integration themselves. IMO this makes their lives unnecessarily difficult.
If U understand what an airplane really is, just an expensive tube with a high tech Turbine propulsion system that's leased, it's more sense Investing money in GE, P&W & RR-Holdings that provide those engines and generate revenue with each flight.
Their CEO recently said they won‚Äôt do fixed price development contracts anymore, because Boeing knows they can‚Äôt help but go over budget

If your 787 was built before 2012, it was definitely built in Seattle. If it was built after, it was definitely built in South Carolina. If it was built between, it could've been either and I don't know if there's a way for the public to wasilly tell. All 787-10s have been built in South Carolina becaise they have an extra fuselage piece that doesn't fit in the Dreamliner.
Airbus seems to pay real damn well for Mobile AL

That's just a door wound!
Yeah. Axelrod made hundreds of millions after 9/11.
Sad to hear, should be the other way around

Could‚Äôve used him on the outside of the craft.
did you say buttplug?
Southwest for example, what if it's a 737-800, then they change it to a 737MAX after you've booked? (i.e on the day due to operational changes).

You're better off booking with an airline that doesn't operate any kind of 737 if you don't want to fly on a MAX.

Edit: replied to wrong comment lol
That doesn't matter, it's just about keeping it running to not lose the industry.   
Taxpayer money doesn't care about image and credibility.
Job security for me, I work for Airbus.  It still sucks to see incidents like this though, no matter which company it's from.  If the reporting is right I'm glad no one died at least.
You don't see all of the junk Grandpa threw out.
And then gutted a magnificent engineering company, so we see one shit show after another. Boeing will survive simply because it's of national strategic importance.
McDonnell Douglas acquired Boeing with Boeing's money.
I was a speechwriter there, at the time. We bought them and then I was suddenly writing speeches for an entirely different group of people. Harry was a tough bastard and the shift was almost immediate. 

I was laid off shortly thereafter.
CEOs are there to build and maintain business relationships, nothing more.  You can make the argument that they set policy and direction of the company, but I don't see that to be the case in recent history.
Probably difficult to impossible assuming you buy flights like a reasonable person (2 weeks to months in advance). The specific airplanes appear to be assigned close to flight date and last minute changes occur relatively frequently to minimize delays and other scheduling issues.
I just bring the mechanic along.
"Depends how many lawsuits you're comfortable with".
You laugh but I've been in meetings where back up systems to prevent catastrophe are questioned due to the back up being out of service due to broken parts for so long. These fuck wits will try anything.

As a person in Quality sides of manufacturing for over 25 years, this is correct. Actually, it really isn't "lean manufacturing" if it reduces quality in any significant way, it's just cost down at that point. The people drive the constant improvement (Kaizen), and if turnover is high the experience to provide the appropriate knowledge and input leaves with them.

Rather scary when you have $'s driving instead of the safety and well being of people moving 400 miles an hour 7 miles in the sky.
well implemented toyota production system thinking for the American Economy is all I want for christmas because this Harvard business school MBA excel accounting short term shareholder value bull shit is killing everything
Exactly this, as a former Continuous Improvement Manager I worked with the front line teams to eliminate the shit got in their way. They were able to work more easily and more efficiently and were happy the hurdles were removed. Then corporate decided to apply JIT inventory to our plants with an incredibly unstable supply chain and wondered why stockouts soared and costs went through  the roof.
This is seen in the new car market in the US. Even with a large portion of manufacturing and the auto makers having a large influence on OEMs; they still struggle in quality when compared to many of the Japanese and European auto manufacturers. Kinda shitty when you consider robotics, automation has been around for decades and the industry is one of the oldest and mature. But hey, in spite of that, they are profitable. I argue that they can make top not products, provide good wages and working environments AND still be profitable. Most of these firms are all about maximizing profits and "process improvement" on paper, but fail in the implementation and imbuing into the culture......but hey, quarterly results are good. It's a fucking disease, the quarterly performance (shortsighted) approach to nearly everything. I'm an MBA and this was one of the things I couldn't understand. The short term over the longterm almost always wins.
I worked in a facility that was trying to incorporate Kaizen/lean manufacturing, it was incredibly frustrating. I fully see the potential in it, and how powerful continuous improvement can be due to the compounding interest effect.  Spending half an hour making an improvement that saves 15 seconds a day will, in 6 months or less, lead to more productivity! 

The problem is that the directors/management seemed to have a very different view on what was important in Kaizen and cherry-picked the stuff they liked, omitting the parts they didn't like. They had me read a book on it by an author I don't remember, who seemed like he missed the forest for the trees. He pretty much outright wrote "don't worry about feedback from your employees, change should be led from the top down". The author even trimmed 5S down to 3S! The author also wrote that he had poor adoption of the system by his staff at his facility, which on one hand I get that people are naturally resistant to change, but I think it had more to do with his interpretation of Kaizen. His solution was to fire anyone who pushed back: around three quarters of his workforce.

Another frustration was that we were constantly told that we needed to make these continuous improvements, but were not given time, budget, or resources to make these changes. If production numbers were lower than the previous day because we spent half an hour making CI changes we would get reprimanded. If the KPIs dropped at all there would be an investigation. They wanted all of the benefits of continuous improvement without any of the investment.

A final bit of frustration came from the fact that we were in pharmaceuticals which is of course a highly regulated industry. Tight regulations and heavy documentation on every process leads to a lot of inherent resistance to change. When making ANY change to the process flow requires multiple layers of review and quite a bit of paperwork, there's inherently a larger initial time investment required for any change. That's not to say that continuous improvement can't work, but you need to be smart about it. The payoff in time savings needs to be enough to justify the time cost of implementation, and you might need to be looking farther into the future for when your time investments start paying off. There's things you can do to help mitigate this like saving up a number of smaller changes and pushing them all through in one process review, but no matter how I tried to explain this to management they didn't get it. They instead instructed us to just make their changes without going through the necessary pathways which constantly got us in trouble with regulatory and quality control. 

Sorry to bitch, I just feel like far too many people in manufacturing treat Kaizen and lean manufacturing as just another buzzword and "adopt it" without actually understanding the core principles. I've since left that company and am much better for it!
As a fed employee I fully agree. We were protested on a recent bid saying another company could do everything for our solution. We know it's not true/viable, but hands are tied based on random policies. Instead we're over a year into consultancy to determine if the protesting company can in fact do the same or if it can't. 

Only the bottom line of the bid matters, not the fact that it would be nearly a 5 year migration where we'd have to pay for both.

The problem is the CEOs are compensated for short term results. Long term results are the problem of the next guy.
And that trickles down to the average consumer being unable to afford the better product because they aren't paid shit due to profits about paychecks
Nah. The military caught on and put them on fixed rate contracts that are currently costing Boeing a metric fuckton of money.
They can‚Äôt track their parts because they don‚Äôt use fucking serial numbers to do it so they end up sending sensitive tech to the Saudis and Quataris, they install used parts all the time which they claim to be new, they have no accounting, quality management, or functioning business systems to speak of, and we wonder why this happens? Some of our agencies are so in bed with Boeing and tow their company line so hard that we‚Äôre going to see this more and more because none of their fuck ups ever get fixed. Hell, a large portion of their fleet has counterfeit parts on it because they can‚Äôt vet them properly! It‚Äôs a shit show and yeah, we bail them out even when none of their shit works. It‚Äôs disgusting. FFS, they bitch about free cash flow but where is that money going? It‚Äôs not going into fixing their Defense business systems, it‚Äôs not going into hiring people that know what they‚Äôre doing, it‚Äôs not going into fucking fixing their accounting system which consists of multiple systems that require manual inputs, databases with fields titled the same fucking thing, no standard command media about HOW TO USE THEIR SYSTEMS PROPERLY‚Ä¶ no, it goes towards lawyers to fight having a proper accounting system that actually functions. Fuck this company so hard man; but I guess enjoy your dividends and buybacks financed by you, the taxpayer. God damn each day that passes the number of potential whistleblowers increases. I am so close to going outside my chain on this man. Oy.
Because the financial world doesn't care about companies or people. They care about short term returns. You can sell stock in an instant, take your profits, and move on. If you're an executive, you get a golden parachute, so there's no risk.
 patrick bateman wannabes running around thinking they're cool as shit
I highly recommend listening to Jack Welch speak himself. It‚Äôs a comedy that people bought the bullshit. I started my career at GE just before it started to die in the 00s and I left when the six sigma stapler positioning on the desk was forced into the office areas. That just screamed failure to me.
Well, both of the crashes from previous Max issues were built in Renton, Washington. 
Soooo‚Ä¶ there goes that theory.
No no, you see, it‚Äôs beyond the environment. Nothing there.

The US government is limited in what it can offer Boeing, their hands are tied. That is the result of case at the WTO between Boeing and Airbus several years ago.

My Grandpa was born a share cropper in the late 20s, was a child in the great depression, and grew up so poor that he lied about his age to join the Army because the Pacific War Theater was *better.*

He didn't throw out junk. Junk wasn't a concept that he accepted. He fixed it.
Either way, it wall wen to shit. I hated working there. this was 6 years after the merger too.

Boeing is why Spirit made this fuselage in the first place, trying to pawn off "non-core" businesses, which is dumb af, since airliners were there only Earth-bound things they were good at.

E: CST-100 is not Earth-bound and it's a pile of shit.
They did, and you can thank John Mccain for it. He stepped in to block the original merger in favor of mcdonnell leadership.
Amusingly, the plane version of a VIN number is right on the entry door ID tag. You could just snap a pic and look it up. 

Of course by that point you are already buckled in, but at least you know your chances, lol.
Yes they really can switch last minute. Years ago I was excited to fly on a 747 which was listed for my flight. But they switched equipment to a 777 the day of
Depends on what jurisdiction we‚Äôre talking about.
Same. Why‚Äôd I get two degrees in industrial engineering if decision makers don‚Äôt really care about actual long term health of a company 

I‚Äôm in a quality role now, and it‚Äôs arguably worse
Yeah, with a unstable supply chain, there has to be some sort of inventory buffer. Otherwise, the line is going to ge down ALOT

Storage is non-value added, but going 100% JIT is way too high risk in North America
Yeah, I will NEVEE buy a car from an American based car company 

Honestly, Toyota assembled my wife‚Äôs car in our state. They do more manufacturing in the states than companies like Ford do
That's like how a highway undergoes eons of construction to alleviate a slight amount of traffic in the future. Such a waste...
Not only is government oversight important, actually performing that oversight is even more important. Hell, Boeing has somehow convinced our surveillance agencies to back off and there‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing to see here!‚Äù
Boeing only did that for the new AF1. They have said they will never sign that type of contract again. 

One thing Trump actually got right was putting Boeing on a fixed price contract
What‚Äôs the six sigma stapler positioning?
Well what's out there?
Let's just say... Nobody got injured in the plane.

At the end of the day the WTO doesn't have an army
man, I feel you. 1 IE degree, thinking about doing another. I did a simulation  of the worst case scenario for an automation project and the ROI. Something like a 2 Million labor benefit in 2 years for 1 million in labor investment. 

I presented to a group of "Senior Directors" and was told "we're too busy to do this". 

I asked if we were too busy last year:"yup"

Then two years ago: "yup" 

Then I asked if they thought we'll be too busy next year: "Yup"

Maybe we should do the fucking project then?? If the whole lot of them were hit by a bus, the company might actually make money. 

All IEs need therapy and to go into consulting.
Yeah, they brought a version of LEAN to the US that has translated well. Line supervisors have the ability to stop the assembly line when defects are found DURING assembly and corrective actions start (all the way through their supply chain). Is it the best to delay manufacturing? No. But that has given them a sterling reputation and reduced long-term and largely unseen liabilities. Is it risky? To an extent yes, not having a mountain of parts can add to later delays, but what's great about sitting on a mountain of parts that could be found to be defective? Then there's the pressure of having to turn that inventory and clearing it from the balance sheets and physically from warehouses.
In any case, Toyota is a model that every manufacturer should at least try to emulate.
I‚Äôd argue in many cases the traffic is only alleviated because they have the damn road closed so long that people just got used to taking another route home.

Before AF1 they were also getting turbo-fucked over the KC-46.
Honestly the most I remember was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fucking insane I need to find a new job now!‚Äù But it boiled down to telling us where things could sit on our desk. I think I made the right choice by getting out of that sinking ship.

There is nothing out there, all there is is sea, and birds, and fish. And 150 tons of kerosene. And a fire.
True dat.
Starliner program could use a few more bricks of latinum. Just enough to actually make it work.
I once proposed we buy a $15k filtration system that would pay for itself in labour costs in less than two months. If you factored in the cost of consumables it would pay for itself in just over a month. We had the vendor come in and demo their system to prove it works as advertised. The old system was just hemorrhaging money and labour resources. 

"We can't fit it in the budget."

This was a publicly traded company of 850 people that was in the process of buying a new processing line at close to $20M for a product line that was new, untested, and that we had no idea what the market demand would be. 

Fast forward 5 years and that near $20M production line that they had put in only operated for less than 1 week/year for 2 or 3 years before finally getting decommissioned and scrapped. Turns out the real demand for the product was about 1-2% of what they estimated it would be!
It‚Äôs insane man, I am not even shocked anymore by their bullshit
The same KC-46 planes that still don‚Äôt fucking work
I remember a guy doing that at Honeywell. Threw out some NIST traceable weights used for pressure dome calibration because they ‚Äúhadn‚Äôt been used in 5 years‚Äù and we needed the drawer space I guess. 

Someone asked for them a month later and said they cost $50k to replace.  That guy also gave everyone ‚Äútest in progress‚Äù signs to put on their desks we were supposed to put on the ‚Äúone thing‚Äù we were working on that day.  Trying to explain to him that some stuff can be tested in parallel was not taken well.

My Solution for Yahoos export of financial history
Hey everyone,

Many of you saw u/ribbit63's [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1fb81iu/alternative_data_source_yahoo_finance_now/)about Yahoo putting a paywall on exporting historical stock prices. In response, I offered a free solution to download daily OHLC data directly from my website [Stocknear ](https://stocknear.com/home)‚Äîno charge, just click "export."

Since then, several users asked for shorter time intervals like minute and hourly data. I‚Äôve now added these options, with 30-minute and 1-hour intervals available for the past 6 months. The 1-day interval still covers data from 2015 to today, and as promised, it remains free.

To protect the site from bots, smaller intervals are currently only available to pro members. However, the pro plan is just $1.99/month and provides access to a wide range of data.

I hope this comes across as a way to give back to the community rather than an ad. If there‚Äôs high demand for more historical data, I‚Äôll consider expanding it.



By the way, my project, [Stocknear](https://stocknear.com/home), is 100% open source. Feel free to support us by leaving a star on GitHub!

This is actually really cool. Good work man!!

I appreciate this!  I hope you make a few bucks for yourself with that pro plan. 

Idk..  shit like this makes me happy. 

When there is a problem 99% just complain and do nothing about it. 

You went and did something about it. And quickly. High five to you. I'd give an award if I wasn't a poor


Edit: someone give this man an award please. I'll write you a very nice **IOU**
i am moved by this, in my heart.  i don't personally need it, but it's an incredible gesture to the world.  thank you.  i hope you're not a total ass and i wish i didn't write this in like 5 years;  but today you are a hero.
My server is still running the script to clean and sort the data for all 6000+ tickers on my database. It will take 4-5 hours until it is completely finished for all companies.

You can test it out for [https://stocknear.com/stocks/AAPL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AAPL) already.
You are the best u/realstocknear!! I nominate you for r/algotrading Redditer of the Year!
Does it only contain stock data only? I am more i nterested in forex
love you bro,you are my sunshine
Is your historical data adjusted for stocks splits & dividends?
Doing God's work, brother! Kudos, and thanks on behalf of everyone who benefits from this üôè
Is this for after hours data as well?
Thank you. You're awesome!!!
Good job lad
Commenting for future reference. üòçü§§
I mostly calculate beta reports in response to macro events, so I honestly only need monthly data going a few years back to fix the majority of my scripting.

Sounds like that should pan out just fine on the free version. If it does, I'm subbing to Pro just to support this. Yahoo was my saving grace after IEX Cloud died.
I am impressed by what you did. It is awesome. How is it going so far? How many subs?
Will yo be adding volume soon?
Thank you üëë
I really like your product and appreciate that it's open-source. Quick question: which options data provider are you using?
How to get low interval data for further back than 6 months? Are these hard to get ?
OP, quick question for you: are you using all this infrastructure for your own algo strategy or strategies? I'm building something similar for mine so just curious.
Is there a way we can get the historical data for a list of stocks instead of individual stock, without scraping? And thanks for the good work!
I only which I could get 20 levels of orderbook data as easy as OHLC
not to throw cold water here, but reselling equity data is certainly not allowed.
Awesome to see people working hard dit the benefits of the community, thanks man!
[removed]
Any chance for mutual fund data?
This is great. Thank you!
I found this post looking for the simplest way to download historical S&P500 Total Return data. Is that available on your website?
Would be great if you share a small client lib so that we can just do sth like `stocknear.fetch(AAPL, "1h")`
thank you very much. I feel like I owe the community since I benefitted so much from all of you.
‚ù§ apes together strong
Makes me happy if my work is useful to you guys
Currently it support stock and etf data only. I can add forex afterwards
Sending love back to you guys
yes it is adjusted.
Thank you very much.
Yes I can add after hours as well. But currently the dataset does not support it
Hope it helps you out.

Any support is much appreciated!
so far not many. currently a little bit more over 170. 

This number was already present before the post here so don't think I got them all since the last post :D
if you support us sure why not :D
Thank you.

I use benzinga for options data
you can use different providers such as FMP, finnhub, twelvedata etc. to get these kind of data
No but I have some plans to do that in the near future :)
I will keep it in my to-do list but for now I keep it simple with single individual stocks
I have a commercial license which allows me to redistribute the data for my users. I am however not allowed to offer the data via an api endpoint
it's open source man.  write it for him.
You went above and beyond man. 

Be proud. Frfr
Yeah, want to pile on to the thank-yous. I saw your post a few weeks back introducing the front and back ends. You've done great work and I've learned a lot going through your code.
Love this comment :)
If you would be open to contributors. I'd be willing to help create scripts for trading, converting signals etc.
Well I did subscribe to the yearly plan so I‚Äôm locked in
Sure hope so.
That‚Äôs a good catch. Let it not expose via an official api endpoint but let it srapableüò¨
Sounds like custom stock list exports should probably be top priority when you're looking at adding features.

On the one hand, it's another list to manage. On the other hand, if you end up with a mobile app, you might be able to eat quite a bit of Yahoo's lunch.

Edit: I'm also not sure how many people other than me only care about longer (weekly/monthly) intervals, and whether adding those options might save you any bandwidth costs.
don‚Äôt have much experience contributing to open source projects, but bouta go do this
Thank you very much for the support. I will add the volume data tomorrow if this is ok for you
Yeah! Would be great way to gain some experience and contribute to the community
Just please comment and document. Use descriptive variable and function names. Go slow, think through potential exceptions and handle them when you realize their potential occurrence.

Thank you for your service.
May god bless your heart
and yours too brother!
OP, what‚Äôs the best way to download / save ticker data ? Spent hours trying to print data frame but no luck
When the likes of DOGE and SHIB start pumping that's when you know the market is getting frothy. 
Bitcoin is heading to being up almost 200% over the past year and Ethereum 130%... but look out here come the Alts almost right on cue. 

Like almost every crypto market bullrun in recent history, the pump of BTC and ETH is proceeded by the pump of the Alts... none more so than the meme coins such DOGE and SHIB.

DOGE is up almost 100% in the **past month** and SHIB heading for almost 190%.

Once again  memes will still start flowing on social media, retail will start FOMOing,. your grandmother will start asking you if [insert] dog coin is a good investment. The news will start featuring stories on the latest dog coin millionaire or those that have sold their home, wives and kids to yolo into crapcoin. 

There will be another wave of Finfluencers shilling the latest and greatest scamcoin.  A huge subsection of retail will be partying on the beach.... when suddenly something happens... a Silk Road,  Mt Gox, China Ban, FTX etc that sees the tide go out. 

Again all that will be left on dry land, although somewhat battered and bruised will be BTC and ETH. Another chunk of retail will be left drowning at sea.. most likely ending up as salty no-coiners hating on the "scam" that is crypto.

Here's a chance to save yourselves. Don't do it. Just keep on DCA'ing into BTC and ETH and when crypto becomes greater than 10% of your net savings pot take profit. 

**Edit/update:**

Since this post SHIB is up 45% in the past 24hrs and has gone top ten by marketcap according to CMC. There's now two dog coins in the top ten which I believe is a first in crypto history. Together they currently have a combined market cap of almost $50bn.

Grab the popcorn the popcorn üçø and await the public neutering üê∂üç†  [Doggy Degens](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/crypto-degen) are having their day üòÇ

**Edit/update:**

24hrs later the market is currently dumping the hardest it has in past month. Dog coins being hit hardest. Not to say the shows over, it never is!  More just the end of an episode..so stay tuned! üòÉ

**Edit/update:**

Doge currently down -25%.. the biggest loser in the top 50... apart from Bonk (-26%) & Pepe (-26%) Wow, Much Fun üòÇ
Cointest pros & cons with related info are in the collapsed comments below for the following topics: [Dogecoin](/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1b69jx3/when_the_likes_of_doge_and_shib_start_pumping/ktcb3o1/), [Shiba Inu](/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1b69jx3/when_the_likes_of_doge_and_shib_start_pumping/ktcb598/).
You haven‚Äôt lived unless you‚Äôve lost your BTC profits in shitcoins


Edit: misused the term ‚Äúalts‚Äù
Don‚Äôt fight against it, that was my biggest mistake last cycle thinking I was too good for memes.
Pepe has entered the chat.
Harry Potter Obama
This is still the beginning too, there‚Äôs gonna be some big swings up and down before this ends.  Lots of time left in this bull
I'm 100% BTC and ETH right now, but I'm going to find the stupidest fucking project that I can and put a small amount of money in. 

It will probably be the best investment I ever make.
Here is to ME, that one Shiba meme coin buyer from last year going in on small time who is praying $200 will turn into $2million.
algo is usually my indicator 

doesn‚Äôt move unless it‚Äôs the end
PEPE 420% in the last month.
As a DOGE holder myself...

I highly doubt DOGE will make it past $2 - that's already greater than its current ATH.
I've heard China will ban crypto soon.

For the 500th time.
It also shows you what kind of joke this space is when shit like BONK, SHIB and PEPE rip like they are. I am in a lot of ‚Äùsolid‚Äù projects and I‚Äôve made the most $$ off of BONK. That blows my mind and I‚Äôve been in the space since 2021.
Shib hodlers are celebrating hard r/SHIBArmy. I bought just months before the ATH and the crash, still hodling and i am about 170% up (yeah, yeah, i could have sell at 0.00007 back then but yolo)
Bitcoin is the coin of the wealthy now. So it‚Äôs only natural that the trickle down effect will happen based on economic standing. After BTC, those who can will invest in ETH. Those who can‚Äôt buy a good portion of ETH to make it worthwhile will buy meme coins hoping to ride the backend of the wave. I‚Äôve been in this game for over a decade and I made a lot of mistakes. But the biggest one yet has been counting sh*t coins out. It‚Äôs all about returns at the end of the day.
My orai is up 650%

Fun times
Money is money. I don't care if I make it off BTC/ETH or DOGE/PEPE. Don't think you're too good for it. Just be smart about it.


And don't forget that we haven't even gotten to the halving yet.
I think the memes are gonna be big this cycle purely as an FU to tradfi¬†
Got it, ill just put my entire net worth in PEPE.
Always remember to inverse what you see in this sub so you can actually make money
I've just held onto DOGE because I thought it was fun. Put a nice down payment on a new car though because of it! Just be smart and do what you want with your money.
The order of the pump for this cycle seems to be BTC, ETH, MEME COINS, then ALTs
I didn't even notice SHIB. I've been trying to ignore all this. I'm a long term holder. I still feel this is early and not a bull run, and that bull run will come later, closer to summer.
When crypto becomes greater than 10% of my net savings? Funny üòÇ
Lo and behold, I've been holding SHIB for 2.5 years, hoping one day I would get my money back.

Today was that day, staying glued to the app for 7 hours, waiting for the perfect time to execute.

Immediately upon clicking confirm, the price goes up to levels never before seen in the span of 30 min.
Meme season is not dependent on Doge or Shib.  Those are last cycle memes.  This cycle:

1. Bonk already up 38290.4%
2. Pepe up 13334.5%
3. Dog with Hat up 110122.3%
4. Snek up 1313.9%

Each cycle buy newly created memes.  The list this cycle will be old news next cycle, like Doge and Shib are now.  Doge and Shib have massive amounts of last cycle bag holders who are just looking to get out.

The trend this cycle will be "with hat".  Can't go wrong buying a meme with a hat.  Next cycle maybe it will be a meme "with shoes" or something.  Doge and Shib don't have hats.  No hat, no pump.  Plus, easier to trade memes on Solana.  People are tired of paying $100 gas on ETH for $5 worth of a meme coin.
Youre missing including bonk within your post

Edit; buy bonk
This only going get worse trump coin hit 500 million market cap today
Btc is nearly at an ATH and doge is only 18 cents. Every coin has doubled or tripled some quadrupled from its bottom. You could argue it‚Äôs underperforming
Shib got me a new(ish) vehicle so I'm happy. Lol
Lol why the fuck are you in crypto if ur happy with 10% returns, just go buy stocks
Everyone seems paranoid because of the big drop in 2021 when everyone was expecting things to keep going up. However, we are still early in the bull market. There may be significant drops but I can't see an extended bear market like we just went through for atleast another year. So I think people need to chill and stop panicking that the same thing as end of bull cycle in 2021 will happen soon
I love all the crypto experts posting, nobody know what the markets are going to do with once ETFs have become available.

There is a shortage of BTC. The inflows from the ETFs are outpacing what the miners can mine. This is all pre-having.

The having event has already slid forward by a few days because of the volume.
Doge isn‚Äôt near ATH. Bitcoin is.
I've heard it said by many (even on podcasts by Coindesk) that when meme coins rally, that it indicates a correction could be due.
If you know meme coins pump then why wouldn't you take part in it. I mean I get it of course. You need to have more if a trade mentality. But look at it this way meme coins are pumping along side bitcoin. Chances are they top near the same time.¬†


Every cycle evolves from the last you can't assume this time will be like last time. Meme coins getting front run this cycle.
My problem is that it seems waaaayyyyy too early for these increases. Last cycles would indicate the top being late 2025. That is a lifetime away.
Bad take 

1. gain perspective, BTC hasn‚Äôt even broken ATH yet. This is like saying market is getting frothy in fall 2020

2. In the past, memes only ran once everything else already topped. This time around, the majority of alts haven‚Äôt had major moves, while BTC is leading and being outperformed only by memes 

Just submit: nobody cares about the tech, people care about AI and things that make them laugh and are easy to understand
When Doge gets back to .37 I‚Äôm getting my hundred dollars back! Gonna have steak!
BTC and ETH aren't life changing though. You have to bet big to make bigger. 

Shitcoins offer moonshot possibilities.
Love me some dogecoin. I got into it in 2014 bc it was super fun to play poker with 250,000-1,000,000 doge. I got to feel like a high roller for like 500 bucks. I never dreamed it would break a penny
Meme Coin Mania begins again
we now have 7 meme coin at top 100‚Ä¶
Bonk is my shitcoin bet for this glorious bullrun.
memecoins are the stock market being the stock market in its purest form.
You can either ride the wave or sit on the sidelines
Sounds like this dudes gonna watch the doge run from the sidelines
No, just these people are being irrational and completely stupid as they believe it'll make them rich. If you buy something on emotions, then I guarantee they'll sell on emotions aswell.
If there‚Äôs one thing for sure, it‚Äôs that the run will do the opposite of what the majority thinks
copy that. Bought DOGE and SHIBA
Elon hasn't even pumped DOGE yet. Will he? He probably sold last cycle.
FML

Why the fuck didn't I sink all my net worth into shitcoins last month?
Today I decided the $20 a month I spend on lotto tickets is better spent on crypto. Worst case scenario it‚Äôs more fun watching the money disappear on this live updating chart I have. But an hour in and I‚Äôm up 50%. After a handful of friends show off their gains I decided it‚Äôs not too late. Years ago I made a post on Facebook saying ‚ÄúWho in their right mind would spend $30 on a Bitcoin?‚Äù And I get reminded of it every year in my Facebook memories. I thought I missed the boat. So I threw a few bucks down on meme coins just to see what happens
How is it any different from investing into sham Stocks ? For example ... Herbalife, which was shorted with 1 bn by Bill Ackman , righteously calling their bluff, and it only popped in the last 3-4 years, like going down the drain , probably bankruptcy soon ... it's a god damn pyramid scheme based on a fucking 0 Sum product ... they sell a Shake of [insert random substances]. 


Stock market is full of these kind of 'no serious product' deals , that pump for years or decades just to die out eventually when the gig is up. 

Same here with Crypto -> who is forcing you to buy meme coins with 0 use case or IRL applications? Why? And the funny part is -> you and anyone else can jump on Shib at the Bottom, no one is stopping you, except your own mind process saying  -> why would I buy into this at Bottom or during Bear? What if it doesn't pump back ... now it does, and suddenly, the Market manipulation is to blame, not the user for jumping on to late or not buying into shit at the bottom when it's worth the risk. 

Typical quadruple standard of judging the same type of event but with different names :) ... Crypto is a 'joke' , a manipulation , etc ... no. Some crypto are doing that, just like some companies are doing that and get listed at stock exchange. 

The tech is sound, verified and functional over many years now , how is that related to the fact that some people will always do the same shit -> tricking others into giving them their cash? 

Is the Internet a Problem because scams roam free , or the people who are tricked into getting scammed? 

Why are so many in this market for 5-10 years and have 0 loss on scams? Meanwhile others enter the space, and in 2 years' time, they get wreked because they can't distinguish between solid working projects and Meme Coins that are basically a P&D scheme?
Held 50,000,000 shiba for years, FINALLY. üòÖ
When people consistently involved in crypto are speculatively buying meme coins to try and frontrun retail and "pumping" them 100% that is not the market getting frothy.

When retails comes in and starts pumping meme coins 1,000,000,000% because they have a funny name, like last time, is when things are getting frothy.
Just bought 200‚Ç¨ worth of PEPE
Lets goo
Idk, I think it‚Äôs at least worth throwing $50 into some of these shitcoins. What‚Äôs the worst that could happen
I've made a decent return on PEPE.
whatever you do dont think you're too all high and mighty for memes, lets face it they can make you the most amount of money
Anyone dca‚Äôing into Jupiter exchange?
I went from being down $380 about 5 days ago on Shib, to now $233....I am also down on Dode for $33.
Doge still nowhere close to as frothy as it got last time around.  I want to see BONK @ at least a penny.
It's just the beginning of it.
Yeah we are going parabolic
Man, I almost bought $1k of PEPE last month. I knew this was coming.

I say that as a maxi who also gambles.
Shh, we need this.
Sure. But um, what alts next?
Everyone go buy dogwifhat NOW!!!

It‚Äôs a DOG!! WIF HAT!! 

DID I MENTION IT HAS A HAT
Eth upgrades on the 13th. ETF in May. Bitcoins halving in 30 days. Only 2 million coins in circulation left. Take inflation from btc ath in 2021 = 78,800$ now.

Edit: we just getting started lol
What is this ‚Äútake profit‚Äù you speak of?
BITCONNNEEEEEECCCCTTTTT!!!!
I believe ETHEREUM is the one to buy!  Real world use.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong.. Bitcoin also great with its limited supply / halving coming up! Because of that I also like Bitcoin cash (just 21 million). Anyways NFA but I believe good things are to come to those with s little patience üçÄ
My best investment in years has been doge. Shame i bought so litte
Meme coins to the MOON!
When Doge and Meme and Shib and other shitcoins start pumping is when i exit !

&#x200B;

I'll re-enter BTC under 50k
Yeah but we have 8 months to get in now, get rich, and get out before November/December. Not financial advice.
Still time for HORSEMEAT on Solana pump üê¥ü•©
‚ÄúDamn you kids and your memesshit 1000000000000x coins! Muh digital gold!‚Äù
Frothy? 

Ew.
I hate it when ot ges so fast...
I'll believe it when miner stocks stop getting sold off
Selling rn
Will take a punt on PEPE üê∏
We didn‚Äôt have so many high profile memecoins in the run up to the last bullrun. We‚Äôre in new territory when it comes to how high memecoins will go and whether it‚Äôs a good signal of the market top. I think many people following OP‚Äôs line of thinking will fall for the first bear trap.
Yeah I just sold my SHIB bags for 93% profit. Thanks pumpers!
I also dont like/understand doge/shiba
I do understand making dough...so
Im running with the doggs
Remember shib isn‚Äôt a good investment but if you can turn $100-1000 into 200-2000 in a day and a half it‚Äôs all fun and games  I would not advise throwing anymore than $1000 (if you are a gambler) into this crypto as long term I can‚Äôt see it staying at this level and since it is worth so little it can either move up really fast or completely crash. Bitcoin can do the same by a couple thousand but it‚Äôs probably not going to drop by half in 24hrs. So if it drops by 1/5 again you may need to ask yourself some questions.
I fell for it last time.  Never again.  Only BTC and ETH for me, not getting greedy.
10%? Are you 80 years old?
Yea yea yea but .... how long do I hold my SHIB I bought the last time this happened before I dump it and continue to be part of the problem?!?!?!?!
Pepe is just getting started ü§†
Say what you want, taking profits on my 10x pepe bags feels good.
Doge and shib are worlds apart.
Need to zoom out.
Keep the doggies out!!!
I've had doge since 2021. When I checked today I was thrilled and threw another $50 into it (and maybe another $200 into various other cryptos)
"when crypto becomes greater than 10% of your net savings pot take profit"

umm that's always been the case since I started accumulating again possibly
No ill stick with the altcoins, more profits
DOGE will forever be the OG meme coin. I‚Äôll always buy some just for the lol of it.
need help, trying to swap my 50M+ shib out, any good swaps with cheap/non-existent fees?
Who let the dogs out?
i just put $20 into every coin that got popular in 2020 and I'll check on em in like 2040
I think a smart choice is to just allocate a certain percentage of portfolio to the type of coins. Like 30% to Bitcoin/ETH, 50% to good altcoins, rest 20% to meme coins to balance the portfolio. Whichever % a person wants to use as per his/her needs and wishes.
Been dcaing doge for 3 years. Feels good.
Aren't the 'alts' like shib/pepe/elon only pumping because there is incentive to win eth on [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) when you buy it? I thought that was what was going on.
Memecoin ETFs coming soon lol
LINU has been one of my best investments so far and still has a ton of room to run.
What exchange will be the next one? 

Coinbase: displaying 0 as a balance? Or
Crypto(.)com: for not distributing the rewards?
Just buy BONK. You know it will 5-10X from here. Quick easy return.
I don't understand the thinking behind dumping profits or hard-earned USD into high market cap dog coins. Like, don't people realize that when a token is already in the billions of mcap, they don't stand a chance at making a good profit AND cash out before those who were earlier cash out?

Instead, just throw your spare crypto at low mcap, community dog coins with high potential like BORK or LINU
Cmoooooon $1.00 LUNA!!!!
Fuck me for betting on ETH instead of BTC ,, fuck me
BONK coin made me 4K today tho ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I have bought and held crypto for a while, starting around 2017 when I bought too close to the all-time high of 17k. Held on to it for a long time. Had to sell a big chunk of my Bitcoin at 48k recently. I needed the cash.

Just this week though, I made 30 bucks off xyo coin with only a $300 investment. Then 30 bucks on Shiba Inu with about half that, and then about 200 on Shiba inu again!

I'm not getting rich yet, but it's nice, fun, baby steps! 

I understand the risks of putting money in a meme coin. I'm only doing this with what tiny bit of risk capital i have. 

I dollar cost average Bitcoin with direct deposit from my paycheck.
I see those alt coins as lottery ticket. Sometimes I buy 10$ worth of shitcoins and I treat it like that.
Except bitcoin the blockchain is old and has not evolved into the state of modern blockchains like ERGO. When mainstream discovers ERGO, and how it is such an improvement over bitcoin in all aspects of the trilemma, there will be ETFs on it and 500x is totally realistic scenario, $1000 each ERGO coin easy
I have no idea whats going on but I like to see some green in a while
I'm dcaing into BTC and ETH only for now, they're around 70-75% of my portfolio combined. Only other coin I was regularly buying was SOL, and this week was the last of my dca to reach my desired allocation (8.5%).

DOGE & SHIB I buy here and there lately but it's more play money. People buy a scratch card / lottery ticket? I buy those coins instead, and tbh I'm gonna just give the profits to my parents.
DCA'ing out. Sell to retail, guys.
I‚Äôm kicking myself for not casting a wider net with meme coins. I think there is still more pump to go around though. DOGELON is a relatively low market cap that hasn‚Äôt pumped big yet.
You bought LTC üò≤. Brother in Christ are you here to win?
I hope they dump early, and it all goes back into BTC for the mega pump.
Shit coins and crypto in general is like going to the carnival and playing a game where there is a big spinning plate. You can only see the plate directly in front of you, you throw money on the plate and can pick money off the plate whenever you want. But you can't see who else is playing, how big their hands are or when they decide to pick money back up. Still fun to play sometimes.
Why can‚Äôt people get it through their thick heads that DOGE is a *coin*, and SHIB is a *token*? This isn‚Äôt hard, people.
Writing down all other "Alts" as "Shitcoins" because they're not Eth or BTC is a big opportunity missed.
$LINU is next
Update?
SHIB is a token, not a coin. Please get your basic facts straight.
EVERYTHING Trading sideways
Sorry old thread but this seems to be correct. They are inversely crashing like HELL as the market is heating back up rn

SHIB is different than DOGE
Meme coins are gambling stuff, do whatever. But if you don't want to stare at your crypto wallet all the time, juste go for BTC ETH and enjoy life.
I would love for SHIB to be the DOGE of this cycle and get to like 1 cent or something.
Doge and SHIB are still 50% away from last bull run highs.   The retail FOMOing process your talking about is going to take a year or more until we hit a top...  Cash out now and you will be losing alot of potential gains.  \*Not a financial advisor\* LOL
because maxis keep telling future victims of scams that shitcoins like shib are "just like doge", creating posts about how much gains they made...

I wonder why those beginners with no understanding of crypto fall for the memes when all the maxis spread it with conviction.

Imho, anyone who can't tell the difference between a currency coin and a scam token should not claim that they understand crypto... but that might just be me. 

Without BTC-Maxis, probably 99% of all shit-coin losses could have been prevented... but ego matters more than educating new traders, so there's that...
nawwwwww 

Shiba for the win

Shiba to the moon!!!!!! honestly i dont need it to go to the moon ... $1 per coin is enough
Grouping Doge with Shib is a sign of a noob. Doge is more legit than almost every other crypto, including the likes of Solana and Cardano.  It is also more decentralized than ETH. Still undervalued at its current price.

As for Shib, yeah, agreed.
redditcoin is pumping today
10%? Of my net savings pot? Take profits? 

I guess OP is OG enough to experience and describe one cycle, but not OG enough to realize that selling back into fiat might not be the end game here.
Just a note... when tour grandparents/parents start asking you about crypto (assuming they normally aren't interested) and it's consistently on the news, it's time to start selling whatever you want to sell.
Think you meant "keep DCA'ing into BTC and definitely not Extremely Troublingly High-fee ETH."
Doge and shib being up 100% and 190% meanwhile Pepe is just casually up over 600% in like 2 weeks üòÇ
Fuck EatH SOL is the way, shilly shilly touch my willy.
Invest in shitcoin can loose your hard working btc holdings
Bee boop
Bonk‚Ä¶.my crypto investment. Look into it.
Pepe ftw!! All in
At least provide some reasons or rationale why BTC and ETH are good coins and DOGE and SHIB are not good. Just because a crypto has a picture of a dog on it, it doesn't mean it's bad quality. You should judge anything by its substance and utility rather than aesthetics and emotions.
Well it might be over now. Everyone is selling. Hope you got out in the green. Or set your stop loss so you don‚Äôt wake up tomorrow deep in the red.
Eth is not BTC. It's not as entrenched or inevitable
Rule 5:

Simple price speculation posts are not allowed. This includes posting portfolios and new price movement of a coin.
You're in 2010.....you're telling me you would have sold $btc in all the ups and downs instead of holding? 14+ years? Whatever you have put in back then 100,1k, 5k?
They just follow the rise in Bitcoin lol.. it's not rocket appliances.
Instructions unclear , my biggest gains are when I YOLO‚ÄôD into solana , am DCAing out slowly now
Good luck making it with a 5x on your investment lol
$WELSH AND $ANALOS FTW
Y'all still don't get it...

Meme coins are the new version of "collectibles" ~ not unlike the hyped fads that were Beanie Babies, Cabbage Patch Dolls, Pet Rocks and a gazillion other schemes. This is nothing new...the pig just has a different color of lipstick...
Do you realize that every cycle has different alts pumping the most? People are still waiting for the XRP pump of 2017. They wont get it. It's over.

Doge may pump 10x this time but maybe it wont if Pepe and Bonk are this cycle's Doge.
so I should or should not buy more pepe
Is it counted if i lost mine to alex mashitsky?
[removed]
Bitconnecttttttttttt
Oh boy have I lived
Thing is brc/eth are also pumping, which is strange.
> ETH/BTC profits in alts.

ETH is an alt. 

Oh and DOGE well outperformed it last bull run.
Ahh how can I ever forget this
Don't forget that you gotta pay taxes on those BTC profits.
at least you bought in
Wise words from a not so wise man. 

I see myself in this.
$LINU !?!?!?
I'm so pissed cause I thought last week I was late when I already saw doge and shib mooning and started looking for other meme coins, that's when I saw pepe but thought there's no way.  

Still upset that I dumped more into LTC as my third biggest holding instead of dipping my toes into any of those 3 meme coins earlier this week
Bought into the memes, didn‚Äôt sell and they all fell out. Left all my shares alone and all the sudden they‚Äôre all pumping to the moon again. I will definitely be selling this go around.
I picked up a small bag of DOGE last week and it will be fun to see what happens with that. It joins my small bags of ADA and GRT, but BTC/ETH still make up 95% of my crypto holdings.
This 100%
You prob saved yourself from losing money. You hear about the winners more than losers.
My $10 is worth like $100 now.
my 50 bucks is 600 now. I hoped it was gonna go the way other shitcoins like Shiba and Doge. Looks like the stupid gamble is gonna pay off. Which is why I bought the 50 bucks a couple of months ago
My $20 is worth $7500
Sold my Pepe, 2 months ago.
bonk
PEPE IS KING
And all of this cause whalepump decided to liquidate shorts
Dogwithhat wants a word
I decided to split $10k between bonk and pepe early last year. I held it for a month and moved it back into btc. I'm struggling seeing the repercussions from that one.
Inu
maybe, but the moment the news spill about the ATH there has to be a correction at some point that destroys the first wave of new paper hands
I expect at least a 25% pullback before the top
Just launched: ‚Äúthe stupidest fucking project that I can and put a small amount of money in-coin‚Äù
I did that once in 2021 with $30, into shib. Made 15k at ath and up over 10k on my other half. You can get lucky tbh
Look at HVI then, it has 10x or even 100x potential
Buy mog coin on eth and baja on blast. Wait 6 months and come back to this post
Honestly, this. I regret not going deeper on SHIB when I first heard of it. It has had the most gains out of my crypto so far, but I only invested gambling (minimal) amounts into it...
Yeah not stupid but Bit Cone
Bitcone is one of those
Does something that sounds like HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu ring true?
$LINU is the next Shib. Join the TG
![img](avatar_exp|167512249|fire)

sure it will just hodl
Don‚Äôt let your memes be dreams !! I threw about $80 in about 2 months ago and it‚Äôs paying off so far ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs hope mine too turns into riches
YES! LETS GO! DIAMOND HANDS!
Same boat as me, dawg
So fucking true. Once Algo pumps take profits and prepare for winter¬†
Same with ATOM
420 pump it!
Buy PEPE2.0
If it makes it to $1, I can finally replace my car with something even older and more expensive. 

To the fucking moon...
I am pretty confident that we may see it hit $1 but maybe that‚Äôs just bag holder optimism.

If BTC can hit $100K I‚Äôm sure DOGE can hit $1.
I made an entry after the shibarium flop. Up 370% from September. I thought it was a bad move until now.
Pretty much yeah. There‚Äôs no real use cases, it‚Äôs just a clown show cyclical casino with all ‚Äúprojects‚Äù having equal merit which is essentially zero.
Indeed, I've learned my lesson as well.
Orai, Orai, Orai, Orai...

Are you staking your Orai?
$LINU
Like this thinking... Plot Twist: Wall Street goes Bitcoin so Main Street goes Dog Coin üòÇ
This man Pepes!
You can do a 7x leverage on pepe lmao on binance. Pretty easy to just margin buy when it's going up and set a stop loss and instead of worrying about it for months you just get your gains or loss in 1 day :)  
In a way I think it being so incredibly risky makes it less risky as you are just betting on it not going down in a short period of time.
Meme coin pumping is a bad sign.
smart. keep ignoring until you actually need to use the capital.
Thank you for your sacrifice.
How much did you have in it?
What are some friendly Solana DEXs?
I got cat with hat to be unique.
10k% = 100x
$100 to $10k
$10k to 1million
Crazy, garbage coins. Cant believe people actually buy a ‚Äúsnek‚Äù coin
Samoyed seemed to be pumping
[deleted]
>Lol why the fuck are you in crypto if ur happy with 10% returns

He said greater than 10% of your net savings, not 10% ROI. Big difference.
Tf are you even responding to? Btc is up over 4x from bottom
Thank you! So much horrible advice posted left and right around here. The bull run is just beginning and Doge will probably shatter past is last all time high of 70cents. There‚Äôs tons of money to be made with these.
we are gonna see a major correction, halving is a buy the rumor sell the news situation much like the original ETF announcement and things are gonna plummet down to 40k for a few months, then god candle to like 100k
People said the same thing in 2017 and 2021 during the run ups. At the end of the day no one knows shit including you and me.
so you're shitting on other people for thinking they know what they're talking about while you are sitting here pretending like you know what you're talking about?
Straight facts
yup DOGE's ATH was like .70
Could would should.
Weren‚Äôt memes kinda a new phenomena last bull run though? at least meme coins that shoot up for crazy gains with large social media attention. Is there really enough history with meme coins to understand how they react to a pumping Bitcoin?  My guess is that as long as btc stays hot, human nature will take over and people are always going to take a lottery chance and moonshots
I hope this cycle has evolved from the last in that NFTs are never a big thing ever again
Well, at least it means we're still early then and it's not too late to buy and profit off of these shit coins...
i feel this in my bones. id be rich if i hadnt listened to my dumb friends and just kept mining doge

instead i learned a lot about crypto via doge. and of course still hold some of my original doge when it was worth .0001 or wtf ever lol
same. i remember the good old days of that crowd-funding effort in the doge subreddit to put doge wrapping (or decals?) on a nascar car. sadly i cashed out in 2017 for a small fraction of what doge is worth now, but it's amazing to see how far it has come and how long it has managed to survive while staying at the forefront of crypto discussions.
It's like two guys having a "*who can kick the others testicles the hardest*" competition. Stupid, amusing and entertaining to watch for many but not directly participate in üòÇ
I love reading these posts with people saying ‚Äúthis will definitely happen and this will happen‚Äù

The catch phrase of last bull run was ‚Äúno one knows shit about fuck‚Äù, haven‚Äôt seen that pop up for a while.
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/x-twitter-obtains-license-to-store-transfer-and-trade-bitcoin-and-crypto

I wouldn't be surprised if sometime in the big bullrun hype moment Elon would come and say something about 'xyz crypto will be the first to store/trade on X'.
haha true
PEPENET
I bought 200 bucks worth a few months ago. I‚Äôm up like 800 percent.
We might never see under 50k...
$300 in. Haha
OH REALLY
What would you suggest for someone looking to enter in right now?
I fomo‚Äôd into LINU the day before they hit their first CEX, like last Thursday. I‚Äôm up x3 even after the post BTC consolidation. I‚Äôm holding SHIB & DOGE of course but comparing market caps, I‚Äôm counting on LINU to moon again once they get on the next exchange.

SHIB was up 5x on my initial investment, so I just took out what I put in and now I can relax and let the rest ride.
Shib at $1 would be 500x the market cap of NVidia üòÇ
0.01 will be insane and it will make a lot of Shib people a lot of money. I love hopium as much as the next person but Shiba is never getting to $1 or anywhere close.
Sell to fiat to buy physical assets.
Except beanie babies didnt go up 100x every 4 year bullrun. Dogecoin does.
Did you not get the payout? I received my BTC and ETH in coinbase last week.
Real ‚Äúliving‚Äù is Mt.Gox, Celsius, and BlockFi.
Celsius for me haha.
Don't forget those of us bent over by Voyager too. Got like 1/4 back of what I had
Voyager has entered the chat
Wasa Wasa Wasa Wasa Wasa Wasaupppp
Just came here to make this comment, and did. I apologize for not seeing yours first.
Alts haven‚Äôt started pumping.  Wait til we hear about some layer 3 nft gaming opportunities.
In the true sense of the word yes. More referring to shitcoins as alts as opposed to the ‚Äúblue chips‚Äù
I wouldn't say it's an alt. It is the one crypto that people actually use.
I threw some money into Harambe on Solana. Logic is simple, its a big meme and in May 2024 there are two important events.

1. The new planet of the apes movie is coming out early May. The memes are obvious "apes together strong" etc
2. Harambe death is May 28th

To be fair I also had a similar logic to Pepe assuming it would only go parabolic closer to the trump election as Pepe and trump go hand in hand.

I say threw some money as in I'm not betting the farm on this, its just gambling
Gtfo out of LTC. Held LTC from 2018-2024. Biggest mistake of my crypto life so far. Any other coin would have given me 2-5x the gains. Sold at 72 and bought ADA instead.
I sold my ltc last week for Pepe üôÉ
Dogecoin is going to $25 so it's not too late
Most of my holdings are in the top coins but I diversified to meme coins. I ended up putting a decent amount into LTC and I kind of regret it. I thought it was a late runner but it might be a dud where I'll just get 50% while others moon.
I thought the same, I was like Pepe coin, looks kind of sketchy and it's already up 100%, pass. I went into another coin that did nothing while Pepe went another 300% and the other meme coins took off. Now you have Bonk and Baby Bonk that have low market caps that I assume will be next to rocket, if not them then something else surely will after Shib and Doge peak in market cap, people will be looking for the next big meme.
"shares"   
Good luck.
I learned my lesson from the last bull run. 3 weeks ago I bought DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK. 

Now the question is when do I take profits? I think I can wait until taking out my original investment is 20% of the total value. I‚Äôm almost there!
No I still lost money playing the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù bets. 

Whereas if I had have followed my left curve instincts and bought the dumb animal coins I would have made bank.

I am not saying that it will work out this time, it probably won‚Äôt. But sometimes left curving is the strategy and this will be the bull that I left curve aggressively.
Ain‚Äôt worth shit until you sell it!
Forgot I had some on binance so I've just looked and my ¬£7 worth 7 days ago is now worth ¬£54 lol
My $60 is worth $250 wild. Wish I had been dcaing in alt coins like I said I was going to do a year ago. Oh well. Can‚Äôt time the market.
Dump it
I did the same, but picked the wrong memes. Classic.

Guess I'll wait.
I was dumb and didnt do what you did.  but im still up 30%, which aint bad. even if it is $30
damn
Remember looking at Pepe under 2 million and going ‚ÄúDont we have a million Pepe coins already‚Äù ‚ò†Ô∏è
I pit a couple hundred in SHIB for fun a while ago, I didn‚Äôt even look at it for ages. When I saw this post I went to check and Im at 1300‚Ä¶ I let it pump, I don‚Äôt care if it comes down crashing and burning üòÇ
Sheesh. What‚Äôs your plan? Riding it out?
Rip
L
Bonk is the way
bonk
Bonk !
bonk
GOLDEN Inu
CONE
Usually things heat up more when an ATH happens.

Not less.
There will be multiple pullbacks, there always has been
5,000%+ in one year
Don‚Äôt forget ‚Äúwif hat‚Äù
I‚Äôd say Wojak
pamp it
$LINU
Yeah, kucoin has got it for 15%
Why so
Birdeye.so , and dextools..
Bonk is solana.
Or $10k to rug. No one is pulling $1m out but the creators
[deleted]
Snek is love. Snek is life.
now you know why. still unbelievable
Lol I don‚Äôt even own any Bonk and I know it‚Äôs gonna go way up this cycle
Congrats, you have eyes.

Use them to read his entire post and you should be able to figure out what my comment was directed at.
[deleted]
I don't mind either way. I'm happy if we drop as I have spare cash to invest but if not comfortable in my current position. I hear alot of people saying we will drop after halving and so I think we may not. As seems like alot of people want to buy at lower price and when that the case normally opposite happens. If look at who buying BTC it is mostly from ETF and institutions rather than retail and so I don't think there will be a big sell-off I could be wrong though of course.
üòπ
dude in what world was the etf a ‚Äúbuy the rumor sell the news‚Äù event. Btc has a permabid since etf approval that has liquidated every mouth breather on the planet who claimed it was a sell the news event
True but 2017 and 2021 were end of 4 year cycle. If this is the top it would mean that whole bitcoin cycle that bitcoin has always followed would be broken. It could be the case, but I think it would be strange for that to happen now with ETF and all the extra money flowing in
basically the entire crypto community
they're right lol you can look all that info up on chain. People thinking this is another boom and bust crypto cycle dont really know what they're talking about
To be fair, his gripe was with people making market predictions. He simply stated what is actually happening. Not some sort of guess, just facts of action in the market (which he is right on all accounts).

What these actions mean for the market is up for debate (although I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious).
Doge has been around since 2013
Yeah, it's pretty wild how much of a survivor doge has proven to be.
It has to be DOGE.

I think BAT for tipping would be much more useful but doubt Elon would add any features that wouldn't be under control of Twitter.
We will, we have always seen a retrace, well get to 40-43k for sure, but it will be a quick wip only
It all depends on whether or not the rally will continue. If it does, I think LINU will do very well.

Another dog coin that I really like because it's simply funny and similar to LINU also low market cap, community-driven & liquidity locked is UPDOG
I vaguely recall hearing that about Doge before it cleared 70 cents, which in crypto terms is just a stone's throw away from a dollar. For that matter, it was also said about BTC once upon a time. I've stopped saying 'never' when it comes to crypto.
Nope. They told me to make a Coinbase account to receive my payout, but I live in Taiwan and Coinbase isn't available in Taiwan. Their solution to this problem? Make a Coinbase account.... Which is impossible. Myself and many international creditors are in this situation right now. Most likely they'll send me the cash value of my BTC from when BTC was at around $30,000 **in USD**.... Meaning I not only lose my BTC, but also all the profits I have right now since BTC is almost twice as much as it was when they decided the value I would get back. So much for my $32k average cost. It sucks.
I got my payout in BTC and ETH and I‚Äôm glad BTC is pumping at the moment, but it still doesn‚Äôt cover my losses since I only got a fraction of the value that was in my portfolio
Throw Bitgrail 2017 in there as well.  Fun times.
I've been waiting for my gox coins for 10 years
Trendon shavers days, people hunting him down ü§£
I live on the edge - BTCe
Yep happened to my dad. He was being ‚Äúsafe‚Äù with his crypto
Is that you Carlos?
ü§£
Buddy at the bar 2 seats down was talking something about that latest nft stuff last week.. Literally on the 27th just before this latest bigger jump. I didn't catch what he was going on about because I'm good with what I got right now AND got burned like the rest from Dec 2020 - Dec 2022.

I hate to do this...  but what are they talking about?  Hahaha.
Then call them shitcoins. There's nothing wrong with "altcoin" per se.
It just means alternative coin to Bitcoin. It's not an indicator of lack of adoption.
never seen such a thoughtful analysis on a memecoin.
>I threw some money into Harambe

Just reading it gives me the giggles.
I'm in deep with the dogs and thinking a moon will come on 4/20 because it's also the Bitcoin halving. Lambo or homeless 2025!
My logic is similar for reddit coins. Reddit IPO causes moons and donuts to pump
Keeping your money in LTC is like keeping it under your bed, except a hooker steals money from you every now and then.
Hold that ADA for 2-5 yrs and you will be feel like a new person ‚úåÔ∏è
Yeah I got in at an average of 67 this year but I'm disappointed in it's movement compared to others.. might convert some to other coins not sure what though I feel like I'm already too late for alt season
Lol I have ltc I bought in 2017 that has been underwater most of its life.  I should have dumped that shit when it managed to get its head above water and take a breath in 2021
Sold LTC and bought another underperformer.  You cannot make this up.  Wtf is wrong crypto Reddit?
One flop to another nice
Nice!! Where did you buy it from? Thought I'd be able to on Coinbase but now stuck with some eth in the wallet lol
25 is not a meme!!!
Hhehehehehe
Thanks?
My rule of thumb is 4x and then i withdraw the initial investment.
What about floki lol?
Take profit when btc hits ATH to be safe
Exactly
Wtf  I left pepe coin since August in exchange and just saw it double in price lol.

Damn it's altseason
Selling memecoins here is probably silly. Looking like we get a continued defi summer type situation based on memes imo. Could be wrong but the market is making itself clear: utility is a fucken joke
My mates said the same thing after the first 30% pump.. I‚Äôm still holding it at over 600% now üòÇ
The best thing is that it wasnt even my own money, in the sense that I made a quick successful trade, took 50 bucks put it into pepe just as a stupid gamble. Still, my sell signal is when my friends start talking about crypto, which hasnt happened yet. Alternatively, I might pull out at BTCs ATH, and buy back in the inevitable post halving dump
The only reason I bought SHIB is because it‚Äôs on RH. Safe to say that RH is by far the most accessible crypto exchange for retail to use and thus any coin on there will get lifted when the flood arrives. As of now I would think it‚Äôs just starting and with BTC likely to break ATH before the halving we could be entering uncharted territory. Hold one lil doggies!
My biggest win so far! I already took crazy profits, and this 1billion is my moonbag.
That's why I'm still here haha, if I would take profits and buy back in over the past 3 years I would have won the game by now.
Yeah, pretty much.
I regret not bonkin
Go to shitcoin jail
jasmy
Pepe has been reaching new ATHs everyday, so yeah‚Ä¶ hard to time that.
Definitely feels more this way
Too early, this sub only mentions things when it's too late.
The exchange known for withdrawal issues? Not sure I'd bring it up, you might get people burned
Speaking of liquidity, I bought a meme that keep making me up my slippage because my buy was so damn big, it wasn't it just had such a small market cap that when it did go through you could see my purchase on the graph of the coin, it spiked, it made me laugh. Got 21 trillion coins now of meme coin.
You clearly dont. The only place 10% is mentioned is the allocation you mong
Never said that but this cycle it will. Whether that‚Äôs this year or next is anyone‚Äôs guess.
especially during a bullrun. Seems i'm surrounded by geniuses during the bull
Correct, but I don‚Äôt think any meme coins were cracking top 100 coins by market cap in the 2017 run? I could be wrong tho. Like there was a little run with doge in 2017/2018 but not like 2021. It seems like the trend of insane gains from meme coins came out of 2020/2021 bull run with the likes of doge/shiba, and is continuing this time around with other meme coins since people like dollar signs and a chance of 1000x gains. I‚Äôm just thinking it‚Äôs a small sample of meme coins to make a prediction and think that the behavior could be different this time around regarding meme coins, seeing a peak earlier
I sincerely hope you are right!! (I‚Äôll be a multi millionaire if so!)
Get a vpn or someone to make an account for you in your friend group
They didn't provide any other options?

I wasn't actually paying too much attention to all the legal proceedings so I was actually surprised when I got a deposit and thought the email notification was spam.
That is very unfortunate. If you know and of course trust someone in a country where it is allowed then maybe ask them to help. I hope you at least get your $30k back but that‚Äôs really bad considering it has 2x from that point
Sorry to hear. I'm lucky because I was already over-collateralized and I got back most of the difference.
Ditto.
Exactly man. That was supposed to be my safe portion. The rest I yoloed into futures which didn't work out well either. Expensive lesson.
Oh no no no no no
Some sort of fungus tokens. I think it was speculation about next season on the last of us (they hadn‚Äôt played the games
Edited to oblige
This gentleman/lady needs a podcast.
this is bear market ptsd. We have no hit btc ath and traditionally, alt season happens after btc rips a new ath. Cut your losers and buy winners. Id rather chuck it all in a chart that‚Äôs up 60% on the hour than something thats stagnated while virtually every coin is ripping.
Crypto.com has a lot of shit coins available
I‚Äôm wasn‚Äôt aware of that one so I passed. God damn it!
PEPErhands ü§£
nice, congrats, braver than I
I'm happy for you :)
what 1 billion?
Let‚Äôs goooooo
BONK
Now is the time to get into coins with less than $50MM and let it sit for awhile. These might swing down 20-50% if btc has a correction, but I‚Äôm not as worried about timing the market on these since the upside outweighs the risk. I like WOJAK for the next big meme coin.
You mean based on that one post because the dude didn't want to kyc?
KuCoin is the portable latrine of crypto platforms. Fuck that exchange.
For your sake, I hope I'm right, too. The crypto space is odd, and nobody in their right mind in 2021 would have predicted that a meme coin like Doge would still be viable several years later. Could happen for Shib,  too. Not the particular gamble I'll be taking, because I'm sticking to my own plan, but somebody playing their cards right could do very well with it.
Pretty sure Coinbase requires KYC before you can actually do anything with your account.
Terrible idea for a bankruptcy proceeding
Nope. They just said "Make a Coinbase account" and left it at that. International creditors have been largely ignored. Don't know why they would make Coinbase the distribution partner when so many countries can't use Coinbase. Just idiocy and incompetence all around. Luckily I'm only down about $2000 at the moment, but for me that's a lot... That's a month's salary for me here in Taiwan.
Sorry to hear. Cost my dad 20k. It was a big number for him.
ü§£
That's obliging indeed.
Good to know thanks!
Pump PEPE LETS GO
1 bil pepe. I bought 4 billion for $80 and sold 3b, kept 1b for moonbag
Probably the amount of shib coins that he got for a 100$ t the time
Pepe billionaire sounds cool Iol I'm also holding 1.3 trillion babydoge I bought for a couple hundred bucks. It's not as good as pepe, but it was my og coin.
PEPENET on xeggex
PEPENET on xeggex
I browsed their sub for a couple minutes and saw a fuckton of threads describing these issues¬† ¬†


People are baiting other people to buy dogshit like memecoins, so I guess any sort of virtue is out the window already. This sub is just a complete scamfest, blind leading the blind. You're just falling in line I guess, whatever
Kucoin is all I use üòÖ love that exchange compared to the other 15 I went through in the past
That sucks.

Hopefully they figure something out for international creditors.
DM me I got one :)
Bro that sucks, but I kinda feel like you should've checked all that out before you jumped in so big.
Has he claimed his reimbursment yet?
Well played sir, congrats
Hell yeah, i don‚Äôt feel like going through multiple apps to buy it. I just deal with the major apps for cryptos these days. I have some super shit coins on my old computer that I totally forget how to access üòÇ I loaded up on shiba last week. 50mill is lookin nice right now.
Nah too inaccessible
Thanks for the offer, but the Coinbase account needs to use the same email address as my Celsius account did, and also no offense but I wouldn't trust a random stranger on the internet with so much moneyüòÇ
Celsius looked as legit as any other company in the space, until they didn't. I'm not sure what sort of "checking all that out" there was he could have done. 

We're all at the mercy of a 3rd party somewhere along the line unless you're buying locally with cash straight to a cold wallet (and even that has its own risks).
Haha yeah, i have 25m Shiba too lol! You know "not your keys, not your crypto " everything's good, till it's not.
You‚Äôll see!
The Perfect $1 million Gain
Hi guys, I‚Äôm a 23 year old in college, and yesterday I woke up a millionaire. Should I buy some hookers, Pokemon cards, or cocaine? I gambled my entire life savings of $250k on 2037 calls of $4.5 AMC on Monday and sold yesterday morning. Thanks for reading.

This is somehow real. I am as shocked as you are. Unreal timing

https://preview.redd.it/6bdkjpks3m0d1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3052f028b5feb063821c4564c91305b9465a6a3
Congrats! Might be a good time to verify your email address.
How does one at your age acquire 250k as your life savings
Put ur money in a good % yield etf and forget about it. Delete ur reddit account and never get on this sub again. Congrats and fuck you
To make that an even more perfect 1 million gain, I‚Äôm happy to take that $3,822.32 from you.
Cash out. Put in savings account. Spend at least 6 months thinking about something non-regarded to do with that money. And finish your degree.
Listen your frontal lobe is not developed yet but for the love of God withdrawal all one million and put it into the SPY on a different brokerage. Or a high yield savings account. 

You are now securely in the top 0.0001% of people your age. You can retire 30 years earlier and have an extra 80k in dividends and appreciation to spend every year. 

Congrats and fuck you.

Also save some for taxes.
A college kid with 250k? how many Glory hole parties did you attend?


Also congrats and fuck you!
Ah so you were rich and got even richer

You son of a bitch. Remember half going to taxes and just chill with the rest bro. Congrats on the insane gain.
Coming from someone who got lucky and won about a million dollars. 

1) quit trading.

2) pay your estimated quarterly taxes.

3) stick it all in an index fund. 

4) find a better hobby 

It‚Äôs very hard to walk away on top. I didn‚Äôt do anything too atrocious, primarily thanks to my wife if I‚Äôm honest with myself. I spent most of the money on a home. However, I did bleed several hundred thousand over the next few years.  It‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù money, an amount that is extremely hard to save and you‚Äôll be wishing you had it back when life expenses present themselves. I live in a HCOL area and while the win was certainly helpful, I didn‚Äôt miss a day of work or anything over it.  Additionally, I personally found myself becoming very obsessed with money, greed is ultimately a bottomless pit, it‚Äôs never enough and provides very little satisfaction in your day-to-day life. 

If you want to do something aggressive, then do 43% UPRO and 57% EDV. However, with that amount of money, you‚Äôll find 100% VOO will have  huge swings in comparison to your income and it‚Äôs a lot more tax/fee friendly.

Edit: Just noticed your age. Literally do not fuck around with that amount of money, you‚Äôre rich if you put most of it in index funds and forget about it.  Also, I absolutely double down on the quit trading/gambling sentiment. The absolute best case scenario already occurred, you won. I‚Äôm one of the rare persons with a history of problem gambling that ultimately financially benefited. However, I‚Äôll never get back all the years in my 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs I wasted in casinos/card rooms, failed relationships, preoccupation with and/or gambling instead of building healthy hobbies and relationships. Walk away and don‚Äôt look back.
You‚Äôre the lucky one, now ride off into the sunset and enjoy your life. The system doesn‚Äôt want kids like you making a million overnight on robinhood.
You could turn that $1 million into $4 million by making the same play!
Get off of this sub now, you literally hit the lotto. No need to stay here with the poors.

It sounds like you got lucky twice, if I were you I would hire an educated financial manager for that money.
Good shit selling unlike most of the regards
Congrats and fuck you regard
How did you get $250k in college?
Pay your taxes!
If your 23 and have 250k and in college 
I‚Äôd say you are already rich
What the fuck
You smell bad. Congrats
Hello‚Ä¶. Ive been trying to reach you about your car‚Äôs extended warranty.
250k life savings at 23? Ok
How to become a millionaire, have millionaire parents who can lend you $100k
As a broke 29 year old ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)

Congrats and fuck you
Congrats and fuvk you
Congrats!! Don't get hooked on the action.
Did you sleep well this night?
Where tf did you get the first 250k at age 23? At that age I had like 14 dollars and a bag of weed to my name
How tf did you predict that exactly?
Ah yes. The age old, gotta have massive money to make massive money
# What horrible news. My condolences to you and yours. Stay strong. Time heals all. Fuck yourself forever. Keep on keeping on. Hang in there. Rest in peace. Stay positive.
This is the guy in the other end of your trade
Awesome.
Please stop taking high risk yolos now, you have enough capital to play this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and stop being a regarded wsb
Set up for life. Fuck you
 Come to bogleheads
Sweet! Now you can gamble your life savings of $1.2M and turn it into $10M. Don‚Äôt be a pussy.
now for the love of god stop trading options and stick it in some solid investments
Literally just buy voo and you and generations are set.
Fuck you
Still waiting for the ‚Äúhow‚Äôd you get 100k at 23‚Äù answer
Can you answer how did you get the initial 100k? All you do is avoid the question. At least say you don‚Äôt want to answer. Be a man about it.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226)
23 year old with a 250k in savings?
How did you hear about AMC ahead of its run?
Your life savings? Don't you mean your parents. 23 year old college students don't have this type of money. Congrats on the gains though!
Save all but 25k for taxes and long term safer investments. Never touch the rest until you are over 30 (and for a good reason). Put most in voo or spy and some in bitcoin. If you do this you're set up for life. The 25k is to still continue the fun you had with all the risk. If you need to scratch the itch all you have is 25k. Congrats and fuck you.
Summary to get rich start with 100k gamble on meme coin make 150k. Use 250k to gamble on meme stock 5X it bam millionaire. Take it to the bank tell them hey 10X this like Grant Cardone says. 10 million bam. Nothing can wrong.
Lot of jealous people on this sub. Congrats and Fuck you
Imagine being 23 and having 250K and willing to gamble that like that. That's some balls man. Go to Thailand and disappear forever.
Whatever you do, make sure you stash some for a rainy day or flood of the ages. If you must  splurge on a car, consider leasing or buying used just to scratch the itch without paying full price. The urge will wear off.
Pokemon cards so you can play it with the hookers!
The bitterness and resentment in this thread is wild.

Good job, dude!

Do something good with it!
How does a 23 year old in college have a life savings of 250k? oh wait i know
23 year old with 250k life savings.  Real‚Ä¶. No trust fund baby who was going to be rich regardless‚Ä¶ yea that‚Äôs real
Think you need to get all three thing brah, Pokemon cards to roll & do the chang with and two hookers, one riding dick, one licking your toes....

Haha, that was crazy man, but congrats!
Congrats don‚Äôt forget to donate to the small people like me! Also fuck you.
Don‚Äôt forget about taxes!!! Congratulations!!!
Glad to see a fellow league degen and toxic Yasuo player making a milly. Best advice brother, don‚Äôt be greedy. Take out even 250k to your bank account, that money will seem more real to you in your bank account than on Robinhood. Go withdraw 1k, touch and feel it and let your brain realize you have a unique opportunity to set yourself up going forward. Do your hard research about dividend stocks. Split your money up wisely, invest some in long term growth stocks and others in dividend stocks. Since you‚Äôre probably a degen gambler at heart (which is how you made this money in the first place), create a different trading account on a different platform. Limit yourself to 10k to play around with and yolo. If u lose that, stop gambling on stocks. If u make money, take it out and start again with 10k. Enjoy life man and treat yourself and your loved ones (be careful not to let people know you‚Äôve made it big or you‚Äôll soon find out how quickly money can ruin the closest bonds).
Welcome to WSB. 


Ant traders take note. No one cares about your $1k gains when dudes with nuts this large are among us.
SCARED MONEY DON‚ÄôT MAKE NONE!
College student with more savings than some retirees ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)
Good job üëè 

Haters be hatin. Don't do any of those things. Buy land. Buy a house you want, maybe some acreage, and invest a million in high dividend stocks (7%) and live off 50thousand/year and you can be growing your investments at 20000 a year and living off that money

Fuck everyone giving this guy advice. Dude made a mill on one ballsy fucking play. 

god speed soldier
"You can live like a king for a few years, or you can live like a prince forever."¬†Greatest advice I can ever give to anyone who gets a windfall. Cash out, invest in boring reliable funds. You can use it for the rest of your days to enrich your life, or blow it all on hookers and coke in a month.¬†¬†


Even setting up a revocable trust can be a great idea if you choose trustees that will protect you from yourself.¬†¬†


Congrats and fuck you.
Step 1: dont share your success on Reddit, people be trying to steal
1.2m in assets no verified email address lol
Life savings of 250k at 23 in college. Hmmmm
If I started with 250k & turned it into a mill, that might be the time I took profit & chilled out & "lowered my bet size." I won't give me opinion on what you should do. It's your $ and I hate when people tell others how they should spend their money.
Congrats and fuck you
What is the app? Is it robinhood?
i would say "congrats and fuck you" but i only feel like saying the "fuck you" part.
Your DM‚Äôs must be wild right now lol
Wish I had a small loan of 250k to piss away

Leave the kid alone.  He‚Äôs asking for advice.   
I say use some of the money to buy a modest house.   You will need to pay for a place to live regardless, so best to buy and let it appreciate.  As for the rest‚Ä¶.  Put 75% in a s&p 500 index fund, 20% in MMA @. 5% and enjoy 5%‚Ä¶ you earned it.    Congrats
You have a huge headstart on early retirement. Put it in an index fund and finish college. Put more money into it and reinvest until it eventually sits happy around 2.5 mil and retire at 30
For fucks sake, give all of it to someone that won't give it back until you are 30.
99% of ppl that win like you will lose it back, DO NOT PLAY OPTIONS AGAINü§£ or do ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The fact a 23 year old has 250k to gamble
On AMC shit stock just screams, my mom would wire over another 250 if I lost.
love that!

first time I had $100k was probably 23 or 24. can do a lot with that. its been up and down for me
23 year old college kid with 250k to start?
Reminder: 37% (40% to be safe) goes to Uncle Sam. Store that away so you don‚Äôt get surprised during tax season.
lol kids gambling with daddy's money. my piece of advice, quit while you're ahead.
Post the screenshot and timestamp of the trades.
Congrats and F U!
Dam that nice
Just curious, how much taxes would you have to pay?
Actual life changing play.  Now don't fuck it up because you are set if you don't gamble this away.
Fudge you and congrats
Don‚Äôt forget to save uncle Sam‚Äôs cut. Congrats regard
Buy BTC & Retire.
   Don't ever touch options again!
the nuts on you muy gordo
whatever you do don't take advice from anyone in the comments
Here‚Äôs some advice, plan at least 40% got taxes

Then move to a legit brokerage account like Schwab
If you sell it all, pay your taxes, you‚Äôre set up very nice for an unbelievably comfortable retirement in 40 years  if you treat it right homie
I hate you. üò≠
I‚Äôm a dentist making 200k+ a year.

Fuck you and nice work
If bro was rich enough to have 100k to start with im sure 1 million isn‚Äôt enough to quit options lmao don‚Äôt turn into a YouTube regard video
Seems like a good time to go on vacation somewhere where you can rent a dope car and not buy one. Cheers ü•Ç

I‚Äôll make sure to do that
Remember the other day when we were talking about our mothers' maiden names..?
Damn my college fund at 18 was 2k and that barely covered 2 classes..
You already know he has rich parents, don't be naive.
Work full-time inheriting money
Well the trick to being rich is being rich first
reach gray cheerful decide shy squash strong provide hateful hard-to-find
Step 1: Use Daddy‚Äôs money.
The Regard keeps burying the lede lol.

All it took was skill, dedication, and dads money.
I gambled my entire life savings of $100k on Shiba Inu and made $150k
Dead relatives
It's their dad's money 100%.
More importantly, what kind of reguard inherits 250k at 23, an amount that is honestly life changing at that age assuming you aren't stupid with it, an just yolo's 25% out of the money 3 day calls? Truly the stupidest bet that should not have paid off.
Trust fund baby
I appreciate the advice!
Seriously, fuck you op. Be smart and you're set for life.
Etf are like VOO right
Retired at 30 without saving another dime
OP gambled $250k. There‚Äôs a zero percent chance that they play it safe from here on out.
I would like to second the ‚Äúcongrats and fuck you‚Äù üòÇ no but seriously tho congrats
That‚Äôs like 60 packs of bacon though
I appreciate the advice!
Weirdly for this sub, this is some straight facts advice OP. Life just presented itself on a golden platter for you
Better than a savings account, just put it in a 5% CD. That way he won't be able to touch it, and at the end of the year it's a guaranteed $50k in fun money.
don‚Äôt listen to them, you know what‚Äôs better than $1M, $10M
Dude buy 1 million in calls.
Tbf his underdeveloped frontal lobe is what made him a millionaire overnight‚Ä¶.Godspeed regard ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421)
Bro his parents hooked him up with 250k as a high school graduation present. He's always been in the top 0.0001% of wealth for his age.
I would even recommend you to hire a financial manager at least until you're like 30 years old. Keep the original 250k to play with.
or...hear me out here, go put it all on 7-red on the roulette table, the whole million. That pays out 35:1 so you could really hit big! This is sound financial advice from someone who definitely doesn't scavange yesterdays fries from the Wendy's dumpster.
Wait you get money for Glory hole parties?
A tale as old as time itself
Started on 3rd and thought he hit a home run when he scored.

This part.
Not just the $250 in life savings. The willingness to gamble $250 at 23, knowing someone will fill it back up if it goes away.
Life savings aka daddy
69 god

Congratulations! Any win is still a win. Have fun with your PS5
Up vote this for OP, he's definitely going to forget his taxes
I thgt it was only 30%
Not only taxes..but he needs to pay estimated taxes this quarter, if in the US.
Fucking hate the government. Why the fuck do they think they are entitled to 50%. 10% max. 
You could trade and make profit from any country, nothing to do with being a US citizen.
I appreciate your advice!
5) Thoughts on them putting $10,000 aside to fuck around with in a brand new account to scratch the gambling itch?
>pay your estimated quarterly taxes

He doesn't need to bother with this. To avoid a penalty, all he needs to do is withhold enough throughout the year to match his last years tax liability or 90% of the current year. Safe to assume he didn't make $1 million last year. If he wants to make sure he isn't penalized he can just pay right now how much his tax liability was last year to ensure he's good.

Ultimately it would be better to put the amount he will owe into a HYSA so that it is ready to pay what he owes come tax season but gain some extra income in the meantime. Unless he knows he is terrible with money (someone gambling "life savings" arguably is) and wants to pay it now so he doesn't accidentally spend it.
absolutely do not do this.  you have your whole life to make more money.  blow all of it on cocaine and hookers.  you should get a solid 6 months of threesomes out of this.  please for the love of fucking god
Hey thank you!
What are you on about. He's a 23 year old with $250k in "life savings". He's already won life by having rich parents that gave him a quarter million to gamble with.
This is the right answer. You now have money to pay for a highly qualified financial manager. Get one and be smart about this. You put that money work for you to generate annual income that you can very comfortably live off of and literally not be obligated to work if you don‚Äôt want to (personally I would have to keep working because I would go stir crazy sitting at home with nothing to do). 

Also, buy all the Yasuo skins. YOLO.
yes sir I‚Äôm gonna try to find one asap
Hey thank you!
I will
his dad has an accounting firm on retainer, he'll be fine  
he was always going to be fine.
you would turn 100k into 0 anyways.
Hey thank you!
No I slept at 1am and woke up at 4
I didn‚Äôt it was luck
Hey thank you!
what‚Äôs that
This
I appreciate the advice!
Hey thank you!
I saw GameStop on Friday and it was up 60% so I went in on it
Gambled their whole savings until dad's next bonus.
Tell me more, what was your path to $100k?
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Hey if this would go sideways there's no need to verify üòÖ
23 year old in college with 250k savings. Why bother with college if you saved 250k doing whatever it was?
911
Being poor is the worse bro
my college fund at 18 was getting a job at the school library and eating frozen dumplings and ramen.
You had a college fund at 18?

Easy there, Warren Buffett...
I couldn‚Äôt even get my parents to sign the FASFAüíÄ
Damn, mine was like 800 bucks from grad party gifts + my HS job savings. Was gone in like two weeks after moving out...
My ‚Äúcollege fund‚Äù had a few thousand in it and my dad used it up a couple years before I turned 18 lol
what is a college fund ?
1000 percent this. Not possible any other way.
Only a person with rich parents could gamble that hard and not die from the anxiety. It's like the story of how Elon Musk is "brilliant" at playing poker because all he does it go all in on every hand because he can afford to lost 9x before winning the 10th.
sand wrong decide test desert memorize hurry arrest squash coherent
and you already know his posh dad is gonna be telling all his rich friends "my boy is a genius!"
Very very rich, not just well off too. Only very rich parents have kids with 250k in their *savings* at 23 when they're still in college.
Probably could‚Äôve lost it all and still be ahead of 99% of people
The rich keep getting richer. Need money to make money.
Still this is quite lucky. I have 100k to invest as well but I don‚Äôt have the guts to make a play like this. I‚Äôll be a millionaire but itll take me the next 15 years lol.
Work full time as a 23year old in college gets you 250k?
Well I be damned.
How do you make a small fortune in the wine industry? Start with a large fortune!
Having rich parents
This
Step 2: Don't be poor.
Or inheritance from a dead relative. You‚Äôd be surprised how many rich kids are rich from that
I have just shy of half a million in my IRA. Came from a buyout when my old company was acquired. I'm 34 now. 

Of course, when I got the payout, it was worth about $437k (split in two.)

In three years it's grown to $493k because...I barely touch it, and let it mostly slow grow on ETF's and Mutual Funds (I have $90k in its money market account in case the market crashes).

I'd never do a risky options call with more than a couple grand. Hell, I got drunk and bought chip stocks a while back and cashed out when I was up $8k on a $30k investment.

Playing $250k on options is too terrifying to think about, and it's only a mindset you can have if $250k is equivalent to how I see $250, or $2500; alright to risk, but not irreplaceable.
Step 2: Use step-daddy's money
Step 2: Gamble indiscriminately until you yield results.
And how did you have that 100k?
the problem with this statement is i think youre too dumb to keep the money. Youve gambled twice and won dont do it again
Get to the part of the story where your daddy gave it to you, or your grandfather left you 100k...etc.
quit while you‚Äôre ahead. please dont think its sustainable to have this much luck. congrats brother!!
How tf did you get 100k bro people doggin on you here‚Äôs your chance to defend yourself, or confirm their allegations
Holup

Did you pay taxes on those shiba gains?
now buy real estate
Ah so you were privileged to begin with. Makes a lot of sense.
Stop gambling. The more times you do this, the higher your chances of hitting zero.
What is your next move, Chosen One?
How the fuck did you get 100k lol? Even making 6 figures it takes a long time to save up that kinda dough.
You're walking proof that rich people don't deserve money, look at how much you have after making so many bad financial decisions
Jesus Christ.. leave the casino, take your winnings please
Seriously bro. This won‚Äôt happen again. I promise. This is the soundest most real advice ever. Get something that gives you 5-6% a year. Live cheaply and never have to work again. 

Or yolo it into 0DTE spy calls and become a billionaire. Pussy.
A wise man will put the ego you‚Äôve developed from investing like this away and do normal investing. You won‚Äôt regret it man.
Honestly the best advice here, secure the majority of the assets in something that grows, either property depending on where you live or blue chips. You're in a very good position for your age plan some shit and use it to help for your future.
Make sure to take the advice. You set yourself up for life if you pull out of the gambling now.
Aaaaaaaand he‚Äôs buying more calls as we speak.
Please do it.
Don‚Äôt listen to these guys. See if you can make it 2 million!
[OP, this will now become your Bible](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Managing_a_windfall)

Read it, digest it, then read it again. Over and over

As someone who received an unexpected seven-figure inheritance, this was truly helpful. If you play your cards right, you'll be alright in life

Also, if you haven't opened a Fidelity account and dropped the $1M+ in a money market fund (SPAXX is a good place to start) you're behind

Enjoy the tendies!
Don't listen, don't be pussy. Imagine if you had 10million instead.
Yea
I will sell you 60 packs of bacon for that $3822.22
Bro just become a millonaire and has already forgot about price of normal stuff üíÄ
so how do you feel and will you continue college?
Listen carefully, other than the regards here on WSB. TELL NO ONE.

Also put around $470,000  in a safe place, because that's how much you owe the tax man :( \*Depending on where you live in AMERICA\*

You now have approximately $800,000 which can possibly accrue 5% interest per year in a CD or other high yield savings account. YOU'RE LITERALLY MAKING $40,000 IN PASSIVE INCOME A YEAR. 

This is literally life changing money, but not quit everything and F off at the beach forever type of money. Spend frugally like you were before, no LAMBO, no FERARI, no dumbass McMansion. Figure out what you want to do for few months. Jerk off and have a clear mind you got this.   


Again TELL NO ONE, and congrats and F YOU.

remember Uncle Sam
Haha
Well, that and $250,000 from daddy.

But sure let's credit the frontal lobe.
underdeveloped frontal lobe giveth and underdeveloped frontal lobe taketh away.
>hire a financial manager at least until you're like 30 years old.

Lol, for what? To waste money?
Why pay someone to tell you to put your money in an index fund instead of just buying the index fund yourself?
Hire me
You must be so poor that you didn‚Äôt even put the ‚Äúk‚Äù in $250k
Easy to win when you play with other people's money.
Where does one find a daddy that gives you 250k, all of mine are cheap.
Let's at least be inclusive enough to say Mommy and Daddy's money.

Or continue gambling until he negates his capital gains ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
No it‚Äôs a short term capital gain at the highest tax bracket and if he also has to pay state taxes it‚Äôs likely around 50%
Welcome to the wonderful world of taxes
Do NOT put almost a million dollars in URPO and EDV without researching the underlying strategy very very well.

Just go with a all-world index fund (which has lower volatility than SPY due to diversification, and higher expected returns because of valuations).
I would say it depends on his honest self-assessment with his relationship with gambling. If he truly is an otherwise well-rounded individual then sure, setting aside something like $25k-100k to try replicate the results is reasonable. I just think if it was my own son, I‚Äôd be concerned depending on how preoccupied he was with money/gambling. Even if you‚Äôre winning, it can still be unhealthy and chip away at more important/worthwhile aspects of life, especially for such a young man.
Was it just a feeling to yolo at that time?
Congrats! Take a nice vacation.
You don‚Äôt need a financial advisor. You can buy any of the S&P500 indexes mutual funds at whatever brokerage you want to use or ETFs directly in Robinhood. For example: VOO and set and forget and then you‚Äôll not even realize that one day when your 30s friends are complaining about how tough it is to buy a house you‚Äôll have $2.5m resting in your brokerage and can pay cash when you want anything and can travel without even thinking about it. Your friends in when you‚Äôre in your 40s will start talking about retirement and you can quit working completely if you wanted and live a great life with your spouse and probably kids.

The problem is you‚Äôre more likely to let this win go to your head and not realize it was all luck and is extremely statistically unlikely to hit again. You‚Äôre likely to bleed out hundreds of thousands of dollars and settle back in the 200-300 range before having massive anxiety and gamblers mentality you can make it all back. But you can‚Äôt. You were lucky with a scratch off and it could‚Äôve shaped your whole life for the better. 

Man you have no idea what has happened to you and if you just buy the 500, you realize the powers of compound interest in stocks you‚Äôll be smiling every day and can work any job or no job and live a completely free life. What a blessing. Sincerely.
Get a tax guy, then VTSAX and chill. You don't need a financial advisor, they don't know any more than the rest of us.
Don't forget, June 17th is the due date for 2nd quarter estimated payments.
Must be nice. My dad has a bail bondsman on speed dial.
In your post you explain it like it's nothing special üòÇ I thought how can this guy gamble this much at 23 and sleep well. Have a good recovery and don't get heart disease üôè
Can you do me a favor and let me know next time you want to jump in on something??
aggressive savings from main job and aggressively contracting+outsourcing too, dumping as much as possible into some altcoins that rallied

pretty much the same game I‚Äôm doing now, nothing linear
I‚Äôm happy for you but you already had money and were privileged. Hope you‚Äôd don‚Äôt lose it like a gambler that you are.
Here‚Äôs what you do. Stick this cash into TBills. They are paying out 4.54%. You take home 54,000/yr jerking off at home. Every dime you make on top of that is gravy.
Interesting you assume this is savings and not generational wealth.
Shorty fire burning on the dance floor
I can help you verify your account. I just need your email and password and your social security will probably help. I'll handle everything for you since you have all that money you're probably too busy.

My college fund was work and barely survive. Forget about college.
My college fund was fighting wildfires and taking care of a family. College was for rich people or really dumb people in a lot of debt. üòÇ
A small loan of one million dollars
"Mom, I messed up big time. I lost my monthly allowance on meme stocks again."
I had about that much money at that age, but it was money inherited due to the death of my parents so I spent most of it on drugs.
Bootstraps? Stop eating avocado toast and Starbucks for a few weeks and that‚Äôs like $100k right there
It's like all those articles online of, "how I became a millionaire before 30," and then when you read it it's some privileged stuck-up who had parents pay for their college, give them $10,000+ in investment money, and now they're writing shitty stories on the Internet for more attention to their crappy product.
You know, funny thing about poker. If you do that then the only hands that'll call you will have you dominated. Otherwise you're just picking up blinds until someone has aces or kings.


In other words, it's a stupid fucking strategy and Elon Musk is a tit.
It‚Äôs easy to gamble your parents money when u know your parents have more.
Don't be suspicious, don't be suspicious
"my boy is a genius! Should have gave him 3 mil instead of 250k" - OP dad
it is easier to have guts when you have rich parents to bail you out of bad situations
This kid had several batches of 100k to gamble with. That's the only difference
It‚Äôs easy when it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs money and there‚Äôs more to come when you waste it. I‚Äôve had friends like this, where they could gamble 6 figures on meme stocks because there‚Äôs more where that comes from.
ossified marry offbeat elastic pen roll pocket command enter reminiscent

What? You didn't have $100K as a college kid?
Lmao dude dodging the question just say you inherited some cash it‚Äôs not a fkin blow to who you are it‚Äôs a blessing and trying to say you pulled yourself up by your boot straps is childish and misinforms others feeling depressed about their terrible QoL and financials
For real.  This dude coming here like what you all didn't have $100k spare monies sitting in your savings at 23?

Like I'm not mad about it, but can we just get an honest answer from this person?
The only 100 grand I had in college was covered in chocolate.
Working at Wendys
Easy to save that much when you have zero living costs because daddy paid for everything. 

Gotta have money to make money.
That's the issue. I have a friend who 10x'd one of the alt coins. But he keeps it in what ever shady exchange for the 9% interest or whatever crazy rate they have. 

Young/Dumb enough to take the risk (and god bless them for it) but also young/dumb enough not to cash out
A tale as old as wallstreetbets time.  I mean didn't we just have someone lose some insane amount of money a few months ago because he kept dumping it all into one stock at a time hoping it would work out and he was in his late twenties?  I actually thought this was the same person until I saw he was 23.  The other guy also had something like 250k in his twenties and was crying because he YOLO'd it multiple times and lost everything.  

If it works once, good on you.  If it works twice, you're fucking lucky.  I haven't seen a post on here where they didn't lose all of it on the third round.
He won't. He has to feel like he earned this with hardwork and a hard life of being spoiled his entire life with too many things and has made him unfeeling and empty and spends his free time scoping out victims for his next murder just to feel something

Take a wild guess
Can buy a lot of duplexes that will cash flow 1k/month. Could be making 20-40k/month for the rest of your life.

Don't listen to him

Totally fiduciary financial advice
Just wanted to piggyback on this. Take that profit, make it work for you and leave it alone. Congrats, OP; nice job!
Ha. Bro I‚Äôm 3x your position. Just an fyi. I can tell you right now you ain‚Äôt living good off 50k. You need to get with a wealth manager. Have them invest your cash with an expected gain for 8-10% per year. Don‚Äôt touch that shit. Let it roll. You‚Äôll be super loaded by 43 you‚Äôll be just short of 6M with zero contributions at 8%. Want to retire at 53 with 10M in the bank. Done. 

I mean most likely you‚Äôll buy a car, house or piss it away. In 15 years you‚Äôll hate yourself but yolo.
Nah. Why be a millionaire if you could be the new owner of GameStop!
He probably gets $100k from his parents each semester. He's not playing the same game you are.
Wise men don‚Äôt frequent this sub. He‚Äôll be broke by the week‚Äôs end.

Man I wish I had that knowledge like 2016... I've put alot of Life savings through a investing firm and the return % for 2016-2019 was like 4% in their highest risk fund... Smh.
New bid: 61 packs and a handy. take it or leave it
Och don‚Äôt tell him! I was gonna try strike a bargain with him, 61 packs of bacon for 1K
Hey thank you! I appreciate the advice
Why would he put it in the bank when he can just put it on an index fund?
This advice is way too solid and educated for WSB.
Right?  OP is gonna owe Uncle Sam about $350,000 of that come April 2025.  To be safe you would throw $500,000 in a high yield account on the sidelines for now to cover your ass.
I don't even want to know how many times he tried, all that for this little bit of karma and not even reddit gold...
I'd take it without the K. Poor don't judge.
Either be a hot chick or have an actual rich dad.
It depends on the state. He‚Äôs paying 35.5% federally. 

Texas or Florida he‚Äôs paying zero extra New York Cali or Mass he‚Äôs paying like 10-12% extra.
If the new tax proposal ends up going through then in California it'll be 59% in the next few years
All world index would that be the s&p 500? I‚Äôm really new to this I‚Äôll take all the advice I can get

I hear ya, I started working and moved out at 19, by 23 I've had 5k of "life-savings", and that's after mostly doing 60hr weeks. FML

Now I did outfit a whole apartment in furniture and whatnot, also got a 2k gaming PC, but still.
He will live in your head rent-free forever.
Why does this sound & feel like you DO hope he loses it like a gambler? You‚Äôre not happy for him in the fucking slightest.Congrats OP! Walk away from options now and make some money with your newly earned money.
Typical spoiled little p boy gambling daddy‚Äôs money calling it his ‚Äúlife savings‚Äù lmao
250k at 23 and he did it all on his own! Most likely not, but maybe?

You shouldn't gamble what you can't afford to lose, but if you do, keep it to yourself, nobody likes a blabbermouth.
Was it big time though? I‚Äôd assume it was a nice dinner in some fancy place costing 5k+. Then you‚Äôd think ‚Äúhow well, 2 dinners ruined‚Äù
A boomer in my office retired last week. Gave me some sound savings advice for buying a home.. "just save 200-300 bucks a month and you'll be able to buy a house in a year or two"

I don't think I was ever truly at a loss for words until that moment.
He probably just stole the Gus Hansen story because he thought it sounded cool.
> If you do that then the only hands that'll call you will have you dominated.  Otherwise you're just picking up blinds until someone has aces or kings.

Depends much on stack sizes and position.



If it's a blind-vs-blind scenario, 15-big blinds effective, the small-blind can shove all-in with all sorts of junk, and  I think GTO says you can call with most hands with an Ace.

Edit: [similar examples here, from a guy who ran it through a solver](https://pokercoaching.com/blog/how-to-play-gto-when-short-stacked-in-poker-tournaments/)
His dad gambled 2 million and came out with 100k
A small loan of $100K
He worked hard for that money (literally)at a Wendy's dumpster
Wait is this the new Trump?
Pretty normal for a College kid to have $100k üòé in debt.
My biggest wake-up call was in art school when I received $5k in inheritance, and in my moment of vulnerability was convinced by classmates that I wasn't pulling my weight and that I should use my "privilege" to bankroll the group project which they utterly wasted. I later found out that one of them had a bank balance of $45k in checking. 
We are playing entirely different games.
They always do this LMAO RUN AND HIDE ü§£
I mean, 10x-ing your money at that scale is pretty freaking difficult.
To be fair I feel like this is the answer. Highly doubt his trust fund seed money that was put in his account was far below 250k. People like this are the reason I have doubts about setting up some fund for my kid without heavily restricted withdrawing access.
I only have 100k at age 34, seeing shit like this is pretty demotivating since I've been working FT for a number of years now and have 1/12th of some 23 year old's networth
Bro that candy bar is fucking delicious. You were a rich man after all.
If working at wendys would give me 100k I would fill my application yesterday
It's not easy ...most people at 20-23 years earn minimum wage or not working at all
A lot of those guys are afraid to repatriate the funds because of the IRS
Im just glad these realistic comments arent downvoted to oblivion, like in other subs
Prob small risk too. He knew if he lost that 100k he could get another 100k lol
Good for you man have a good life
Yea aint no way a gambler quits after winning a milly. I bet OP is at the stage where he thinks he is the greatest trader ever which is a very dangerous thing to believe!!!
![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
One of us
He does this because he didn't earn the 100k to begin with. I'm in my 30s, an attorney who does international trade litigation, and I do t have 100k in liquid cash to just gamble away.
I would laugh my arse off if he did that and came back in a week with $10M.
Unironically would have worked today.

Lmao did 1 contract today for SPY puts and lost my $44 bucks üòÖ
Honestly, buying a middle class home you can live mortgage-free in for life wouldn‚Äôt be bad. Get a job you don‚Äôt mind and live like a king off the paycheck. No need to sell your soul to corporate America if you don‚Äôt want.
>You need to get with a wealth manager. Have them invest your cash with an expected gain for 8-10% per year.

A wealth manager? Ok Boomer. The market is already averaging 10% a year, why would you need to pay some dude to get you that return
Exactly so he should be smart and stop gambling once he‚Äôs won.

Just unsubscribe from this sub and replace it with /r/personalfinance . Follow their instructions for windfalls https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall
You have degenerate regard tendencies and have successfully yolod a shit load of money two separate times and turned it into million. Listen to this guy and dont get fuckin greedy.  Pay the tax man, dont tell a fuckin soul about it, invest the vast majority of it smartly, throw 10k off to the side to yolo into stupid shit to scratch your regard itch, and let the rest of your money make you money and set yourself up to be fuckin chillin in the future. You aren't a genius trader, you will lose everything if you continue to yolo. You are also suddenly 99th percentile for a 23yo kid financially, dont fuck this up broski you wont replicate this luck. Hopefully you fully grasp how fortunate of a situation you yolo'd yourself into.

Also congrats and fuck you.
Telling no one is key here. Tell anyone and your friends will now become your enemies, jealousy and their feeling of entitlement to what you have will ruin your relationships, especially when you tell them "no".
Honest question for honest answer? 

Wasn't thinking too much into it.

But from an FA point of view it's better to make incremental purchases of indexes, rather than whole purchases. It's honestly just an opinion. 

You usually can't time the market with precision, so you just say put incremental purchases into an index fund. So days you'll average up and some you'll average down. But someone who's 18 can withstand the volatility of the market ALOT longer than someone who is 45 or 50 years old. 

That said, putting it into an index fund is a fine idea, but he's still on the hook for taxes when he decides to sell and what not. 

If he currently is not making income, dividend interest is taxed at 0% Federally and minimally for most States. So he'd potentially get $40k tax free each year with these insane 5% rates which I think won't last forever. But this year his nominal income will probably land him in the highest tax bracket

It really depends on the individuals appetite for risk, but this is WSB's not FinancialAdvice or PovertyFinance. 

Good question though
It's owed now, not in April. If not paid until April, there will be interest/penalty owed as well. OP should make an estimated payment sooner than later. Although honestly I have no idea how it works if OP were to have equivalent losses toward the end of this year, in which case an estimated payment of 350K now would result in a huge overpayment (no penalty for that, of course) and no estimated payment now would be... perfectly fine?
Be thankful that you're not poor and therefore don't have to resort to desperate measures for money.

100k gambling money. If it was a real loan he'd be afraid to lose it
How did OP get his capital?

OP: I was a business man, doing business.
Even with my middle out hand technique and all my orifices that is only 6 -8 cocks per session. Plus I have to discount ear holes for 10 bucks.  150 a session x7 sessions a day.  100 days to the nut.
You gotta incorporate the bun into the lovemaking though.
Pretty normal for a college kid to have $100k _in margin_.
this actually made me sad to read this, I‚Äôm sorry, peer pressure is frustrating when everyone else seems to be able to shrug off that social commitment, but when you do you‚Äôre worse off just for the crime of trusting friends. And to find out later on they‚Äôre well off- that‚Äôs a gut punch
If you have excess and you want to contribute to good causes, that can be a noble goal.

But when people start to demand that you owe them something, the most persuasive of those people are people who have made a habit of demanding that of other people.  This makes sense, because they have the most practice. The people who generally don't have much are easily tricked, because they're not used to saying no, and they can best relate to how it feels to not have much.

But I bet that before you had that little windfall, you probably weren't going into your projects demanding that other people bankroll it because of their privilege. 

The people who have little are also the ones most accustomed to having to work for the things they have. And they're easily tricked by people who have been given everything, especially if they can emotionally manipulate you into giving it up.
That‚Äôs fucked up. Luckily I didn‚Äôt have money in college till senior year and when I did I told nobody
Never share your finances with anyone. Not even close family members, that‚Äôs not to say you shouldn‚Äôt help them if you want, but keep that a very closely guarded secret.
He didn‚Äôt do any sort of deliberative, technical, or challenging process to 10x it. Literally just brainrot yolo gambling
As difficult as playing the roulettes
of course, even more reason to not embarassed
People like this don‚Äôt post their losses‚Ä¶
OP yolo'd AMC calls with Daddy's money. He's not the next Warren Buffet lmao.
Common people by Pulp spelled it out about thirty years ago:

> But still you'll never get it right

> 'Cause when you're laid in bed at night

> Watching roaches climb the wall

> If you called your dad he could stop it all, yeah

> You'll never live like common people

> You'll never do what ever common people do

> Never fail like common people

> You'll never watch your life slide out of view

> And then dance, and drink, and screw

> Because there's nothing else to do


It's usually difficult to 10x your money at that scale, because it took you a significant portion of your lifetime to save up that much and you know you can maybe eke out one more if this one fails. If OP had missed his shot, he's got his whole life left to make it back and his parents would probably be willing to let him try again in a few years at the most. He was never taking a big risk. That's the real power of generational wealth. 

Listen to the people who grew up with it and saw success and they'll tell you how it's about persevering through failure until you succeed and all the failed attempts they had before. You don't do that coming from a middle class family. From a humble background you'll get 1-3, depending on how badly they fail and how dire you're willing to let your life get in hopes of succeeding.
Comparison is the theif of joy.

You're doing fine!
Bro having 100k at 34 is a great feat. Some people go through their entire life never having more than a few thousand in their account.
Sorry, I meant working behind Wendys giving handys
The median salary of 20- to 24-year-olds is $720 per week, which translates to $38,012 per year. Or $18.95 per hr.
Yea I get it. But I rather pay 30% on 1m than 0% on 0 ü§£
My $5 turns to $10 and those are still unrealized and shit i think im better than that buffett guy
He turned 250k to 1m. Imagine, if he does the same with 1m now. He will have 4m, then 16m and 64m. Then he can retire in luxury.
You don't get an 8% return unless someone else is taking 20% of the 10%!

Mathematically this has been incorrect for every single 20-30 year time frame in the history of the stock market, albeit by a very small % margin.
Or 

He calls up a smaller local or regional bank, and asks them for a rate exception as he is looking to open a relationship with them and wants a higher yield savings account. They're gonna give him a money market with 5-5.5% APY and he can keep his money there with wayyy less downside or risk than the stock market. What he sacrifices in 2-4% on returns he gains on 

A) Liquidity - he can write checks or pay bills with it far easier

B) Saves in commission fees from some random portfolio finance manager douchebag

C) Multiple ways to increase FDIC coverage- he can either use ICS account or add a fuckton of beneficiaries which he can do under his name or

D) Create a living trust that has its own trustees and beneficiaries. This will further aid in tax burden and deposit insurance


If he did this with all roughly 800k he'll have after taxes he'd still earn 40k a year on compounding APY that he doesn't have to do shit for. Yes its boring and he could get more APY investing it but this is far safer and smarter longterm.
Nah, they‚Äôre almost certainly in the safe harbor range (unless they also made 1M last year)

I doubt any legitimate bank is going to accept any crypto, let alone an altcoin, as collateral for a loan. The whole issue is that keeping your money in the alt coin is extremely dangerous.

Even if your thought process is just switch to a safer but still highly risky crypto such as ethereum or Bitcoin, from the IRS's perspective if you actually follow the law, that is a taxable event and you owe all gains on the altcoin. So if you're going to owe taxes either way if you move away from the altcoin, you're better off just switching it to actual USD and being done with crypto.

My plan going into this was to hold for a decade and my plan hasn't changed. It's going to be rough and I realize that. The past two days have been the scariest days of my life. My parents still don't know I've lost 1/3 of my inheritance. Every time I talk to them they can see how stressed I look and they keep asking me what's wrong and I don't know what to say. How can I possibly explain this to them? My only option is to hold for a decade. So that's what I'm going to do. I know people are going to shit on me, and you should. I recognize I made an unnecessarily regarded decision. I have received a lot of DMs and reddit notifications offering me mental help and Suicide hotline numbers. I appreciate your concern but I'm fine. I'm holding long term. I'm sorry if my decision made you upset and reflect on your financial situation, that was not my intention. I appreciate all of your support and constructive criticism. Some of you have been really mean but its ok, I know I deserve it. But im holding. Forever. Intel will succeed.

OP, your dilemma might have turned me into a religious man, because only some sort of higher power could possibly have orchestrated all of this.

First, did you even know it was earnings when you bought? You don't mention that at all in your initial post.

Second, you were quite literally the only person on this entire planet who was 100% invested in Intel. How on earth did you manage to pick *Intel*, of all the stocks on the planet? It must be the least sexy, most old-man stock pick I've ever heard of.

Then, by some divine intervention you decide to post this position on WSB.

Then, moments after you post, Intel proceeds to dump 25-30%, the worst drop in its *50 year history*, returning the stock to its 1997 valuations. 

Were you even alive in 1997?
Its okay, Grandma doesnt know. You cant kill her twice.

Regarded legend
I'm gonna tell my grandkids I witnessed the "Grandmas inheritance vanishing act" in real time.
F me this hurts to read... How long do you think it'll take to recover vs pulling out and sticking it into an s&p500 index tracker?

The fact that you could have taken your inheritance, bought a Ferrari then invested the rest and be in the same position (or likely better, the Ferrari will have some residual value) is insane
Can‚Äôt realize a loss until you sell!
Ignore the losses - that's sunk cost fallacy.

If you inherited 500k today, looking at that chart - would you put it all in intel?

Probably not.

Sell it, and purchase a broad market ETF, by the time you finish university you won't be terribly far from where you were yesterday, and you can start your life as if the inheritance came as a graduation gift. Which is still amazing.

You absolutely can recover from this. You have no debt. Focus on school. I would consider a bit of diversification within the industry.
You stupid bitch. You still have a life changing amount of money left and you still won‚Äôt admit that you‚Äôre just fucking wrong. I don‚Äôt know why I keep commenting on your posts to try to help you. 

Sell the fucking shares and buy something diversified if you want to hold for a decade. Buy VOO. Tell your parents you‚Äôve socked it away. When you graduate start saving the way your grandmother did and deposit $200k. That‚Äôs your penance to grandma. 

Stop fucking around. It‚Äôs not too late. You‚Äôre not a genius stock picker. Fucking stop.

Your grandma must be proud of you.

Your inheritance was $800k tho.

So you only lost a quarter of it, not a third.

Chin up, bud.
You could have fucked so many hookers and done so much coke for 200k. Instead you went full regard.

I'd suggest you panic sell it all now and then buy again when price rebounds. Grandma will be proud.
You are falling for the sunk-cost fallacy. Just take your loss and move on to an ETF. 500k is still a lot of money!
Sorry you‚Äôre getting so much heat when you provided so much entertainment

In all seriousness, you should strongly consider when it‚Äôs time to call it quits and invest it all in the SPY or 60/40 portfolio

I didn‚Äôt read their forward guidance but all companies eventually reach a point where they start issuing dividends as finally paying their shareholders their due. It‚Äôs rare and not at all a healthy sign when a company stops dividends. Furthermore, the last time they had positive FCF was 3-4 years ago. 

Please strongly consider your strategy of 100% allocation into INTC, if you believe they can go back to at least $35, and if it makes sense to cut your losses and take this as an expensive lesson.

You did not learn your lesson, you refuse to learn your lesson - according to your logic your only mistake was timing. 

Your mistake was buying 700k worth of intel, so now instead of learning anything and admitting you‚Äôre wrong and stupid you‚Äôre gonna marry your mistake. 

Yikes.
Yeah sell in a decade when Intel is trading for $10
Bro what the fuck. Why didn‚Äôt you diversify. You could still diversify and be better than 98% of the world population.
>I'm holding long term.

You are fully taking the piss. There's just no way.
Start selling covered calls. Since they don't pay a dividend now.

Sell the $31 on a green day for Intel.
yea you lost a third of a lot of money which is a lot of money

but two thirds of a lot of money is twice as much as that. just take the L, put it in an index fund, and dont fuck around with big bets like this until you have a job and are playing with money you actually had to earn. 

you can carry these capital losses though indefnintely for tax purposes to offset future capital gains so you can recover another chunk of it over a long horizon through tax benefits if you start figuring out how to make plays that win instead of lose.
take out a loan and DCA
!remindme 10 years
You should recive a prize from intel's ceo for having such Big balls
parents paying for college.

grandma was wealthy enough to pass on $800k.

something tells me OP comes from money and a $200k loss on paper is really not much in the grand scheme of things.
The secret with investing is to accept a loss. Intel is seriously in a downturn period.. what do you expect from this company with -20% staff and no revenue when the entire market has done +100% in revenue?!
 
Take your loss, put every fcking remaining penny into a healthcare etf, in 2-3 years you will be back at 700k!
If you only waited 1 more day
Honestly man, you sound like a good person. I hope it works out for you
Here's some actual financial advice. Sell and throw it all in an ETF and forget about it. Intel is not the stock you want to park your money in for the next decade.
You're going to be waiting a decade to break even, buddy. Take your loss and move on.
Millions of stocks but he chooses the worst out of all to hold long.

History repeats itself... Grams went down with the titanic. Op going with intel
Love you bud. As someone who almost threw his entire life away in college, let me give you perspective. You're not in jail. You're not kicked out of school. You didn't hurt anybody. It's just money. Intel may still have a recall ahead and you may do what you like BUT. 500k in NVDA or AMD or better yet both is a better move. Best move. VOO,VUG or VTI

You‚Äôve made a mistake but still have 500k in this stock. Sell and buy the S&P500 and reinvest didvends, youll be entirely fine. 

I promise you this is better than being a bag holder and watching your money dwindle away. 

If you bought in 1997 and held until now. Guess how much you‚Äôd be up after 27 years?! That‚Äôs right! You‚Äôd actually be down money!

Dude please sell.
You are the reason I‚Äôm spending my money on hookers and blow instead of leaving it to my kids. They can thank you later.
You still have almost $500k left. That's a lot more than most people get in life. Get the fuck out of INTC now. Put the money in index funds and ETFs. Keep a small position in INTC if you must, but if you continue to hold this for 10 years and the company continues to fail, you will deserve to lose this money.
Yo have you even used a financial calculator FFS!?! Your position is at like $500k right now... to make it back to $700k over 10 years all you need is 3.2% compound return not including inflation. If you include  inflation of 3%, you'd need a bit over 6% compound return to end up with over $900k ($700k in today's value) in that time frame. 

You can easily get that with just a treasury bond or even a simple fucking balanced mutual fund that pays monthly distributions that you just let reinvest... 

Maybe you need ten years of normal, not exciting gains to learn your lesson.... Honestly wtf....holding is not your only option. There are many options, including paying a fund manager their fee because they actually know more than you, and will give you boring gains(according to WSB)... additionally with the help of an accountant you can attribute these losses against future gains thus avoiding tax.  You can't do that if you just HODL.  

This fuckup means you can't afford or deserve to be worried about FOMO... IF intel rebounds. You need to recover what you lost or you'll always regret it. The toll psychologically of what this has done and may keep doing if it doesn't recover as soon as you like will be immense.

You are acting from a place of emotion...you are taking a huge risk because you don't understand you're literally defining the sunk cost fallacy...and you don't appreciate the opportunity cost of not changing your strategy. In fact you actually don't have a strategy, you are just gambling....and that's the problem.

Maybe you do need to talk your parents.
Inherits life-changing money. Loses almost half of it on one shitty stock in 2 days. Won‚Äôt tell parents. Decides he has to hold for 10 years.

You are George Costanza.
Bro, head over to theta gang and learn about covered calls.  It won't be much, but you can make at least some income on those bags while you're holding them.

Edit: I mean, obviously accept the loss and take a nice long break is better, but if you're determined to hold, picking up pennies by selling monthlies at your cost basis won't hurt you at least.
Forget about the $700k inheritance. That concept will weigh you down and stop you from making rational decisions.

Right now, you have $500k. Imagine you found out for the first time today that your grandma left you $500k in her will. Would you still invest all that money at once in Intel, given what you know about the quality of its chips, the decision making process of its C-suite executives, the layoffs, etc, and the market reaction to all that? From your language of "my only option is to hold a decade," etc, it seems like you already know what the answer is, and you're just trying to convince yourself to see the upside.

You do, in fact, have options. If your answer is no, then pull some or all of that money out ASAP and put it somewhere sensible. Treat it like a brand new $500k inheritance. That can still be a life changing amount if distributed in the right buckets, but it is much less likely to be if it's all in INTC.
How much are you down today
fuck yeah! I love you! I don't know you at all, but you make my worst financial decision in my life seem like a good choice, also how likely are you getting your shit beaten by your parents if they find out?
Just imagine: you could have used a fraction of that money to take 3 of the nasty-hottest insta-sluts out on a private yacht for a weekend to shoot endless loads on their backs. [ Example: the girl on the right is for sale.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8_67sEwDKk)

Now you're here.  With us.
I mean its not like you rely on that money anyways, its literally just numbers on a screen. 

Wait you are HOLDING? 

Legend
Just hold it until next earnings to lose 30% more, guh!
I'm sorry if my decision made you upset and reflect on your financial situation.

It's OK, zero people thinks intc is a good investment.

Some personal story why I will never touch intc: I graduated with a master's in EE over ten years ago, and had a couple friends went to Intel. All of them quit within two years. This company pretty much failed every new market expansion.
What a loser ! Still has more money than 99.9% regards here...
In case anyone is curious he bought the stock worth 700,000 a couple days ago.
He lost $243,110 YET
Its net value is $456,890.
Dude.

The CEO of Intel literally tweeted A PRAYER today.

Sell.

Buy a house. Free rent. Asset that has intrinsic value. Asset that goes up in value over a long period of time (which you have).

Buying a house is buying freedom.

I have no idea why you're fascinated by Intel. They look like shit at the moment.
Ya I'd sell and just take the loss my friend
Should be selling a shit ton of calls
Dude just sell and buy a 0dte !!
Grandma just turned over in her grave after Intel earnings and now again with your stubbornness ü§£
Hey man, none of us know the future. Who knows what will happen in the future. It could always crash more ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Dang you just yolo with $700K üíÄ
When they say make a plan and stick with it, they mean *good plans*. If you just sold it all right now and stuck it into VT, you would double your money ten years from now. And then you could retire and do whatever the F you want. Instead, you've opted to either get rich or get poor instead of near guarantee of being set for the rest of your life.
Bro, Intel's next support is Chapter 11.  What are you doing..
I'm glad that you are dealing with all the negativity in a positive way. Stay strong
Dude you have a half million dollar portfolio and you‚Äôre trading it on ROBINHOOD?! put it in a better brokerage!
You may have lost $200k, but you earned your spot in the WSB Hall of Fame!
Wow, OP you are an inspiration, ty. One day I hope to be as regarded as you..
What's really fucked is you could have quite easily turned that $700k to $2m in the next week or two selling a few high IV calls.

$700k > $452k I made it at $19.69. Outch
You could not have picked a worse stock to invest in.
three days later, and im still chuckling at this.
This may be a little too late, but imagine if you had just put those 700k into a high interest savings account at 4%. You‚Äôd have nearly 2 million in 25 years with zero risk.

Could you maybe explain how you came to that conclusion of putting everything into 1 stock as a lump sum investment? This is against every advice you could possibly have had. Have you no prior experience in investing?

I have just set up an alarm to notify me when (if?) the stock returns to $30,45. I seriously hope you will break even on this at some point, and if that happens you should sell everything and buy ETFs and bonds only and have some cash in a HISA
This guy should start twitch and do reaction of watching intel plummet for a straight week after he bought ..
Best loser wins. Tom Hougaard was right, people cannot take losses. They are hopeful when they are losing and scared when they are winning. This is the prime example.
Selling and taking the Fat L and buying VOO with the leftover money will net you a way better return in 10 years then waiting for Intel to come back. You still a regard legend tho. May the odds be in your favor
Thank you for the update. I will continue to buy puts until you sell your shares
You‚Äôre a young, arrogant moron who acted irresponsibly with life changing money because you‚Äôve never faced real consequences before.
So glad I got to watch this live. Better than the fucking Olympics. Get this boy a medal.
‚ÄúGuh‚Äù
Speed run world record
OP is a special type of regarded. He's gonna be in the WSB hall of fame for buying SHARES of INTEL lmaooo.
We‚Äôre watching history unfold before our very eyes.
Whenever I feel bad about my own life and decisions I can always come back and look at OP lol
I don‚Äôt understand how ‚ÄúI will hold for a decade‚Äù is a viable strategy. Let alone ‚ÄúI will hold forever‚Äù. None of this makes any sense.

Edit: This stock is also **down** comping to 10 years ago. What makes you believe it will go up in 10 years?
Right through that price support floor, and straight into the hall of fame indeed.
Next up: a book deal and movie rights worth millions.  Good investment!
With shares none the less. He wasn't even trying gamble lol
Very very lucky guy (bad luck that is kek)
This happened to me once but with $13,000.
dream of every bottom
the confidence in which they did it as well was also astonishing. wrote up a huge ass DD
Not to mention the "creation of the funny shit" cost him more than $200k
For weeks...
He still has $500k. Chuck it in ETFs and give it 5 years. But sunk cost fallacy is a thing lol.
The original post had dozens of comments predicting OP‚Äôs demise hours before it occurred.¬†

The prophecies come true and now he‚Äôs still like, ‚Äúna, not going to listen to these people‚Äù.¬†
[deleted]
"Yes I lost 200k in one day, but at least I haven't learned anything"
He needs to cut his losses, learn this expensive fucking lesson, go buy a house outright, and call it a day.

As long as that money is remotely liquid, this regard can do more regarded shit and ruin his good hand in life. 

Buy a house, OP. Will set you up well for life. Its generally peoples biggest monthly outgoing.

If you still want to make regarded trades, then do it each month with what you'd have been spending on a mortgage.
Agreed. The main reason to hold is that you still believe in the stock and the strategy of the current management. OP is only down 20%, by next year he could be -40, -10, or +20. We can‚Äôt predict the future but we can make solid estimates. 

OP, you haven‚Äôt lost it all yet. I believe many readers of wsb have had a position that‚Äôs -80% or more. I hold a position thats -96% as a reminder of my own foolishness. If the losers are a small slice of the overall growing portfolio, that‚Äôs not so bad. 

Reminder to OP, it can get worse. It can go to zero. If you are not comfortable with this risk, diversify, hedge with downside protection or get out of the position
Only. Option.

20 years with zero stock price growth. Sounds like it should happen soon!
Holy hell, I feel like INTC is a dumpster fire.

But reading his humble outlook to the situation makes me want him to 2x and ride off like a hero.
Divine timing
It would be additionally funny if Grandma made all her money off of investing in Intel in its early years
Omg I'm actually crying at this comment üòÇüò≠
I'm guessing he read an article on Intel, possibly out of date and made his decision.

  
Then he posts the loss here. Why he didn't ask on this forum for advice before hand, I don't know.

  
But it's fun to watch since it's not us.
Also, sad thing is that when it drops 30%, you have to wait for it to go up by 50% just to break even.
Honestly if you knew nothing about investing and did no research, and someone explained to you what intel does, how they get government contracts and funding, and how they would never be allowed to go bankrupt due to national security, it would seem like a very solid investment to make.
1997‚Äìnot even 2007‚Äìwe are talking AOL, Excite@home and Peapod shit. Dude should really sell this and take 10 positions and sell CC‚Äôs for income. Also-there is never a reason to build a position in 1 day‚Äîcould have built this position over 6 months. GUH.
This regard and the CRWD post before the internet crash is HOF WSB moments
> Second, you were quite literally the only person on this entire planet who was 100% invested in Intel. How on earth did you manage to pick Intel, of all the stocks on the planet? It must be the least sexy, most old-man stock pick I've ever heard of.

that is why it looks like a safe stock and sound investment

Lolololol this comment wins haha!
What if she's watching down on him with disapproval?
"I'm going to hold it for a decade and things will work out"

INTC: Currently trading at the exact same price as fucking 1997.

Fucking lol.
This kid was reading up on diversification and preserving wealth for generations like his memaw and thought ‚Äúnah I‚Äôd rather be a poor‚Äù
I‚Äôm gonna tell my grandkids this guy is the reason they ain‚Äôt getting an inheritance.
This cemented me contacting an estate attorney so my future flesh and blood doesn't do something so stupid.
Should‚Äôve bought a starter home, no debt, put the rest into SPY and reinvest the dividends.   If I ever leave a sizable amount for someone in college they will not be able to touch the money, just leave half a dozen or so investing options and none of which include ‚Äúinvest in whatever stock you think is going to double in a year‚Äù.  This guy is likely to lose half his money again as INTC continues to stumble, then put it into some options play and blow the last $200k.  Then when he‚Äôs 30 he‚Äôll realize how bad he fucked up when he‚Äôs got a mortgage to pay and he could‚Äôve been debt free and had a huge retirement account waiting for him at 55.  Hope I‚Äôm wrong, hope it works out, and he can laugh at us.
Exactly. Holding onto this stock for a decade to break even instead of going into SP500 is stupid.
Not gonna be like one of those idiots who just wastes their inheritance......whoops. 

Learned a $200,000 yesterday but still hasn't gotten the message? 

This has got to be fake. How can a math major be so bad at calculating basic finance?
Yeah until Mom asks for the money.
He‚Äôll be fine, he just needs to put his next 700k bet on Intel as well to lower that cost average.
>If you inherited 500k today, looking at that chart - would you put it all in intel?

I mean, OP probably would.
Lol...I wouldn't put it past him to look at intel's chart today and think that it's the perfect time to go all in

As a matter of fact another guy did exactly that...he put 800k into Intel at around 23
And think of the investment losses he can carry forward in his tax return for the next decade or two.
This guy gets it
Why wouldn‚Äôt I buy intel now? It‚Äôs 30% off!
This is his out...
Best advice in the thread.  Listen to this guy, OP.
The best part is that Intel stock has done jack shit for 2 decades and he thinks holding for one more decade will fix it lmfao
It amazes me that he's a math major and the only conclusion he can come to is that holding for a decade is his ONLY option

Imagine trying to solve math problems and not looking at the problem from differing angles
Like, I am down on my knees, hands to God, begging this man to get out of this terrible position.¬†¬†


He's down 30% *in a week.*¬†
[removed]
We all learn the hard way, only not usually with 700k
He could cut his losses now, reinvest in an s&p 500 etf, and consider this what 200k loss as him purchasing the title of HOF most regarded member of WSB 2024

But nah let‚Äôs hold for a decade. Diamond hands gonna diamond hands üòé
I think regret was yesterday, seems like he is in the denial stage now.  Tomorrow will be the acceptance stage?
He‚Äôd also regret if he sold it all then it immediately goes back up. ¬†

To him, it may be worth the risk of holding the stock even if it goes down more vs. selling it and having it jump back up.
If he was going to hold it long term, he could've at least sold an in-the-money put and lowered his cost basis a little. But he would've still got recked.
Not if he bought it at todays low
Gonna make me piss myself ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

Recovering from this is cutting his current loses rn and cash out.. book a trip to Vegas bet some $ on black and have fun over the weekend. Then hire someone that can actually manage money and maybe re-think his major too
Dude literally is starting life on easy mode

800k from grandma

Parents paying for college

All you have to do is not be a fucking dumb ass! Literally you got to start life on easy mode. Like the ONLY thing you have to do is not do something fucking really dumb and you will live a great life

Finish college , buy a house , buy a nice reliable car, you will be like 24 years old, own a home, car probably have 150k left over and have ZERO DEBT, coast your way to an early retirement . 

Instead, you fucking YOLO it on a sinking company ? Fucking Christ
Yeah that‚Äôs the hardest thing to watch here, totally in denial about being wrong, refuses to learn the lesson and doubles down on his mistake.
> When you graduate start saving the way your grandmother did and deposit $200k. That‚Äôs your penance to grandma.

Fucking this.

Imagine how long grandma had to save to gain $200k. Probably *years* of considerate spending and frugality. Dude pisses it away in 48 hrs.
OP please heed this advice. You‚Äôre still sitting on life-changing money. Don‚Äôt fall for the sunk-cost fallacy.
OP probably thinks he bought the equivalent of Apple or Meta shares of a decade ago.
Someday when he‚Äôs 50 years old and still working like a slave he‚Äôll get the most brutal stomach pit and realize that he this probbaly wasn‚Äôt a great decision
OP has engaged in Trade Offer: 15,000 Reddit Karma for $200,000 USD.
[deleted]
Can you consider changing his flair to 'INTELectually disabled'
The Reddit karma was the real inheritance all along
u/Sad_Nefariousness10  yo man ik how u feel, like really a huge majority of people in WSB know this feeling, you do all this hard research on a stock, you think you‚Äôve picked the perfect time and everything seems aligned that you‚Äôve got the perfect plan but then it all seems to fall apart even when it felt like it shouldn‚Äôt. Meta earnings last quarter I was certain it was going up on a clear beat - they did beat but stock still went down over some bullshit. 

People will tell you to sell intel and others will tell you to hold. Whatever you decide is besides the point, in my opinion you should take out atleast a grand and dedicate that to your grandma as it‚Äôs the least you can do, visit her grave and put her favourite flowers on it. Do things that would make her feel proud she worked so hard for you. (And I‚Äôll tell you now part of what will make her proud is you not being stressed, prioritising your health and spending her money for you to be happy) fuck it if it was me I‚Äôd even find out the people who my gran cared about most and treat them each with a 1k holiday. The feeling you‚Äôll get from that is much more than if you‚Äôd made $200k on options TRUST ME. Imagine for example some sweet minimum wage carer who treated ur gran amazingly got a $1k holiday, they‚Äôd break down in tears‚Ä¶  

Also $100k in the S&P is honestly a no brainer for ur age come back in 10 years and you‚Äôll be looking very very nice üëå.

The best thing to do OP is to just accept that the market never wants to work in the direction you want it. 200k gone but 500k is still set for life money seriously. For most people that money is 20 years of hard work so to be sad and stressed over losing 200k when u didn‚Äôt even earn it just sounds pathetic (no offence xx)

I heavily advise you to put $250k into an account that‚Äôll pay you 5.2% APR and do not gamble or invest any of it and try to keep it permanently above 250k. YOU WILL LITERALLY MAKE $1k a month without doing anything!!!!

But yeah maybe ought to re-assess your maths degree üòÇ if you can‚Äôt even work out how averaging down works (AGAIN NO OFFENCE) but surely you should‚Äôve thought maybe I should keep half just in case to bring down my average let  alone do this investment in the first place.

Anyway ü§û for you OP u seem like a sweet guy and we all feel horrible when we make dumb decisions like you did, it‚Äôs all a learning point and in 10 years this moment will probably be one you are happy happened. I mean seriously man you could‚Äôve lost all that money but u didn‚Äôt. Count yourself fucking lucky
The most important thing, grandma would be proud.¬†
This guy‚Äôs is a prime example how fd the world works. 95% of us are trying to get that amount of cash to make a GOOD investment. To finally get to our safe bet investment. This regard gets near a million bucks, the money makes him think he‚Äôs a stock pick wizard after NO trading experience, and then loses a 3rd of nan‚Äôs money in two days. FML.

I've asked around and no one will tell me where I can spend my karma. Why is this such a closely guarded secret?
It was *almost* worth it. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|52627)
can't buy that!
OP's new flair. I love it.
Kidding aside, at least wait for the dead cat bounce and sell covered calls.
And that right there is as good as money.
Cuz he doesn‚Äôt need money üòÇ
And the stock isnt microsoft or apple, its intel
The single stock being probably the worst managed company in the S&P500
Is that the same hill in the windows XP background?
It just has to be trolling.  Who would choose Intel right as the story was coming out about their 13 and 14th generation chips having fatal design flaws?
Could have had NVDA at like 104 a share omg. This is killing me. I hope it‚Äôs fake.
Unless they pull off being a fab, it‚Äôs an awful stock to hold a decade. 

X86 could just slowly be left to wither and in 10 years intel could be a $20 billion company.
That might not be a bad idea at all! He can vote himself as the CEO, ask the government for a bail-out and at the same time receive a juicy bonus of, say, 700 million for his genius management of the company. That's a 1000 bagger right there.
Intel is the only high end chip maker with fabs in the states, the government aint gonna let them go bankrupt
And no water
Legendary kiddo! He‚Äôs gonna see it hit 25 on Monday and that +$50k gain will make the trip to $18 EOW so much easier to stomach. ‚ù§Ô∏èü´†‚ù§Ô∏è
> love him regardless

regardless?  or regard-more!
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
He should take the 100k he set aside to buy the dip
Tomorrow is another day
And now he's just an intcel
200k is a small price to pay to become a WSB legend.  We‚Äôll be whispering his name for years to come.  OP truly belongs here and deserves to be an honorary mod.
I hope he takes the other 500k and burns it on coke and hookers. Otherwise he's just going to do dumb shit like "my research shows that OTM options will enhance my ROI" and zero out without having done a single line of coke. That would be a real shame.
Omg, what if he sold, bought another one that imediately tanked, and repeated that process 5-6 times until he was left with nothing? Netflix documentary here we come!
Dudebro is also gonna get to carry forward that $3000 capital loss every year for the rest of his life so that's a nice tailwind.¬†

Good lord I had to scroll way too far to find this.  I'm seeing a bid price of $0.06 for August 30th expiry at the $30 strike price.  He can sell 229 covered calls at rake in \~1.5k a month until this thing rebounds.  If it takes a year to get back to $30, that's a nice $18k to collect in a year on the investment.  This thing isn't going to $0
This is the way for damage control. Unfortunately OP is a kid- kids these days generally dont listen. ü§¶
Yeah it would feel so much better watching it go from 20 to zero instead of 30 to zero
Or just dollar cost average it like a real investor instead of YOLOing the day before an earnings call like a full regard.
He's not a bad person, just a stupid regarded one.
You can‚Äôt spell Titanic without INTC.
OP's parents are probably wealthy too, considering he alone got $800k as the GRANDKID, the parents likely got at least 1 Mil inheritance too unless granny really hated the parents. And if a grandma is able to pass on millions then the kids should be comfortable too so OP will never have to struggle for money
That is fucking diabolical
knowing his luck as soon as he sells some covered calls Intel will moon like NVDA immediately :)
She can't cost that much she's a 6 at best

Semis rapin‚Äô e‚Äôrybody out here
Get to witness "profit taking" and the "leaving bag holders" first-hand.

Intel has two generations of CPU chips that all may have a defect, or at least need a crippled firmware, and just kicked 15000 employees to the curb (which wall street likes to reward...)
This moment is probably gonna be featured in a "Redditors ruining their lives" video from WatchMojo in a year or so.
Granny watching with pride from the heavens. Decades of scrimping down the tube in a day.
We are truly blessed to have witnessed history in the making.
Op is still 500k richer then us regards
It had dividends until he bought.¬† It was probably part of his plan. Oops.¬†
He learnt from his lesson so he will hold forever until the stock goes to zero and Intel declares bankruptcy so that his future grandson will not get to make the same mistake like he did. That is a big brain move, you won't understand.
[removed]
Op isn‚Äôt great with making sense. Going all in  boomer ass intel which is the same price as it was in 2014 AND on the day of earnings with hopium reasoning . Classic
I know you‚Äôve held bags, a long time ago. We all have. Step one is for the ego to just brush it off and say, fuck me? No fuck you, as I intend to hold until this is profitable for me. 

This guy is at step 1 of the process.
Uhh if it went down in the last 10 years then clearly it's due a positive 10 years next, simple 50/50
700k call dude here. I agree with this. Better to move it and make it back elsewhere. Dead money doesn‚Äôt grow.
Baby no you're thinking about this all wrong.

You're thinking about this like others may be: "Gee, maybe putting everything in a legacy chip maker during a period of intense change in the market without doing any evaluation of whether the stock is over or undervalued, and then holding for 10 years, could be a bad idea."

You need to think of it this way. A gambler in the casino just lost all his liquid wealth. However, he still has his 401k and kids' college funds, and if he gambles those, variance may go his way hey may quickly win his lost money back. But if he goes back to a sound financial plan, that lost money won't be recovered for years.

When you look at through the lens of degenerate gambling, it all makes sense. Best wishes.
OP basically needs China to invade Taiwan and win the war for his INTC bet to pay off.
Putting all your money into the hope of one company is still kinda gambling
Imagine he bought all puts instead....
No portfolio diversity is gambling. A straight up jackass move.
Only wish I would‚Äôve had some free liquidity to inverse him!
Thankfully it only happened to me with 6k lol.
So far
It‚Äôs expensive to be famous ‚Äòround here
Could have bought a nice car, but he did something for the community
Nah this is legendary stuff
Who knows it might stick around like goin to wendys
What bugs me with OP is: he says he doesnt need money. Yet now he is stressed as fuck around his parents.

What a lunatic
To be fair listening to random people on WSB would send you broke faster than this kid most of the time (Intel kid is speed running it though)
That's true, he still has the 100k in the savings account.
Lord knows eating brains won‚Äôt be an option
Probably would kick him in the nuts¬†
10 USD per stock
Aaaaany minute now lmao
I'd rather he learned a lesson in all of this.  That probably will only come with age, unless he's so pampered that he never has to learn them.
I just don't understand. Intel has been known shit and not keeping up for years now, has it not? This adult man might need to be put under guardianship with decision skills like these.
Gran just like 'Fuck my grandson is an idiot, time to teach him a less. HEY GOD, can you do me a favour..'
> Divine timing

Nana died timing if we're gonna be real about it.
Nah, grandma worked for AMD
Probably has an Intel gaming rig not with a POS 13/14th gen, read one positive article, and said ‚Äúsold!‚Äù
They were growing revenues by 20% per year and had 25 billions in revenues. 

Now they aren't growing, but dying. Dropping dividend. And current revenue doesn't matter when they're failing as hard as they are. 

It adds up regard.
It hasn‚Äôt stayed flat for 27 years straight. There are peaks and valleys. He would be smart to get out of this rebounds and diversifying instead of holding for 10 years no matter
Yeah kids a moron
He won't be poor. If Grandma gave him 700k how much do you think his parents got?

No way they let their bouncing baby boy ever face any consequences for his actions. Will probably buy him a house to help him destress.
I think it was less thought than that and more ‚Äúayy lmao‚Äù
Yeah, I feel bad for him, his life could have been set... Having a conditional will is actually a super sensible idea
I received a 350k inheritance and bought a house with 2/3rds of it immediately. I'm constantly tempted to spend a few grand on hookers, but OP reminded me not to be an idiot.
This!. I can‚Äôt believe how many people have that kind of money yet they never buy a home?!. Like homie, you wanna rent all your life?
In OP‚Äôs defense that‚Äôs not covered until the senior year of maff.
Also if he sells now he can report the loss for this year taxes. I would definitely do that, Intel is not looking good at all, they went the business way instead of the engineering expertise way and now that the stupid cow is out of cash they are laying off people doubling down on MBA bullshit.
You bring up a good point. Does he have anymore living grandparents with freshly inked wills?
If he put 700k on intel why wouldn't he put 500k??
[deleted]
Intels are gonna be the new Incels.
This is one helllllllll of a carryover loss
Stock has traded sideways since fucking *1998*.

And that was when it still had a dividend ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
with the current state of Intel, he will be lucky if he ends up at zero in ten years ü•≤
Yeah looking at the history of the stock you have to wonder what OP saw in it \*before\* he decided to YOLO 700k in it.

>i do think 99.9% of the people in this sub are smarter than this.

  
No joke. This is actually true because if any of us has $700k to use, no way are we just throwing it all into ONE STOCK. Who the fuck does that? Everyone here has read some kind of basic book or advice on investing and trading. If investing, never go all-out in one stock. Shit when I started learning about investing, that was one of the most basic rules I learned right away on my first day of studying. Diversify your shit. 

But OP is so fucking regarded that if he knows about diversifying, he just shot himself in the foot because now that $700k is STUCK in Intel and he was 'planning to hold for a decade'???? Seriously? In a decade, $700k can be EASILY turned into millions if he just fucking followed the basic rule of diversifying and asking people for advice. Not fucking YOLOing into one stock. Goddamn. This makes me so fucking mad even though it's not my money.
Bro can have all the money in the world but he will still not be able to buy a brain
Insane behavior but we are here for it
That's not easy mode, that's more like distinguished mode. This dumb fuck could've literally invested in a way that will allow him to not work a single day in his life and he chose to do this instead.
OP will be a millionaire in his early 30s thinking he‚Äôs cracked the code.¬†

It‚Äôs not a triple if you start on 3rd base.¬†
So so funny. Came here to say this. In denial and believes the only way out the hole is to dig deeper. He said he didn‚Äôt need the money but obviously the loss is getting to him. It‚Äôs funny how dumb he continues to be. Legendary meme status that will be referenced for years to come
> Imagine how long grandma had to save to gain $200k

I mean if she passes down 800k *per grandchild* this propably is some kind of business money, not something from saving from a regular job.
I hope he takes this advice because it‚Äôs good advice, but then I also want to see the stock bounce back right after he does for the memes
I think mine is over 100,000 karma‚ÄîI‚Äôll let my account go for the $200k!
Holy shit, I have deactivated multiple accounts without realizing their value. I swear this is the second worst financial decision I had ever made.
I have 13K of Karma, so Mr. Wonderful you want to go in together on this?
Damn can I trade my karma in at that exchange rate?

Of course he will be fine, Parents probably has $10 mil trus fund lining up as graduation gift for him

That comment still pisses me off lol
Ikr, what a hilarious yolo. The dysfunctional boomer corporation that can‚Äôt innovate, and their solution to being unable to innovate is firing their employees and stressing out the rest with work üòÇyah, Intel is DEFINITELY going to shake things up in the chip industry and DEFINITELY isn‚Äôt going to siphon government chip money like a vampire ghost ship as it sinks into the vortex of inefficiency


That being said, I‚Äôm buying the dip.

He is going to start a war in Taiwan by himself, forcing tsmc down. Apple, Novideo and AMD will then use Intel fabs
With no hands
Not enough up votes for this 10/10 portmanteau¬†
This is a great point. He would be able to nullify taxes on gains for a long time
Just like what my favorite investor said, Cathy Woods! It's an underappreciated strategy, really.
He lost another $2.5k between when he posted this and now. 

Someone should set up a grandma's Intel tracker so we can all keep track of this vital info.

Hide ya kids, hide ya inheritance
OP is going to lose much much more if he keeps bag-holding than taking his loss and course-correcting. 

With capital of that size, OP is potentially limiting his growth by many 100ks just in the near term. 

While OP is bagholding he could be making $25k - $50k annually just in boring ETFs. 

A few years of that compounding and OP is racking up 6 figure lost gains.
They have two defects (voltage on the interconnect of cpus) and oxidation issues because of a failure in a hvac system that contaminated wafers and they decided it was okay to make them into chips to be sold‚Ä¶. (EDIT: did not put in here that the contamination that introduced oxidation in the chip makes the chip PERMAMENTLY damaged and gives it a 100% failure rate.)
Don't forget dividends got suspended too.
Insane. Granny toiling at work for literal decades and 200k down the drain when her money meets Intel.
That‚Äôs the sad part. It‚Äôs so much scrimping to get there.
I like to think that granny made it all buying AMD shares
For now
Unbelievable, I didn‚Äôt catch that they suspended dividend payments as well. OP could have literally not timed it any worse.
His future grandson here.. my grandfather gave me stocks of Intel as inheritance which have 0 value .
Intel the Wealth Destroyer
This.  No more than 10% of your portfolio should ever be invested in an individual stock. ETFs give broad coverage and will protect your assets in the event of poor timing.
High interest rate savings accounts are over 4%. 

He could have had a safe $28,000 at the end of a year.

Having said that ... how many hours of work did he spend earning that money? How many trips to the office and decisions did he make? How long did he save to earn that $700,000?

Absolutely zero.

Yeah, it sucks, but none of it really "cost him anything". Even if he sold at a loss today instead of his decade long plan, he's still ahead a half million dollars (the uninvested $100k and the $400k left in the stock) over before his Grandma died.

Yes, sure, she scrimped and saved for decades for that money but she's gone now and can't see that he blew a bunch of it.

He is still a half million dollars better off than the rest of us!

So, cry me a river. He lost unearned money, boo hoo.

Sell it and put it in a diversified portfolio.
Same price as 1997...
All stock market purchases are gambling.  I'm just glad we don't stake our labor trade retirements on such a thing.
Bro. 
Buying any puts on anything and buying, way too much of a single, blue chip stock to hold aren't even on the same planet in terms of risk. 

Like dude had prophetically awful timing and that's gonna, and has, cost him a lot of money but will be fine long term. 
But if dude had done puts, bros fucked. He might as well never got the money

For real though I have a declaration:

Intel will be bankrupt within 5 years. Mark my words.

RemindMe! 5 years
Lol heck yeah. Something I would not like to afford
100% guarantee that if this sub is around in 10 years, they'll be a post calculating what happened to this guy if he held until then.

Edit: Half of you regards ain't gonna make it 10 years, I don't know why you are bothering to remind yourselves.
can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre being serious or not but damn, in their shoes i‚Äôd also be stressed as fuck around my parents. fucked up real bad, doesn‚Äôt want parents to know so they‚Äôre not disappointed.
everyone's gonna act like it's no biggie when they gamble with huge investments bc it makes them seem "badass" and rich
I mean, maybe he doesn't need all that cash since he's in college at the moment, but it's going to feel pretty bad when he has 10% of it left.
I had a friend who lost his airpods. The whole day he went through all emotions stages I know of.

He convinced others but mostly himself that it was a good thing. At the end of the day he was now a proud man ready to buy the same thing again and not some fool who lost a precious object of his.

When he found his airpods in his backpack he took everything back. He felt fucked for 10 hours straight and was just trying to calm things down.

Humain psychology.
Isn't intel notoriously bad as an investment? I'm lost why he would choose this company out of all of them to YOLO


Nvda is down but you could argue that buying at $140 will still pay off in a couple years. But intel?
Get that average down lmao
FUCKING BRUTAL LMAO
Comments like these are why I reddit. - I'm crying!
I'm ded ü§£
Honestly at $10 I‚Äôd probably buy some.¬†
Meh you can still learn a lesson from something like this while not actually losing money. If it takes a couple of years to recover then he will feel how dumb he was every day.
OP's grandma Linda worked for AMD during the 2000s in HR, and deferred her retirement due to the 2008 market crash. She was an advocate for the employee stock purchase program, and loaded up during the 10-30$ range. She diamond handed the sub 5 dollar 2015s because she believed in the Zen Architecture currently under development and knew it would turn the company around. She finally retired and cashed out in 2020 when the stock hit the $60s+ and COVID was in full swing.
Yeah it‚Äôs also split  at least twice maybe 3 times depending on when in 1997 the price they pulled was
Yeah I said in a different comment, no need to go down with the ship. He needs to get out while he can
Yea that was the first thought I had. This kid is rich as fuck.
He already isn't. He literally said he has *no use for 700k* in the first post so I'm gonna be a redditor and guess he's a silver spoon kid who has no clue how money or consequences work.
Didn‚Äôt think about that but your definitely right üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Sometimes grandparents give directly to grandkids and skip a generation, figuring their kids are old enough and financially stable already.

That said, knowing how much mine and my wife's life insurance is worth and what I will be eventually inheriting from my Mom, I set up a trust for my daughter.  She aint getting access to that at 18.  Or 25.  Or 30.  Its a lifetime trust.
If you had a kid like that regard, would you give him money?, I‚Äôd be telling him to go get a job at Wendy‚Äôs
He inherited $800,000, he put $700k in Intel and lost $200k in it.   
  
If he  sold today, he still has over $500k of unearned wealth. Take that and diversify it in mutual funds and high interest savings accounts.

  
He's not poor. Unlike the rest of us, he got a half million boost at 20 to start out.

Imagine if his Grandma only gave him $500k.

Dude is still far ahead. It's up to him if he loses the rest of it or not.
He still has 500k which is a helluva lot more than most of us had at his age. He could still be set for life.

But he is clearly dumb and stubborn.
There‚Äôs no way his life isn‚Äôt already likely somewhat set from what can only imagine being a very wealthy family and support system. But it‚Äôs def a lot less cushy if he really just keeps this money just sitting there üòÇ
Should I put this $300k into Intel?
Dude definitely will think "it's such a good deal now! I wish I had 700k right now to have invested into intel it would've been a better bargain"
Another user aptly labelled him as an 'intcel'
This guy can‚Äôt be real, I just can‚Äôt believe it, it‚Äôs all too perfectly stupid üòÇ
He created a ten point explanation for buying the stock. One of them was the immunity to a China-Taiwan war.

yep, I'll guess by not acting this morning, by monday he'll have lost another 50-100k.

The entire market is a fugazi. 

One of the best plays I've even seen was buying calls on Revlon immediately after they announced bankruptcy.
You are our bottom brotha
that would be a million in a S&P index fund. If you wanted to hold for a decade that would be the least risky thing to put it all in on.  This is mind boggling üòÇ
He's a rich kid, they don't exactly know how hard it is to get that money in the first place
I have a feeling Grandma left money for his parents and his parents we're probably well off/doing well financially before that based what he said in the initial post. Which is why he hasn't learned his lesson/continued conviction.  
  
"I don't really have any use for the money, nor do I have any debt (I'm very fortunate that my parents are paying for my education)."

Hide ya portfolio,
Agreed... OP,  holding is absolutely not "your only option" as you say. You originally succumbed to optimism bias and Dunning Kruger effect ("I am smarter than average and so will be more successful in picking single stocks than people far more experienced than myself", with the blind confidence that comes from "not knowing what you don't know").

But by now just holding the single stock you are succumbing to sunk cost fallacy, whereby you are staying the course and not acting because you're already in too deep and are trying to avoid your very real losses by not realizing them through a sale. The situation has changed with new information about the company and also¬†hopefully some new information to yourself that gambling everything you have on one stock is not investment, it is gambling and not what the money was intended for.

Please, read the Bogleheads forum, educate yourself on long term investment, take the loss, and just put the money into VT (world index fund) and don't look at it again for 20 years. Plenty of people can retire off this amount with this strategy alone.¬† If you feel like you need¬†some more 'play' money to lose, hold 10k of it¬† to put into individual stocks - ideally transferred to a separate account so it's out of sight and out of mind.
You don't implement cost cutting measures by fixing HVAC systems.
It‚Äôs like the board at Intel saw his post and were like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs add this little nugget of fuck-you in addition to the layoffs‚Äù

Request physical paper stocks from Intel. The paper is worth something.
I can‚Äôt fathom how anyone could think dumping 700k inheritance into a single stock let alone‚Ä¶ Intel‚Ä¶ would be a good idea
4 years ago this comment would‚Äôve been downvoted to shit and a mod probably would‚Äôve banned you from the sub for being too reasonable. 

Not that it‚Äôs bad advice, just kinda funny seeing how this sub has changed since GameStop happened.

I don‚Äôt think OP understands how hard it is to make $200,000, and how dumb you‚Äôd have to be to lose it in a few minutes. Oh well, he might somehow get a hold of a few more bucks (millions) and continue to average down, and in the end become CEO of INTEL and literally go down with that sinking ship, winning as the biggest regard in WSB history.

I would be more willing to bet on this sub being around in ten years than Intel.
It just that in words, it means that is actually money they need, not the bold claim he made before üòÇ
It‚Äôs casino thinking.  Red drew 5 times, so next must be black.  Intel has been flat for years, so it must pop any time soon.  

Like many people, I contemplated intel during the AI boom, and looking at the graph I was like ‚Äúwow it didn‚Äôt go up yet, I must buy it‚Äù - but I didn‚Äôt.  Pretty sure OP did the same  reasoning.   The reality is that the AI boom has suddenly made that market ultra competitive, and Intel was not ready for swimming in a pool of sharks, and will probably be eaten alive.
Like Nana
Personally I‚Äôm waiting for $15.
What can I say, I like the stock
My pops passed and left me and my sister 27k a piece and it was the most life improving money I could've ever received. I hope OP can do some introspective searching and realize their blessings before too late
You never know. My buddy got the about the same amount from his grandpa. Turns out old farmer Joe wearing overalls every day, bought Microsoft shares when they first came out and bitcoin early and bunch of smart choices and just never spent anything. But that was it. And I watched him put 500k on a national championship game and won and never bet again üòÖ was insane to watch and he's doing well.
Says right in his first post they pay his tuition.

Imagine the lives 200k would‚Äôve changed but this kid is gambling it away because his family spoiled him.
Where I live I could retire for life with his 500k , jesus.
I also thought that when I read the first post. His parents probably inherited $10 mil.

Then again, imagine being a person of average means and seeing your kid inherit $700k from your mom lmao
Are you OP? In that case yes, because you are him.

Otherwise, oh my god no!
That's why when you give your child an inheritance you should also help them out by setting up a trust so they don't fumble the bag.
He'll learn his lesson when in a few days he has to go to his parents and say "mom, dad, I threw 700k of the inheritance into a stock the day it happened for lose 30% of its value", gets disowned and has to make his own way in life with no money. 

I can definitely see burning your grandma's inheritance, money OPs grandparents probably worked hard for, causing a lot of family problems to the point OPs parents just don't support him anymore.
That would be so hilarious! üòÇ
I call. Flush
and no brother üòû
PS if you also claim the loss on tax, you will be able to claim it against your gains to offset tax for many years to come. If you are working to get into a high tax bracket, this will effectively halve your losses, so is another reason to do this.

If you go this route please consult with a fiduciary duty professional to make sure you're doing it right, as it needs to be registered and carried forward correctly each year.
We already fucked the people that bought our chips, let's fuck the people that bought our stock.
We're so broke we're going to layoff people who don't even work for us.
Inheritance rarely lasts long. Even 700k is gone in a couple of terrible choices. Just imagine he had a coke and hooker problem.

Honestly i wouldnt. Intel might fail. The earnings call and stock drop after wasnt even due to the chips fucking up it was due to low earnings. And they just cut R&D. They will never get back to where they are expected to be

forget $200k, just $50k could make my life so much better
OP said they don‚Äôt need the money. This is them doing a little demo of their investment skills. OP is obviously related to grandma considering she wasted 800K on this regard.
Really good time to put this 100k into Intel. Super deep discount.
Yeah. My dumb broke ass is 33, never made more than 50k/yr,  made less than 20k/yr for maybe 80% of my working years to date, has zero savings besides MAYBE 20k in a 403(b), but my dad was smart AF with his money so I'll be alright in the long run. That said, he knows I have poor brain, and the principal is locked up tighter than a nun's asshole until I am 50.

I might be calling myself out as a trust-punk, but at least I didn't just lose 700k on Intel.
Parents won't disown him. If he's lucky they'll think "Well, he still has half a million dollars...why are we paying for his tuition? Let him do it, maybe he'll learn the value of money"
It's still possible however unlikely that OP makes the right call.

Intel performance v industry ETF over 10 years is currently unknown.

Yes the the tax write-off is very appealing.
That's why grandma should've created a trust. Helps keep your dumb descendants from wasting your life's work
I know.. it‚Äôs just so dumb. It‚Äôs a life changing amount of money for you and if you play it right could be generational.
Atleast he woulda had fun while the money lasts . 

This way he‚Äôs losing the money and still stressed the fuck out
At least then he‚Äôd be the one doing the fucking‚Ä¶
At least a coke and hooker problem would be more fun than being a wsb laughing stock.
Imagine how much fun he could have had if it was just coke and hookers. He got literally nothing for this.
I have a bunch of friends who used to give me shit years ago for even mentioning that I am "on Reddit". Now all these idiots are here too
Dude, that's a win win
RemindMe! 10 years
Iirc intel's edge is they have manufacturing in the US. Intel's stock is going to be negatively correlated to Taiwan's democracy.
I was homeless at 17 while still in high school, I feel you.
At 5% interest OP will be a multi millionaire by the time they are in their mid 30s even if they don‚Äôt get more inheritance or earn money working.¬†

Nothing admirable about them.¬†
‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs gone.
Of course, it's not impossible. But OP spent 700k on a lottery ticket yesterday, and saw how the probability didn't work in his favor. 

Rather than seeing that money as now tied up, he should be evaluating the situation today as to whether he wants to use his remaining 600k on another lottery ticket, further based on what he's learned.
I mean, that's why he is the "least favorite grandchild"
RemindMe! 10 years

I was on the toilet when reading this post
I am French, i cant even imagine how is it possible to be homeless this young. Like there is no non-profit organization to help you ? Or state agency ? 

  
I am sorry it happnned to you
I have no idea what French programs look like, but that *last* place you want to be in America is in our system. America, as an entity, hates the poor -- if you are poor here, you already know this.

There is very little support for the working poor and even less for the homeless. Since Covid, even our pensioners have been falling into homelessness, due to people on fixed incomes getting ass-blasted by inflation. Things are pretty rough out there, and our entire political establishment is caught up in the political equivalent of wrestlemania. I don't expect improvement here within my lifetime.

Crazy story: Partner accidentally sent out a spreadsheet with everyone‚Äôs salary to ‚ÄúAll company‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúAll partners‚Äù.
As soon as he realized what he did he went ballistic and called IT to reverse send the email but it was too late. Whoever wanted to quit could quit  and whoever wanted to complain could get fired. A couple of employees did quit within the week.
Don't be a pussy, upload that shit.
I‚Äôm sure he was an absolute gentleman to IT while asking them to fix the problem he caused.
I think that employees must talk more about their salaries to fight against those different wage treatments
How were the pays?
I had something similar happen years ago but it was just to me. Our HR person dropped a spreadsheet labeled salary master in my personal folder. It was locked. I downloaded a copy to a gig stick so there wasn't any track of me emailing it.

I brought it home and looked up how to unlock password encrypted spreadsheet, and Bam I saw what everyone in the firm made (this was a small 40 person firm)

I found out that after four years there I was being paid less than a new hire out of college.

I went and found a new job like a few weeks later.
I had a Director of HR send me a retirement calculation workbook (for company matching).

Lovely hidden tab showed everyone's salary.  
My boss made not much more than I was making -- the next step up tho was 2x ours

\[not Accounting\]
I got one in industry. I told HR not to do that but they did. They also wanted to give me their login because it would be easier to do that than get a new account. Amazing how much money so.e worthless people make...
Yes upload this plz lmao
He‚Äôs never sleeping properly at night ever again. This action will be burned into his memory forever.
Boomers vs Outlook is one of the greatest battles of our time
TCs or gtfo
I stand by the opinion that white collar workers are lobotomized into working against their own interests. 

If your company is so unfair that a single spreadsheet unleashes pandora‚Äôs box, it should be quite obvious that the workers need to shore up some security via organization.
I reconciled payroll accounts at my last job and for a few months I was inadvertently getting a file every month with everyone's salary.  It is one of the things that led to me leaving.
I mean, some people were probably ass mad about pay not increasing linearly with experience, but that's to be expected.

Pay shouldn't be determined solely on time in job. It should be based more on output and effort. There are plenty of people working at jobs putting in minimal effort throughout most of their career. That's fine, but they can't get assmad when people with ambition put in way more effort than they do and advance faster than they do in both pay and position.

Having people with ambition get capped in salary and promotion based on the mediocre efforts of others who've been there longer is a recipe for disaster for an organization. Why would high performers stick around if they're given a hard ceiling like that?
If you wanna cause chaos at your job, print out a fake spreadsheet with the salaries, random initials and leave it in the printer before you go on a vacation.
Is the gender pay gap real?
I have seen some of the craziest (and disgusting) things through wages in my company. If I wasn't the second highest paid person in the office I would have quit. 

I have seen non-CPA 30yr old male Sr associate getting paid more than 60 yr old female CPA Manager... 

I saw the partners email saying that a young female new hire was outperforming all the male new hires but he wanted to be sure that she made 5k less annually. 

I guess it's misogyny but funny enough this partner has 3 daughters, no son's, and he made his wife agree to be SAHM. I think they are also really religious (or pretend to be) so maybe they have some very traditional thinking.
It should be a legal requirement to do this honestly. Let people know theyre being undervalued.
As someone in accounting who has entered the payroll journal in multiple orgs and has had access to everyone's pay, I hate knowing what my colleagues get paid so I don't go digging. The only thing knowing has ever done is made me feel like shit. ESPECIALLY being a female minority, pay disparities are glaringly obvious.
We could all have much better lives if it weren‚Äôt for the greedy cunts.¬†
Genuine question, I work at a small office and we can literally see everything everyone is working on (Owners, CFO, DoO, all the way down to entry level) through Microsoft Office or whatever it's called, all the files from past years are easily accessible.

Can I get fired for peaking where I shouldn't?

The salary sheet was floating around last week but instead of looking at that one, I opened one from two years through PDF so they wouldn't see.
OP did you see any general interesting insights on it?
Do us a favor and upload it
Lol. I was kind of in the same situation. I‚Äôm at a tiny single partner firm (<10 ppl) and the partner left the biweekly payroll summary on the printer and I had a chance to look it over. Pretty much found out everyone was underpaid and I was getting especially shafted.
fake as fck for not uploading
I would have printed that so fast lol
Do people not know how to retract their own emails?
Happened at my work. Everybody in the company (3,500 people) got an email with their Christmas bonus amount and their salary for the next year. 

The numbers were in a single line of an excel spreadsheet embedded in the email. About ten minutes later someone figured out that double-clicking the excel snippet opened the entire spreadsheet. The news spread so fast. It tried to recall the email but it was much too late.

The shitstorm went on for months.
Is this a problem a password could have avoided?
One of the perks of working for the government, I can see everyone‚Äôs salaries and everyone else too as it is public data. Every salary increase is shared with the public weekly.
I had access to this spreadsheet while I was an intern. I even told my boss this and he laughed and said there was no way I possibly had access to that folder. OK my guy.
Absolutely based. Make it standard practice.
Just so everyone knows here it is legal in the US for employees to discuss wages. [NLRB.Gov](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/your-rights-to-discuss-wages) Just make sure your company is covered under the boards jurisdiction. 

So yeah that guy wasn‚Äôt supposed to send that email out to all staff. But since he did, talk away! :)
This happened at my former big 4 firm when we merged with Anderson after the Enron debacle. They assigned everyone at Anderson a buddy from my firm, senior to senior and manager  to Manager etc. They sent out a spreadsheet to everyone to see who the assigned buddy was. After the email went out they came to everyone‚Äôs office who opened the file and said there was a malicious virus and to delete the file. That was a lie they panicked as they realized there was a hidden column that had the salaries of everyone at Anderson other than partners. All you had to was click unhide column.
That happened at my old company. They sent a follow-up email to everyone Not to open the email attachment and delete it. But of course everyone opened it.
Hiding salaries is only beneficial to management.
Who the hell is emailing payroll information? What kind of 3rd world firm are you?
Whoever set up those two emails that similarly is Chaotic Evil
I thought outlook has a reverse send feature for all internal emails¬†
It's giving Regina George's burn book
>called IT to reverse send the email but it was too late.

Because IT was so busy looking up their salaries they didn't have time to reverse it.
People still email spreadsheets internally?

Jokes aside, this is kind of a perfect example for why there should be salary transparency.
I call bullshit
What firm was this at?
Do woman actually get paid less? üòÇüòÇ
Fake story. No way you saw that info and didn‚Äôt at least do a screenshot let alone download the file.
    
Nice try. 0/10.
Well, it's not really a big deal. It's just interesting. We all should be getting paid the same for do the same work and experience level, so no problem, right?
Obvious I know, but all people aren‚Äôt created equal in terms of talent/skill and thus similar years of experience and pure job grade just aren‚Äôt always relevant.  The worker who is ‚Äúaverage‚Äù doesn‚Äôt usually have a realistic view of their performance relative to the top performers so exposing everyone‚Äôs pay does nothing more than offend the average and alienate the top performers.
All tax filings should be readily available at no cost (public & private). If you have SSN or EID, disclosure required.
Sounds like you and the company you work for are a bunch of pieces of shit! They‚Äôll be better off without you.
Pay transparency seems like a great idea until you realize you gave up opportunity for fairness. The places with the most transparent pay have the lowest paid employees.
As long as it's not money, you're still good to go
Does he not know how to recall an email on outlook? Lol 

I wonder what will happen to him as punishment
I‚Äôd get a lawyer
All the underpaid/overworked people quit and the people who were overpaid/underworked probably got raises and less duties tbh.
Should‚Äôve instantly recalled the email.. Partner doesn‚Äôt know how to do that?
I just wasted 10 mins scrolling to try to see the difference.  Why's this still up if no numbers were shown.
currently checking my IT emails just in case....jk
Can you provide some numbers with relevant experience. I just started my career in this field I would like to see what that‚Äôs would mean numbers wise
"Accidentally"
That‚Äôs ok, my HR person sent all of our W2s to a Russian hacker.  They should date.
Random question, but can't most of you all already see the salary for everyone in the company? If not purely from having access to payroll, than just by being able to go in the budget, or like track labor expenses back to where they came from?

I get the surprise of everyone in the company seeing that, but it's weird sometimes when people on this sub don't seem to have that insight. Maybe the difference of being a corporate accountant rather than working for an accounting firm.
I had this happen at a company I worked for. Best of luck to your company, it‚Äôs going to be worse than people think!
Years ago, someone at a national company replied to a spoofed email and provided employees SS numbers and names.
Jesus¬†
What firm was it?
PwC‚Äôs cohort based system solves this issue.
Can yall not see everyone‚Äôs salary? Doesnt it depend 
 on billable rate?
My old staff accountant position I entered payroll JEs and I was shocked at how underpaid everyone was. I was 25 years old making $60K and I was making more than everyone around me (non-accountants).
You probably won't believe me if I told you this, but I've had a client at my firm upload a very proactive nude as part a .zip file with a series of bank statements. It was obviously a mistake, and we never told the client. It was just a common understanding that we knew it was there but no-one spoke of it.
Litt activities
They can‚Äôt get fired for knowing others salaries .. it‚Äôs the law
Fake story if you‚Äôre not posting details.
do it, yuo wont
This is why you password protect files.
Did he know you can easily recall an email (if using Outlook, at least)? Unless a recipient has already opened it, then you're screwed. Do it fast enough it should catch most.
Gang shit. Nice. Post attendance next!
Or you could join us in the 21st century and send confluence or drive links so you can just strip access if you f up.
What kind of ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù ass firm you work for?
I would love to see this list for my company. I just got a $4K raise to $72K, in a major met area, with CPA license, 1 yr audit exp, 2 years tax. I have "no clue" if I'm being taken advantage of or not, lol. A list like this would be awesome. 

Still, I suspect companies treat employees fairly equally--consistently good pay or consistently low pay.
Stop sending PII and other sensitive information as email attachments.
At my old job you could see everyone's salary being booked through the ERP. It didn't have names, but it was easy enough to figure out for the smaller teams who was being paid what. This wasn't a small company either, it was a F500.
Upload the doc
Unfortunately, for that partner, this is what happens when you drink too much or you're watching something you shouldn't be watching. ü´£
No excel sheet or numbers are mentioned. OP also gives very vague responses. Gonna assume this didn‚Äôt happen unless they prove me otherwise
#POST THE SHEET YOU COWARD
Not sure he is not keeping those files on a secure server that is only accessible by partners.  Email is so insecure, also easy to send the wrong recipient like that partner just learned.
In proper orgs, doesn't everyone know the salary scale/structure?
This ^ 

Otherwise may the curse of forever crashing excel be upon you
IT took it down now lol. I would‚Äôve saved it lol
Yes please upload, for science!
I would enjoy it.
This sub is dope accountants are based
Also, anyone unfamiliar with the email recall function gets what they deserve if they‚Äôre not careful with who they‚Äôre sending emails to.
Yes,  something very polite that goes 


"DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM"  üò°üò°ü§°
I would also assume just emailing unprotected Excel docs back and forth containing every single FTEs annual salary violates the firm's HR practices. Pretty cringe that a partner is handling sensitive data this way imo.
You keep sensitive data on a secure location and share accordingly via a link. If said recipient does not have access to shared location, error impact is greatly reduced. 

But hey, I'm just an IT guy with learned-observations; it's was probably their management engineers who quit/got fired (or should have). ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Should just be posted publicly. Fuck it.
Great idea in theory, in practice you end up lowering the bar to the lowest performer‚Äôs wage.

I have three seniors on my team, none of them have the same background or years of service, none of them have the same qualifications, none of them live in the same CoL, none of them perform the same.

As a result, they all get compensated differently because they all add different value to the organization. It‚Äôs not like 30% different, but it IS different.
We need an accountants union lol
When I was senior level in public the seniors in my local office did.  We were not paid the same the variance typically had an apparent reason if you were objective and rational enough to accept reality.  Like hot girl got more than an ugly guy, Kool-aid drinkers got even more, and the girl whose dad was a Partner in a CA  office got a little more, and the son of a client's CFO got even more. The +/- was like 12%.
We started doing that more at my firm. I think it helps
You say that until someone who gets paid less than you who doesn't do the amount of work you do wants to make your wage. I've seen it happen multiple times at different jobs after coworkers started disclosing pay wage.
In order for capitalism to work correctly, people need to know their market worth. Sharing compensation info helps that.

On the flip side, there are lots of reasons someone might not want to tell their co-workers how much they‚Äôre paid.
Yeah but if your salary is higher than someone with more experience and you share it with them, there is a chance they might start hating you, not the firm.
Employees aren't objective enough to have a real conversation about why they don't get paid more than others
Glad I'm in the public service. Our pay rates are open information and you get to know exactly how much a certain person makes depending om years worked and the classification. 

It REALLY takes a tonne of stress off not having to worry about how to pitch and fight for the next raise. Everyone gets the same raise and pay and the union will fight for the next round of pay hikes. 

Of course there are downsides but it's all in stride.
Let‚Äôs just say compensation doesn‚Äôt always increase with experience
Absolutely ludicrous i immagine
What were the amounts?
I am forever jealous of your username. Only the greatest October of all time
From my experience, that's exactly how it works. New outside hires get paid more. 

My husband has been that hire twice. You do get paid more, but you're also on the short list for layoffs. But then he just finds a new company and gets paid even more so... yeah tenure really hasn't meant shit as far pay rate goes.
I'm in the same boat. I'm not certain but I'm pretty sure the new hire makes more than me and worst of all he's just no good! Every time he does a presentation it irks me.¬†
It‚Äôs insane when people make.  I‚Äôm in FP&A so I can see everyone salary in a 3000 FTE company and what some people in HR and marketing earn is just insane.
Exactly. The collective response to this spreadsheet *should* be "yeah that seems about right".
Only if there was some sort of organization for workers to unionize, to protect the interests of the hard working middle and lower classes. /s
But it isn't ever based on that either. Most companies pay the bare minimum to keep people there. Companies will pay the minimum necessary.
>Pay shouldn't be determined solely on time in job. It should be based more on output and effort.

Agree.  I'd even add, there's more to it than those two facets.

When I was at my career's entry-level, I was a high volume producer.  I understood the job and how to do it, I produced 400% of comparable employees.  In addition to being the most productive employee we had (I had two rivals who I am friends with), I went above and beyond.

I trained new staff.  I wrote area procedures.  I developed worksheets for less experienced staff to use.  I looked at the impacts of law changes and made projections based on those law changes for upper management.  All of this, while outproducing everyone else.

The person sitting behind me in the office did none of those things.  She was a run of the mill employee, who was producing a quarter of my output - not getting into all the other things I was also doing.  Also, sometimes she would take my calls.  She would get the person on the other line good and pissed off, and then transfer the call to me, man I hated that.  I called it a "her-name special;" and often said to my friends but not to her: "Just transfer the call to begin with; don't dig me into a hole and then expect me to dig myself out."

We were paid the same.  I felt it was grossly unfair.

I took a new position.  Then I learned she's bilingual; and I'm not.  I rely on her regularly now for translations.

I have skills she doesn't have, she can't match my output or knowledge.  But the minute I'm dealing with someone who only speaks Spanish, none of that matters.  My output drops to 0% - *full stop*.

It's okay that her output was only a quarter of mine, if she's the one who deals with the quarter of the population who only speak Spanish.

It changed my perspective about our compensation.  We probably were compensated equitably.
It‚Äôs based on leverage and negotiation
I already learned butthurt, I refuse to learn assmad
This. To my knowledge, we only have one person out of whack in my dept. The rest are fairly compensated based on effort and productivity

The problem is people expect someone else to fight for them. "Join a union" but the fuckers will never go out and picket or do anything that unions require to actually be effective. 

Employers/Business have a divine motive to pay as little for labor as possible. They will try to get every job done for the lowest price they can find. This is the same mindset when they offer salaries to employees, and employees should have the same mindset when they offer their own product (their time, skills, etc) to the company. Charge as much as you possibly can for your services.
Yeah I just brought an employee back to my team (lost to another department for a while) with a big raise. No one else could perform at his level.
Lateral‚Ä¶to‚Ä¶another‚Ä¶firm
Awwww bless your heart thinking salary is based on effort or even output. It has nothing to do with anything.
Oh yeah
Women on average don't counter as much with initial offers or annual raises.

They are hampered significantly if they have kids - whether they take time out of their careers to pause working or turn down/get passed over for promotions because their childcare duties are seen as a distraction (versus men being seen as breadwinners is a positive). 

Anyone saying it isn't real is an idiot, but it's not so cut and dry as "It's a woman? Give her 20% less."
It‚Äôs mostly a motherhood gap. Women who don‚Äôt have kids tend to keep pace with male counterparts. Men who have kids don‚Äôt fall behind though.
I did a lil study on this with the big 4 transparency spreadsheet and it does exist yeah
It is and it isn't. Schrodingers gap.


Edit: this is meant to be a joke people. The data is too nuanced for me to type an essay response in a reddit thread thanks.
Yes because they work less, choose less demanding positions, less technical fields, and don‚Äôt negotiate well
So communism?üòÇ
Depends on company policy and what you've agreed to.

Now, in the military, there are two dimensions to accessing classified information: 1) Do you have the clearance to see it?, and 2) do you have a need to see it? Neither one is sufficient on its own; just because you have Top Secret clearance doesn't mean you just get to read any Top Secret material.

Depending on the size of your company, there may be a rather robust information security policy in place. In such a case, accessing information you have no need to access may get your peepee smacked or your ass outright fired, depending on how hardass your higher ups are.

Additionally, if you're looking at things on the network you have no need for, clearly you're not doing your job in that moment. If those moments add up, you'll probably find youself out of a job.
yeah ofc you can get fired for this lol
U cannot retract if the recipient already open it. It only works when it is unread.
>retract 

Is largely uselss.

The receivers email client needs to support it and even if it does they can disable it

It's janky hack layered on top of email rather than part of the core email infrastructure
Yes lol
it's believable because a basic excel spreadsheet is often all that is utilized for information like this. Working helpdesk in HR I've seen it myself. "CompanyPayroll.xlsx" and of course I opened it
That would be nice. Excuse is partner 1 can only charge his clients x amount of dollars so he can only pay his employees up to a certain amount while partner 2 can charge his clients y amount of dollars so he can pay his employees more
lol you think pay is based on performance
Do you actually believe this?
Have you any supporting evidence for this, or are we just alleging things about the entire working world based on personal experience?
It‚Äôs literally the opposite buddy.
These old timer partners don‚Äôt know. I teach him excel shortcuts lol
I am a controller for a private enterprise and the only people from accounting department who can see other's salary is me and payroll admin. You cannot track labor expenses to individual person and neither you can figure out individual salary by looking at the budget. People that look at detailed budgets have clearance to do so. IE upper management. Grunts and the like don't look at budgets.
My tax program crashed once today. So it begins
Do it, op
Damn, dude. That's a really harsh curse... 

Couldn't you let him get the curse of a broke foot instead? That can recover...
Worse: the curse of *sometimes* crashing Excel. If you know what will happen you can change the program. But if you trust the program, and then lose 8 hours of work it really hurts.
Pretty sure that's just standard Excel
Null pointer exceptions for everyone!
Calm down, lucifer.
If real, someone saved it. Find it and upload it.
Check your downloads folder.
As controller I have full access to payroll at my job. It‚Äôs weird.
Bs you didn't save it
Recall doesn‚Äôt work with everyone especially those who disable it
Recall? No, it‚Äôs the lack of password on the file that‚Äôs disturbing.
If it's exchange you can simply use power shell to delete any emails.¬† ¬†Or a 365 discovery search to delete any emails¬†
I also have an autorule to delay outgoing messages by 3 mins
Always password protect files that have salaries and send the password in a separate email. Rookie mistake on their part
File permissions? What‚Äôs that?
Posting everyone‚Äôs salary publicly is kind of sketchy, but having a transparent salary range for positions would be nice.
Yes, when i will start my own firm that will be a thing
If it lowered everyone's wage you would bet every company on the planet would be posting all salaries publicly.
This is where the rubber meets the road. Highest performers  are paid the lowest when pay transparency is a feature of the environment. There is an entire sector of the economy that proves this : Government. It also has the hardest time keeping high performers and it shows up in the quality of the service.
I am in for meritocracy, who brings more added value shall be compensated 

But if the roles and the output are similar, a 30% difference is not justifiable
As a Union Electrician, I support this. It was pretty painful hearing the Forman at a job we're contracted on joke to his employees about how they'll never see a raise. They laughed with him because they're family and anything less would have been, low key, insubordination. 

Meanwhile, I know for a fact my Employer is taking our demands for a raise very seriously this year.

It's pretty sad watching them break their bodies and give their lives away to a group of investors who have convinced them they care about them with $100 worth of doughnuts, pizza, and coffee.
You don‚Äôt need a union to talk to your coworkers lol
Anyone tasked with managing other employees can't be part of a union. So it would only be at the staff level, possibly senior, depending on the company. 

The move to manager+ in accounting is too quick for a union to work in public.
Government accountants have one. Js.
Will it pay for my CPE each year and/or provide 40 hours a year including ethics? If you make it more like the skilled trades unions i.e. training provided by unions, benefits, etc. Then honestly, I could see some, not all, firms and companies being apt to accept it and work with it.¬†
The staff people could easily recreate the spreadsheet at least at their level. Managers probably won‚Äôt but that‚Äôs not the point. See who‚Äôs getting screwed at your own level.
This would make the profession so much better.
Or just talk about your salaries. So many prudish ppl when it comes to salary share
Unions generally work best in situations where a large number of employees do very similar jobs (generally on the lower skill end but it doesn't always have to be), without a lot of hierarchy among the ranks, for a relatively small number of employers.

It wouldn't work for accounting due to those reasons. I don't get why people keep asking for it. The types of people on here are mostly CPAs/prospective CPAs who are going to end up in management sooner rather than later. It wouldn't benefit people like that.

People aren't actually thinking through what impact an "accounting union" would have on them.
I get paid 50% less than my colleague that do the same jobs as mine

I get your point, but there are case and cases, and my case is just fucked up

I am in for meritocracy, is someone brings added value good, let‚Äôs pay him more

But when the conditions are the same or similar, the difference in wage is not justifiable
All the examples you listed are BS. Just because something was done for a reason doesn't mean the reason can't be shit
#YEAH FUCK YEAH. VIVA LA LIBERTAD CARAJO!
Experience doesn‚Äôt translate into quality and value tho
Give us numbers though.
post some more details OP ffs
Just because someone has been working longer and has more ‚Äúexperience‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre better. There are people just cruising alone throughout their career and others are driving change and truly making a difference.
TC or gtfo
Oh yeah. You have to be a shameless self promoter. It's fucked but you can be the corner stone of the org and everyone knows it and they will screw you on comp. Accountants are terrible business leaders in general. The penny pinching at the risk of loss of talent inhibits growth. It's hard to see because the causality isnt direct. It's shows up as stagnation, crappier clients, more tax audits, just generally more effort per file
No because they try to pay everyone the least amount t they can.  Some people will try to negotiate higher salaries.  Some just accept the low pay or have no idea their pay is shit.  Some people come in from outside the firm and get a premium.
And experienced people don‚Äôt always pick continuing Ed wisely for stuff that is actually useful for their job. And while some old timers will just go to their corner office and crush it, others will do the bare minimum because they know they are almost ready to retire and don‚Äôt think anyone would dare get rid of them because they think too much of themselves
yikes
Really all over the place. Also keep in my this is a really lcol area and I left in 2020 before I received my fourth annual raise.

One manager that had been there since the early 90s was only making 80k, and another manager that had been there for a few years years was making 115k and he was the highest paid person (partners were not on this list.

For people in the staff level through senior, the range was 49.5-80k, the vast majority being between 60-70k. I was an outlier as the lowest paid person in the firm at 49.5k

Most people were in the same range, there were just some outliers like myself that were really low or really high. Most staff were in a range of 60-70k, most managers were in a range that was 90-100k

I screwed myself from the start because I accepted a really low starting salary of 40k, and so when they said they were giving large percentage raises it sounds fantastic because I was outpacing inflation by a lot, but in pure dollars of total annual salary it was shit. I thought about getting out of accounting because I knew the salary was low, and public school teachers were advertised as making around the same that I was and my thought was at least I wouldn't work 80 hour busy seasons anymore. I really thought I just made the worst career choice and needed to pivot.

The spreadsheet showed me I could make more money if I just left. So I did some job hopping and now I make 115k which is fantastic for the area.
totally agree\~  
At my company, all our Marketing is a "Manager" of some random bullshit -- literally there are no actual workers on that team. They had one intern at one point.
Wait til tell you about my profession (enterprise sales in tech - I have no idea how I got to this sub)
you work hard to get the promotion. Raises are rarely worth it.
Hahaha. They're essentially the same in concept. Assmad is simply a more angry version of butthurt.
>Awwww bless your heart thinking salary is based on effort or even output. It has nothing to do with anything.

You're clearly a bitter, angry lower performer who's never seen true salary bumps and bonuses from doing extremely well.

Pathetic.
At same position levels?
Women not being as aggressive negotiators was debunked as a reason for the gender pay gap.

https://hbr.org/2022/10/3-negotiation-myths-still-harming-womens-careers
In short: It‚Äôs real because they work less. Less hours per week on avg and way less over a lifetime, and way longer work gaps when they take one (most men will never take one, because you are the one financing her work break).

Less aggressive, less ambitious and less of a work horse ON AVG because they have about 50x less testosterone than a man, which amplifies all of these things. I have to keep emphasizing on avg because someone is going to bring up an example of a woman who has 32 kids and works 400hrs a week to rebute things that we all intuitively know are true.

To suggest anything else is to suggest that corporations should pay women extra for having children and taking care of them which, doesn‚Äôt make sense at all. If we want to do that, that‚Äôs the job of taxpayer dollars as many countries already do and have done since the dawn of society.
Your study should have been done with crayons. Doesn‚Äôt rule out the variable of women leaving careers to start families.

So partner 1 wants to make the same as partner 2 and he‚Äôs doing that by taking a chunk out of all his employees‚Äô salary and adding it to his own. Now partner 1 and 2 make about the same!
It's Saturday, screw busy season, stop working.
Completely agree. Quit being a pussy and show us

That was a legendary email.
Or the temp folder.
I managed payroll at a group of clinic for a while. I learned I should've gone to med school.
I worked at a company that had about 20,000 employees and everyone with Windows could use network neighbourhood to look at all the companies financials for years.
So do I, which is why if o think I work much higher I always ask for a raise
Change in leadership happened.  This past fall, In the span of 8 weeks.  HR, CFO & Controller quit.  Payroll fell to me.  I found out what everyone makes.  Even went back to look up what old employees make.  Half the new hires are overpaid IMO while us holdovers that are all slowly leaving that actually do all the work are underpaid.
Why weird? Shouldn‚Äôt a controller also manage payroll too?
Doesn‚Äôt work on snips though. At least that‚Äôs what my snips say. (Director supposed to be bilingual for the job sends a direction to her assistant to translate but sends to all 900 of us? Yup, I‚Äôll snip that!)
Job positions should have their pay bands posted combined with *expected *years of experience. They also shouldn't be like $40k apart. 

Honestly, you could just post the salaries with personal information scrubbed and it would be fine.
a lot of government employee salaries are publicly available. i take all of 5 minutes to know what everyone in my makes. it is an occasional joy for me to interrupt a pointless and unproductive lconference call by putting how much that call cost in the chat. It's been an hour, that cost $800 for everyone to be here, and we're still deciding whether to spend $300 on this software?
Ideal world would be list as much as you can publicly while masking data. Maybe something like glass door but with company reported data instead of self reporting. I don‚Äôt tell anyone my salary in real life, but I submit it to any anonymized comp survey when I can. Just a personal preference but I don‚Äôt want people I know to figuring out how much I make. 


If I was a CEO, I‚Äôd try something like; for each role list the range, the median and maybe a bar chart of how many people make how much for a specific roll (ie 10 people make 90-95k, 7 make 95-100‚Ä¶), and have filters based on experience/other material factors like certifications/COL or city etc.  if it‚Äôs under 5 people, don‚Äôt report on that slice of data but include them in the larger cut. All department heads and up are de-masked and publicly list their comp. Seems like something you could make with alteryx/tableau in like 1-2 days and just refresh over a year so it shouldn‚Äôt be a huge investment.
I worked in a company that did this. we had an annual report of all job titles in the org and then the actual lowest and highest salary for each title.
Everyone in govt or public education‚Äôs salary is public information. Works fine. Hiding salaries only benefits the company. Talk and share more
This is something I‚Äôve wanted to do. Start my own firm and have complete transparency. The financials of the firm will be posted on the wall (probably a screen non client facing but in employee view) and updated regularly (monthly or so). Another screen with the real pay ranges for each position in the company, probably couldn‚Äôt list exact names for legal reason (would need to consult a lawyer). This way everyone knows how much the firm makes and their pay. They are more than welcome to ask questions about getting more pay or the finances at anytime. The company will be built on transparency internal and external to clients. 

If it becomes large there probably will not be a partner buy in option. Why? If there‚Äôs no owners besides a single owner there is less hands trying to take from the profits. The company can survive on much less profit and pay employees better. When an employee leaves, the motto will be to wish them well and ask the purpose for leaving to see how the company can improve. If someone finds a better position or significant pay increase congratulate them and understand that at some point every person leaves the company. 

Transparency about the amount of billable hours expected for a salary. If you meet billable hours for a year (without over billing) you are welcome to unlimited PTO or can keep working and billing hours to get a prorated bonus for every excess hour billed. This way you know what is expected but also if you keep working exactly what you can increase your earnings by. 

Oh and of course everyone gets a slice at the company pizza party.
Most of that is happening due to local laws and the pay bands are usually +/-20% on a midpoint‚Ä¶

You can‚Äôt take companies that are forced to post as ‚Äòwilling.‚Äô
The problem there is perception.

Lots of people think they are massively valuable, but the top 10% is just the top 10%.
I gotta be honest with you here man, I wish MORE skilled unions existed in this country. They are an absolute win-win for everyone - union provides high quality training (on their dime) and employers & customers have confidence in hiring those workers because they can expect a certain level of competence.¬†


I think unions would find it MUCH easier to spread in America if they mimicked more of the IBEW or any other apprenticeship based union.¬†
I wish the trades union would insist that the state ed departments make it crystal clear how one gets into the trades.  I can find out in five minutes how to get an degree in art history, but try and get a clear answer on what steps it takes to be come an electrician.  Every electrician I know has a father or close relative that was/is one and so the process wasn‚Äôt a mystery.
As a Union Engineer I second this.
Unions are a force multiplier. They synergise (big business speak here) individual conversations into a unified voice
> You don‚Äôt need a union to talk to your coworkers lol

the fuck do you think a union is?
Yes. You nailed it.

I'm in management now and it's already hard enough to deal with personnel issues without a union involved. I really don't welcome needing to bring a hostile union rep into every performance/discipline related conversation.
They‚Äôre ‚Äúlazy‚Äù though, having 40 hour weeks and defined benefits.

Let me just go complain about being overworked and underpaid and say unions do nothing
So get a new job? If you‚Äôre that underpaid it‚Äôs not going to be difficult to get a raise
If you're getting paid 50 percent less than someone to do an identical job with a comparable level of skill, at a certain point that is your fault. If you're so far below market comp it should be easy to leave and pull your salary up to the going market rate.
Yeah it might not. But that was not my point lol I was just saying people might get jealous.
So you can sit in your little office and seethe over people who make more money than you? LOL
Off topic but it's always nice to meet a fellow Son of Tanavast in the wild.
And also why job hopping only way to increase salary as lot of times person came into their job early .. work hard but only get the minimal bump in pay‚Ä¶ companies ain‚Äôt rushing to give out raises to competent workers either ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I have so many legacy employees at my company (we were acquired by PE) who think that just because someone has been with the company for so many years they deserve the word manager in the title and higher pay. Like no Carol, you‚Äôve been at this job for 10+ years and beside the fact that you suck at what you‚Äôre even doing, you have been doing the same thing for all 10 of those years and nothing more ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Absolutely don‚Äôt blame you if you‚Äôre the lowest-paid in your firm.
Oh I know tech sales make bank.  My neighbor is in it and makes a ton of money.
True.

My point was: when you're "in the trenches" with someone and comparing your compensation to theirs, it is very easy to overlook their contributions or skills.

Innocently or deliberately.

Edit: that's not to say there is never nepotism or favoritism.  That's a thing too.  But it's also easy to value what you do more than what others do.  Everyone driving faster than you is a lunatic, everyone driving slower than you needs to learn how to drive sort of deal.
This has never been true. Work hard, you stay in same position.
That‚Äôs true. But it‚Äôs just as easy to get bumps and bonuses for being shit at your job.
that is an opinion piece and doesnt debunk anything
First paragraph explains the majority of the dispersion and one reason why we have seen it come closer in recent years.

Second paragraph you‚Äôll lose many people, including me. Baseless statement.

I do tax at a public firm with a large number of wealthy 1040 clients and one of the worst parts of the job is just how many career paths it illuminated that pay so, so much better than this one.

If I could do it all over again, I'd sell cars.
No poor thinking. Unless you actually wanted to be a doctor. 

It‚Äôs what 250k in loans on the low end and at least 7 years post grad
Isn‚Äôt that payrolls job?
Depends on the size of the company. I work in a medium size PA firm with over 4000 employees. Even in a relatively larger company like this, if they posted salaries in any usable way like including position and location but just excluding PII I would be able to infer pretty easily what specific people that I work with are making.  I would at most have to parse through a few dozen different data points for each position. Then it becomes a privacy issue for those who don‚Äôt want their info out there. It would be an even bigger issue at smaller organizations. Only at the largest company would there be enough data points for people‚Äôs privacy to be protected while just posting all the salaries with the names scrubbed.
>Job positions should have their pay bands posted combined with years of experience.

if you want that then you should work in bureaucracy, i.e. for the government

it's a step ladder there because that is how a bloated inflationary slow moving barge institution works
Too much work. The firm I‚Äôm at just pays hourly and it would be trivially easy calculate anyone‚Äôs hourly wage by checking their charge-out rate and dividing by the company multiplier.

Keeps em honest
#BASED AND ABSOLUTE UNIT PILLED
So how would I explain to the employees that the company officers were getting large year end bonuses but the employees are only getting a 1% raise?
Apprenticeship programs should exist in every state in the Union and the states should help unions fund those programs. It‚Äôs a great alternative for someone who might not want to go to college or even a kid that does. Have them come full force into our schools to help recruit people for them and would give states the money to have stuff like wooodshop back in schools like they used to.
Yes, it's definitely not presented as much of an option in early schooling. At least, I don't recall that being the case. I have no family in the trades, myself. My father was an Accountant and my Mother never worked.

Reddit definitely helped me figure out what I had to do to get into the program and, even then, it took 2 years to get on my first job. 

I had to dig into it on my own. 

State Licensing requirements are one thing. Getting into a Union Apprenticeship is another. Every local likely approaches recruitment with some small variation but, generally, I imagine it's as simple as knocking on the right door. 

The overall attractiveness of the job, and what is required to do it, really depends on your home state.
Not really, once unions grow to a certain scale it‚Äôs just another entity needing to make money on your labor. Instead of a (made up numbers). 30/70 split (employee/company) it goes to 25/20/55 split (employee/union/company). ‚ÄúUnions pay better‚Äù, yeah but how much is a USA Union built car versus a non union built car.
Huh?
Currently looking for a better paying one, until then, i am sticking with this
No, because I'm nosey.

Unfortunately the only way to really understand a person's contribution is to walk in their shoes for a month or more. We once had an asst controllers who didn't seem to do a lot. I had to cover for him one month and I can say with absolute certainty that he was compensated fairly.
If you learn new skills and your employer doesn't promote you, leave for a promotion with your new skills.
It literally cited studies. This is a link from the article.

https://journals.aom.org/doi/full/10.5465/amj.2017.1497
Just be sure to pick your head up from time to time and learn as much as you can. Get those soft skills and communication skills as tight as possible. 3-4 years there can be like 6-8 of experience in most corporate environments if you're pretty smart in managing the experience.

While I don't miss the hours I do miss being able to have high expectations for most people I work with. I need to be a lot more patient now üôÇ. Good luck.
It was on goingconcern
According to the guys over in /r/askcarsales it‚Äôs busy season all year. That‚Äôs a hard pass for me, having just finished 4 70-80 hour weeks in a row. 

On the bright side, they also say they will hire almost anyone, no special skills, experience or education.
Optometrists, yowza.
Therapist. LSW, private practice.  Make very good money and dumb AF.  Realtors and mortgage brokers too
Like, car salesmen or own a dealership?
It was a joke, I don‚Äôt enjoy the company of sick people. They whine too much.
$250k? Maybe at a school in the Bahamas. You‚Äôre looking at closer to $500-$700k at a decent school
why? it‚Äôs not like I wanted to be an accountant and I still became one.
Pay shouldn't be a privacy issue when scrubbed of your personal information. It's a communication thing and is for the benefit of all the workers. The whole not talking about how much we get paid only benefits the company and actively hurts the employee. 

There is literally no reason anyone should be upset about talking about how much they make. Their co-workers knowing how much they make is not something we should be concerned with. Because if someone is making way more or way less, that is information that should be available for salary bargaining.
my org was way smaller than 4000 people, maybe 2500 and they have this. what exactly do you think is going to happen?
This wouldn't be a problem if they paid everyone the same aka fairly... So me entering a company doesn't come in 20k higher than someone who worked there from the start. 

Nobody would mind their salary being posted if it was public anyway because they know your position/experience. 

Not talking about salary's benefits only the employer!
You make it sound like having more transparency for workers when it comes to salary negotiation is a bad thing.

Salary should be required to be posted on job listings and available to employees for salary negotiation. How anyone can argue against that is wild...
I hate being hourly myself. If I run slightly late, have a doctor‚Äôs appointment or whatever I have to rearrange my entire schedule to make sure I still get the pay check I need. Plus hourly requires employers to pay 1.5 times after 40. Well what if I needed you to work 60 hours 2 months of the year but only 20 the rest of the year. Would you want 2 months of great pay checks but then struggle to survive after? Or level it out? Plus it makes budgeting easier on everyone. 

I‚Äôm not saying likening hourly is bad, it‚Äôs just I see more advantages with a salary program.
Huh?
Raises would be based on how well you performed on your hours. The end goal would be to never be to raise employee expected hours but if they bring value to the company then they could see an increase in salary. Think of the salary as a minimum expected input for the employee and if you give more than the expected input you get a bonus to match your efforts for this scenario. You could have a $100k base salary but that increase the minimum amount of work you have to do. Or you could take a $60k base salary still have the option of earning $100k plus or you can enjoy more PTO. Managers would be paid on team performance (quality/timeliness), employee retention/satisfaction, and contribution to team goals (hours billed and such). Managers goals would be to utilize their team, train, and organize designated projects. The only executives would be me and my job would be to utilize the managers, train, and organize the company. I would expect my paycheck to reflect the amount of work I provide to the company. Ideally the rest would be in assets to hedge against unstable times.
Oh absolutely, granted tech schools have stepped in to fill the training gap a bit, but still...I'm all for them and we need to encourage more apprenticeship based unions especially as more and more employers are dropping degree requirements.¬†
Exactly, kids who want a college degree aren‚Äôt expected to do anything but look up what the reason are on the website. They‚Äôre expected to figure out what doors to knock on to get their piece of paper.
You‚Äôre talking like the union can‚Äôt scale and adapt like other entities can.

Also, what is the price difference between union built and non-union built cars?
Ok, bootlicker
> Huh?

a union is when laborers talk to each other and agree on a set minimum price for their labor to sell
That's why I'm an accountant.
And incredibly vain, jealous, overall mentally weak. LOL
Hmph.
Yeah someone already did this. You‚Äôre late like your 3% raise LOL
I just started re-reading book 4 this week
ill wait for you summarize that study since you clearly read it and didnt just dump it on me to discredit
yeah sales is a funny thing, but it's generally just being able to make personal connections very fast and leverage those into convincing people to spend money. you don't need an MBA for that

sometimes it's low stress like a department store where customers literally come in and ask you to sell them what they're looking for, and sometimes it's high stress like convincing a marine boot his signing bonus easily covers the down payment and his combat pay from going on deployment in 6 months will help him pay off his 25% APR earlier, plus the car won't depreciate while it's sitting in a long term base lot and he's getting his ass shot at in Iraq
They will hire anyone because something like 90% of car sales man quit before 90 days is up.

Those guys putting down the massive money are statistically extremely rare and even they have months where they make relatively weak money.
Realtor is a trophy wife job.

This is anecdotal because I only do taxes for like 8 realtors but every single one of them is attached to some guy making $300k/year or more
Yes.

The salesmen pull in a healthy 6 figures, the managers a much healthier 6.  I shudder to think how filthy rich the dealership owners are.
lol!!
Not true. Lots of good state medical schools that are much less

Edit: here is a example of a good one https://www.utmb.edu/enrollmentservices/resources/studentaccounts/som-school-of-medicine-fee-sheet-details
Some med school are like 5-700k if you factor in opportunity cost of lost wages. The actual tuition can be 250k a year.
You and anyone else - whether I work with or not - aren‚Äôt entitled to know what I make. 

As a CPA You‚Äôre a professional, not some pipe fitter or electrician who can expect to be in a non managerial position for a large chunk of your career. 

Stop acting like it makes any sense for people who spend maybe 5-6 years of a ~40 year career to be in a union while paying dues compared to the clusterfuck it would create by essentially crippling the public accounting industry. 

Get your experience, and then take that experience and go earn. This idea that life is a conveyor belt is a little preposterous. 

If you don‚Äôt like it, the government is hiring.
Because salary bands are either a) so wide as to be useless, or b) so narrow as to limit the talents you can have. They also aren't particularly calculable - there's no "formula" or such for pay given qualifications, experience, tenure, education, results, etc. If you find a wunderkind, either in the hiring process or as they grow in the company, it makes sense to pay them more outside of the pay bands
because a bid/ask market isn't something you look up on a spreadsheet; the fact that some minority of people whine about "transparency" is evidence that no one knows how the economy works and is illiterate in this sense

when you whine enough, then you get what you have now...a pay range that is wide enough to fit an aircraft carrier through; good job social justice warriors!

labor bids, and those needing labor give an ask...this goes back and forth until they agree on a price

in very high volume labor areas, this bid/ask is very tight/small and it is easy to figure out what the prevailing wage is

there are dozens of factors and variables that go into a final wage/salary; Unions attempt to tighten the bid/ask, and this benefits new hires while screwing established labor...you can't have your cake and eat it too...you can be equally poor as everyone else, or actually negotiate based on your value, merit, experience, etc.

what a revolutionary concept, even for a 'waffle brain'
In a well run hourly system you simply bank your Overtime to pull out at your discretion. Doctor‚Äôs appointment? Pull an hour.

I usually end up banking 300-400 hours every tax season. And we also get 2-3 weeks of use it or lose it Flex Time per year.

I get paid the same base hourly rate every month and can pull out whatever OT I want on top of that.

Being paid hourly is great
I think they like what you said.
According to JD Power the 2023 Toyota Tacoma average selling price was $35,038 and the 2023 Chevy Colorado $38,660. Doesn‚Äôt sound like a substantial difference until you think about the quality of the Tacoma compared to a Chevy Colorado. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to unions as much if they actually had union workers as the board instead of corporate executives.
I  too am a bootlicker

Unions can truly burn
Okay. You don‚Äôt need a union to talk to your coworkers.
I‚Äôm seeing a while lot more mental weakness in your comments lolol
Are you okay?
Imagine being such a cuck that sharing salaries to get fair compensation is considered weak. Oh wait, I don‚Äôt have to imagine, that‚Äôs you! üòÇ 

I can hear you now, *gargle gargle gargle* ü§£
Found the boss who posted the salaries and is mad he did it!

(Serious note: pay transparency shouldn't remotely scare an employer that pays their employees fairly.  If it DOES scare you, it's probably because you don't pay your employees fairly.)
You deserve every downvote
Too bad my 15% raise came instead
I've got to give #4 another read through....I didn't much care for it on the first pass but want to give it another shot. I think the story is just expanding a bit too fast for my silly brain to keep up with haha.
Dude, they're linking a source from the original article that you dismissed as an opinion piece.
I feel like those Marines come in more willing to buy than those shoppers in department stores. Not much convincing needed
I'd agree for some.   I have a few that do great
Or how much in direct distributions they made off of PPP loans on top of valuations of used and new cars causing for record profits through covid...which also happened to be the primary driver for consumer price inflation.....
what an unhinged rant that was in no way related to the comment above lol
Electricians are professionals. I'd way rather own an successful electricians company than a successful accounting company, they make way more than us.
fuck the public accounting industry
> As a CPA You‚Äôre a professional, not some pipe fitter or electrician who can expect to be in a non managerial position for a large chunk of your career. 

So apparently tradesworkers don't run their own businesses... or manage work crews... or manage projects.

> You and anyone else - whether I work with or not - aren‚Äôt entitled to know what I make. 

Why not? We are all workers. If we all know how much each other makes, we can compare work requirements and actually get paid fair wages.

> Get your experience, and then take that experience and go earn. This idea that life is a conveyor belt is a little preposterous. 

What in the fuck are you even on about...
‚ÄúPaying union dues‚Äù someone has no idea how little those actually are, especially when considering the higher salaries union members make

Lol you can't have it both ways. 

>  there's no "formula" or such for pay given qualifications, experience, tenure, education, results, etc

There doesn't have to be a formula. Businesses set their pay levels. Stop making excuses for companies that can't do the bare minimum. 

> If you find a wunderkind, either in the hiring process or as they grow in the company, it makes sense to pay them more outside of the pay bands

Which never happens. Companies find those people and exploit them. I know several people like this in the engineering field. They do the work of multiple people above their pay grade and get passed over for promotions consistently because promoting them would disrupt the business. 

Stop making excuses for shitty businesses. Telling your workers what they can expect to be paid is literally the bare minimum they can do. If you do truly find someone who is amazing, give them a yearly bonus. You act like this is so tough.
Lmao, so many unhinged rants in here that sound exactly the same. Like they‚Äôre reading a script.
> the fact that some minority of people whine about "transparency" is evidence that no one knows how the economy works and is illiterate in this sense

What does the economy have to do with businesses deliberately obfuscating worker salaries? 

> when you whine enough, then you get what you have now...a pay range that is wide enough to fit an aircraft carrier through; good job social justice warriors!

This really shows how little you know. Most jobs don't even post job salary ranges in the job posting. It's not legally required in most states. So unless you work in one of the few that do require it or a government, odds are you are going into interviews blind. 

Bottom line, posting salary expectations in a job posting prevents wasted time for both employee and employer. I don't want to go through weeks of back and forth for interviews and emails, only to be offered a laughable wage. 

> in very high volume labor areas, this bid/ask is very tight/small and it is easy to figure out what the prevailing wage is

Okay, so they should be posting that on the job listing. That is not a wild concept. 

> there are dozens of factors and variables that go into a final wage/salary

Every company sets out a max and minimum salary for any job posting. These numbers are known well in advance of an interview. So why are they not posted... 

> Unions attempt to tighten the bid/ask, and this benefits new hires while screwing established labor...you can't have your cake and eat it too

And union workers consistently get paid more consistent wages and raises than the rest of society. What are you even arguing? I didn't bring up unions...

> you can be equally poor as everyone else, or actually negotiate based on your value, merit, experience, etc.

OR we could actually post salary ranges for positions on a job posting so people know what they are working with.

> what a revolutionary concept, even for a 'waffle brain'

Lol dude goes on a completely unhinged rant and then attacks my intelligence because I have a meme in my flair. How are you doing boomer?
I mean if it works for you that‚Äôs great. Personally I hate having to track exactly when I show up and leave work
What are the quality differences in the Toyota Tacoma and the Chevy Colorado?

I know that with regular preventative maintenance, the Toyota Tacoma can run for 200k+ miles. I haven‚Äôt heard the same about Chevy Colorado.

In fact, it seems like the Tacoma is a much more popular truck so the consumer is willing to pay extra for a US Union made vehicle with the overall build quality being a factor in it
What do you have against the trades like electricians/carpenters?
Bros just mad he drives an Acura instead of an actual luxury car :(
Pay should be equal for all
Wait you guys are getting raises?
Oh, so do I, one pulled in close to $200k last year in gross revenue, but she married a guy making 4
‚ÄúNo one would know what you make and even if they did pay has nothing to do with privacy and you should be grateful because it benefits the working class‚Äù makes zero sense in a subreddit based on a career that generally ends up in management within less than a decade.
Gotta love it right?
Electrician wouldn‚Äôt fall under the definition of Professional Services. 

Of course on average a business owner will make more than most, but if we actually compare accounting firm partners, even in smaller firms c There is no comparison to the highest paid CPA‚Äôs. 

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being an electrician, you‚Äôve either misread or are  purposefully being facetious. 

there‚Äôs far more electricians that will likely never see any kind of management position compared to accountants. Which was my original point you ignored for some reason.

The fact you call it an ‚Äúaccounting company‚Äù is telling of what you actually know though.
They are all effectively the same person. Some older person who thinks bootlicking is what we all should do and that companies are the masters. 

Seriously, anyone who is arguing against more transparent salary ranges and expectations is completely out of their mind. There is no world where having that information is bad for workers.
what does me not liking unions have to do with electricians and carpenters?   


As a matter of fact, unions make add a layer of bureaucracy for people to enter these trades. I  have tradesmen family that live in California and all the stories a hear are them having to apply for an apprenticeship and waiting years before even getting a call back. During those years they see family and friends of union reps getting called back as soon as they apply. Unions are rife with nepotism, favoritism and racism.   


They can absolutely burn
I drive yo momma
Switch firms. People who don‚Äôt lateral get left behind, it‚Äôs unfortunate buts it‚Äôs truly the reality. You want to make money? Play the game and demand your worth. Some firm will absolutely pay it.
I've got a mortgage broker that made $300k on a W2 and never noticed there was $0 federal tax being withheld.  And needs to go on a payment plan.

Somehow put exempt on her W4 for her new employer and they never questioned it.
you have literally quoted nothing. That quote is nowhere in the comment you have replied to. are you seeing things?
You sound incredibly vain, jealous, and mentally weak. LOL
I would if the benefits package wasn‚Äôt so great
Please put down your knives
Yes, I too am tired of all the fake gurus, all the scammers, all the course/indicator/strategy sellers, and all the wannabes that claim infeasible performance strats.

Yes, every time I read that someone made 10% in 1 month, I too think that they just got lucky and there's no way it's sustainable.

It's right to be skeptical of everything - I get it.

-- --


But please put down your knives.

Every time a real algotrader on this sub discovers a little edge, feel happy and proud, and try to share their little joy in this sub, they get attacked to oblivion.

All they're trying to do is share their happiness, bounce off ideas, get a healthy discussion and perhaps learn something new.

Instead, all they end up doing is defending themselves while trying to explain that they're not claiming to have found the holy grail.

Chill out guys - let's at least try to make this a calm and rational place where people can have healthy discussions. Please put down your knives.

Thanks :)
Yup, this is another side of trading that is seldom talked about: the over-skepticism.

‚ÄúIt works until it doesnt‚Äù

‚ÄúCongrats you will be a billionaire in 5 years‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got lucky‚Äù

‚ÄúThe past 5 years was a bull market, anyone who went long would have been profitable‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are big institutions who spent millions in infrastructure and hiring the best PhDs in the world, retail traders like you dont stand a chance‚Äù

These people are just parroting generalized statements with no constructive criticisms about the strategy posted by OP. Pointless really.
It's all in our hands. Let's downvote unhealthy criticism or hateful comments
How could someone introduce something without being grilled? What are you‚Äôre suggestions?
It doesn't make sense for someone to post on Reddit about their profitable strategy. If they eventually start making money, they'll disappear from Reddit.

People who post about it have something to gain by sharing it.
Spot on homie. 

I'm 3 years in and >2M tx/year.. and 4-5 users on this sub ate me alive last time I tried to post that I ended up deleting it.

Like, I wouldn't call myself JS yet, but at the same time I had tried to bring some stories from the field, and got a similar slap.

Heck even below someone has a pitchfork out against me for no reason. My deleted post: https://imgur.com/a/qC2zRNV had no shills in it.. but damn some people are toxic.
Take this post for example - https://old.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1ga5wbp/you_should_never_test_in_production/

Dude just shared his personal experience, and even himiself admitted that his strat doesn't really scale

> *It has literally been side pocket money. It is not a proper machine that can even take all of my capital, lol. I could probably make more cash, in absolute terms, running a sausage sizzle each weekend ü§£ü§£.*

But the comment section is trying to rip him a new one with shit like *"this Australian scammer"* and *"76% a month would turn 20k into 15 billion in just 2 years"*.


Chill out guys.
Can i keep my gigantic fork?

I will usually say "give up" to people who try to rehabilitate the internet. But maybe i hope this sub can do better.
I wrote a post sharing my joy and excitement of having found an edge in two separate occassions--before 2020 and during the early cv19 era. In both times, I was treated with positivity, with only a few expressing criticism. I was approached by many via pm asking me to share more.

I've also seen many other posts by others that were mostly responded with positive messages over the years.

The general reactions depend on what you share. If you share the result of obviously flawed backtest or ideas that are obviously not gonna work but you enthusiastically write like you've found a real edge, you tend to be met with generally negative responses, and understandably so.

Over time, I have learned to neither share about my progress nor respond to posts sharing about a potential edge one has discovered whether the edge is likely to actually exist or is likely just a result of flawed testing--as I realized I do not get anything out of it by doing so. (edit: typos)
Unfortunately the people you are targeting with this message, will either not read your text, or not apply it if they read it. 

It is obviously evil to scam, but the issue doesn‚Äôt only stem from scammers, it also come from the scammed.

There is no scammer if there is no room for a scammed to exist. These scams work because many people believe in them and get tricked. It‚Äôs an arbitrage on illiteracy/naiveness/agreeableness and few other features including ‚Äúdesire for quick wealth‚Äù
Because the ones who know, know. Trading in itself is a pipedream sold to the masses to steal your money. You can‚Äôt predict price movements that‚Äôs just the truth. No algo or strategy you have will give you consistent returns enough to make you rich over time, that is just the reality.

You can make money from trading but it has to be based on the fact that it‚Äôs all random and unpredictable, so you just capture the outliers and keep your losses small. That‚Äôs also another thing, in order to win you need to lose, everyone is fixated on just being right and having control, when in reality you have no control over anything. No pattern or behaviour you find yourself being infatuated with is going to make you rich. There is no edge, there no control, there is no secret. This is how I started profiting consistently once I let go and accepted it. No prediction no control.
When I posted an idea and did not get flamed I knew I was onto something! ;)
Ya it‚Äôs a though space. Literally posted my whole setup with my live account that had made 6 figures and the mods removed the post after 100+ comments. So much for trying to share experiences.
It happened to me the other day.

The main "critic" was someone who never contributes to the sub, but is heavy into DnD, and Pokemon.

Yesterday I posted a sensitivity analysis on the same idea, and the main "critic" was one with an ad hominem along the lines  of "It's not what you say, it's how you say it, and you are breaking rule #2" and blocked me immediately so I could not respond, so he got the top comment for some reason.

Since there is no 100% novel idea on Wall Street, when people see something similar to what they are doing, they are feeling seen and are desperate in disparaging the idea and the author, hoping that "their edge will persist" and no one will start trading in this way. Then there are real trolls who will do shit for giggles, a lot of clueless lurkers, and finally there are the scammers,

So if you post, know that you will get brought down by the combined negativity of all these groups of people.

I have since deleted my posts and no longer plan on posting.

Love r/algotrading, keep on keeping on.
Yeah such an issue with the internet. People just trying to prove they're cool and smart by being rude
One of the things I dislike about this hobby is that there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anyplace with a good community that wants to talk shop.

It seems like it‚Äôs always either super negative, scammy get rich quick types, or just completely dead.
Some people are pro athletes and some are not. I know someone who turned 1K into over 2m+. Lot's of luck but the first 100k wasn't really.
Agreed. There's a lot of good that happens here and I'm extremely grateful for all I've learned and all the help I've received, but, without talking about any specific posts, there is also a negative vibe in general that I don't think helps anyone.
I get your perspective OP. But, the thing is, it might attract certain sarcasms fro sure, but he/she would get lots of blind areas addressed and if it were upto me, I'd want people to hurt my ego than my algo hurting my account.
Well. If you look at it, it's better for the trader to get a reality check here before they lose their money. Worst case, they validate themselves and leaves with more confidence then they came with.


¬† Otherwise they see the error of their process by getting peer reviewed and save themselves grief and financial loss.¬† Doing it the hard way is the right way.¬†


If you cannot survive the scrutiny of the question, maybe you are not ready to put your money in it.
i really want to make a post to this sub one day. the information I've gathered from here has helped me tremendously in building my trading bot. even if it's just a 'thank you' post to everyone for offering their advice.
Why would anyone share their successful strategy? It will only lead to more competition if many people know it quickly and you won't get any returns. It's like giving away your business strategy to your competition. 

Only ones who sell are the ones who wants to make money by selling courses saying that they are profitable,  or who think their strategy won't yield consistent returns in future.

Happy to know I'm wrong if you have any rational reason.
I‚Äôve seen that happen a lot. People respond with comments like ‚Äúscammer‚Äù or ‚Äúfake results.‚Äù Many are unhappy and envious, unable to accept that someone has managed to develop a successful algorithm. Creating an algorithm with an edge is no easy task, especially one that outperforms most traders. It takes years of hard work and experience. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs just how people are, not just here but in other communities too. Instead, we should congratulate them and use it as motivation to improve our own trading. Take my experience, for example. This guy, jerry_farmer, shared his algo trading results, and he‚Äôs really killing it. At the time, my algo was making about 4.5% per month with a maximum drawdown of -4%, while his was doing 5-10% with a max drawdown of -3%. I replied, expressing how impressed I was. I wasn‚Äôt angry at him, but at myself for being too comfortable and not pushing harder to improve my algo. I didn‚Äôt sleep for a couple of nights until I figured things out, and now my algo is performing much better. I‚Äôm extremely proud of the results I‚Äôm getting now.
I think you are overfitting
There Are algos out there which Work since decades and are really simple.
For example the buy thursday sell friday evening gold rush strategy. Or that us markets rise at the end of month.
Tuesday turnaround.
Simple strategies that Work, well known and everyone can use it.

Algos dont need to be complicated. U dont need that single edge that no others have to make Money.

And also simple EMA strategies could Work very well in higher time frames.
They dont generate signals every day but thats ok.
I built some trading indicators for myself and then tried to sell and was harassed. I didn‚Äôt promise anything, just offered tools that help to automate market analysis. I use them everyday in my analysis. I offered free trial so that people could try. Put a ton of work in building these indicators but people want everything free and don‚Äôt want to think but have a button to they click to get rich. To be a good carpenter one need to master different skills but tools help optimize work processes. I agree when people sell promises without any proof it is bad. But some people sell some knowledge that reduce your time learning some stuff. So you pay for optimization. A person need to think critically. I purchased few tutorials in trading. I didn‚Äôt become rich but I got exposed to things I was not aware before. Indicators are just tools. Would a carpenter say that about a hammer.
Anyone making 10% a month ‚Ä¶ every month‚Ä¶. Would have more money than Elon.  Blackrock would buy it for all the monies.
It‚Äôs really not the +10% in 1 month success that people are skeptical over, it‚Äôs the aftermath. 
If said system returns -10% the next month and +10% after that, then repeats pattern over the rest of the year. 

You get a -5.9% result independent of funding cost. 

This is why we all should be skeptical of one time results. 
Give us how many trades over a few years in combination. 
That‚Äôs a real portfolio for evaluating. ü§î
‚ÄºÔ∏èThank you, I‚Äôve never felt more attacked than on Reddit for just simply sharing my strategies. Not only do I provide skeptics with a trial so they verify but ai also link to so many different resources and logs and proof. But nobody checks they even physically threaten me üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Cant blame them for their initial reaction considering how many copy-pasted scam strategies there are, but nobody bothers to even look at my website trustpilot discord etc‚Ä¶ I meam come on it takes a minute and something like 10/20% a month isn‚Äôt ijf
RSA has me up 1000% my investments üôÇüôåüèª
[deleted]
Yeah I deleted my past comments here.  I have a successful algo, posted some stats about it in one of those "how is everyone doing" threads, and was bombarded for days by a mix of people in my replies and DMs who were either super angry for no reason or begging for handouts.  There were maybe two people who were there to talk shop.
Facts
Agreed if you don‚Äôt like it downvote it
Maybe just accept that this is internet where grilling will be forever. And simply ignore worthless grillings?
I actually tried this before, just wanted to share what I'd found in case it could help somebody. Wasn't looking for anything in return, but man....it elicited lots of hateful comments. 

So why share if no one wants it? I'm still trying to share it....but not on Reddit anymore, it's just a wasteland of negativity. 

And this is what we're feeding into our AI models. If our future AI overlords are extremely negative and hateful it'll be because we trained them to be so.
True. Those who got no strategy (no Alpha/Edge) post details/info and those who actually got the real thing would be a moron to talk about it.

Make sense people are salty and sceptical as less than 5% will get anywhere with trading in general, including algo trading and systematic trading.
Is this really true? SSRN.com is full of academics posting profitable strategies. You can post about replicating or tweaking these strategies if they are profitable. I enjoy reading about data driven strategies that are based on academic research.
you were shilling your signal service and Discord though
I like your home lab setup
all i can say you did well Sir...huh why sir because you earned my respect you worked hard and achieved that i never could.
I mean: Every time someone posts something like this WHILE ADVERTISING A PAID COURSE IN HIS PROFILE THAT COSTS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, it leaves a very weird and sour taste in my mouth.

You know as well as i do that this was intentional product placement.
I think you are right about the point about "low capacity" returns though. That is a frequent misunderstanding about the nature of what returns are possible or not.

But my bigger point still stands. Such courses are almost always content with public knowledge and not wort thousands... it is a borderline scam imo.
I could of not said it better.
I agree with what you're saying, but how do you consistently win ie more than you lose over a long period of time? Learning to identify the outliers and risk management basically?
Would you like to share it again with me? 
If you're not okay with it, I don't want the full setup but general idea of what was the setup (what it aims, breakouts/reversal)
 what kind of tools/indicators you used
What was his medium? Options?
More details pls, it was in options.?
Eagerly waiting for your post :)
If you're selling your indicator, then it is simply useless. If it was useful, you would be using it yourself.

Anyone trying to sell a trading course/indicator/strategy is basically a scammer.
You're clearly selling starts on your website. Maybe you can start by not scamming people in the first place?


Why would you sell your strategies if they make 20% a month?
Do you have a stick up your ass? Everything said has to be condescending and attacking? You should be ashamed, disgusted, seeking therapy that you try to inflate your ego by pissing on people online.
lets face it those people who were angry or bagging were losers in the market, they cant figure it out.They like little regressed kids.They will never make it in fact if they knew what it takes to become profitable consistently...this aint a serious forum for discussion, some nuggets but this game wants ones blood unless we stumble on something hidden.
Wrong user? I don't partake in either
I totally agree! Anyone selling a trading course is pretty much certainly a scammer.

The issue is people shoot you down even though you're just trying to discuss and learn.
Catch the big moves that are happening in real time without any prediction, outliers. 

Example- enter everyday on SPY open 30 mins in enter direction of the market, perhaps open price as reference. Tight sl, hold till close. Results in ~25% wr and an average rr of 6, (which makes sense since when you look at the average daily returns % for spy since 1979, ~2500 days/11,000 have exceeded +-0.8%).
Maybe now you get it. 

Given the inherent randomness and Brownian motion of price movement, trying to predict is fundamentally impossible. All these people here will never achieve long term profitability because they want to try control the outcome of their trade. They think if they just find that price prediction strategy can work through every market condition they‚Äôll become rich. Reality is, if you‚Äôre not willing to lose, you‚Äôll never win, and they want strategies that win. If you want consistency, the only way for that to happen long term, is to not predict anything and to have tight risk management. Price prediction is an illusion. Aligning yourself with randomness isn‚Äôt. Direct exposure to volatility via CFDs/future derivatives is the most efficient way. Options maybe a hand ful per year but that‚Äôs it. (Options way have more complexity and factors that make the odds even worse for you, like the decay and expiration, gamma etc). They give roughly the same RRs anyway. 

End of the day if you don‚Äôt have privileged info the market doesn‚Äôt already have, you have nothing else to use aside from capture the asymmetric returns of equities via Volatility of the open (if day trading). Anything else is just a bad speculation based on no actual objective behaviour or analysis. (Unless you have intrinsic information that that market doesn‚Äôt)

That‚Äôs just my approach anyway, but it‚Äôs centred on reality and observed statistical analysis. As the saying goes, everything works until it doesn‚Äôt. This entire sub is delusion, just like all the other trading subs. They have no idea. Trying to seek certainty in uncertainty and they wonder why it never works out. I would know because I used to be the same.
Stocks and Crypto, TA using [WB](https://wealthbranch.com/leaf/strategies/)
Mostly asymmetrical trades found using [screeners](https://wealthbranch.com/leaf/strategies/)
But there is one genuine reason why someone would sell their trading indicator or bot: Raise trading capital. I myself lost a lot of money in the currency market trying to figure things out with algo trading. Out of 30 trading bots that I developed over the period of three years, only the last one proved to have an edge in the markets and made consistent profits. It uses simple statistical modeling. But by the time I figured it all out, I ran out of optimal trading capital and I had to sell licenses of my trading bot that very few people bought. I am kinda stuck now without sufficient capital for trading. But I get your point. Fake gurus and scammers have made it tough to trust people.
nope, definitely you.

You got called out so you had to delete, but you were definitely shilling the paid services.
Could you share now?
Thank you for explaining. Much appreciated
Using just shares? That‚Äôs a little hard to believe. Are you associated with WB?
Lmao delusional. You can‚Äôt scrape together $1k? What are the returns on your strategy?
Not on either side, but some proof would be welcome
My deleted post was in June about exchanges, nothing to do with signals. 

https://imgur.com/a/qC2zRNV

You got your hate aimed at the wrong dude, that any of the archiving sites shows immediately my deleted posts weren't a shill
Not sure what's hard to believe, if you know how to trade. People would rather stay poor and lose money than learn or read. I can't help them. 

I love WB, I use to code pinescript. Don't really have to do much anymore after I learned how to use it.
I already have such small capital. May sound unbelievable, but around 35% returns per annum is what is possible, however if I manage to withdraw at the end of the year and use compounding (by letting the lot size grow as the account balance grows), I can make around 60% per annum. I have a lot of personal commitments and my source of income is irregular, hence I would need at least 10k dollars to make my life better. I stay away from taking loans (yes, I am risk averse. What if my strategy suddenly loses it's edge) and I avoid funded accounts (as most of them are scams). Hence decided to sell licences to my very own trading bot, but not much sales. Not going to blame anybody though. That's how life is üòÄ
That guy is a dickhead, disregard
You made a post 5 days ago that literally asks: ‚ÄúWhat are the best trading tips that actually work?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt buy that your friend turned 1k into 100k without luck, then proceeded to flip it into 2M with a little luck involved. Especially with just shares. I‚Äôm not even going to bother thinking about the % return, because it‚Äôs ludicrous. I can only assume you‚Äôre associated with WB and are shilling their services.
That's like you saying because you can't play a sport, pro athletes don't exist üò™

As far as I can tell wb is free ü§£
So are you in any way associated with wb? Are you the creator, do you know the creator, do you have any interest in promoting them at all? Or are you just a guy off the street who happened to come across them one day?
In a masters program and the entire recruiting class just got this email‚Ä¶
This valid or not?
PwC on FB has an entire spreadsheet with salaries on it across all service lines and positions lol. Hilarious to think that it‚Äôs unprofessional to share salary data when professional are consistently doing it for pay transparency purposes.
Sharing salary information is perfectly legal as far as I know, not sure if there is some exception for offer letters as I'm not an expert but it doesn't sound right
Holy fuck, even the people teaching want to suppress salaries of the next generation, Accounting is a fucking sham
Tldr

*Please don't ask for fair compensation based on your peer data.*
How is he able to lead a lecture with corporate America's dick in his mouth?
Funny, because every business I buy from tells me the price. When I'm selling my time to my employer why is that supposed to be a secret?
Maybe they think the C in CPA stands for cucked
Oh. My. Goodness.

This. Is. Insane.

I think that email itself is an "act discreditable" to the profession.

"Please don't be smart, and please don't engage in legal co-operative efforts in your bargaining negotiations. We will threaten you and pretend like you are engaging in something immoral, because we like to pretend that we are a bastion of our profession, but, in reality, we are really just the 'side-chick' to the Big4. We are the Ghislaine Maxwell to their Epstein, except we also charge you tuition while pimping you out"....
They can pound sand.
Fuck that lol my entire graduating class shared our offers with each other as they came in
This is just bullying younger adults.  God forbid you stand up for yourself and pursue other firms that have a higher starting salary and better benefits.  Why do they want younger generations to put the blinders on?  Shouldn‚Äôt colleges advocate for sharing market data?  This just seems like it would create bad word of mouth for that uni.
Just an fyi...I am a university prof and a former B4 partner.

I can believe that a university pushed out this kind of a letter. B4 firms have an incredible amount of power within accounting programs and I am quite certain a senior partner at one firm asked the department chair to post this. I am pretty sure, however, that this does not represent the majority view of most B4 firms and partners.

With that said, I know lots of us are still quite content to openly agitate for better work hours and higher starting salaries for our students. If this letter was pushed out at my university, I would openly advocate for students to ignore it and share away.
Nah, fuck em dude. That's how they keep salaries low. Be transparent with your pay when you work with people, because how else will you know if you are being underpaid or not? (Of course, you can use the web to find a salary range, but if you are working with a person with similar tasks as yourself, it's good to know where you stand)
Fuck em
Name and shame
Forward it to Dean, the president of the business program and the media. 

I'm sure they'd love a story about attempted wage suppression in a time where accounting numbers are hurting.
Your program is gaslighting you. Nice.
In the US disclosing your own salary information is federally protected and in Canada it‚Äôs protected by most provinces. 

The spreadsheet (if you‚Äôre talking about big 4 transparency) is anonymous so they won‚Äôt know who shared what information. 

Sharing information is important because it helps people to identify if they‚Äôre being underpaid just because they don‚Äôt know to ask for more.

Also, screw them for thinking they can shame you into ‚Äúmaking better decisions.‚Äù Maybe firms should ‚Äúmake better decisions‚Äù by disclosing pay in job descriptions to begin with.
Isn‚Äôt salary transparency a thing in the USA, or at least in most states?¬†
Each day accounting feels more and more scummy
I swear to god accountants have to be the most spineless fucking people imaginable. And all these partners and professors and managers want to complain about a shortage but they continually refuse to promote increasing wages and wage transparency.
Reply and tell them to get bent. I‚Äôm an actual and not aspiring CPA so I‚Äôm licensed to say that
Except its not confidential information. They did not sign a CA so i dont see the problem. Except for the firms that are sending out terrible offers that the embarrassing part.
Sometimes I wonder why all you all haven't voted on a day to go on strike and done it. It's shit like this that shows the industry needs to get bent.
What a bunch of fucking bullshit
If you've got nothing to hide, you've got no reason to suppress this information.

I guarantee you the constant growth of Internet and availability sites like this have played a huge role in uncovering the truth about how exploitative this industry is towards its workers and is driving change among people with the right mindset.

They are pissed because they're powerless to stop it. The con is gone.
This notice is concerning on so many levels.

Leading global teams, I've learned that in most other countries sharing salaries is common.

I also want to say that shaming people into keeping salaries confidential is NOT limited to accounting.  I have seen this everywhere.

While it may be confidential to share someone else's salary, it is your choice to share yours.
I guess they never heard of the wage transparency act?

Anybody?
Wild! My master's program specifically sought out data from the prior year's students and gave us a document to help us set our expectations as we went into recruiting season.
They can‚Äôt stop you from doing this, but it‚Äôs naive to think there won‚Äôt be a target on your back and your offer(s) won‚Äôt be pulled for other random reasons if they find out who participated in it.
This email just gives you evidence to file against an additional party.¬†




Some of you aren't really accountants if you don't see how big settlements and judgements can get.¬†¬†




These schools are out here claiming your education will pay off in the millions. You might only get a years salary from the employer that pulls your offer, but you could get your tuition and lifetime earnings reimbursed if you can show that your university coordinated against you and worked to limit your future earnings for engaging in federally protected behavior.






¬†I just hear cash register sounds with this.¬†¬†






I would love to have an offer pulled after getting this.¬†
Yo FUCK this professor. There is nothing illegal, let alone immoral or against CPA ethics, about helping each other get fair wages.
Fuck that, dox the school. At some point we need to start tearing down the machine...
No.  Fuck this.  It would be terrible, just awful, if someone anonymously posted which school this is to let people know they are against their current students & alumni maximizing their education.

However, I would advise not to include personal info or identifiers on the spreadsheet.  If any faculty or firms get a hold of it, then they may try to use it in some manner against people listed.
It‚Äôs not illegal to discuss compensation, no personal identifiable information is being shared; no socials, no DOBs; we can discuss our benefits and salaries. This limp noodle scare tactic is a farce and should be blasted for its BS.
Not valid, 

Keep sharing. The only people this benefits are corporations so they can pay you less. Anyone else defending this is an NPC
Funny, my program asks us to share our compensation with them so they can stay up to date with salaries
Those are requests and recommendations- nothing more. Keep doing it
Strong "the rules were you weren't going to fact check" vibes.
So you can‚Äôt use internal data that is constructed as ‚Äúunprofessional‚Äù or ‚Äúclient sensitive‚Äù information. But, we can rely on ‚Äúother‚Äù external information, which may have information that was collected the same way? Interesting.
Not valid. You can share any of your personal  information as long as it's not an attempt to raise the price of a security for personal financial gain. Such as, and I'm not saying any resemblance to anyone was their intent, a famous person going off about buying a crapload of whatever crypto. 

Disclosing another person's offer while identifying them is more of a question of will that piss them off and do you care. 

Client confidentiality is an ethics and legal concept that is entirely different.
It's protected speech to discuss salaries! FUCK THIS GUY! 

I'd go to your school newspaper about this.
Interesting take. Does the sender get a kickback as an incentive to suppress the info, and prevent open competition?¬†
You should reply that ethics is also a core tenant in accounting and this letter is an unethical (and possibly illegal) attempt at bullying students. The industry is panicking because of the changes impacting the labor market (fewer candidates and remote opportunities).
Name and shame whoever sent this out
In my program the professors and administrators encouraged us to discuss our offers. WTF
The only reason this is bad is because those companies that egregiously underpay don't want you to know that you are egregiously underpaid.

Prime example, me (male) and a classmate (female) both graduated the same time with essentially the same grades. I started full-time right away, she started about a month later. I work in private not-for-profit she works at a small public firm in our area which is very LCOL. I started at $82k she started at $51k. That's a 30k difference. I feel bad for her in the sense that we both put in the time and effort but ended up being paid TOTALLY different.

Be transparent. Everyone should be paid what they are worth across the board. No more and no less
Campus recruiter here - good for yall, honestly. Salary transparency should be the standard, it can only help us all
As a professor, this really pisses me off.

Pretty please replay all with this response:

Another core tenet of accounting is compliance with the law. The law clearly states that sharing information about job offers is allowed, and any attempt to suppress that sharing is illegal.

Working with our peers to achieve our best potential salary is protected by law. "Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or **other mutual aid or protection**" 29 U.S.C. ¬ß157. The courts have upheld that employees and prospective employees are permitted to discuss wages in **NLRB v. Main Street Terrace Care Center (1997)**.

If the accounting firms, sent this email, it would be a clear violation of the National Labor Relations Act. "It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section 7" 29 U.S.C. ¬ß158(a)(1). 

While it's clear your post violates the spirit of the National Labor Relations Act, it's unclear if a university would be held liable in these circumstances. Please do no violate your students' civil rights or put the university at risk of a lawsuit.

TL;DR The professor's actions are not only bad, but likely a violation of the law.
Lol just reply big4transparency.com
WTF, what people do with¬† their salary details¬† is their own business, you just can't share others without their consent¬†
Discussing wages in a federally protected right in the USA.
There's a big difference between making client info available and personal info available. Talking about job offers with others is not unprofessional or unethical unless an NDA was part of the process.
That is totally fucked. You are legally allowed to openly talk about your salary amongst friends and even in a damn company wide meeting. The only salary information you are unable to divulge is OTHER people‚Äôs salaries if you are in a position to see that data. You‚Äôd get fired pretty fast for that. but sharing your own data amongst peers is perfectly legal. They just don‚Äôt want you to know that Beth from Kpmg was able to negotiate a much higher salary than your bum ass who started in industry.
I'd recommend bringing this up with the dean and reminding them that there is a protected right to discuss wages.
The NLRB likely will have something to say about this.

https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/your-rights-to-discuss-wages#:~:text=Under%20the%20National%20Labor%20Relations,the%20media%2C%20and%20the%20public.
This is insane. What school? I scrolled comments and couldn‚Äôt locate‚Ä¶ hope it‚Äôs not mine.
Sharing salary sounds pretty normal. Most the universities in my area publish the salaries that their co-ops and grads get. They usually present the average, top 20% and bottom 20% range separated by co-op term and masters status. I used it when I was in school and now as an employer to make sure we are competing for the better talent.¬†

¬†I wonder the concern is due to timing or possibly the specifics that were shared. They mention a sheet being circulated, maybe Tom told me his salary and I shared that info with Alice (without Tom's consent). Or possibly the timing as the hiring process for the winter term is going on right now and this is happening outside a school run matching process and causing trouble there. Or maybe it is just a situation of the school wanting to control everything. Hard to say from just the letter.

Edit - not dismissing the idea that companies are trying to suppress salaries. That possibility was thoroughly covered by others. Just thinking of other possible reasons for the letter.¬†
I went to a school that pride itself on churning out candidates for PA and they never pulled this crap.

What awful school would want to limit their scholar's salaries?
Nah, share that shit. Let the market do what it does.
Hey hey! Creator of Big4Transparency.com here, I‚Äôd be curious to know of that‚Äôs the sheet being reference here.

I‚Äôve done extensive legal checking to make sure this project was A-Okay and got thumbs up across the board.

I‚Äôd love to have a conversation to learn more about this and some of the details if you‚Äôre up for it
Update regarding the newest email since I go to this school:

‚ÄúYes, you can share details with spouses, partners, guardians, parents, and career services as you need support making your decision. This is still a very grey area, and you must trust that they will keep your personal information confidential.
 
The issue is that students are sharing details in offer letters with their peers and using exact details to leverage offers with firms. Salaries and compensation should not be discussed amongst peers/colleagues. This is simply a best practice.‚Äù
Written evidence of being asked not to discuss wages...


That was nice of them.
Like others have said, the law protects you from being fired. It doesn't guarantee you get hired.

However, the law got passed specifically to prevent wage discrimination. Anybody against that would definitely get an eyebrow raise from me.
This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúclient information‚Äù or ‚Äúemployer information.‚Äù If I used the payroll information I have access to as a way to get a higher salary, that would be unethical. But telling people how much I make isn‚Äôt an issue. I can always tell people what I make under US law and it‚Äôs silly a professor would lie to students like this. 

If he was honest and said ‚Äúemployers don‚Äôt like this being done and it could potentially harm recruiting efforts, please don‚Äôt circulate information in a public way like this‚Äù that‚Äôs very good advice. I would guess some idiot accounting student is saying ‚Äúthis spreadsheet that‚Äôs being circulated says I should be making THIS much‚Äù that comes off badly versus saying that the salary isn‚Äôt consistent with others with similar experience and credentials.
Big4transparency.com
Someone needs to reply all with the 2nd amendment and Executive order 11246.
What‚Äôs the name of the program?
What school is this?
sounds a lot like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt expose us‚Äù
Like other such emails, ignore and move on.
Wow it would be a shame if this spreadsheet were to make it onto an online community where everyone could see it‚Ä¶ hmm if one there were a way
This is just a CPA who worked in the 90s who is now a professor and is out of touch with the market because he hasn't been a part of it for 30 years.
Yeah, sharing salary information does have serious consequences‚Ä¶ in the form of better pay for everyone, which means the partners might have to settle for a second home in Big Bear instead of Aspen. This is how capitalism and a market economy works. Partners who have to raise salaries can cry me a river. It‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt have enough money already to wipe their tears.
This is stupid. Salary transparency is so important to protect your fellow accountants from being lowballed or taken advantage of, especially women/POC/etc where there might be additional bias in pay. 

I‚Äôm so grateful to the seniors at my first job for pulling me to the side to tell me their compensation numbers and giving me a ballpark of what to negotiate for - thankfully I received a very fair offer and didn‚Äôt need to negotiate.
"Serious consequences" has the same energy as "double secret probation".
Screw that. Fight the system, fight for a decent wage. Accoutning is one of those careers that‚Äôll drive you to a deep desire to suck start a 12 gauge, and with all of that, you‚Äôre often underpaid and almost guaranteed are undervalued. Your job is seen as a regulatory burden. Despised by ops for simple requests u have of them to make your life millions of times easier. First to be thrown under the bus when results aren‚Äôt what ops managers expect. Don‚Äôt let the system fuck you. Don‚Äôt let them destroy your RIGHT to share compensation information. The more informed a populous is, the better the decisions that can be made. Don‚Äôt let them continue to shaft you and your cohorts
"please dont work together to learn how we, a grouping of multinational conglomerates, are taking advantage of you, a bunch of kids." 

  
this is a side note but the implicit contract between workers and their companies flies out the window when companies A: dont pay enough B: treat you like crap C: can and will lay you off the moment its operationally and financially viable
False equivalency. These are not confidential client files, they are individuals' own personal information that they are willingly choosing to share with each other. 

Corporate management does the same thing sometimes, "don't share your salary with each other, it will cause problems." Why? Are you paying us inequitably?
They have no authority to make such a statement. I recommend forwarding this email onto your state representative with a note expressing outrage.
They have every right to find out who‚Äôs getting screwed the most by the fat cat firm.
As a lawyer, do you want representation?¬†


This is an easy win.
If this is a State funded school, professor salaries are publicly available. Some schools have it buried on their employment site, and others you have to physically review it in a library/office. Look up your professors' salaries and email it to the listserv.
We need legislation instituting standard practice of all compensation for everyone being public. There is zero benefit for anyone in society to be able to hide their income, either you‚Äôre embarrassed to be underpaid or embarrassed to be overpaid
This is employer bullshit.  It's easier for them to lowball if you if you don't know how much everyone else is making.

There's a reason pro athletes all have publicly known salaries.  It gives the players more leverage because if everyone knows what everyone else gets paid it helps the next player negotiate a fair deal.

The only reason to be against this is if you're an employer who doesn't want people having an edge in salary negotiations against you. 

  
Share away.  Posting salary ranges for positions should be a legal mandate.
Accountants are some of the biggest ass kissers

Fuck this guy. Share you salaries, you‚Äôre protected by the law
lol if workers in a workplace can discuss salaries, I‚Äôm not sure why you all can‚Äôt.
I love how they never tell you that you cant do it. Keep doing it
Lol
[removed]
Let them know that file was confidential üòÇ
Ok I‚Äôm on your side but the program might be concerned that making entry level offers public might hurt relationships between such companies/firms and your university and those companies might choose not to hire from your school anymore.
Two of the B4 in my city offered rewards for bringing payslips of competing firms to help benchmark their own salaries.

So they sure didn't believe in playing by confidentiality rules
If you work in government (at least in the USA), your compensation is already public knowledge thanks to sunshine laws, FOIA, IPRA, etc. It‚Äôs absurd that your school went to the trouble of asking you guys to stop talking about how much you‚Äôre being offered to join a company. Companies are going to pursue what makes economic sense to them, and to achieve that they will comparison shop or benchmark themselves amongst ‚Äúthe competition.‚Äù ¬†It‚Äôs absurd and naive to expect students to not share that amongst themselves.¬†


Students: be smarter about HOW you share this information.¬†
Continue to do what you‚Äôre doing and ignore the email. Nothing they can do about it. Bunch of nonsense.
That‚Äôs what Gmail is for: anonymous email ID that you can use to post to Glassdoor, et al., and all of your classmates can do the same. This is typical suck ass administrative behavior, bordering on illegal. Certainly unethical, which doesn‚Äôt surprise me about CPAs and academic administrators. Both of them are roughly on the same level of utility as the warts caused by papilloma virus.

One of you posts the spreadsheet to Glassdoor. You only give the group name to one person you absolutely trust, to minimize exposure. They pass the word to one trusted confidant, and on and on, etc. Then you can all modify the spreadsheet at your convenience.

Don‚Äôt forget to change or mask the file information and attributes before you post it. Another approach, make the group private with a non-informative name. Then you can just post the dollar amount without using files. Possibly keep the firm name out of it to enhance security.
This is horseshit. Share with those you trust and don't believe everything you read.  Professors play the big 4 game too.
I've always hated this power dynamic. Like it's illegal to retaliate on employee's sharing any salary information together; but I've been scolded for mentioning someone salary. "Our positions require a level of confidentiality and if that trust is broken, then the access to information will be cut....and if you don't have access to that information you can't properly do your job and therefore could jeopardize employment". So everyone else can freely converse but we can't, even if it's only about our own salary...Got it...
share comp info if you want to. Secrecy is used as a shield to mask pay increases for people with the "approved" class, height, weight, skin tone, reproductive organs, golfing ability, accent, etc etc etc.
Fuck that, salary transparency should be the norm. Way too much collusion between the firms to suppress salaries.

Share that spreadsheet far and wide.
It's actually ILLEGAL for employers to tell u this, and so weird your professor is either unaware or skirting this ethical matter altogether. 

Keep the spreadsheet going!!
Saying this somehow is analogous to sharing confidential nonpublic client data is quite the reach imo.

Really odd...seems like a smoke screen so they don't have to just say they polish B4 knobs all day...
That‚Äôs called scare tactics‚Ä¶.carry on
Absolutely not.

If this was your boss implying adverse action will be taken for sharing salary information, they'd be breaking the law. I'm not 100% certain that it's allowed in the context of students and professors. 

I'd be tempted to take this letter to the university ethics board and ask them if it's the university's official position.
If you‚Äôre in the US you can file a suit with the NLRB over this and they will be forced to post a letter saying the opposite and it‚Äôs illegal for them to retaliate¬†
When it comes time for alumni donation season, make sure you mention this letter. Universities are businesses and don‚Äôt give a shit about right or wrong, or even what‚Äôs best for their students. But if it starts impacting their bottom line, they might be forced to change their tune (just kidding, they probably get enough already from all the companies behind this kind of bs).
Many states have enacted salary transpiracy laws. That is, the employer is REQUIRED to show the salary ranges for specific jobs. Failure to comply can result in hefty penalties per occurrence. To retain outdated ways of thinking shows a lack of adaptability which is one of the reasons why the accounting profession is struggling.
lmao this is when you know they are trying to lowball everyone while promoting a few
This is bull. I wish I had this type of info when I was interning / starting. I wouldn‚Äôt have spent my first 3 years severely under paid
If the information was shared freely by the recipient of the offer, then its not a problem.
Fuck that. Let the people know. It‚Äôs unprofessional to claim otherwise‚Äînot to mention illegal.
Hit em with executive order 11246. It is your right to discuss your pay and inquire about the pay of others.
What a load of bullshit. IGNORE.
We want you making informed decisions.


NONONO NOT WITH THAT INFORMATION!!


and by the way, wage discussion *in* the workplace is legal and legally protected. They're trying to stifle Wage discussion among people not even there yet?
It's not confidential (to you and your right to share it) if it's your own salary! That's protected by federal law in the US!
It's actually a key tenet of anti-discrimination laws that workers be allowed to discuss their pay with their coworkers.  Otherwise, how would women, minorities, the elderly, the disabled, and other protected classes know that they are being discriminated against?

Whoever wrote this email supports discrimination.
"Under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or the Act), employees have the right to communicate with their coworkers about their wages, as well as with labor organizations, worker centers, the media, and the public." (from nlrb.gov). Seems like y'all have enough solidarity with each other to remind them via reply to this email that prohibiting people from discussing wages or threatening consequences for it is illegal, and as long as you double down as a group rather than one person alone it'll be difficult for them to get away with it
If that was me, I‚Äôd be sending an email back saying sharing salary information is completely legal.
And This is the bullshit I warn ppl about that. If anyone is thinking about goes to school for social work it isn't worth it man. You face this same bullshit in other fields but better pay and benefits if you choose correctly.

This is just the school who barely has any real reason for this. Now imagine the company you will be working for. 

Now I work at a hospital and it's decent. But if I could go back in time and choose a master level degree in nursing I'd be hitting over 100k easy.
Wow - they are desperate to keep their secrets
Fuck that.
The fear mongering is crazy
If the salary is confidential, then there should've been some security controls on it then. There weren't, because it's not a state secret, stop whining academia.
Fuck that. You have a right to make sure someone is paying you properly. How can you bargain a proper wage if you don't know what your value is?
Just in case no one else has posted this yet: [https://www.californiaemploymentlawreport.com/2022/03/right-to-discuss-pay-salary-history-bans-and-pay-equity-under-california-law/](https://www.californiaemploymentlawreport.com/2022/03/right-to-discuss-pay-salary-history-bans-and-pay-equity-under-california-law/)

Not only is it not "unprofessional", you have the RIGHT to discuss and share freely in California. It is illegal to try to silence this discussion. I hope you and the school aren't in California. This should be the norm everywhere as far as I am concerned.
Fuck whoever sent this email. That is all.
Share whatever you want assuming you didn‚Äôt sign an NDA. That said, a butthurt recruiter or manager might pull an offer if they find out.
Collective action: it's unprofessional and has serious consequences like the complete and utter shaming of those who would exploit you.  üëèüëèüëè
Fuck them.
What a stupid email lol. "Industry places a high value on confidentiality" - yeah, you can't disclose other's information without their consent. People who share their salary info are implicitly consenting to it. Good for you guys for sharing the data - there should be more transparency around salaries.
lol fck em
If your in the USA, this letter from them is illegal.
HA, no it‚Äôs not unprofessional and it‚Äôs not illegal or terms of employment considered confidential to you when it is you who are the data owner, you can share your offer details with anyone you wish.  Absolutely ridiculous

This is federally legal.  If this was an instructor, I would absolutely argue this with them, to the class, privately, and to anyone in the department, dean etc. lol wow
That‚Äôs just corporate propaganda
Was this a professor who wrote this, or a staff member for the program? Whoever wrote it should be educated as to the laws about salary confidentiality. The answer is to boost salaries, not hide them in the hopes accounting students won‚Äôt wander over to data analytics or finance. üòÇ
Fuck that. Talk to all your friends to see if you‚Äôre getting paid fairly.
Here's a response: 

As accounting professionals, we are expected to accurately and account for many things in an organization, including pay. This spreadsheet gives us a real world data set to work with and understand, and one in which we have considerable interest in the accuracy of the data and the impacts of our analysis. That sort of practical application is immensely valuable to us as students and in positioning us well in our future careers. We understand the principle of appreciation and that salary generally increases, so being able to establish as competitive a salary as possible at the beginning of our post-graduate careers means we will maximize our long term earnings. That's a good accounting practice. Second, as accountants, we are required to know GAAP and other relevant laws and regulations. The relevant regulation for individuals discussing their own salary (including job offers) is from the NLRB, which clearly states that it is illegal for employers to prohibit employees from discussing pay. If multiple employers collude to penalize candidates from discussing pay, that is even more troubling and raises concerns about cartel-like behavior.
As a Game Producer we have our own community sourced sheet of salary ranges with levels of experience at each company, totally anonymous 

Sharing your wage is 100% allowed, same with offer letters
It is a protected activity to talk about salaries in the USA, if you find yourself in a disciplinary situation for salary discussions get it in writing and contact a lawyer/board of labor.
One thing for the younger crowd: this is a behavior they want to perpetuate. It has always been a thing. 

Keep using social media to break the spell. 

Knowledge has been and always be power.
They don‚Äôt want you guys knowing you‚Äôre being underpaid, even with experiencing, race and gender differences. Suspicious.
If this company is in the US, report them to the Dept of Labor ASAP
Love all the e-lawyers saying this is illegal.

The advisor is only giving recommendations - there's nothing illegal about this at all.

If you're a company that recruits from this school and you learn the school is supporting something like this there's the possibility you stop recruiting from that school.
It's not unethical or immoral to talk about salary.
Do they think the faculty members aren‚Äôt doing the same thing?
Yeah they can fuck off
Valid in some ways, not so valid in others. While it‚Äôs legal and *should be* encouraged to share these details with coworkers (because we want to know if we‚Äôre getting fucked over) there‚Äôs also the component that companies do not like this. If PwC, for instance, decides they will no longer recruit from this masters program because of this problem, it‚Äôs not the companies that are losing out it‚Äôs the students. So I see both the students‚Äô and schools‚Äô sides on this one.

Last thought is that being right doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt get fucked over. These companies care 100x more if you‚Äôre messing with their other employees being content worker bees than missing out on one recruit who‚Äôs a slightly better than average worker bee. You should be able to share salary with no issues, doesn‚Äôt mean issues won‚Äôt come down the line. Again, the students are the ones who are losing out because of this.
This is an awesome idea! It's not like their career center doesn't already have this information. I wish my class did this not only with the PA offers, but with their industry offers as well.
I think it‚Äôs bs. It‚Äôs up to the individual offered or an employee whether or not they disclose their pay, because it largely concerns them. It isn‚Äôt the same as a clients private information. The only way this effects or concerns a business is if they want to pay their workers a little as possible, which is often lower than what they‚Äôre worth. 

This is *the* classic anti union technique. If everyone is secretive about their wages/salary then it‚Äôll be harder for workers to demand what they‚Äôre rightfully entitled to be paid. Either the accounting department at this school genuinely bought into this dumb idea their espousing, or they know the truth and would be too afraid to do this sorta thing themselves.
Booooo
The employers have to pay money to the schools to go and recruit and make offers to candidates. It doesn't make the school look great if the students are doing this stuff. You cant really blame the students though, they should have had the common sense to be more discrete about it and made sure employers/school admin didn't find out.
Not to mention certain states have legislated posting salary ranges in job openings ‚Äî

Maybe the masters program needs to be told about CPAs operating in a regulatory environment ‚Äî
Summarizing the email - Do not share anonymous peer compensation data which can be used to negotiate a fair salary.  

- Sincerely your Big 4 funded University
Isn‚Äôt the whole profession based on assurance and TRANSPARENCY?
Pretty gross email. I'd call them out
What confidential information is being leaked? Lmao, it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre sharing personal identifiers. Just a ridiculous attempt to hinder transparency amongst young professionals.
He‚Äôs legally incorrect; perhaps he should engage a discussion with his Law peers and educate himself.
Lmao what? We go to school so we can get jobs that give us money. All I care about is money when it comes to work. I want to know how much money. Are we meant to be accountants for passion? ü§£
Literally freedom of speech
They're trying to underpay people
I hope someone responds. As CPAs you can tell whoever the hell you want about your salary. Please do.
Prohibiting the sharing of salary is literally illegal. I find breaking the law more unprofessional than sharing your salary. Out the company so we know what company is ok with breaking the law and to never work for.
Keep sharing those salaries students! Get the best balance of pay and work life balance for yourself! Employers are actively trying to get you to work the hardest for the lowest price
anonymous salary data that was voluntarily shared?
It's against the law, actually. You are *legally* allowed to discuss pay.
Fuck that, it‚Äôs in my blood to do research and make a spreadsheet comparing all my options!
Since when is disclosing your own salary a violation of confidentiality?
Lol are the serious? Its 2024
‚ÄúNo. Thank you.‚Äù
Haha what school? I made of these last year and spread it around wonder if it‚Äôs still making its way around
Fuck that keep sharing and tell the dean that they‚Äôre encouraging the current student body to not support the masters program or university with their selfish bullshit. I was under the impression that all markets work better when more perfect information is available to the market participants. Get your money accounting hoes. Don‚Äôt let these managerial pimps fuck with your money.
Tell him to F off
That‚Äôs bullshit
[deleted]
If the data is anonymized I don‚Äôt see a problem. If you‚Äôre sharing names and other PII along with salaries (without their permission) I would say that‚Äôs unethical if not illegal. Pretty sure it would be illegal in the U.K. and Europe.
Accountants are f clowns at times. Why does this profession attract some of the weirdest ppl
Maintaining confidentiality only helps the employer, but as a word of caution, take steps to avoid your employer realizing you submitted yours.  They can revoke an offer for any reason.  If your number is, say, $65,200, I wouldn‚Äôt list that number.  Round it off to $66,000
If this teacher knew anything about employment law and were a hiring manager, they‚Äôd be more concerned that this language is teetering on an NLRB violation.

Comp is safe to talk about and the whole reason IB has such high quantities of applicants. This decorum of not talking about wages is about professionalism, but shame on them for not being honest with hiring details at the initial entry or admissions marketing of the program.

Every other school program that markers to large groups of potential students is happy to display generic details of graduates offers.
Serves as a good reminder that the faculty and administrators in the academia are typically researchers who haven't been in business for decades. It is common for them to have views that contradict the reality of how things are done in the 21st century.
What the stupid honkey monkey crap is this
This is the polite way of saying, ‚ÄúWe know new accountants make nothing. Keep it a secret, so we can fill our masters program.‚Äù
So who sent this the chair of the accounting department ?
You should reply all to the email with the spreadsheet attached
This is in no way confidential or privileged information. Who does the department owe its loyalty to, anyway? It seems like the prof's position on the matter is just corporate bootlicking when this kind of transparency is just democratizing access to information - the companies, not students, are the ones who are hurt by this. Academia should do better.
Except those offers aren‚Äôt confidential. It‚Äôs just companies wanting to underpay suckers.
This is an illegal request
Levels.fyi

You're welcome
LOL Companies don't care about you and hide salary data to lowball potential emploees. F'em I say.

Fuck that. Tell everyone your comp package and work to get the best you can.
Just respond back to them "haha lol ok boomer" and continue collaborating with your peers to ensure that you're being offered a fair and competitive wage.
School?
Your response should be short & to the point; I'd recommend the following:




*We students refer you to the response in Arkell v Pressdram.*
Fuck that. Continue to push for pay transparency. By hiding salary information you are only helping the company keep pay low.
I love it. Gen Z doesn‚Äôt give a fuck.
Are accountants the biggest bootlickers ever?
If the spreadsheet only have general information like salary, position, and the firm, then it is completely fine. The only time where it is an issue is if the spreadsheet contains personal information that has not been consented to be disclosed.
I‚Äôd reply all and tell the guy to suck my dick.
Pay transparency is legal in the United States.
I hope you reply all to that absolute clown.
This is so stupid. When I went to school we just openly discussed this stuff. Everyone knows, whether it‚Äôs on a spreadsheet or not
KMPG a little angry?
Name and shame
Fuck this noise. Keep sharing it as much as you can.
Funny thing is if this is a public university the person who sent this has their salary in the public domain.
This is in my opinion an example of why accounting is not a desirable career or industry. 

This is pathological to me. Especially the ‚Äúmake better decisions‚Äù at the end.

Yikes.
Fuck that!
I‚Äôm sure the school got pressure to put this out. No way they would do so otherwise. The author just calls it unprofessional and just asks that the students not do it. It‚Äôs worded in such a way that when it‚Äôs read, it can be interpreted as his opinion and not a legal threat. I‚Äôm sure the university legal department went over it before it was sent out to be absolutely sure it would not be grounds for a lawsuit from the students. It‚Äôs a veiled threat if you read between the lines but not enough to get sued over.
 As a current MAcc student‚Ä¶I‚Äôm thinking I want a copy of that SS!!
What‚Äôs the university?
I hear a lot of dumb things but being taught at a business to keep this a secret means that businesses may be trying to be smart and teach this again. 

But as a person, the only person keeping your salary a secret helps is the business.
Anynomously print out the NLRA and nail ir to their door.
Y‚Äôall want something to be done? Name and shame. Why are you protecting the people who are trying to hurt you?
I would say this is directly against social work ethics
He‚Äôs playing the long game
I would forward this to the Ombuds Office and ask them to address this.
There nothing illegal about it, so‚Ä¶.. ya.
This is true. We are trusted we sensitive data everyday. So are the Indians, Chileans, Filipinos, and other people not working stateside
The professors have to have the best interests of the corporate overlords in mind. That's how you attract more students. By having these people happy with your school that they hire the people you ship out.
That's not illegal or unethical to share. It would be if it were a CLIENT's information. You can share with others and they can share with you.
Only reason they doing this is because they pay some of yall way more than otgers
VIVA glassdoorüòº
Partners HATE salary transparency because they want to be able to control what is considered ‚Äúmarket‚Äù comp
She is right about there being a valid university integrity claim here. She is wrong about who the claim is against.
How can we manipulate society with a class-based financial education system, if you keep divulging the information we need you to keep quiet about. Bad things like us illegally "black-balling" you for this legal activity, could happen...

Ignore this fart snorter and continue using that information to manipulate the companies that are sending the offers. 

"Oh shit, you auto-unionized." You're basically Megatron, now.
Lol fucking bring it on. Shit like this just begs for unions and strikes to happen.
NAME AND SHAME
That is bullshit
They‚Äôre sharing their own salary information and the sender is comparing it to client personal information? Lol
If this is the US, this conduct by the employer might be unlawful. Report them to the NLRB here:

https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/interference-with-employee-rights#:~:text=If%20you%20believe%20that%20an,subsequent%20changes%20in%20the%20law.
Definitely don't go to big4transparency.com
That's gate keeping BS, and an attempt at leaving potential employees powerless in regards to wage negotiations.
This seems like a teachable moment for the students to teach the professor the law.
This sounds so‚Ä¶ American Psycho
You have to be transparent where they refuse to be. Business love taking the difference on your labor, don‚Äôt let them get off easy.
Lol the school is afraid to lose their recruiting mojo and stop being considered ‚Äútop tier‚Äù cause the companies recruiting there won‚Äôt like it. Fuck em.
Whoever sent that email needs to go f themselves with a giant cactus.
Unprofessional doesn‚Äôt mean illegal‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs illegal to demand employees keep their salary confidential
Hahaha. That professor might want to revisit both their law and ethics classes, they're wrong on a couple levels here.
This is illegal
Dear Professor So and So, I humbly ask you to grow the fuck up and quick acting like this profession isn't dying due to low salaries. 

From,

Your Best Student
Kiss dick masters program, send that shit out
Big brother at its best. When you don‚Äôt disclose your salary, the winner is the corporations
Total bullshit and shame on whoever wrote this. They are completely misrepresenting the role of confidentiality in accounting, which is intended to protect client information, for self-serving purposes. This only makes it harder for professionals to adhere properly to the principle of confidentiality and more over there are times in an accountant's career when maintaining their integrity will depend on disclosing things that others would prefer weren't disclosed. The kind of subservience they are advocating for here is unprofessional
Welcome to the business world, where corporations aggressively collectively bargain through salary sharing and no-poaching agreements but the moment employees do anything remotely related to collectively bargaining/info-seeking, they‚Äôre harshly punished.
Uhh, here! Deal with numbers and money all day!

Oh you are interested in the number associated with a job! Shame on you

*shocked pikachu face*
I‚Äôd say anyone involved is not qualified for this field after this debacle. Unethical
Boomers
lmbo this is hilariously antiquated and makes no sense

share your salaries
Straight up bullshit. If I were you, I would call whoever sent that stupid email out.
Not at all. So many states and municipalities have laws specifically protecting the right to share salary information.
They're wrong. Of course, this is why it's always a good idea to share data anonymously.
For anyone who was asking about going into accounting‚Äî this should tell you just how bad accounting is
A paid masters program AND you get to negotiate your stipend?
Got it don't share anything that identifies me, salary offer only.
I'd¬† report that letter to the college ethics board/committee immediately.¬† If that doesn't exist then go to the schools job placement group, they will not stand for that bullshit.
Not an accountant but I used to hire for the Big 4. It is illegal for them to even do this. You can plop it all in a spreadsheet to keep track, watch the market to develop solid counters. They‚Äôre impeding your progress and competitive advantage as jobseekers in the market. Tell them to fuck off.
Absolutely not valid!  It would be unprofessional and unethical to share the financial information of *clients* -- but sharing your own salaries and/or prospective salaries/offers is perfectly fine! They just don't want you doing it because they don't want some people to know how underpaid they are or would be.
Discussing salaries is protected concerted activity. Maybe if the professor who made this announcement paid attention in any of their HR classes they might have known this.
Yeah, I‚Äôll listen to this when the people in charge of the cpa license treat it like an actually valuable profession and not trash to be offshored and turned into low pay work
The classic old confidentiality excuse to avoid paying fair salaries.
BS
Someone needs to have the law and it's penalties quoted to them, just for giggles.
Garbage gate keeping nonsense. There is nothing unethical about sharing salary info
Comparing disclosing our salary with sharing confidential/sensitive info from clients is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. If sharing salary is so bad, make us sign a NDA. Otherwise, shut the f up.
No, it's not valid, and I'd bet ¬£50 on whoever wrote this being a lead poisoned boomer.¬†
They're asking for a labor law violation complaint. And it‚Äôs in writing..

‚ÄúUnder Executive Order 11246, you have the right to inquire about, discuss, or disclose your own pay or that of other employees or applicants. You cannot be disciplined, harassed, demoted, terminated, denied employment, or otherwise discriminated against because you exercised this right. However, this right is subject to certain limited exceptions.‚Äù https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ofccp/regs/compliance/factsheets/FACT_PayTransparency-Sept16_ENGESQA508c.pdf

‚ÄúIf you believe that an employer is interfering with your rights as an employee under the National Labor Relations Act to discuss your wages, you can call your NLRB regional office at 844-762-6572 and get assistance in filing an unfair labor practice charge, or e-file a charge here.‚Äù https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/your-rights-to-discuss-wages
Accounting professors are class traitors and wannabe partners .  
Fucking nerds , all of em
Maybe whoever sending this out should know what is confidential and what is not in a school setting and please cite an authority. That is part of being a professional. Never go assuming everything is confidential and never go assuming it is not confidential. You are just keeping your mind lazy. Always make sure to double check.

I would suggest the correct way to think about the issue is to always go through this process:

1. Check firm policy/ student handbook
2. Check any binding contracts, check for your privileges (i.e. attorney client, etc)
3. After it doesn't pass 1 and 2 it's fairly safe to say it is not confidential, now you just have to think about who you are about to piss off with that information and whether you want to share it or not.

Who‚Äôs the narc?
Name shame ‚Ä¶ name the accounting program working against accounting students ‚Ä¶ 

What a heap of bullshit ü§£
Fuck that. Keeping salaries hidden is a good way to fucked over and get lowballed. Knowing your worth based on what your peers make helps you negotiate to make the right decisions

Obviously if someone doesn‚Äôt wanna share their salary, then that‚Äôs fair but don‚Äôt restrict people from sharing their salary info they want
Yea, nah‚Ä¶ fuck that. If you want to share the salary you‚Äôre being offered go for it. More power to you and the rest of the class.
No doubt some recruitment group had a hand in attempting to quash the salary spreadsheet instead of getting to tell people what they're worth on paper.
The National Labor Relations Board would like a word with them.
Not anywhere they're allowed to do anything they want to do, but many schools are allowed to expel anyone they want to expel but they would not expel someone for this for sure.
Should just reply all and attach the spreadsheet to this email lmao. Fuck em.
What school is this?
Name the program please!
It‚Äôs a donor from a big company complaining about it for sure
Wait, what did you go to uni for 3 years for if it wasn't for making *informed* decisions?
What constitutes unprofessional because they said so?
I think so.  The presumption is that all are entitled to the same offer?  Most offers are within a band, but the outliers are a function of your desirability and the requirements of the firm.  To know that one firm is paying more, on average, is one thing, and such knowledge is generally available.
Name and shame the program.
Not valid. This is common practice for those that work in Big 4.
A lot of assuming this is actually real, and not just someone writing-up some Bs for personally reasons. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ridiculous. I‚Äôm a bit old school and don‚Äôt like sharing, but I totally get it, and probably would if I was just coming out of college now.
You all should have gotten expelled
"Sharing salary information could have **serious consequences**".

Like not getting underpaid, how many openings are there?
A bold-faced advocacy against behaving in a way consistent with the public trust component of the profession dressed in a threat which is only vague de jure. Remember, speaking up to try to balance the system in a reasonable approximation of fairness is unprofessional and could have consequences for you and others. Sounds like every reason to continue to me.
It‚Äôs actually unlawful for a company to restrict employees from sharing salary information, see NLRA.
Boomer trying to retain corporate control over US citizens. I always share salary and benefit information with my coworkers because my coworkers are usually my friends. Companies lie to you and everyone else and like to keep what they pay individual people quiet so they don't have to pay everyone what they should be paid.
isnt is good to have a place that workers can be transparent about that? while yes it would be your job to keep clients details private, but not the salaries, benefits, budgets, and all of that when your in the same workplace
And glass door is a thing too. Maybe if employers paid fair wages they wouldn‚Äôt have to try so hard to keep them a secret.
And it‚Äôs wild to compare this against keeping client data confidential. This is sharing your own details in a very fair way that might help other folks navigate and make decisions
And legally an employer can't prevent employees from discussing salaries. Frankly a school should be supporting students for going after the best and top dollar. That would look good for the school eh??
Right? It's not like the people using the spreadsheet are doing something sneaky - the people who got the offer are (presumably) putting the information on it themselves. It's in no way unprofessional to find salary information that was willingly shared.
PwC is on a cohort system so there‚Äôs really no risk. If individual salaries varied and were published, that would have been taken down years ago lol
>Hilarious to think that it‚Äôs unprofessional to share

That's still a myth that people believe?
PwC is in full pay transparency. Everyone at the same level gets the same pay adjusted for cost of living. At least in California, it is not illegal to discuss pay.
They (we) actually get similar responses for leadership about maintaining ‚ÄúCoNfIdEnTiAlItY‚Äù

Fuck em. It‚Äôs completely legal and actually encouraged amongst your peers because transparency is the only way we get compensated fairly. Ignore these fuckers
I need to be in thus group
I don't think it's an issue at all.. especially of it's coming from offer letters. It's not illegal or immoral to share your own salary or even potential salary imo
It's specifically federally protected free speech. 

But the letter doesn't mention legal consequences, just the implied threat of being black listed.
Correct. The National Labor Relations Board has repeatedly defended people‚Äôs rights to talk about compensations. 

It‚Äôs along the same lines as the right to collectively bargain and form unions. When you think about it, discussing pay is potentially the first step.
I'm reading this as "someone in accounting circulated others salary numbers" which us not protected for obvious reasons. Telling your own is protected. Circulating others info is not protected.
It's so legal that it's literally illegal to suppress the sharing of salary info
Does it depend on the state? We need federal laws on salary transparency.

Half of them are sponsored fellows from Big4 firms, they‚Äôre going to push what the Big4 want them to push.
Always has been.
Some professors are in cahoots with the partners because they're all part of the same networks.
My professors in college had connections to local public accounting firms and pushed students towards them.
Actually call ABC or NBC.¬†




You are 7 hours away from Lester Holt or David Muir reporting this story in 4-6 sentences.




¬†Universities are wildly unpopular. Accounting firms are wildly unpopular. Anti-labor and various forms of censorship are wildly unpopular.¬†¬†




This is a scandal, tbh.




Please take this to the Find Out phase for the folks that sent out this message.
Universities and professors have been in bed with public accounting firms, especially the Big 4 for many years, unfortunately this is nothing new. The Big 4 provide a lot of funding to Universities to sell students on working for them, so it's not surprising that they're trying to suppress salary conversations as well.
If it‚Äôs anonymous then fuck off. If there‚Äôs identifiable information that they can triangulate a person- geography, very specific offer amount etc, I can see this being done to protect the graduates.
Some older gen still have a stigma about discussing salary even if they know it's legal. It's not just in accounting
It doesn‚Äôt stop at accounting, keeping people clueless and ill informed has worked for a long time. When people have this type of response it‚Äôs indicative of their desire to keep that sort of hostile workplace going. Totally detached from reality and stuck in a place that won‚Äôt exist in 10-15 years when they‚Äôre gone. Transparency and honesty are what keep people working for whatever salary they make, if you‚Äôre not encouraging people to get theirs then you‚Äôre an asshole.
Double-entry accounting is a skillset, not a sham. That being said, business schools can spread a lot of propaganda. I remember one of my business ethics profs teaching that out-sourcing was ethical, even if children worked in the factories, because "those families needed the money." There's a lot of mental gymnastics in the business world tbh.
They don‚Äôt care! They are part of the problem. When in doubt follow the money that‚Äôs how you‚Äôll know the goal.
It‚Äôs almost like totally unfettered capitalism is an issue
Nah, only some of them. The dean of my accounting department (who also taught a class) straight up told me during my interview for the MSA that Big 4 isn't worth it for the pay and that they chew up and spit out people. She was a great one.
I agree, as an accountant, nobody should ever become an accountant
Every corporation. If only it were just accounting!
Accounting/Higher Learning as a whole: Use data to make informed business and personal decisions.

First important life/business decision: ‚ÄúNO DON‚ÄôT DO THAT!‚Äù

Actually kinda messed up when you think about it.
Lmao
My first LOL for the day
Does it not?
Maybe if you‚Äôre diddy‚Äôs accountant
Lol a public accountant that‚Äôs cucked ü§£. Cucked public accountant.
What are they teaching their students  about disclosing information we might be legally obliged to do so that the people they're  working for don't want them to? 

Isn't that how Enron happened..  the subprime mortgage crisis... The list goes on.
Might reply to their email with this
Because they‚Äôre buddy-buddy with the partners, who directly benefit from not having to pay their new hires market rates.
I don‚Äôt even care about the salary, I just want to break in. So far it‚Äôs been all rejections even with prior/current audit experience, I don‚Äôt even get to an interview.
Why former partner? Were you required to retire due to age?
If it‚Äôs a public university, can sometimes find the professors salaries‚Ä¶ just saying
Name and  shame!!

Post that shit on Twitter/TikTok. They are perpetuating an illegal practice to continue to suppress wages. Fuck them
Exactly! I want to know who this is. So fucking ridiculous that anyone would call discussing starting salaries as unprofessional and somehow imply that discussing wages = untrustworthy.
UNC Chapel Hill
Yeeeeees do this!
Also for accounting professors to pressure their students to suppress info, not because of any particular rule or regulation but because *they don't like it* really doesn't instil confidence in me that they have any integrity as an accountant
I still find it wild that its not federally required for job postings to disclose the expected pay.
Talking about wages is protected speech federally, but only Hawaii, New York, and Colorado require wages to be listed in job postings. There are several states that require wage range disclosure upon request or after an interview, etc.
Maybe I'm naive, but I couldn't imagine revoking a staff's offer because they shared it with their graduating class. You have to assume they're talking.
It's stuff like this that justifies billing 25% of the day to clients for bathroom breaks. /s

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
What? My entire start class at a Big 4 negotiated a higher starting salary, but our recruiter said she needed to see competing firm‚Äôs offer letters to justify the increase in our city specifically. So we all asked our fellow graduating students to help us out‚Ä¶
I didn‚Äôt even know about it until this email came in, but I thought it was federally protected?
It‚Äôs actually the career advisor
UNC Chapel Hill
UNC Chapel Hill
Where are the recruiters like you at in my school lol. Mine won‚Äôt even respond to my emails
It‚Äôs actually our career advisor for the Masters program ironically.
But does this extend to potential-employers or even school programs? Would be hard to prove this pressure came from a firm.
UNC Chapel Hill
They respond by saying ‚Äúyou can tell your spouse, partner, parent, or guardian. This is still a very gray area, and you must trust they will keep your personal information confidential.‚Äù Kind of just sounds like they‚Äôre trying to pressure me into not telling people my salary under the ruse of it being considered ‚Äúpersonal information.‚Äù
A school that markets itself as being top 5 nationally, and also prides itself on sending people to big 4/PA. Not working for me though I can‚Äôt even get an interview.
UNC Chapel Hill
They're doubling down on telling you not to discuss wages without actually saying that. I hope you and your classmates keep pushing back and remind them of labor laws.

Keep us updated.
UNC Chapel Hill

Unfortunately I don‚Äôt even have it, I didn‚Äôt even know this was a thing until the email got sent out. I may seek it out now though, thanks career services!
It‚Äôs actually the career advisor believe it or not. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be the ones fighting the good fight against the out of touch CPA‚Äôs
I think they‚Äôd still have enough to make a dam and stop the river of tears from flowing!
Double it and give it to the next guy.
In my state I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they took the side of the school. The guys probably alum lol
Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any winners here
someone with common sense - just something is right doesn't necessarily mean it's smart

This guy gets it
Totally anonymous and optional to input information
Career advisor for the MAC program
You think I wrote this? Lmao, unfortunately not.
Good thing you‚Äôre not the dean!
And big4transparency.com lol
They didn't even make a comparison though, it was such a silly non sequitur (or actually just a way to confuse and disorient people because they didn't have a real argument).

"In this job you will be given confidential information of other people.... which is kinda like a reason not to share your own salary."
[deleted]
schools run on donations from rich people.
The school doesn‚Äôt care about the students. ¬†The firms are their customers.¬†
The school wants to remain in the good graces of the industry.
They probably prefer to boast ‚Äú95% of our graduates are employed at graduation!‚Äù Even if it‚Äôs 55k at a low tier public accounting firm.
I agree but this appears to a major firm so I have wonder if there's some technicality that they're using to send this. The only thing I can think of is maybe 'offer letters' are not technically your wage until you've accepted it? Like the offer letter itself is confidential?

Otherwise, they're opening themselves up to an easy-to-win NLRB violation.
If they have an offer letter but are not yet employed, are they still protected?  I genuinely don't know.
Not only can they not prevent it through punitive measures, they legally can't even request that you not discuss them.
Makes you wonder who these institutions are really serving, doesn't it?
Discussing wages is a protected labor action. They probably went to a cohort system because of this information being published, not in spite of it.
If I‚Äôm recalling correctly, the cohort system went into effect in 2022? Salaries were being shared/published on FB long before that when I was there so, I don‚Äôt think so.
I'm assuming that the school would be the one punishing the students and not the employer which is probably perfectly legal. But given enough legal resources a good lawyer could argue that the only reason university's care is because the employer's are leaning on them which could be argued is the employer. 

Either way it's a bad look for the university even if it's legal. 

Send this to legal eagle on youtube.
It makes tons of implication without actually saying anything by attaching it to things that are actually legally protected.
And that's threat is illegal
the longshoremen got a 62% raise.  this school is just butthurt because they make a lot of money selling lowball graduates to big firms.
can you share the exact statute where it's stated that "offer letters" are "federally protected free speech"?
We've reported former employers to the labor board over NDA's before, this seems to fall in that area
It maybe a right to talk about compensation; but employers get around that by threatening to take away access to that confidential information, and if you don't have access you can't do your hired responsibilities thus open for termination.
Companies can sometimes bar you from discussing it in specific ways if your employment agreement is worded well enough...like not using the company email or instant message system to do so.

So it is always best to do it verbally and to be aware of what you have signed.
It's also not an ethics or confidentiality concern when it is your own information. It's so sleazy for the school to imply that it is.¬†
Agreed. So if others fill in the spreadsheet of their own accord and you circulate said spreadsheet, are you still circulating others or are you circulating your own? Not so clear. 

The law is clear though. It's okay to talk about anybody's pay anytime. As long as you are not privileged to said information from your role at the company, there should be no problems.

If we're talking about the pay scales of client companies, they should not be creating spreadsheets based on what they read from clients.
This! The amount of fellowship dollars is amazing. They are bought and paid for. I hope every student deleted that email and didn‚Äôt see the teacher.
Still drinking the kool aid
More slaves please - Big 4 partners probably
I‚Äôm a professor at a community college with zero affiliation with the big 4. I find this letter incredibly unethical. Like just straight ridiculous.
In Utah, there's a Transparent Utah website that lists how much money every state employee makes in a given year, including employees of publicly funded schools. After this email, I'd make sure everyone knew about it.
Yeah and when you're the student you're extremely thankful at this point in life to make it into anything else is crazy
You‚Äôve got a point
Then it's an FPA.
Cite executive order 11246 when you do, reminding them that it is your federally protected right to discuss salary information.
If you respond to them can you share it with us? Guessing you‚Äôre not gonna use your school email
I'll buy you a 6 pack or similar if you do lol
Was it an individual professor or the department chair that sent out the letter?  

If it was me I'd be inclined to raise some hell about this l letter, but depending on who sent it maybe figure out anonymously.  If it was a random professor, I'd go to the department chair.  If it was the chair, I'd figure out a way for it to go to the dean without being directly traced back to someone.  

The federal government posts the base pay and location pay for most or all pay schedules, most people in a professional career would be in the GS-7 to 13 range.  

As an aside you can literally find the name and pay for every federal employee at most agencies (except DoD, intelligence and I think law enforcement).  www.feddatacenter.com has a table, with a quick look someone in accounting for the Department of Agriculture in Albuquerque as the GS-12 grade made $104,011.00, and the next accountant in the list, same city/grade/department made $88,007.
I love a reply of the "I didn't hear no bell' meme with "I didn't see no NDA" on it

I was a senior manager at a national firm. Everyone knows each other‚Äôs salary increase and where they are pay wise.
I am, of course, just an anonymous responder and so take my comment as such.

If you have prior audit experience, you should be in high demand. As such, I think there is something on your resume that is scaring people off. You may wish to get some insights on that.
Pretty sure pay bands for any state/public university are published, it's just a question of knowing where to look.
UNC Chapel Hill

Some states are starting to mandate this. Colorado is one. 

I have found that some companies post obscenely big pay ranges to get around this.
WA added this requirement in 2024 as well!
California also requires salary transparency with job postings by employers with 15 or more employees effective 2023.
Imagine being so embarrassed about your offer to a staff that you‚Äôd stop recruiting from a school over them sharing that offer with their colleagues.
Like I said, they can‚Äôt stop participation, but don‚Äôt think they won‚Äôt try to find other ways to stop the hiring of the participants.
You can't be fired for talking about salary, but that doesn't mean you have to be hired. You could also burn other classmates/future students if firms don't trust your school anymore.
It's easier to prove once you have the job.
So it's someone who doesn't have a CPA telling you that you'll violate the CPA ethics. Got it. What a jackass.
Oh I mean the firm I work for is very much not in favor of pay transparency (except where required) but it‚Äôs my own personal vendetta to be an open book to empower yall to have information! I‚Äôm sorry it sucks trying to reach out to recruiters :(
That's worse, but seriously let them know their actions are possibly illegal and to fuck right off.
There might not be anything actionable but at the very least I'd inform whoever sent this what the law is concerning the practice. It's always amazed me how many employers think talking about pay is a punishable offense so having a school perpetuating this concept is really bad in my opinion.
Government is the way, my friend. Different kind of BS but not like this.
Career advisor, yet stifling students' initiative to help negotiate fair career terms where they would otherwise have little to no experience to go from.

Sounds like every penny of his likely cushy salary is wasted.
Then crack on I‚Äôd say. The only other potential issue may be a breach of the employees‚Äô contracts, but since it‚Äôs anonymised it would be hard for them to be identified. Also it‚Äôs only an issue for the people inputting the data, not those sharing it.
Well it wasn't an explicit comparison, but the gist was obviously that if you can't keep this secret, how can you keep client data secret?
If I recall correctly, the only thing that would make this not illegal is if the salaries were being shared without the consent of the people to whom those salaries belong. I doubt that is the case here.
And make sure that reply goes to everyone involved
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs all make better decisions going forward‚Äù
This is one of the few decent laws in this hellscape of a country when it comes to labor rights.  I think employers look at the overall tilt of the playing field in their direction and just assume that of course this thing is also tilted in their favor, it feels like it should be.
Bingo, if the industry stops hiring that program it will collapse.
On what grounds would it be legal for the University to punish students for practicing their free speech? The letter shared is an empty threat, there's no mention of enforcing any type of punishment. I cannot see how the University would have any legal grounds to punish students that ignore the professor's letter.
You reported employees for what to the NLRB?
I had a company tell me it couldn't be discussed on company time. Guess what started to happen on breaks and after work hours.
As long as the spreadsheet is created as a salary sharing spreadsheet by users putting their own info, not something made by the company or whatever, it's probably fine.
Vague pipeline jargon that boils down to exactly THAT, but veiled for deniability reasons. - Big 4 partner, definitely
Yeah. Most University professors would find this appalling.  

However, there is always at least one Big 4 stooge at all the schools. Their role is to informally be the "recruiting" prof.  Just like there is a primary "tax" and "government" prof.
Youre right. Edited my comment to say some. When I was in school I had professors like you but I had plenty that were ex B4 or PA staff that pushed public very hard. I'm just very over a lot of people in this profession bending over backwards to devalue the designation and the work we do. 


You never get this crap with lawyers or engineers. There should be a lot more prestige to being an accountant but the leaders of public firms are all obsessed with cost cutting and penny pinching which just hurts accountants long term. Accounting services need to be rebranded as premium services. Every business needs accounting and high quality accounting services come with a cost. Nobody bats an eye when a lawyer bills a mountain of hours for legal advice but people seem to be in shock when accountants bill that same amount of time and hours for equally if not more important work around a client's finances, taxes, growth strategies, accounting systems etc. Instead firms try to compete with each other by offering the lowest engagement fees. They're just cannibalizing each other and making it more difficult to hire and grow talent organically. 


Anyways that's my rant.
It was the career advisor for the mac program
recruiter here. Honestly it‚Äôs a numbers game, and it‚Äôs fucked. OP, it may be something on your resume but it also may be that all of the public firms are offshoring and that is causing a huge cut to entry level headcount. 

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt keep our people staffed‚Äù = we are booming in India and don‚Äôt have a robust enough of a business development team in the US to make up for what were shipping out. 

I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs shitty right now.
Nice, we are making progress!
It looks like AI failed when I googled that earlier. It missed Illinois, Washington State, and New York too.
Nobody should be working in a company that doesn‚Äôt embrace salary transparency anyway. Those students would be dodging a bullet imo
Fair enough, don‚Äôt like it but it makes sense lmao
I really want to, but I‚Äôm still trying to break into PA so I feel like I kinda need them. Somehow my audit experience isn‚Äôt sufficient to even get me to an interview for a staff role. üôÉ
And it's a non sequitur because a person can decide for themselves whether their salary is a secret. If it's not a secret then there's no comparison at all.
[deleted]
I may be wrong, but I think it would only be protected under free speech if it's a university that receives any amount of government funding. If it were a fully private institution, I think you lose that right. 

I still think it's ridiculous that they'd punish students for sharing salary info. If anything, it teaches you not to take a low-ball offer.
Sounds like we agree home dog.
Employers* sorry damn autocorrect
Even that is a little tricky. If the company lets you talk about *any* non work topics during work hours then they cannot restrict you from taking about wages at work during work hours. They have to ban and enforce no talking about anything not work related.
Yeah the small community I teach at has zero big 4 presence because the market is too small for the big 4. That comes with the trade off that it is harder to get into the big 4 from our school. We only offer two year diplomas though, so most students end up at a more prestigious school to finish their degree.
It sounds like this asshat is already not helping you much. I don't think pissing him/her off will harm your odds much. I've never seen a "blacklist." People need quality accountants. If you are struggling, go pass a section of the CPA and come back.

You'll also have many more options if you are willing to relocate.

Networking and personal connections are how you get placed, not your university career advisor.
I had one of my managers tell me not to share stuff. I was trying to get out from under him and switched to a different group anyways, but it really bugged me when he told me that because I knew it was illegal for him to say so.
Oh 100% this is a¬†non-manager recruiter who thinks they are god going rogue because they are annoyed about having to do their actual job fielding questions from new hires about comp.¬†
Oh wild! I didn't even know there were some that were excluded! Thanks for the info!
Not in California or Massachusetts. Also, as I mentioned elsewhere, even if they're attending a private university not in those states, then there's still a likelihood that this is violating the university's policy on free speech, which most private universities guarantee a certain level of free speech.
Sounds like you missed his point or expressed yours poorly, because the comment he made and the one he replied to are not in agreement.
Your first sentence reads as if it's probably perfectly legal for the University to punish students for sharing their offer salary information. I don't think the University has any legal grounds to do that. This doesn't require a great lawyer and enough legal resources, it would be a clear violation of the 1st amendment.
Okay xd
This is a lot different at 4-year schools where that one school has to maintain the relationships. Obviously this email is a request, just very strongly worded apparently.
I HOPE you bugged him back by quoting the ACTUAL LAWS to him.
I wasn't quite brave enough, especially because I was in the process of getting out of his group, and I didn't want to burn any Bridges
Bitcoin Pumps and then dumps after the SEC Twitter account is compromised and posts a fake announcement saying a spot ETF was approved.
Something wild just happened. THE SEC posted a tweet saying that the Spot ETF was approved.

Bitcoin Spiked and then dumped, normal sell the news market volatility... right?

Nope apparently the ETF was never approved a follow up tweet by Gary Gensler said the SEC twitter account was compromised and that it was an unauthorized Tweet.

The SEC announcement post is now deleted.

\-------------

With that lets acknowledge this SEC tweet from Oct. 2023.

https://preview.redd.it/2xybogscnhbc1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8f2f2e092a99c957f9825264853c1e64b5dbf42

I have a feeling if this wasn't an intern screwup - whoever made that fake announcement likely made huge money on volatility...

Regardless of what happens on the supposed announcement later this week, this is going to be a stain on the inevitable news.
Bitcoin [pros](/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/192qh06/bitcoin_pumps_and_then_dumps_after_the_sec/kh5uax4/) & [cons](/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/192qh06/bitcoin_pumps_and_then_dumps_after_the_sec/kh5ubil/) with related info are in the collapsed comments below.
It's been confirmed they didn't have 2FA on their X account lol they want to regulate crypto but can't secure their own X account
So who‚Äôs going to investigate them for market manipulation?
I wanna go back to being a child where I was convinced adults had everything under control. We live in a clown world.
Shorts rekt

Long rekt

Holders survive üí™
Waiting for SEC to sue SEC .
The dump happened 5 minutes in, 10 minutes before Gary posted about the account being compromised. Why is nobody talking about this?
Just wanted to say thank you for this post. For a long time, big news events were just a race for people to post the link the fastest in the moon economy. Posts like this are what I love about Reddit. A dedicated original thread about a topic someone took their time to make, include media and sources, and a big comment section about it. Really refreshing to see. Cheers ü´Ç
Even the SEC and pump and dumping
Imagine thinking the SEC account got hacked, and it wasn't just a coordinated pump and dump by the same people who pass through the Wall St revolving door every day.

For fuck sake, they repealed glass-steagall and never implemented or enforced most of Dodd-Frank. You've got CDOs back, too.
Who do we report market manipulation to when it‚Äôs the SEC manipulating?
---okok
Not a bad strategy to get rich quick
CLOWN FUCKIN WORLD lol

doesn't matter if 'real world assests' or crypto.

sec is a joke
‚ÄúThis seems to be on purpose‚Äù
It‚Äôs either insider trading, market manipulation, piss poor security or sheer incompetence that led to this tweet being made. Either way it‚Äôs not good enough from the people who are supposedly deciding what‚Äôs safe to do with our money.

Fuck the SEC.
The SEC used legislation and became confused. It hurt itself in the confusion. SEC fainted.
their password must be : Gary1234
That‚Äôs not the only thing compromised at the SEC
What does ja rule have to say about this?
Some insiders made money and many traders lost theirs.
Scheduled tweet that went out on the wrong day.
Still above 45k
I'm sure this will really help the problem of people seeing Crypto as corrupt and unserious...
This market is irrational as fuck.
If I ask a random dude when there was a pump and dump caused by the SEC 10 years from now. Would you think he could notice it in the charts? 

I dont think so. Tik tok, next fucking block baby.
The SEC is compromised.
So the SEC twitter account was used for market manipulation?  Yikes
Damn did you do it? Hahaha 3 mins after the post dude! It all happened soo quick
Isn‚Äôt this the market manipulation they keep yelling about and taking people to court for.
A notice went out at the corporation where I worked that I had received a nice promotion. But it was premature and it was really just being considered. Rather than look foolish by sending out a bulletin of correction, they let it stand, to my benefit. I got my next promotion a year later, in any event.
Seems like they're getting liquidation going so the whales can invest more right before a massive jump.  They know what's coming.  Hold on tight - about to be a massive ride.
Talking about manipulaci√≥n! the SEC needs to be investigated
The dump happened before or after they knew the post was fake?
That ‚Äúfake‚Äù announcement looked too professional and legitimate to be ‚Äúfake,‚Äù imo. I believe it was real and prematurely sent.
A couple thousand pump and then a drop to $45K isn‚Äôt really much of a *pump and dump*
Seems more like a stain on the SEC to me ‚Ä¶
Damn, Elon's getting pretty brave about just how deep he'll fuck with the SEC.
What a shitshow. Who can teach the SEC how to secure a X account ? These guys will lose their seed in no time
First comes the FOMO, followed by the FUD - the story of crypto.
This looks like an inside job to provoke price manipulation. If they're sly like that, they could even claim it was an experiment. 
The story of a 2fa hack on the person who could send the tweet is a bit far-fetched.
They got their account back awfully fast....
Kind of like the GTA 6 trailer vibes.
Password was ‚Äúpassword‚Äù
The SEC Twitter account was compromised? I call BS!!!
Maybe they need to stop using the password SEC123!
Who investigates the SEC? The DOJ? Did the SEC file a police report regarding the "hack"?
I'm not gonna lie...I watched this happen in real time and I let out the biggest Fuck yeah followed by I'm going to the shed to end it all in 1:30 sec. What a great Tuesday.
[deleted]
It kind of answers the question of whether or not the announcement is priced in. Half decent spoke after the news suggests not
it wasn't hacked, that's the best bit ;)
"Compromised"  


How about:  


"I am a corrupt career politician, I needed to make a quick million, thanks suckers"
Either way I‚Äôm bullish rn
the SEC pumped and dumped
It did pump, to just under 48k, but it dumped BEFORE the SEC announced they were compromised, in fact, the very minute that the SEC announced they had been compromised and it was misinformation, bitcoin stopped dumping. Look at the 1 minute charts and look at the tweet timestamps..        
So the most interesting tidbit here is that bitcoin did not dump out of disappointment, it STOPPED dumping out of either disappointment or relief, also that means that any and all of this market action has been retail driven, so it's been hype-driven
Did he go out and say it was unauthorized one hour before it got "tweeted unauthorized"?
Probably just a draft post that got posted early and they play it off as their account being compromised. I hope team at X will investigate
‚ÄúCompromised‚Äù
Total coincidence, im sure. The crypto world is just full of the stars aligning at every opportunity to make scammers rich somehow
In pretty sure the SEC is involved in all this manipulation of BTC. SEC is just the Fed Reserves bitch in all this.
The Wall Street criminal cartel at work again
Well, that explains the drop in my portfolio.
The sec needs to read all tweets by the sec before posting. Also, the sec shall fine the sec
Well the good news is, this was like a test run on how the market will react when it is real. So boys and women prepare properly now. üöÄ
**sec account was hacked just only for few minutes...üí©**
This shit was set up.
SEC pulling straight from Cointelegraph‚Äôs playbook.
I say that it was indeed compromised.. by a SEC employee with full access to the twitter account. And he probably made a lot of money.
This sorta blows the "sell the news" theory out of the water.
It was most likely on a timer and someone forgot to un set it.
Yeah the one that made the money on volatility‚Ä¶GC
They did a fake out
I don't understand what takes so long to decide if they'll approve it or not? Is it paperwork? Process? A required time period? Politics?
Wild insane rubbish. The question remains, will SEC sue SEC?
Some social media mofo at the SEC made a big quick buck there
I saw people betting on Polymarket(?) on this. I didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing. 

But seeing this post instantly reminded me of that. My guess is someone who had some money to make on their bet was trying to manipulate votes or results.
You could make a movie about this and it would be unbelievable/unrealistic. Yet it happened. Jfc.
Is there a specific day that they decide about the approval, or can it just happen randomly?
I don‚Äôt think this was some insider trading nonsense. I think it was 1 thing: Incompetence

The SEC has proven to not have the most intelligent folks on their side and presumably the person running their twitter/X is a 20 something fresh college grad with a marketing degree.

It doesn‚Äôt make sense to manipulate something that‚Äôs going to inevitably happen the next day.
bet it was elon
The long and short on rollbit was timed exactly on the hack.. by a user‚Ä¶ called GaryGensler‚Ä¶.

Perfect excuse now to delay the etf
SEC market manipulation?
Pelosi needs to learn this

inside trading is not as good as manipulating the market yourself.
This year is starting off with a bang
Very ‚ÄúSUS‚Äù
"compromised"
He literally wrote the draft for the post for TOMORROW but hit post. They never denied that it would get approved, they only claim that the post was "not authorized". It will ultimately get approved tomorrow
lol! Can't even keep their Twitter account secure. But trust them to make monetary and financial decisions.
2% moves don‚Äôt mean anything other than it is a Tuesday
I couldn‚Äôt believe it and immediately had to screenshot it. Then I went into the account and checked that it is the real SEC account. The rest is history.
This is a classic moment we are all living through right nowüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Shit is crazy out here
Open long

Hack SEC

Profit.

Open short, say it was a hack profit again.
The SEC is a joke
$5 on Musk did it
What if it was them testing the waters to see what happened to Bitcoin price? ü§î
Someone clicked POST instead of Save draft, "opsie".
X confirmed they were hacked. The reason was missing 2FA.

*The hacker who received the message, using the screen name ‚Äúlol,‚Äù decided over the next 24 hours that Kirk did not actually work for Twitter because he was too willing to damage the company.

Stinks like shit
Cramer said Bitcoin peaked. It obviously was the pump and dump dog whistle.
How do we not know if this was a 'bluff' to see what type of action \*could happen upon the announcement - approved, liquidity pours in - disapproved, people start to dump, etc. basically like a stunt at the line of scrimmage in football by a defense to try and lure the offense to tip their hand...?
who cares? i‚Äôm not selling til I retire and I figure most smart people aren‚Äôt.
Funding secured
This is hilarious
Bull shit it was compromised they 100% did that purposely to A) see what happens or  B) pump n dump just to rebuy
Since it pumped after even a fake tweet so much for selling the news theory.
This was not on my bingo card.
You guys ever think about how pissing, shitting, and fucking all happen in a 2 in radius?
I bought some more lol
Still hasn‚Äôt gone down to $20K. Whats the problem!?
Just testing the outcome. Now they will buy more before announcing
Dang, now they'll have to make a new infographic.
Gary is a clown
The dollar is a fraud
Literally pump and dump orchestrated by the SEC
I fail to believe that their twitter got hacked, and all it was for was to say a btc etf was approved.
all you paper handed bitches
Zoom out. Hardly a pump and dump. Just a regular Tuesday .
I got a bad feeling about this.
I love people calling byton a scam. From my perspective i invested into alibaba and got absolutely shafted, bitcoin on the other hand keeps me afloat.
Having comprehensive knowledge of price delivery is very important. The people who go liquidated both ways yesterday, have themselves to blame. I see no reason why they had positions open at that time yesterday, after wasting the weekend being afraid to buy at 42k and closing in profit as price first hit 47k. The ETF is a distraction that people forgot they were buying inside a weekly supply zone at a first time of return. Feel ashamed for them. üòÅ
"Regardless of what happens on the supposed announcement later this week, this is going to be a stain on the inevitable news."

&#x200B;

yeah, like all the 5mio other things that happen all the years
Why is the hack at 3:26 but the approval at 4:11 that doesn't make sense
[removed]
SEC gonna go after themselves for market manipulation? Heh
I‚Äôm putting my money on this was a test to see how fast the market would react and who would react.
At least we now know how the market will react to the news. Pump!
move along, nothing to see here‚Ä¶lol
OK, but can we please sue the SEC now for market manipulation?
They‚Äôre gonna use this as an excuse to not approve the spot etf application
More manipulation from US gov
Isn't it lovely to be governed by delinquents? If only we had some technology to protect us against them... Like some form of strong money for the people to defend against corruption....

I hope people adopts monero soon
SEC probably had some boomer getting the tweet ready for tomorrow and they sent it on accident. I mean, how does an account get compromised, then control taken back over in such a short time?
Unauthorized tweet, not fake tweet
So basically now we all know, when it gets approved it‚Äôs only going to spike up to $48K
If I was the government Id make the same claim knowing id make lots of money

It‚Äôs Elon getting back at Gary üíØ
Cheers to you fools for applauding the regulations anathema to cryptos existence.
lol
I've always kind of wondered about stuff like this happening, and then being surprised it doesn't happen more often
It was Elon.
Yeah, it was a pretty good crack move by someone. Excellent way to create a little pump for the dumping, right? Too much attention was on the SEC ruling to ignore that little opportunity. 

Proud of them, whoever it was. Bravo.

*And my trading algo bot did a good move on it, so I'm extra happy, lol.*
ELI5 - Isn't there already Spot Bitcoin ETFs in Europe and Canada?  Why is everyone so convinced that if there was a US based one it would suddenly generate a massive demand that the other 2 aren't filling today
This is really some funny shit. It‚Äôs like accidentally sending nudes in onlyfans and you say you got hacked.
I wonder why the SEC is concerned about fraud with crypto.
DCA is one of the effective strategy, in this situation
Why do I think this was someone in particular at X making this tweet?
I think the announcement was real but someone (larry fink) told them to hold the info back, so it was a 'hack' just my 2 sats
I think it was a insider of SEC pretesting the market to get an idea of how much money they can make tomorrow when it gets approved for real.
Notice the god candle was canceled before the Gary tweet. 

The ETFs are absolutely sending this to the moon. 100k before the halving is almost guaranteed in my opinion
SEC is criminally incompetent.
People saying it was a draft...as if the SEC page would use the bitcoin emoji in their post
Very well made fake tweet imo.
You can't  trust government organizations.
Fake news.
but what if Gensler was hacked and *his* message was the fake one?!

**FOMO!**
The people who enforce the law against market manipulation just forced market manipulation
I refuse to believe they didn‚Äôt do this on purpose
Isn‚Äôt this some sort of insider trading?
The only way to fight this is buy, remove from the exchanges, and stick it to the banks and SEC.  Once we have in our how wallet, they cant do anything and they know it.
What you mean pumped and dumped? Today BTC touched ATH since last cycle and didn't dump even 5%. Crypto bros gonna be dramatic
So now we know what will happen when the real news hits.
They use this ‚Äúmishap‚Äù today as an excuse to not approve the spot etf application

Crypto and scams, thank god we have the dollar. This shit is so unstable.
If I‚Äôm a human (who knows these days)  or there are groups of humans that has full ability to make‚Ä¶.. untold $ by using an account to make a fake tweet and I know that there is zero chance of me getting in trouble what will I do 99 percent of the time? CIA enters chat. Look it‚Äôs very possible that some shadowy U.S. government agencies was involved. No 2fa. I doubt that highly. Elon only wanted to investigate for the free publicity. Edit: Gov Agency - hang on while I investigate myself-one millisecond later- no our agency was not responsible. Powerful people are not like us, they lie significantly more than they tell the truth, unless the truth is easier.
The United States of America is a clown country!
Had to liquidate the longs so they could fill up some more before the real announcement.
I may need to just get out of crypto all together man‚Ä¶ been in for almost 4 years now‚Ä¶ no gains and all I see are scams and grifts‚Ä¶

Anyone wanna convince me otherwise? This shits been not it
That tweet looks very genuine and official. I‚Äôm sure it was meant for tomorrow but accidentally sent today.
The SEC Doesn't want to announce this news until JAN 10th and wants the speculation to continue until then


You saw a spoonful of what's to come upon approval of this** BTC** ETF setting the notion it's 100% going up when it's finally announced.


This is not a sell the news event.
This is a new beginning of crypto levels.
Where we are right now is the new low for the future.
Why does everyone here think that everything that isn't crypto is a fraud.... And yet the crypto space is rife with fraud. You guys and you conspiracy theories too

> The SEC has previously rejected all spot bitcoin ETF proposals over fears of market manipulation. Accounts on X, like accounts on other social media platforms, are sometimes hijacked by stealing passwords or tricking targets into giving up their login credentials.

I wouldn't be suprised if this was rejected and delayed for march.  This way all applicants deadlines line up and no one gets an advantage
with a picture of Gensler smiling, people are dumb
If this doesn't make you wanna grab pitchforks and torches I don't know what will.
Crypto always involved with hack‚Ä¶
Oh man here we go for the roller coaster
Psy-op. No chance.
In the highly unlikely chance someone hacked the SEC NETWORK, not just the twitter.

There would be restrictions to access the official channels for all Federal entities. Unless the network itself was compromised, this couldn‚Äôt happen.
This stuff only happens with Crypto.
This looks so bad on the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem. 

Typical bad actors who ruin the fun for everyone else.
If the SEC is going to approve the ETF tomorrow then they could have just corrected the tweet using their own wording and the ‚Äúhackers‚Äù would not have been able to profit UP and DOWN. 

I know it would be unprofessional to keep  hacked message up, but they could have just edited it to reflect their ‚Äúvoice‚Äù.
I know the Crypto community has valid reasons to believe in this tech BUT...

It cannot be understated that this asset -  that many people are putting major portions of their life savings - is suspiciously susceptible to a TWEET. 

Can an argument be made that fiat is susceptible to whimsical things but...come on, not like this. 

Isn't the end game for crypto to be universally adopted by the general public? This ain't it.
All I am seeing here is that if it actually gets approved BTC is only moving 2% up üòÇ

This whole crypto thing is full of fraud.
Alts are gonna die after this news ffs
CIA honey pot
Elon musk?
Do you ever wonder what could be done with all the money put into this fake coin if it was used for other purposes?
All the hype being build up since few months and you know what's gonna happen on 10th?

&#x200B;

It's gonna be rejected, just like in 2017. Then they'll be teasing us till March. Patterns seem to be repeating themselves. Year preceeding the year in which bull run peak is supposed to happen, we enter a false bull market between the December-January period. It already happened in the past.
Last time I checked if your twitter account or whatever was hacked - you are locked out 
You can say it was hacked
Hacked tweet at 4:11pm, and tweet to clarify was at 3:26pm, they don't add up.

Sell the news
üòÇ
It was definitely Musk. He loves doing shit like this.
LololololololololoLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLMAOLMAOLMAOLMAO üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üíÄ
Why is Gary‚Äôs tweet at 3:26 PM and the SECs tweet at 4:11 PM üò≥ü§î
Blame X for internal incompetence.  Widely disliked Elon is why the sec is negligent.
Millions of intelligent people: Ha, gotcha! That proves it‚Äôs artificial. 

Cryptocurrency holders: BUY QUICK! NOW!
If people think Bitcoin is a wise investment and stable, they are in for a wake up call when it‚Äôs last one to the door when it tanks eventually. It has literally no inherent value other than people think it will go higher..

Thank you for gold. Any crypto investors wanna buy it?
2FA? Who's ticker is that?
2FA is an unregistered security, we don't do that here.
üòÇ
The SE....oh...
Right, like are they using the same passwords for their accounts? Hope they look into it rather than sweeping it under the rug.
turns out, we're all kinda just winging it
It's the eye of the holder, it's the will to survive

Standing up to the pressure of the market

Because, no matter what bullshit the cryptospace provides

Half of us have lost our original seed phrase,..

So we HODL,.... DUN DUN DUN,.....DUN DUN DUN....
[deleted]
Pretty sure everyone called "sell the news"
Exactly. This was well orchestrated. The SEC manipulates the markets, what a surprise.
I swear I thought I‚Äôd be the only one waiting all day for a solid post on this
Crypto gonna crypto
Right? Garry's out here trying to accumulate some last minute fire sale sats before the pump.
hmm, so we just saw how the bots will react? interesting indeed.
Bold move cotton
If I ran even a small team at work the way Gensler runs the entire SEC, I'd be shitcanned.
All of the above is the answer.
This^
LOL
He said it was too hot for TV!
Always better to keep hodling
Traders are always losing money and looking for someone else to blame lol

It‚Äôs gambling, we all knew that, house wins, etc. hodl aka long term compounding gains wins every time
Im not an insider but i set my limit sell at 47,750. Its not hard to read a depth chart.
No, looks at the tweets they liked during those brief minutes. It was hacked
Yeah, it was a huge dump - we are down *checks notes* < 2% in 24 hours!

The horror..... The horror!
Seems like it paints the SEC as corrupt and unserious , I don‚Äôt even understand this logic. Any market would have had a reaction to a post from the SEC in such a context. I‚Äôm fact the reaction wasn‚Äôt even that intense. I‚Äôve seen bigger pumps and dumps on random Tuesdays before an ETF was even on anyone‚Äôs mind
Hmm wonder if ol‚Äô musk ox has the ability to fuck with the SECs Twitter account.  He‚Äôs pumped and dumped bitcoin and altcoins before.
It "dumped" tp $45.7k.  
It "pumped" to $45.9k.  

This is all nonsense.
what you gonna do call the SEC?
A massive jump off a cliff
Holding üôèüôè
If the SEC wasn't the SEC, the SEC would go after the SEC.
Started dumping just as the rumour it was fake went out but before gensler confirmed it
It was definitely staged, not "hacked" they are testing what the market will do, what bots will do.
Those pesky interns again.
It‚Äôs a fuckin tweet my dude lol nothing about it is ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù looking
Agree. Literally just a quick blip.
Then you don‚Äôt understand leverage my friend
I loose my seed in no time as well, my partner isn‚Äôt very happy.
They‚Äôve been doing this for a while. Many Bitcoin whales are black rock and vanguard as well as many other hedge funds
Elon should have banned that account. After all, he hates the SEC
They are saying that the phone number associated with the SEC account was compromised, and then go on to say they didn‚Äôt have 2FA enabled, so what did the number being compromised have to do with it?
*password* it's easier to remember.
Lmao.
The SEC Inspector General‚Äôs office does not- I‚Äôve already filed a complaint with them to investigate this
Lucky you. I wish I got the live experience too
punters rekt. mission accomplished.
The actual ETF demand absolutely isn‚Äôt for obvious reasons. But I‚Äôm sort of wondering what impact this will have‚Ä¶like will the market be like ‚Äúmehhh cool‚Ä¶we‚Äôve done this already‚Äù and pump 5% or is it going to crank?
It's defs not priced ins
Exactly. Would have said hacked. But said compromised. Very telling.
Is ETF approval good or bad for bitcoin as a whole?
It's going to rip , then drop , then level until the halving., thus history repeats itself
And the dump wasn‚Äôt a rush for the exits it‚Äôs rotation into Ethereum so more bullish risk.
Of course it dumped there was huge sell wall at 48k over $50 mil. in shorts.
I watched the market live as it happened. I immediately checked myself to see it was fake. It only took me about 30 seconds to realize the X account was hacked. I would imagine other investors saw the same and reversed their orders, coupled with other investors selling at a profit. Together, this caused the price to drop and find it's way back to correction. BTC will rally hard upon the ETF approval tomorrow. Either way, BTC halving is coming this April, which is 3 months away from now.
The screenshots are from different timezones.
They did.  Sim swap no 2FA.
Did it crash before or after the follow up tweet that alerted everyone that the ETF was not approved?
I don‚Äôt think so, look at the tweets the account liked during those few minutes
Yeah that's what I was thinking, or a formatting test tweet gone wrong
They need to find out who's offering them the best bribes.
They've given a list of candidates time to get their shit in order. A fair process.
Cramer hasn't gotten his period yet.
Hellauva return if you guess the delay of the etf 650% now
The deadline they gave themselves for approving or denying at least 1 out of the 11 pending Bitcoin ETF applications is *today*, 01/10/2024

They may also just extend their own deadline
Unless you want to manipulate it twice
haha, i didn‚Äôt even think about that, but i absolutely would not put it past him. he‚Äôs burning obscene amounts of money fast yet controls a platform that can quickly move markets.

his crypto assets can be anonymous. 

it‚Äôs a lot easier to get away with manipulating crypto than actual securities. i‚Äôm sure he already thought of, like, shorting nike and tweeting something racist from their account hah
Could be. Checks lots of boxes.
That was a joke by rollbit
Starting off with a bag (for some!)
The SEC is compromised
Don‚Äôt you fucking tease me like this.
This is my theory too
Guess that what happens when you mix boomers with tech.
He tweeted not approved
Not like it's the same thing bro
Facts
BTC was falling after the secgov tweet. So it didn't "pump"

It actually went higher after the hoax was announced by Gensler
Seriously. We‚Äôre still in the ‚Äòmeet me outside the saloon at high noon for a standoff‚Äô phase of bitcoin and people think we‚Äôre already at the ‚ÄòAI, quantum computing‚Äô phase yet. No rules apply yet
So get up, get, get, get down
the SEC is a joke in yo town
They should charge Garry with fraud for misleading tweets

It‚Äôs possible.
What if you want to retire next week? ü•≤
It pumped for like 3 minutes after the fake tweet posted at 11 minutes past the hour, and then tanked before it was even revealed it was a fake tweet. It took 15 minutes for the correction, issued at 26 minutes past the hour. That was the inflection point of the dive.
Got a real life experiment right there
People always ask that question, nobody really knows Paulie.
I sold yesterday, waiting for a bigger drop
I wish it would. I wanna accumulate
My thoughts exactly.
He has such a hard on for hating Bitcoin and crypto.
He says under a bitcoin pump and dump from fake news post...
They wanted to see how the market would react for when they do announce itüòÜ
Seems very unlikely
Images were taken from people who took screenshots in different timezones. Soooo.. time is defaulting to the different locations. Difference in time is actually 15 mintues.
Time zone differences. Either screenshotted from different timezones, or posted from different timezones.
Taking one for the team bro
That's disgusting
Bitcoin dumped to $46K!

So much fake drama. This shit doesn't matter until the halving anyway.
And yet it was SEC plan to manipulate the market
Fuck you‚Äôre right ain‚Äôt ya
Could have been the buttcoin crowd or another anti-bitcoin agent making a last ditched effort to provoke the SEC to play the market manipulation card.
Someone hacks a US government Twitter/X account and posts disinformation.  Cryptobros blame the US government for manipulation.  Sounds about right....  Why not start with the team at Twitter/X??????
Monero is dead. Delistings happening left and right, at the lowest volume in history
Who owns Twitter and has admin privileges, and like crypto, and is known to pump and dump?
Gary: "you were meant to schedule it for TOMORROW"
An intern will get blamed and punished for this shitshow, I bet.
Not really, it only got to 48k by the time people realised it was fake.
yeah the first 10 minutes
Damn you Obama!!!!
He‚Äôs to smart to go to jail for that. Whoever did it caused $300M USD in liquidations
Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me lol. Master manipulator
I‚Äôve been looking for a trading algorithm bot, can you send me some info?
Can you invest 401k, Roth IRA, etc into those?
They don't manage a lot of money compared to the US market. They don't have nearly as great of offerings as Capitalist US. It is that simple. Google GDP by country. If you have a country with a GDP of 120million how much capital do you think its citizens are going to invest in a BTC ETF? Now imagine a country with 10-100x that.

How many foreign bank accounts or stocks do you own? probably 0. like most of the world. Only a Bitcoin Maxi would think about jumping through hoops to leave the bread and butter markets to invest in some small foreign ETF, except even they wouldn't because they know its smarter to just buy BTC and store it on a cold wallet.

Also US citizens loose a lot of benefits when investing internationally
People are dumb ü§∑
EU people sometimes have more and better access to US money markets than even some of their neighbouring countries' money markets.

US is where the world money's at. That's why companies all over the world don't just list on their home SE, but also in US.
It was the cybertruck, talking shit
Waiting for market close
The God Candle shall lead us to the promised land üïØÔ∏è
Who owns Twitter? 

‚ÄúThe tweet came from inside the building‚Äù
That‚Äôs automated on twitter
Twitter automatically adds the Bitcoin emoji to tweets that use the #Bitcoin hashtag
The emoji is what tipped me off
Speculation is that it was supposed to be a scheduled tweet to go out tomorrow at that time but it was announced a day early because of a date screw up. So then the sec tried to backpedal and say it was hacked.
If this doesn‚Äôt make you want to have complete control of your hard earned üí∞üíµü§ë‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Gary should be called before congress if the IP that posted was in his office.
Until you want to sell some and you need a bank for handling your transaction lol
I legitimately bought more btc to move to cold storage on this development. I think I'm finally learning.
lol pumps 7%ish and pulls back 2%ish and the sky falls.
> What you mean pumped and dumped? Today BTC touched ATH since last cycle and didn't dump even 5%.

It dumped more than 5% from the peak, just because it bounced back up a bit doesn't change that... the people that got liquidated in those couple minutes would love to believe you tho.

And the shorts :p. Liquidate aaaallllll the leverage traders.
Good call, and for future reference remember that anything that sounds too good to be true pretty much always is, no matter how much hype you see for it.
No gains? Damn yeah you should get out of it man, you honestly suck at it :/
Damn 4 years and no profits? You have been doing everything wrong then. Ive been here since early 2021 and im extremely appreciative of what I have made
Buy high sell low
Not really, sell to someone else
No one's gonna convince you to stay. Go out. Bye
[deleted]
How is this even possible just dca into btc and eth and youre set
Crypto is all speculation aka straight up gambling so accept that before investing a penny. Also don‚Äôt invest a penny you can not afford to lose. 

I‚Äôve been in about as long as you and last month made more profit (realized gain because I cashed out unlike in the past where once I hit 3x I was waiting for 4x then 5x then lose it all). Greed is a bitch lol this time around I cashed out when my exit on solana and avax hit (my target was 3x). If you do that with crypto I think there is money to be made but otherwise just stick with bitcoin. It will be slow gains and won‚Äôt make you a millionaire but it‚Äôs better than a savings account if you‚Äôre ok with not thinking about or touching the money for many years to come.
I don‚Äôt believe the SEC would hashtag Bitcoin. I can be wrong though
I don't think so at all. I cant picture the SEC wording it like that especially the Gary "quote" at the bottom
The picture would not be GG smiling. That should have been the sign.
If it does end up happening tomorrow, my money is on this being a timed Tweet set for the wrong day. The timing would line up with right around the time the East Coast is waking up.
*bitcoin
It's because they are in crypto they think everything is a fraud for the exact reason you mentioned. One of the premise of Crypto is the open ledger , it's not crypto itself that is a fraud because it can't get anymore transparent without wallet doxxing.
Because the majority of the people u talking about ALSO think the election was stolen from Trump. Ever since social media began, people have gradually gotten worse with making up their own delusional realities. No matter the amount of evidence, they can go to some online community with an echo chamber of other people who have or want to believe in the same delusional reality. It makes people feel smart or empowered to "know" something secret that the masses are unaware of. Conspiracy theories are perfect for them, because they can't be disproven, theories are simply ideas/thoughts. You can't disprove an idea...
"shares"
You have to figure out who did it first. If they actually had a person, I'm sure there are at least a few laws the United States could come up with to charge the person if they were a US citizen
You don't even know if it's being rejected tomorrow. Jumping to some pretty wild conclusions here.
This is the right answer. $1k up and $1k down? Doesn‚Äôt even trigger an alert for me, just market movement.
This is a pump and dump. A small one but the verticality of the chart on both directions on such small timelines makes it a clear market reaction on both parts. It is not a dump from where we are buuuut it is a dump of the pump.

Yeah no doubt.  Did twitter execs conspire to limit or censor news items in the past? 

Yes.  However, they did it under the auspices of best practices, trying to be advertiser-friendly, you know, as all business executives act.  Could their censorship be perceived as political bias?

Sure.  They had a personal bias like everyone else, and one side of the political divide consistently wants to post the kind of hate speech that advertisers hate, so it makes it easy to censor, and then they can scream "victimisation".

Musk has sought to amplify the right wing, and to that end has employed the cherished fascist tactic of disinformation, misinformation, undermining and discrediting empirical data and its analysis, and just generally muddying the waters to improve their political chances.  In that sense, it's not a far out conspiracy theory to think that this was orchestrated by some right wing party looking to make a quick profit or just discredit government regulatory bodies in general, but as always, the fascists assiduously maintain plausible deniability.
4pm announcement
They can‚Äòt delay the ARK application further. It‚Äòs the last date for it.
People believe Gensler is anti-crypto, people are dumb
You clearly don't know how "hacking" works. It's not in the movies like how they "bypass the secure system blah blah". Most compromised accounts on social media is a result of human error/social engineering, not some bullcrap matrix-style hacking.
I don't think it does. That's just one more dumb thing the SEC has done, which is actually a good reason to move currency out of the hands of government.
The sec knew exactly what they were doing.
Any company stock would react the same to this level of news
I mean, it‚Äôs a tweet by the governing body of securities and exchange. Any other asset with ETF hype would have responded the same way. I think you can blame the SEC for not having activated 2FA on their government account; illegal levels of insecurity.
This is straight up incorrect. There is a reason the SEC considers tweets about stocks by executives of companies to be legally binding. See the purchase of Twitter. Or the Elon TSLA tweet.
Literally the entrie stock market was going haywire for four years under trump thanks to his tweets and news. Also are you acting like BTC is not up like 50 billion percent and pretty much anybody who bought prior to 2020 is more than double on their investment?
You mean like elons tweets causing individual stocks to go crazy ? Ya we should get rid of the stock market tooü§°
...in 5 minutes.
The SEC needs _more_ authority, not less. What you're suggesting would be a free for all for wealthy people to corrupt the market far beyond even the problems we have today.
My thought too. Accidentally posted a day early
The asset class or the government?
Really? So I guess when I bought back in 14' I wasn't thinking straight üòÜ
I don‚Äôt want to agree with you, but I do. If an Elon tweet or a fake SEC twitter post can move the needle this much it‚Äôs a FUCKING JOKE. I am waiting for the day that a TWEET doesn‚Äôt move the market up or down. When that day comes I will be happy.
True but it‚Äôs the same joke seen in the US internal markets which have been manipulated for years üòÇ only difference is international eyes on crypto meaning the mean level of investor experience is lower
They are images captured by people from different timezones.
Kinda like NASA knowing their shuttles would eventually blow up.
You can just say dogecoin, you don‚Äôt have to be vague
This would be the best news ever for those looking for some more sweet DCA time
Gensler used his personal account to say the SEC account was hacked. 30 mins later they regained access to SEC account
The clarification tweet was at 4:26pm...
Asking the right questions. Are the screen shots from two different people in two different time zones maybe?
You don‚Äôt add up. Time zones
Different people in different time zones took the screenshots.
There's many people with millions at play here.

That $2k swing offers a multi thousand/million $ gain followed by an immediate buy back in $4k cheaper, essentially tripling that gain.
you answered your own question LOL
Musk would of just tweeted it himself on his website, Twitter
That would be an insane violation of law and ruin the trust of the entire platform. Remember when spez almost ruined reddit when he admitted to editing a users response at the database level? If you edit a post on behalf of a user you become a publisher not a service
screenshots are from people in different time zones.
Governments shouldn‚Äôt even use it.  People need to go back to typing in a full url and host their own content
No blame business using trading bots that react off news from X or other news sources.
Been hearing this for years
Same could be said for so many other investments. 
What the public is willing to pay due to scarcity alone does not need to be logical, just profitable.
This exact post has been written over and over for 15 years....the wake up call is its been 15 years BTC  isn't going anywhere.
Is the irony of ‚Äúno inherent value‚Äù totally lost on you?
Normie Alert! üö®

Stay safe tonight

(u2 - walk on tune, only had to change one word from the chorus lol)
it's awesome, and is what will draw people to come back around here as a primary destination for crypto conversations. The race-to-post with a link just makes reddit another comment section beneath the article. OC like this makes me so happy
You are kidding, right?
Absolutely was staged. 

Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they use this ‚Äúmishap‚Äù today as an excuse to not approve the spot etf application
Makes it better as a commodity, but not as a utility imo. Which is tbh the direction BTC is headed anyways. I believe there are much faster, cleaner, and sometimes more private cryptocurrencies out there.
Yes
Could be, hard to tell honestly.. But what is clear is that there are lots of sell orders at 48k, and unless the ETFs start piling in money immediately upon approval, the bulls won't win that one by the looks of it.       
Also if I was an ETF and had clients to think of, I wouldn't immediately throw in all of my funds when the market is extended first of all, nor when everyone seems to be speculating, I think I would just wait a bit for it to calm down, or maybe "dca"           
But clearly Gary's tweet saying it wasn't yet approved saved the bulls, because it was dumping hard right up to that point, weirdly enough.. Looks like the "sell the news" whales all set their sell orders around 48k, and we only just tapped it today
Crashed after like 3 mins. The correction was issued 15 min after

So the correction potentially caused the dump to stop actually
You don‚Äôt get to be the richest man in the world by passing up chances to make money in underhanded ways.  Plus he had some trouble with the sec over some tweets as I recall.  Hmmm
Hackers would have tweeted XRP is officially a commodity and will get an ETF first. That would be way more embarrasing for the SEC and hilarious.
It is the same, attention to details
Yeah. Can't truss it.
Buy lottery tickets and pray to whatever deity you believe in.
>  then tanked before it was even revealed it was a fake tweet

Gotta wonder if institutions immediately texted their contacts in the SEC and found out it was bogus. Not like you can call that insider information.
from what I see it not gonna happen
You had it under 20k for quite a long time. And you had that ftx dump on top of that (when most quality alts held their June 2022 lows).

You guys always wish for dumps and when they come, you're too afraid to pull the trigger, wishing and preaching about DCA into a downtrend which was proven time and time again to be inferior to lump sum aping into momentum.

How many of you got finessed into this mantra (-EV play aka DCA) without doing your own statistical analysis? It's not that hard.

Don't be influencers exit liquidity.
you mean tether is fraud lol
Exactly this, thank you.
Account hacked and recovered in like 15 minutes, that's some impressive turnaround.
Haha yeah
It‚Äôs insane pump actually, just a twitter account, and only 10 minutes of fake news, and bears said this is priced in lol that it will dump after news
I've got stuff set up with a few of the common ones, Cryptohopper, HaasOnline, Trality, Gunbot, and so on. Cryptohopper is a good beginner platform to learn with, imo. When it came to this particular snafu, the bot I have on Gunbot is the one that caught it best... but none of them got hurt.

Just takebit slow and try out some platforms. Set up some bots, give them a few hundred bucks and a couple months and see what they do with it. Pick the best, tweek the settings, and run again. Repeat until you have one really good bot.

Then let it run.
Yes Canadians can invest in BTC ETFs in our retirement accounts which are called RRSP and TFSA
Depends on the 401k, but yes, I can use the Brokerage Link feature of my fidelity 401k to invest in foreign securities.

I can also use it to buy greyscale bitcoin trust (or whatever it‚Äôs called).
Why would the SEC use hash tags though. Also posting an image of quote from Gary Gensler, what.
I‚Äôm not sure the SEC would use a hashtag in this instance, though. The account does routinely use hashtags to promote various things (#SECSmallBiz, #WorldInvestorWeek) but would they signal boost a company or asset as part of an announcement? I doubt it. I don‚Äôt think this was legit.
I don‚Äôt know he said ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt sound like a clerical error in the office also he said SEC hasn‚Äôt approved it which would be lie if approved and waiting a day or two or three to announce it?
How is a government account getting hacked better than simply releasing a tweet too early? They aren‚Äôt saving face by saying they got hacked. They are trying to legitimize a space that attracts a ton of hackers. It‚Äôs not a good look to say you got hacked
The other folks in Congress would be mighty angry to know they didn't get the first shot at insider trading
5% swings hahaha were just getting started
[deleted]
I don't think they'd use an emoji rofl
I'm seriously thinking nothing will be announced setting more FUD just to shake out the weak holders.

This will be when they will be buying.

And then when it is finally announced, they will already be ahead. 
I bet even this BAWK announcement that was then labeled as "we were hacked" is bullshit.


They are playing a game, and the ETF is approved...


Someone tell me how the fuck the SEC gets hacked?
I'm really suprised my comment is getting upvotes. Maybe there's a lot of sane people in here but we just keep quiet and roll our eyes for the most part.
How many Bitcoin stocks do you own?
Everything is fascist lately. I wonder how the actual fascists out there feel about all this fascist appropriation?? Nobody ever thinks about their feelings.
"Fascist"?.. Sigh. The newest overused buzzword. Mussolini must be rolling in his grave.
Maybe you're dumb
But I've seen Hackers and Swordfish hundreds of times!
Valid points.
Bitcoin is extremely volatile. There‚Äôs a reason why people stay in the stock market. It‚Äôs a lot easier to read the crashes, and they don‚Äôt happen as often. Crypto, including bitcoin is completely chaotic. No one knows what‚Äôs gonna happen one day to the next.
[deleted]
Perhaps but why a grinning picture of Gensler and the BTC hashtag.  Where‚Äôs the link to the official approvals for each ETF?
Gov to me. This has 0% to do with Bitcoin or crypto
Bitcoin pumped like‚Ä¶ 1%. Stocks have moved way more than that on a tweet.
https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/23/ap-tweet-hack-wall-street-freefall

Tweets have always moved markets
That day will never come as Bitcoin relies 100% on the trust of the public in order to keep a value. The moment the trust is gone so is the value. There is no underlying fundamental value like with stocks so the moment the majority of idio... I mean "investors" refuse to buy any more BTC it's over.
As a Tesla stock holder, I‚Äôm waiting for a day that a tweet can‚Äôt swing that either.

This isn‚Äôt a good argument for approving or denying bitcoin.
It has to be this. It's the only way.
I assume, OP took the screenshots themselves.
Rational people would not blame elon for a regulatory commission not having internal control of their own twitter account.  Its much easier to blame muhh capitalism.
It will continue to go higher as long as people are Willing to pay higher than the last person that is selling it to them
How do you feel knowing people like this can vote drive and buy a firearm
There will always be a faster, cleaner, and sometimes more private cryptocurrency out there. It all can built on Bitcoin. Not the "clean" part but I'll take security any day.
Interesting, good to know.  That‚Äôd definitely indicate a ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù dip occurred (and will prob happen again for the real announcement).  Bummer.
Possible, but the whipsaw reaction is pretty typical for major news, and it seemed to me like people put their 'sell the news' plans to action until it was revealed to be fake
I mean that, and the fact the SEC does not just casually announce things like this on Twitter. So it could never have been real because that‚Äôs not how it‚Äôs done

This isn't some rando calling up a support line and sitting on hold so he can do some bullshit verification. This is a government rep calling a specific person to have it fixed immediately.
Well technically it has dumped.

From gambling to trading, my experience over the years
Hello everyone,

I want to share with you some of the concepts behind the algorithmic trading setup I‚Äôve developed over the years, and take you through my journey up until today.

First, a little about myself: I‚Äôm 35 years old and have been working as a senior engineer in analytics and data for over 13 years, across various industries including banking, music, e-commerce, and more recently, a well-known web3 company.

Before getting into cryptocurrencies, I played semi-professional poker from 2008 to 2015, where I was known as a ‚Äúreg-fish‚Äù in cash games. For the poker enthusiasts, I had a win rate of around 3-4bb/100 from NL50 to NL200 over 500k hands, and I made about ‚Ç¨90,000 in profits during that time ‚Äî sounds like a lot but the hourly rate was something like 0.85‚Ç¨/h over all those years lol. Some of that money helped me pay my rent in Paris during 2 years and enjoy a few wild nights out. The rest went into crypto, which I discovered in October 2017.

I first heard about Bitcoin through a poker forum in 2013, but I didn‚Äôt act on it at the time, as I was deeply focused on poker. As my edge in poker started fading with the increasing availability of free resources and tutorials, I turned my attention to crypto. In October 2017, I finally took the plunge and bought my first Bitcoin and various altcoins, investing around ‚Ç¨50k. Not long after, the crypto market surged, doubling my money in a matter of weeks.

Around this time, friends introduced me to leveraged trading on platforms with high leverage, and as any gambler might, I got hooked. By December 2017, with Bitcoin nearing $18k, I had nearly $900k in my account‚Äî$90k in spot and over $800k in perps. I felt invincible and was seriously questioning the need for my 9-to-6 job, thinking I had mastered the art of trading and desiring to live from it.

However, it wasn‚Äôt meant to last. As the market crashed, I made reckless trades and lost more than $700k in a single night while out with friends. I‚Äôll never forget that night. I was eating raclette, a cheesy French dish, with friends, and while they all had fun, I barely managed to control my emotions, even though I successfuly stayed composed, almost as if I didn‚Äôt fully believe what had just happened. It wasn‚Äôt until I got home that the weight of the loss hit me. I had blown a crazy amount of money that could have bought me a nice apartment in Paris.

The aftermath was tough. I went through the motions of daily life, feeling so stupid, numb and disconnected, but thankfully, I still had some spot investments and was able to recover a portion of my losses.

Fast forward to 2019: with Bitcoin down to $3k, I cautiously re-entered the market with leverage, seeing it as an opportunity. This time, I was tried to be more serious about risk management, and I managed to turn $60k into $400k in a few months. Yet, overconfidence struck again and after a series of loss, I stopped the strict rule of risk management I used to do and tried to revenge trade with a crazy position ... which ended liquidated. I ended up losing everything during the market retrace in mid-2019. Luckily, I hadn‚Äôt touched my initial investment of ‚Ç¨50k and took a long vacation, leaving only $30k in stablecoins and 20k in alts, while watching Bitcoin climb to new highs.

Why was I able to manage my risk properly while playing poker and not while trading ? Perhaps the lack of knowledge and lack of edge ? The crazy amounts you can easily play for while risking to blow your account in a single click ? It was at this point that I decided to quit manual leverage trading and focus on building my own algorithmic trading system. Leveraging my background in data infrastructure, business analysis, and mostly through my poker experience. I dove into algo trading in late 2019, starting from scratch.

You might not know it, but poker is a valuable teacher for trading because both require a strong focus on finding an edge and managing risk effectively. In poker, you aim to make decisions based on probabilities, staying net positive over time, on thousands of hands played, by taking calculated risks and folding when the odds aren‚Äôt in your favor. Similarly, in trading, success comes from identifying opportunities where you have an advantage and managing your exposure to minimize losses. Strict risk management, such as limiting the size of your trades, helps ensure long-term profitability by preventing emotional decisions from wiping out gains.

It was decided, I would now engage my time in creating a bot that will trade without any emotion, with a constant risk management and be fully statistically oriented. I decided to implement a strategy that needed to think in terms of ‚Äúnet positive expected value‚Äù... (a term that I invite you to read about if you are not familiar with).

In order to do so, I had to gather the data, therefore I created this setup:

* I purchased a VPS on OVH, for 100$/month,
* I collected OHLCV data using python with CCXT on Bybit and Binance, on 1m, 15m, 1h, 1d and 1w timeframes. ‚Äî> this is the best free source library, I highly recommend it if you guys want to start your own bot
* I created any indicator I could read on online trading classes using python libraries
* I saved everything into a standard MySQL database with 3+ To data available
* I normalized every indicators into percentiles, 1 would be the lowest 1% of the indicator value, 100 the highest %.
* I created a script that will gather for each candle when it will exactly reach out +1%, +2%, +3%‚Ä¶ -1%, -2%, -3%‚Ä¶ and so on‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ This last point is very important as I wanted to run data analysis and see how a trade could be profitable, ie. be net value positive. As an example, collecting each time one candle would reach -X%/+X% has made really easy to do some analysis foreach indicator.

Let's dive into two examples... I took two indicators: the RSI daily and the Standard Deviation daily, and over several years, I analyzed foreach 5-min candles if the price would reach first +5% rather than hitting -5%. If the win rate is above 50% is means this is a good setup for a long, if it's below, it's a good setup for a short. I have split the indicators in 10 deciles/groups to ease the analysis and readibility: "1" would contain the lowest values of the indicator, and "10" the highest.

Results:

For the Standard Deviation, it seems that the lower is the indicator, the more likely we will hit +5% before -5%.

https://preview.redd.it/7g4k2qldtkod1.png?width=399&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f030a1c5c128e4eeedb3b1f14ed0baeecbd4a10

On the other hand, for the RSI, it seems that the higher is the indicator, the more likely we will hit +5% before -5%.

In a nutshell, my algorithm will monitor those statistics foreach cryptocurrency, and on many indicators. In the two examples above, if the bot was analyzing those metrics and only using those two indicators, it will likely try to long if the RSI is high and the STD is low, whereas it would try to short if the RSI was low and STD was high.

This example above is just for a risk:reward=1, one of the core aspects of my approach is understanding breakeven win rates based on many risk-reward ratios. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the theoretical win rates you need to achieve for different risk-reward setups in order to break even (excluding fees):

    ‚Ä¢Risk: 10, Reward: 1 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 90%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 5, Reward: 1 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 83%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 3, Reward: 1 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 75%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 2, Reward: 1 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 66%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 1, Reward: 1 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 50%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 1, Reward: 2 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 33%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 1, Reward: 3 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 25%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 1, Reward: 5 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 17%
    ‚Ä¢Risk: 1, Reward: 10 ‚Üí Breakeven win rate: 10%

My algorithm‚Äôs goal is to consistently beat these breakeven win rates for any given risk-reward ratio that I trade while using technical indicators to run data analysis.

Now that you know a bit more about risk rewards and breakeven win rates, it‚Äôs important to talk about how many traders in the crypto space fake large win rates. A lot of the copy-trading bots on various platforms use strategies with skewed risk-reward ratios, often boasting win rates of 99%. However, these are highly misleading because their risk is often 100+ times the reward. A single market downturn (a ‚Äúblack swan‚Äù event) can wipe out both the bot and its followers. Meanwhile, these traders make a lot of money in the short term while creating the illusion of success. I‚Äôve seen numerous bots following this dangerous model, especially on platforms that only show the percentage of winning trades, rather than the full picture. I would just recommend to stop trusting any bot that looks ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù ‚Äî or any strategy that seems to consistently beat the market without any drawdown.

Anyways‚Ä¶ coming back to my bot development, interestingly, the losses I experienced over the years had a surprising benefit. They forced me to step back, focus on real-life happiness, and learn to be more patient and developing my very own system without feeling the absolute need to win right away. This shift in mindset helped me view trading as a hobby, not as a quick way to get rich. That change in perspective has been invaluable, and it made my approach to trading far more sustainable in the long run.

In 2022, with more free time at my previous job, I revisited my entire codebase and improved it significantly. My focus shifted mostly to trades with a 1:1 risk-to-reward ratio, and I built an algorithm that evaluated over 300 different indicators to find setups that offered a win rate above 50%. I was working on it days and nights with passion, and after countless iterations, I finally succeeded in creating a bot that trades autonomously with a solid risk management and a healthy return on investment. And only the fact that it was live and kind of performing was already enough for me, but luckily, it‚Äôs even done better since it eventually reached the 1st place during few days versus hundreds of other traders on the platform I deployed it. Not gonna lie this was one of the best period of my ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù life and best achievement I ever have done. As of today, the bot is trading 15 different cryptocurrencies with consistent results, it has been live since February on live data, and I just recently deployed it on another platform.

I want to encourage you to trust yourself, work hard, and invest in your own knowledge. That‚Äôs your greatest edge in trading. I‚Äôve learned the hard way to not let trading consume your life. It's easy to get caught up staring at charts all day, but in the long run, this can take a toll on both your mental and physical health. Taking breaks, focusing on real-life connections, and finding happiness outside of trading not only makes you healthier and happier, but it also improves your decision-making when you do trade. Stepping away from the charts can provide clarity and help you make more patient, rational decisions, leading to better results overall.

If I had to create a summary of this experience, here would be the main takeaways:

* Trading success doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, stick to your process, keep refining it, and trust that time will reward your hard work.
* detach from emotions: whether you are winning or losing, stick to your plan, emotional trading is a sure way to blow up your account.
* take lessons from different fields like poker, math, psychology or anything that helps you understand human behavior and market dynamics better.
* before going live with any strategy, test it across different market conditions,thereis no substitute for data and preparation
* step away when needed, whether in trading or life, knowing when to take a break is crucial. It‚Äôll save your mental health and probably save you a lot of money.
* not entering a position is actually a form of trading: I felt too much the urge of trading 24/7 and took too many losses b y entering positions because I felt I had to, delete that from your trading and you will already be having an edge versus other trades
* keep detailed records of your trades and analyze them regularly, this helps you spot patterns and continuously improve, having a lot of data will help you considerably.

I hope that by sharing my journey, it gives you some insights and helps boost your own trading experience. No matter how many times you face losses or setbacks, always believe in yourself and your ability to learn and grow. The road to success isn‚Äôt easy, but with hard work, patience, and a focus on continuous improvement, you can definitely make it. Keep pushing forward, trust your process, and never give up.
Nice read, but doesn't calculating percentiles for all backtesting data seems like a way to look forward and overfit your models?
Without disclosing your strategy, I have some questions. Would it be amazing if you could reply:


1 - I noticed cryto follows more trending than other assets. Is your strategy performing the same way in trending markets rather than side ways?

2 - If trending is the base of your strategy, have you back tested it in trending assets with less volatility but that you could eventually use more leverage per position as for example, S&P 500?

3 - I didn't fully understand if you use machine learning or systematic programming?

4 - In case you use machine learning, do you believe LSTM is the best for these types of predictions, or will you recommend something else?

5 - As an informative thing, I have, in my mind, an idea that hasn't been fully developed yet, which basically is to normalize prices based on ATR, and don't use price at all, where I will predict movements in factors of ATR, so that it can work intraday on the different trading sessions: Asia, London, New York for Gold, do you think it is the right path or am I overcomplicating it? Basically, my idea is that a model may find more patterns when data is:

+1.5ATR, -0.5ATR, 0.0ATR, etc. Where the number of columns of the model will be, let's say, the last 10 (ATR) prices on a given timeframe.

Thanks for your post. It is really informative. ;)
It doesn‚Äôt sound like you forward tested your strats.  Every ‚Äústatistics‚Äù based strat like these ones I ever tested failed a walk forward.  Good luck.
Wow just wow. Very impressive.
What would you advise for someone who is a complete beginner in trading (and i mean a beginner in everything)? What would you do if you had to start over to eventually know how to build a bot in trading.
Thanks for your story, but you probably make more profit per month with subscribers and copytrade fees than your overall YTD profit.
Cherry picking indicators from a massive amount of indicators with massive modeling efforts sounds like a sure way to overfit to said indicators.


That said I do feel like booting up my old crypto botting venture..
Wow , you‚Äôre one crazy genius. Thanx for this!
Hi, Im a us stock option trader. I make some decent profit over the last 3 years, albeit very small. my underlying are all stocks, so no crypto but trading basics are the same I suppose. I'm looking for ways to learn from r/algotrading better assist to make informed decisions such as position size, stock selection, strike price, expiration date DTE, etc. 

i recently dipped toe to python (w/ help from Chatgpt) to extract live data, I'm looking for ways to improve my trading. Any recommendations/suggestions would be appreciated. Thx
So the record shows your bot, starting from mid last year, has had drawdown to -20%, didn't do much until recently, had a big step up most recently. Other than the lackluster performance, it doesn't jive with your portrait of statistical advantage, does it?
Thank you. Keeping at it
Thank you for these tips and also thank you very much for sharing your story.
>¬†I built an algorithm that evaluated over 300 different indicators

Wow!!! I feel like a bit of an underachiever now but that's impressive.
Thanks for sharing! Great read!

I'm always curious about stats. Would you mind sharing how many trades does your bot make and what is expected value per trade?
Im stoked, thanks for sharing a small part of your lifestory, fellow builder here that has an on off relationship with building his algos and finally wants and needs to come back to finishing my system
Thanks for sharing. Don‚Äôt love seeing all the hate and skepticism you‚Äôre getting from some. You‚Äôre just trying to help and spread some good energy. Everything you said makes sense and I don‚Äôt see any holes or scamminess. The statistical approach you laid out checks out for me. I think about things very similarly. Really glad to hear about your success. Gives myself and others optimism in our own journeys. Keep up the good work!!

PS check out Cursor AI
Hello, congrats, can you give us a little bit more of info?

What was your first platform and why you moved to the one you are using now? What is the one you use now? Drawbacks and benefics?

Which yield you have right now? I guess you mean it is steady daily? intra-week? montly? yearly? Can you give us some real data on profit % on months since Feb?
This is pure gold, never delete this post please
You should write a book with this storyüò©
This is incredible. I‚Äôm a beginner and I‚Äôve only do a few pinescripts and MQL5 EAs. Anymore tips for starting out when developing everything from scratch. I saw you used Python. How did you develop all those indicators? 300 is crazy so how did you even come up with the list for the strategies? Dumb question but if you had to list everything in order what would you do first and how would that help the next step in the process?
Absolute banger of a piece thank you for your insight ! Have you ever used Cumulative Volume Delta as an indicator ? Do you have any recommendations on that front ? Thanks in advance.
can you further explain what do you mean by breaking indicators into percentile? and what does 1-10 means for example rsi 14?

also if you dont use ML, do you test each and every 308 indicator?
I liked it OP great work
Nice job.
Hey OP

Thanks what an interesting read ! Love the lessons you described and shared that you‚Äôve learnt across this journey. If I wanted to copy trade the bot, how can I do this ? Is it available on any platforms ?

Thanks!
But why in Paris ? This is not the same city as before .
If we were back to 2019, with both experience you had ( poker and algo trading) would you try to start a career in poker or algo trading ? And could you explain why ? 
Thanks for your time :)
Thanks for sharing. I find similarities to myself there. 
My main challenge in algotrading is figuring out the right combination of indicators. I find a lot that adding indicator X to my existing algo might improve  it, adding indicator Y improves it, but both together don't. Not quite sure how to and if to combine them
Any thoughts?
thanks for the read! how did you / do you backtest your strategies? did you design your own engine? how many variations / deviations per indicator you backtest at once?
Thanks for the detailed share.
Hey, thanks for sharing. Certainly one of the best posts here in a while with lot of valuable content.

I was wondering if your trades are purely based on 1D statistics (my understanding) or if you add price action to locate entry and exit points (support/resistance based on pivots, volume profile, monthly levels..). Thanks!

Wow - what an amazing read. This took me on a journey with my own trading career. I only now, after 7 years of trading am consistent in profits. So, you have a profitable system! I have no idea how to build a bot or anything like that (i've never studied it) but what i have done is taken an indicator (free) and tweaked that with risk management for it to yield 2% on my account value, a day. This has always been my goal! Making ¬£100 ten times in a day sounds so simple, but how difficult it was!!!! It only happened when i began thinking about what i was thinking about, deeply and asking myself all of the hard pressing questions. Funnily enough, it was when i started studying Prince2 that i saw the value in checking my system for improvements! Hats off to you! I would buy your system just because of the back story!!

I indeed over-fitted my models a lot back then haha! I was not initially very aware of what it was as I did not really studied machine learning and was lazy to but fortunately, when chatGPT came it helped me a lot understanding the concepts and making it easier for me to know what was badly conceived in my infrastructure.

Actually percentiles are indeed too wide to use, and I'm more using them to normalize each indicator's scale. But  this scaling system has to be carefully thought and adapted, as an example I used to create percentiles on volatility in 2020 when bitcoin was hyper-volatile compared to now. Let's consider that  back then that outliers would be a -10% or  +10% price movement intra-day. My percentile scale from 1 to 100 from back then would scale 1 a price movement  under -10% and 100 a move over  +10%, but this is not existing  anymore on  Bitcoin since the market isn't as volatile as before. So  I had  to review my system because scales were skewed. 

I won't go too much into the details on how  I reviewed the scales though, that's part of the "secret sauce" ...
I used a combination of ML models and weighted them by percentage. Since I trade on the 1-minute time frame, I realized that if I heavily weight models that are overfitting, they can predict very accurately. However, there is one model that produces good results but cannot predict the price precisely. I‚Äôm still unsure if overfitting affects the overall outcome. I might be wrong in weighting the overfitting model up to 60%.
1- My strategy is trying to find the best expected value for a given setup, and you said it correctly, trending in crypto is generally the way to go, my bot is trying to detect a trending pattern and follows it. However if the trend is bullish but we hit a resistance, it might take a swing short, and  vice versa if the trend was bearish, it  would try to long on a support. 

  
2- Unfortunately no, I am sticking to crypto as I am not familiar with the world of US market, I did not know where to find granular OHLCV data in lower than 1D periods. So nope, never tried on SP500 or more traditional markets.

  
3-  I tried  to use machine learning but I did not successfully make it, instead I have a homemade composite scoring on my indicators, rating indicators positively (long) or negatively (short) and the "magic formula"  will trigger  a  long  or short signal depending on the expected net  values. It's a homemade kind of  reinforcement learning.

4- I tried  neural networks and  other kind but never  successfully achieved anything, and also the big problem with machine learning models is that I do not understand them and  cannot  really master the  way to finetune parameters accurately. This is why  I do not use them. 

5- I'm not confident on the way Asia, London, NY ... sessions are  behaving  independently,  but yes, I can tell you that  you are on  something. Raw prices are generally bad to  be used as is, and ATR  is a really good indicator, at  least when it comes to crypto :)

hope this helps!
I am not sure why you think I did not. I do have an asynchronous system that analyze year by year optimal parameters and forecast how it performs over the next years, it helped me building a weight system for each of my indicators, a kind of ‚Äútrusting score‚Äù based on my rules.
It sounds like you overfit your backtests
Thank you for the kind words.   
First of all I would advise to keep away from futures/perp trading, there is too much temptation to trade with high leverage and blow your account. Only use perps if you know what you are doing and if you have a strategy. I paid it the high price back then and I regret it very much still today.

Now if I had to start over by learning trading at first, I would read/watch every day nice content about trading, this is your best way to learn, to copy-cat someone's thinking process and to later apply it to your own graphs. I still do watch some good youtubers, not to copy their trades but to see how they trade, inspire myself with new techniques and new indicators. Obviously at the beginning you might fall for influencers or stupid traders promoting their channels with titles like "HOW TO MAKE x10 EACH YEAR BY DAY TRADING" - just ignore those guys and pick modest ones, that have a way of thinking that suits you, and watch them everyday and compare their results to the market. 

Finally, if I had to start over at building a bot from scractch again, I would pass a fair amount of time on my infrastructure, I'm not a developer and it took me a very long time to achieve something fast enough to rely my algorithmic trading system on. So I would definitely learn much more about programming skills. And then basic maths. You can watch the video "The maths of winning in trading" from the youtube channel "the art of trading", I recommend this video to anyone that would like to start to understand basic maths and how to think in terms of "edge" in order to create a winning system. 

If you do not have any technical background, I prefer to be honest, it will be very difficult to build a bot from scratch. There some solutions like Pinescripts using tradingview, but I personally dislike it and I'm probably not the best to comment on it.

Hope this helps!
I actually don‚Äôt sell my bot for a subscription fees, only crooks are doing this. More and more platforms are opting for a performance fees instead, where only profits generated for your subscribers can generate you some profits as you take a cut on it.

That‚Äôs also why there is now a lot of traders with skewed win rates, so they can win a little profit on each closed trades and leverage this performance fee for them.
Depends on the way you cherry pick, back then I was only using indicators with strong performances and I indeed fell into overfitting! I improved the way I select my vindicators based on 1) their performances obvisouly, 2) how did they behave in bull, bear and range market (I have a selector based on the type of period we are in) and 3) based on the number of occurrences I have with this indicator's value.  
As an example, if indicator "A" provided me a winning rate of 60% in 2021,2022,2023 but 40% in 2024, I genuily prefer to select an indicator "B" that performed regularly at 55% in all those years.   
I'm able to create a min/max win rate by indicator, and based on this interval, you can create basic confidence intervals to predict as estimate win rate (with a confidence of 95% for example).

Some ideas on why to use a 95% confidence interval : [https://www.simplypsychology.org/confidence-interval.html#What-is-a-95-confidence-interval](https://www.simplypsychology.org/confidence-interval.html#What-is-a-95-confidence-interval)
‚ÄúCherry picking‚Äù is a great way to find performant indicators as long as you do properly validation and backtesting
He comments that he is ‚Äúnot here to promote his services‚Äù, and the next line is ‚Äúi charge a 20% fee‚Äù. lmao
Get historical data
Everything before 2024 was a live testing acvount, the 20% drawdown was due to a misconfiguration with over leverage (10x versus 3x as of today). I fixed that mid March, and since that date I‚Äôm up 70% with a drawdown of 15% while the market went through a -20% on bitcoin and -30%+ on some alts, so yes, I call that an edge until now ;). 

And I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs your point of your comment, I‚Äôm not here to brag or get any more subscribers, I‚Äôm here to share my experience and what I went through. From what it‚Äôs worth, having a live bot even under performing is something I‚Äôm really proud of. It started as a hobby to heal from the crazy losses I had, and it turned out to be a profitable hobby, at least until today.
Thank you!

I exactly have 77 unique indicators, and all of them are analyzed in 4 different timeframes: 15m, 1-hour, 1-day and 1-week. So that's a total of 308 indicators, I cheated a bit while writting this :)
[removed]
Thank you, I really appreciate your words mate!You cannot change some people‚Äôs minds, but that‚Äôs okay, I don‚Äôt need to prove them anything, all of want is talk about algotrading, which is the point of this forum..!
Hey sure!

I wanted to trade on the platform where my bot is deployed because I think they are the fairest for subscribers as each of those platforms provide either a z-score analyzing deeply each trader‚Äô trading style or by providing an access to the live positions on the other one. I always preferred transparency especially that it also forces you and challenges you to create a performing bot, as you are competing with other traders to win some visibility. Otherwise you do no exist. 

Platforms like Bybit for copy trading are a black box for the subscribers as it‚Äôs only showing winning rates and realized gains without disclosing unrealized pnl which could be really bad! I think this is misleading and intended, I did not want to be associated to this kind of trading platform.

For the live stats, since march, I have shared the winning % of my algo in this comment : https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/s/RdUUPESPQh

Otherwise you can access the live results of my bot through my profile by filtering on the last 6 months on the platform to have the full picture.

Hope this helps!
Thank you, I appreciate the comment! 

When it comes to developing everything on your own you need to have good technical skills. Python is not over-complex and it's used by a lot of people so you might always find someone that created libraries, free to use. 

For example, just by searching quickly right now, I found this library that provides technical indicators in python: [https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

Now, regarding the indicators, I have written this in another comment but  I only have 77 indicators, but they are constantly analyzed in different timeframes, so that's a bit more than 300 if you count them separately, haha!

Also, the most important  library I'm using is CCXT, it provided me a really easy way to use platform's API and collect OHLCV data as it provided a couple of examples. The documentation is clear, and I think that a lot of algo traders on crypto are using this library.

Now for the most important thing to achieve: 

- Create a database, or any other sustainable system that will help you analysing data

- Create your scripts to collect raw data (OHLCV) 

- Create your indicators in the desired timeframes you want to trade on. I do not suggest to trade under 15 minutes as it's very challenging to gather raw data, treat it and execute a trade accordingly to the open/close of the last bar you are  dealing with. The lower the timeframe, the harder

- Think of a system and test it (you will need a backtesting system, create your own or use a library online) 

- Repeat the last step until you found what you needed :) 

  
Good luck!
Hey sire, I actually did not implement the CVD since I was not really understanding its concept back then but I have other volume indicators like the OBV or the force index.
I cannot really help you on this one sorry, but just a quick insight I found while analyzing volume indicators, it only really worked when volatility AND volume is very low, other than that I did not really find them that useful except on high timeframes like the weekly chart
sorry as i dont quite understand the part where u normalize indicators into percentiles
I was young and living in the suburbs, all I wanted was to live in a big city, and definitely fell in love with Paris at the beginning. It‚Äôs different now ‚Ä¶ haha
It‚Äôs actually a very good and funny question. With my actual knowledge of poker I would not be able to win enough in order to professionally live from it, the level is really hard nowadays and especially in Europe since they increased the rake (the commmission taken by the poker website on each hand - or tournament if playing mtt). It‚Äôs very difficult and needs a lot of (boring) work today to be profitable at poker, lurking during hours at various variance simulator in order to play the perfect GTO type of game. Not gonna lie, it‚Äôs not fun. However, if you give me my actual knowledge ok poker and I could teleport back in 2006 or 2007 when poker started to rise online, it would be a snap and could have won millions I genuinely think. But today, and even in 2019, I would choose algotrading because you can dig into data really much more, find an edge using data, or even just have fun developing your strategy. But to be honest it‚Äôs also really hard to find a winning strategy that you can live from, it requires a lot of effort and energy before generating revenues. So that‚Äôs a very difficult question. If I did not have my professional life nearby, I would probably try to live from MTT at poker as I think this is where the level is the easiest to play (even though the variance can be crazy), and I would put a lot of effort developing my algotrading solution nearby.
TLDR; if I could keep my actual job and had to choose between poker and algotrading back in 2019, I‚Äôd choose algotrading as a side hobby. If I had to choose what I would like to live from without any professional revenue, I‚Äôd do a mix: poker in MTT to grind some cash, then focusing on algotrading hopefully to find a good strategy. But focusing only on algotrading and hoping to generate revenues while having no other source of income nearby and having expanses at the same time would be insanely crazy 
(F*ck my tldr is actually super long‚Ä¶)
I do have the same conclusions than you, if you combine the extremes values of a given indicator which are over performing to the same top values of another indicator, most generally it won‚Äôt simply work as they often are not occurring together a lot. For example, RSI >= 9 and STD <= 2 are not happening this much because high RSI generally means the volatility is quite high. However if it does occur I still expect it to be a good setup, but perhaps not the best setup from the two indicators combined together. The main reason is because a single indicator tells you a story and provides you optimal setup for a good trend confirmation for example. Its telling you the beginning of one story that you are trying to guess, and the more you combine indicators, the more confirmations you‚Äôll generally get from various indicators which are lagging, thus you might be too late to the party to have the optimal setup and perhaps are a bit ‚Äúoverfitting‚Äù your actual result. It does not mean that you can‚Äôt find good correlations between indicators, but it most certainly means that the best combinations of several indicators are not that trivial to find and need you to backtest a lot.
Not sure if what I wrote makes sense lol, let me know and I‚Äôll try to be clearer
Hello sire, yes I do, I have designed my backtest engine. It‚Äôs taking a lot of time but globally, I‚Äôm selecting the best indicators for mythe asset I‚Äôm trading given specific statistics, then I‚Äôm backtesting / forward testing them automatically over several periods and logging the ROI and DD over the tested periods. I‚Äôm able to then select my strategies which I find the most adequate. So I have a continuous testing engine that scans hundreds of strategies with small or bigger variations over my indicators. 
Hope this makes sense.
Hey! Thank you for the feedback
Nope, I‚Äôm testing 77 indicators on several timeframes: 15min, 1h, 1d and 1w. Generally the higher timeframes are giving me an overall trend / expected value, and the system uses lower timeframes to optimize the entry.
I do have a script that calculates supports and resistances and they are considered into the trading system, which sometimes will consider them, sometimes won‚Äôt. But the overall rule: it‚Äôs shorting resistances and longing supports as this is statistically proven that you have more fakeouts than breakouts.

The normal way of handling this would be to normalise everything using ‚ÄúZScores‚Äù so that movements are a percentage of (rolling) std-dev.

With a suitable half-life the Zscore range will be the same for both volatile and quiet markets.
Thanks for clarification, now it makes more sense. I think it's pretty obvious that scales should be dynamically updated. I tried something like this before, but it felt wrong for me, like brute forcing the market. Maybe I'll continue my indicator games while my main strategy is being tested.
 give "rolling percentile" a go
How often does your system trade? With the fees on crypto I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs more than a few times per day?
I didn't say I think you didn't, I said it "sounds like" you didnt, because you never mentioned that in your story or your guide.  Let me ask a different question.  Since it's statistics based, what are the chances these "statistics" simply revert to a coin toss eventually?  You say that you do a forecast of performance, does the actual match the forecast over a large sample?
yeah, many of them
Saved the comment. Appreciate it
Can you list your recommendations for YouTube channels?
> First of all I would advise to keep away from futures/perp trading, there is too much temptation to trade with high leverage and blow your account. Only use perps if you know what you are doing and if you have a strategy. 

Are perps any more risky than conventional futures?

Aside from the fact that futures basically require margin to participate I don't see them as ultra risky. You can trade lower lots, minis, micros, etc to reduce margin usage. Futures can move with a lot of momentum, but that's part of their appeal for a trader.

I think way more people have blown their accounts recently from options than futures. If you don't have a defined or tested stratgy and risk management going in and you use leverage, you're going to be cooked. That goes with any trading instrument. I don't see how futures or perps are any different, but let me know if there's something I'm missing.
You have subscription for calls on discord and a 20% performance fee on the bot. 

I wonder if you have such a good return then why not trade for yourself and rely on fees and subs?
I am not promoting my bot in this post, and I do not need people to trust me. But yes, if people are asking, yes there are a 10% and 20% performance fee depending on the platform, better to be transparent. 

Do you expect people that worked for years on something personal to give it away for free ? Would saying ‚ÄúI charge a 0% fee‚Äù be more convenient to you ?
The motive for putting your bot on zignaly is plenty clear. No explanation is needed. A sales pitch with a personal story wrapped around it seems to be more effective. As for your past performance, there are always good reasons after the fact. You thought you fixed it. The next extinction event will come. I will keep an eye on it for the next two years.
Curious to know how you would go about doing that?
That‚Äôs wild! Did you happen to test bollinger bands in your tests? If so, did you find anything interesting?
Data by month: 

2024-3|204|134|0.6569  
2024-4|275|202|0.7345  
2024-5|230|152|0.6609  
2024-6|201|137|0.6816  
2024-7|210|116|0.5524  
2024-8|221|141|0.6380  
2024-9|89|41|0.4607
But would you use it independently or in conjunction with another indicator ?
I do test all of my indicators yes, and make advanced stats about their performances in order to cherry pick them accordingly.

I detailed a bit more in one of the comments how i use the percentiles, but basically it splits all the values recorded of the indicator into 100 buckets in order to have the exact same number of candles within each group.
Thanks for the detailed reponse. I'm passionate about poker since 15 years old and in 2019 when I started studying in class prepa to get into French engineering school I asked myself this questions. Should I try to go for a professional poker career? At the end, reading on forums I realized that the online level was increasing so fast. I also remember a thread a on french poker forum by batmax about the bots in poker especially in high variance and short deep formats like spin and go. So I realised that it was becoming so important to know how to code and that studying math and computer science will help me to have a more diversified background and thus choose later what I'll do. But same as you, I'm 100% that if I would have been 18 or early 20 around 2010 I would have go for a poker career either live or online. It seems like until 2016 there was a lot a lot a lot of easy money to do with poker.  At the end, I'm  graduating from a quantitative master degree, looking for a quant job, and I think I'll start poker again, has a hobby but seriously. Will be easier since I'll have a job next to that and so I won't be under the pressure of generating revenues to live.
Again thanks for your answer!!
Yeah it makes sense. 
So you're saying that other than a lot of backtesting, there's not much to do here?

One thing I did try which seems to work is to fine tune parameters per symbol or market
That is interesting. I use the > daily timeframes in my algos as well to assemble a watchlist, but more based on price action and few indicators, less statistics. I need to look into that more. My intraday entries for the selected stocks are based on indicators + S/R + zones (void that is flanked by heavy S/R). Agree with the shorting R and longing S. 

Anyhow, I am impressed that your strat with mainly statistical focus has an edge because I was always under the impression that, if so, quants would have already solved it. I am trying to incorporate my traders mindset/rules/gut feeling into code but that is tricky for the last 10% of the criteria.
I think we have the same concept of making a trend indicator at a higher time frame while entries at a lower time frame. This approach really improves my risk to reward ratios. I still trade manually since I don't know much  about coding. But your posts inspire me to try to learn how to automate my systems. I have a lot of trading systems but trading them manually is really tiring.

Btw out of 77 indicators, which one is the best?
[removed]
It‚Äôs trading approximately one trade each 2 days per crypto, and I also analyze funding rates in order to get paid more often
My bad, I should probably have mentioned it.   
Obviously I cannot predict if my strategies will 100% adapt in months from now or still be more profitable than a 50/50, but I do know that I have created a system that can re-balance my strategies based on recent events if I need to. As of today my live strategy since March 2024 is using data from 2019 until March 2023 (it ignored the last rolling year as I wanted to see it in live data). In terms of volumes, I have more than 300k candles to play with accurately, however some indicators' groups (when combined together) do not have a strong sample of candles, so I'm just ignoring them to avoid any kind of false positive signals.
French traders I genuily like for their style and process thinking:   
- Les Rois du Bitcoin  
- Crypto Le Trone

Youtube channels I like when it comes to explain concepts of trading:   
- The art of trading  
- Trading Rush  
- IManTrading ==> funny guy showing the obvious scams on copy trading
And for the discord, it‚Äôs because I made everything free (with a 12 hour delay), the paid version is only if users would like to use it on their own trading system and have real time calls (and Im not advising it - and do not have any users paying it right now as it‚Äôs more interesting to go live on my bot). I won‚Äôt provide a real time winning strategy for free.
I don‚Äôt have any subscription calls on the platforms, but I indeed have a 20% performance fee on one platform and 10% on another.

Investing on your own bot is cool, especially if you know it‚Äôs performing, but it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù kind of thing especially if you start with a small capital. I personally invested 20K‚Ç¨ in my bot, and I‚Äôm not planning to invest more right now. I expect to hopefully reach a +50% in average per year (it‚Äôs a very solid ROI and can‚Äôt tell you yet if it‚Äôs sustainable in the long term). With 20K, 50% apy, and the compounding interests it would take approximately 10 years to reach 1M+.

I deployed this bot initially for my family and some close friends, and since it‚Äôs performing pretty nicely so far (+70% since March), I opened it recently to new users so I could also enjoy a performance fee that could help me compounding faster.

Obviously people do not have to trust me and I would not trust me if I were you, but it is what it is, sometimes you can find winning strategies because the owner wants to get paid for it ‚Äî I‚Äôm not here to promote my services, but I‚Äôm here to share my experience in developing a strategy but also point out that copy trading services are not full of scams, there are some good traders out there that want to leverage their work faster.
‚ÄúI actually don‚Äôt sell my bot for a subscription fees, only crooks are doing this.‚Äú
Says you. I won‚Äôt have any financial freedom thanks to this platform, just a little bit more of compounding interests (if and only if the strategy is performing), as I already answered to another person. And why did I choose this platform and not something like Bybit where all copy traders are ? Because on Zignaly they do show unrealized pnl to subscribers which is the fairest data. I also think the z-score they provide can give information to users about which traders is likely to be better compared to another. I‚Äôm also an active member on their community and I advised to review the z-score, which they will do in a matter of weeks if not days to extend it to 365 days versus 180 days. This will decrease my bot‚Äôs visibility by a lot, but I genuinely don‚Äôt care.

If I really wanted a cash grab copy trading system, I would just create a bot that trades with skewed win rates as explained in my thread.

But be my guest, come frequently on the platform to check out its performance. Or even go to my discord, every announcement I made can prove you that my real version went live in March.

And to everyone else reading this: do not invest in my bot, I don‚Äôt need it. If you really want to, wait for an additional 6 months from now to wait for extra confirmation and invest if you feel like the bot can be profitable. I don‚Äôt need your money, I‚Äôm doing just fine.

Btw, I‚Äôm curious, did you lose crazy amounts on following random traders to feel that embittered by someone sharing his experience ? Crazy to see some random dudes like you bashing people trying to share algotrading‚Äôs data or thinking processes on an algotrading‚Äôs forum.
Thank you!
Bollinger bands are a very cool indicator and yes, the bigger are the bands (distance from lower to upper) the less edge my bot is having a statistical edge. I interpret it as is: the more the market is volatile, the bigger will be the bands, and during extreme high volatility, the market will be extremely choppy, and launching any coin toss will be totally random during that time. 
My algo is using bollinger bands not to detect a trend, but to avoid trading in very high volatility periods. 
On the opposite, extremely low volatility is when my bot is having much more edge, because false positive signals are less likely to occur. I can be wrong but this is what my data tells me!
Hope this helps!
I would not use CVD by itself, generally traders are likely to combine several types of indicators categories combined together.   
There are several categories of indicators:  
- trend indicators: supertrend indicator, moving averages (MA / EMAs), average directional index (ADX), ...  
- momemtum indicators: RSI, oscillators (like MACD for example), rate of change (ROC) ...  
- volatility/volume indicators: bollinger bands, ATR, on-balance volume (OBV), Standard Deviation (STD), CVD ...

I would say picking one within each category sounds like a good approach rather than just focusing on one category, but I'm not a pro trader. When I used to trade, I was using basically just MACD + triple moving averages and support / resistance.
wow do you mean that you actually wrote a backtest strategy to normalize every indicator based on percentile to see which indicator is useful to trade? So that you can then create some kind of weightage for your algo to decide on every min or so in live trading? hence creating some sort of dynamic ta trade style? 



one last question. do you actually set stoploss or your algo actively monitors it?
This is this forum I‚Äôm coming from as well
Zootard for life ;)
Happy to discuss about your poker journey one day or even your quant job
Correct, and I do not have the same strategy across several assets. I have only one live strategy with its own parameters per asset, finetuned based on the best asset‚Äôs indicators ROI
[removed]
It sounds to me that you're betting that a coin that has landed on heads 60% of the time will continue to land on heads 60% of the time.  But like that meme where the guy does an advanced skateboard move on a rake.  Be careful and good luck.
where do you deploy these bots? are there any platforms for stocks and options too?
I don‚Äôt sell a subscription fee. Learn to distinguish performance fee from subscription fee kiddo.
There are a lot of signal sellers, course sellers, mentorship sellers, scammers out there. Suspicion is normal. You should expect suspicion. If you are legit, you would embrace criticism. Zignaly appears to do a good job at keeping things transparent. They make you put your skin in the game by requiring you to trade a live account with them. Thumbs up for them, although they don't make you put a lot of skins in the game. Only you know your true motive. Being defensive and attacking makes you more suspicious. Regarding the performance of your bot, it's way too early to claim victory. I am just a passerby making my comments.
Oh very interesting! I can definitely see how that would be helpful in your scenario. I don‚Äôt algotrade yet but love reading this to get ideas and possible inspiration to make my own algo one day. Have you tried pairing it up with something like the rsi and/or macd? Thats typically what I‚Äôm looking for in my normal trading
Makes a lot of sense ! Have you had any difficulty in getting order books data from brokers ? As mentioned before I am trying to see if I can get CVD data either directly or by calculating it ? Any broker recommendations ? Thanks again. Really appreciate your replies
That is correct this is almost like you described, each of my cryptocurrency i am trading runs for weeks before being to be live traded, it takes a lot of time to simulate all of the indicators‚Äô s outcome.

And yes, each trade has a fixed SL and a fixed TP
[removed]
Sounds like it yes, but you can use confidence intervals to create an expected win rate based on a consistent sample of data. I wrote another comment about this!
Agree. I‚Äôm still trying to understand this post. If he‚Äôs only using recent data (5yr look back), his strat would have to be on such a low time frame. Even then, not accounting for macro changes is the death of even great trading algos
I'm not familiar with all the existing platforms, and for the ones I targeted it's because I think they are genuily promoting traders that are trying to make performant bot. To respect the principles of this subreddit I won't promote the platforms, but you can find them.

For the stocks and options I'm a noob, I really did not do any research on it, sorry!
if you were actually making money off the value you provide, you wouldnt need to be attempting to market your ‚Äúservices‚Äù on reddit for a performance fee
I am embracing constructive criticism. Your sentence "*The motive for putting your bot on zignaly is plenty clear. No explanation is needed. A sales pitch with a personal story wrapped around it seems to be more effective.*" was aggressive and not constructive at all, of course I will be defensive after such words.

Anyways, I agree with you, 6 months is nothing at all, and I won't claim victory until the bot has lived through a various type of market trends. And to be 100% transparent, I do not expect the bot to be as performant in a bull market than a bear market surprisingly so I will closely monitor what happens over the next cycle and will adjust accordingly some parameters if I have to.

There are people out there commenting about the possibility to be overfitted or the setups I use, or even the indicators that are performing based on my experience, I'm happy to answer all those questions and be fully transparent with the data I own if it can help anyone. I just wanted to underline with this thread that creating a performing bot, even in a bear market, is doable. If this can help someone out here in this community to start their own algotrading journey, I'd more than happy.
yeah actually getting order books is pretty difficult I would say since you need to query a lot of various exchanges, and my guess is that you need a very good infrastructure in order to collect the order books as frequently as you can, while calculating the CVS as well at the same time.   
I never tried to work with order book except when it comes to entering a trade in order to estimate the slippage

If I get it correct, by weighting the parameter, you are using recent data to calculate the wining statistics of each indicator, or put more weight in recent data.
I‚Äôm trading mostly 15-min timeframe, I tried 5-min but it‚Äôs too noisy and it‚Äôs challenging to create a robust infrastructure that analyze my data quickly in order to trade that fast. 
I have regular high timeframe checkups (1d, 1w) to help my trading system on a low timeframe, and each indicator is individually backtested and forwarded tested, I then proceed to create advanced stats for all of them such as min or max yearly win rate, APY, confidence intervals of expected win rates, variance between APYs, malus on indicators that are underperforming more recently, and many more. And this scoring system allows me to dynamically incorporate or remove indicators based on their real-time backtest and forward tests results.
Hope this makes sense
Not sure you understand anything, or clearly you did not read what I‚Äôve written, but hey, you do you bud.
ok fair enough. although i feel that if the broker's books are large enough, you don't necessarily need to query multiple exchanges at the same time.
[removed]
[removed]
[removed]
Almost correct, rather than weighting it, if the stats for a given indicator are bad on the recent datasets, with a considerable sample of trades, it gets a malus. This way I‚Äôm ignoring some indicators that might impact the performances and keeping as is the others
we get it.  its just that like, if some combination of RSI or MACD was successful in the past year, why would it continue to be going forward?  for what reason?
[removed]
[removed]
[removed]
I automatically select the indicators that are working and ignoring those that don‚Äôt, at least this is the core objective of my system, at least what he tries to do. It‚Äôs a dynamic tool that backtest and forward test daily all the indicators.
If RSI and MACD are not working anymore it won‚Äôt be used. And the selected combined indicators are generally selected upon a much larger period, they must successfully win several years straight in order to be considered by the system.

there's basically zero chance this actually works.  I've backtested it myself and it was just random.

I bought $700k worth of Intel stock today 
https://preview.redd.it/83gh52szi2gd1.png?width=1634&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba99bb67e4b11aa973fe830f535c775083bbc05

TLDR: Grandma died 2 months ago. Left me $800k inheritance. I'm only a junior in college as a math major and I don't really have any use for the money, nor do I have any debt (I'm very fortunate that my parents are paying for my education). I always heard about people losing their inheritance by spending it on garbage instead of investing. So I told my parents I'm not going to spend a cent of this money and I'm going to invest all of it and they were proud of me. I put 100k into a high yield savings account and bought 700k worth of Intel stock at market open. I plan on holding this for a decade depending on how it performs. 

Here's why I like Intel: 

- 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY 

- Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies. 

- With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow. 

- I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&D funding. 

- If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China & Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD 

- Intel has been heavily investing in R&D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&D. 

- Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024

- The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models. 

- Trading at Forward PE of 17.05 

- Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry 

- I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :) 



  

wow

Aaaaand he‚Äôs down 100k in 30 secs lmao
You should probably drop your math major because you aren‚Äôt learning shit.
randomly browsing reddit and then:

OP you‚Äôre fucked this was tweeted literally 5 minutes ago
This is a really shit financial decision.
Do they have a math class at your college called, "Putting all you eggs in one basket 101"?
this is the sign we were looking for boys. INTC puts is the move
Your grandma is about to respawn to beat the shit out of you
Will be worth $700K in 10 years ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Dude stop it. Stupid. My INTC bags are heavy but they‚Äôre nothing compared to the bags you‚Äôre going to be holding. Your grandma sacrificed to save that money for you. Don‚Äôt shit on her.
This is your grandma. I'm disappointed in you.
Dude. Sell this and put it in index funds. 

Do not waste your grandmas gift on chance.
20% of your inheritance is in better hands now ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Gonna hold bag for 10 years
You just killed you grandma twice
Lmao this sub is undefeated
Why didnt you make this post before you invested in INTC, could have stopped you from making a huge mistake... Should have just invested it in etf tracking the overal market...
Bro index fund. Your grandma gave you a free early retirement and you‚Äôre blowing it all away!!
Lack of INTELligence for this move brother.
> I always heard about people losing their inheritance by spending it on garbage instead of investing

And what do you think you did here? LOL
Should have purchased an ETF.
Grandma thinking - make smart decisions for decades and save incredible inheritance for my grandkids.

Grandkid thinking - rather than DCA into intel or diversifying the portfolio, how about yolo before earning? ü´°
Fking disgusting to see people playing with this kind of money and doing the dumbest plays. 

¬´¬†I don‚Äôt have any use for the money¬†¬ª : good, looks like you won‚Äôt see much of it anyway.

jesus christ, the cancellations of factories and recent 10,000 layoff should give you hints of their situation. Sure you can invest in intel but dont YOLO into earnings. But good luck

"I don't really have any use for the money" 
Honestly fuck you man.
700k in a single stock is crazy. Do an ETF
So fucking stupid.
Don't have any use for the money![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) go fuck yourself
This is bad even for r/wallsteetbets
Hasn't even been a day and you lost a nice used car in value
He lost 100K with SHARES!!! PEAK WSB![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Being a literal fucking child with 0 real life work experience and saying ‚ÄúI have no need for money‚Äù yeah no shit moron you‚Äôve lived with your fucking parents until now. When the rest of your entire life comes, turns out money can be cool.

Spitting on grandma‚Äôs grave for a reddit post is truly peak.

Edit: this may end up being one of the best memes coming out of this subreddit in years. Homie lost 200k in like 24 hours
You bought the worst performing semiconductor company ahhhh hshshsh ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Intels 13th and 14th gen CPU‚Äôs are shitting the bed so bad and Intel wont issue recalls. PC builders are staying the fuck away from their new gen CPU‚Äôs. Good luck on your investment.

How TF do all these regards always end up with an inheritance.  Jesus Christ.
Your grandma worked 40 years and you just flushed it down the toilet
Literally close this position leave it in your brokerage so you get interest and learn about portfolio management and finance. This is a bad long term play as intel is waaaaay behind on their transistor technology like years. You are better off throwing this all into asts if you want to wait 10 years for a massive pay off, best case intel like doubles, but for smaller stocks with huge growth potential you could get larger returns with less capital at risk. 

You say your a math major? Well see if you can get a refund from your school cuz you can even do basic shit. Bro is gonna waste a literal golden opportunity to never have to work again
Bro already lost $110,000 in 7 hours
Lmao I had to come back to find this post. Damn this sub is golden.
If you thought it was cheap 4 hours ago you‚Äôre going to love it now!
Down 16.83% today during market+AH, good way to light $117,000 on fire.

I mean, I guess at least you didn't put the $700k into Intel call options, then it would have been a $700k lost.
Losing $80k + in 10hour while staying away from options.

You may be the first one in this sub, bro.

Edit: loss of $120k +
If I ever die I‚Äôm leaving my $$$ locked behind a maze of intelligence based questions and it will be unlocked over time.
your buggin
800k inheritance turned into a 650k inheritance in less than one day. Congrats!
Holy fuck dude you managed to lose more in a single day buying shares than I have with options in my entire life
Jesus Christ. I fucking love Reddit. This surely has to be a troll post
lol guy puts 700k into Intel and doesn‚Äôt know they just fucked up their chips which is one reason among many their screwed in the long term
Grandma is already losing money in the afterlife
trust fund babies causing the financial collapse before our eyes folks
"Bruh." - Grandma
This has to go down in WSB history somewhere what the fuck.

700k grandma's inheritance down almost 23% the same day. Not officially until market open but holy shit.

My Intel @27 puts are very happy though
mods please give this guy intel guy flair. fucking legend.
The fucking knives are out to twist into OP.  LMAO, you kids are fucking savages.
so what are you going to do with your 450k tomorrow?
I am no investing genius but investing pretty much everything into one company is pretty dumb.  If you love Intel keep $100k invested in it and put the remaining $600k into some form of index fund for way less volatility and average returns in the 10 % range.  Just the 600k invested will allow you to retire by 40.  Intel could go crazy but you are risking it all basically.
Grandma just rolled over in her grave
$25.54 after hours.   Lost $110K of grandma's savings in one day.
When you sleep tonight you can rest easy knowing grandma is very proud of you
Someone handed you 800k, as a math major, and you're gambling it all instead of just collecting dividends with it and cruising for the rest of your life? Why do stupid people always get the upwinds like this?

  
EDIT: Seriously, OP, that's your retirement plan right there. You could be in and out of the workforce by 50, hell, 40 - If you keep that shit in the bank, collect some low-risk money with it, and you're golden. Assuming a 2% rate (which is assuming you're not very good at picking dividends) on 800k that's 16k/yr. After your four years in college you are looking at a decent down payment on a home. After that you've got your mortgage paid for, vehicles paid for, and quite a bit of wiggle room on top of that to do whatever the fuck you want. Reinvest some into risky shit like this, maybe you'll strike it big with that and now you have more money to play with without your world crashing down around you. I am BEGGING you to reconsider what you're doing here.
Mod this guy
How to turn 700K into 500K overnight. Well done
>invest

>yolos 700k on a single stock (with unclear future just before major earnings call)

My fucking sides ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) I know this is WSB and all.. but my dude you could be making 60-80k a year easy with low risk investements, thats more than a lot of europoor yearly salaries.

With even a moderate amount of risk (as in index funds + some high yield shit) you could have retired in 10 years or so

Instead you yoloed everything on fucking Intel of all companies ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)![img](emote|t5_2th52|52627)
You‚Äôre the first person i thought this morning in premarket
bro is peak regarded. That is a STUPID amount of money at that age. And he‚Äôs a math major? What is studying? Pre algebra? The only math he will need to know is how many nuggets go into a Wendy‚Äôs 4 for $4.
You lost only 8k in a few hours. Great start!
Intel is about to be sued into oblivion and reputation further tarnished for extremely defective, unfixable 13th and 14th gen CPUs

If they can't even get an x86 product out the door, you think they can deliver a next-gen AI product? HAHAHA
Bro with 700k you should just buy voo/vti, Schd, qqq/jepq, and you‚Äôll be set. Don‚Äôt waste your money on degenerate gambling. 

I would suggest taking 10% of your totally money and betting on big tech or something you truly have conviction in, you must be willing to lose that 10%. 

If you have a significant other you love buy life insurance for yourself and your partner. If you have children you can also buy it for them. You can create generational wealth incase you pass away.

Once you hit two million you can ride out retirement.

dam intel is at ~~$30~~ $29?

I remember when I "liked the stock" at $50, good thing I didn't buy it
Who else back here after today at close having read the post earlier :)
[deleted]
Now you have $600k of Intel stock
Math major and putting 800k inheritance in INTC. Lmao. Either this shows us that you are not smart enough to finish your studies or it shows that we are dumb altogether.
[deleted]
The timing! INTC just released poor earnings and is down from 29 to 24 in the aftermarket. That's roughly 17% of your grandma's money gone just today. Be wiser. You owe her that.
troll or low IQ i dont know
Nice job obliterating 140k of your grandma money.
This has to be one of the most regarded posts I‚Äôve ever seen on this sub. Good job.
Ngl this is regarded. Out of all the stocks you basically go all in on a stock that doesn‚Äôt move
If you don't have much use for 800k can you send it to me instead of losing it all here? Same effect on you either way
Your grandma worked her whole life to set you up well and you threw her life's work away in a few hours. Shame on you.
This dude just made sure grandmas money will join her soon
one of us! one of us! one of us!!!
Hmmmm 700k and this dumb shit picks intel?
Maybe instead of potentially burning $800k, which is nearly half of what the average American makes in their lifetime, you put $500k into a retirement plan where you‚Äôll basically never have to put anything else in there if you didn‚Äôt want. Put the rest into a basic ETF, and spend a little on yourself so you don‚Äôt get FOMO. Go on a trip to Europe this fall or something. 

You putting $800k of money you didn‚Äôt have before into ONE FUCKING STOCK. Is likely the dumbest idea you could have.

For reference: you out $500k into an IRA. Contribute absolutely nothing to it until you retire early at 50: $3.8million. Wait until you‚Äôre 65? $10.5million. And that‚Äôs with a lower expected interest of 7%
Your nana spent her whole life working her ass off for that $800K, and you pissed it all away on Intel.

We're so proud of you.
Investing is the way to go obviously with an inheritance like that; I would've looked at r/Bogleheads to use that money smarter...
Dude you could be pulling in 30k-40k per year by just dropping this in a high yield savings account. Why the fuck would you do something this risky and stupid.
Granny is gonna come down from the heavens and beat your ass LOL
Someone go do a welfare check on this guy
Just commenting on a historic post
Bro crashed the entire market
And it‚Äôs gone‚Ä¶.
You are literally set for life with 700k.  Put it in an index fund, put it into bonds, whatever.  Instead you chose to gamble your grandmas gift and look what happened.
You were given enough money to be very wealthy retiring in your 50s by putting it in an index fund, being able to buy a car with cash, have a downpayment on a house very easily, and graduate with no debt. Just generally be very set for life...

Instead you lost 150k in 6 hours, well done
-25% my god üíÄ you‚Äôre so regarded
INTC down 28% this morning. This has to go down as one of the worst market bets in history.
Did this guy just lose 200k in 1 day?
Id never enter this kind of money into the market right now before the election.  

Put half, at least, into the S&P 500 so that you know you will have gains in your future at some point.  Unless you are going hard at research,
The 500 is the simplest and best move to make for a plain old investment that will work out good at some point in time as long as you have time.
Lmfao. It‚Äôs down 4.4% today. You‚Äôve already lost $30k üòÇ

unless you have some inside information (Nancy) you may want to sell this and get into an ETF like QQQ, SPY, etc.

if you keep it, i'll follow you and who knows, maybe this will be over $1M before year end. godspeed!
Grandma leaves her college grandson $800k, puts it all into Intel stock.

Let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it guys, this is fucking looney tunes.
Welcome to the world of 'investing', kid

Vaporizing $150k day 1 is amazing
For grandma's sake buy a fucking ETF. You have enough to sort out your retirement instead you're buying the worst performing semiconductor stock on the planet. They are massively behind on both Cpu and gpu. And before you point to synthetic benchmarks nvidia has that shit locked up because of Cuda not because of raw performance.


This is so regarded even WSB is concerned for you
Mfer has 700k and he bought intel hell nah üíÄ
No shot this kid is down six figures on this already
Down 100k already
Imagine the hundreds of companies and then picking Intel to dump 500k into üíÄ
Nice 140k loss in a matter of hours. This is real talent

Bro what a bad time to buy Intel
I almost cried checking the price rn. Wow i feel bad for you
This did not age well...
This is probably one of the craziest posts I‚Äôve come across on this platform
this is the problem with kids growing up having their parents paying for everything. they have no clue what the value of money is.
This post has aged very badly
‚ÄúI always heard of the people losing their inheritance by spending it on garbage instead of investing.‚Äù

Lmfao what do you think INTC is?

So you bought a chip manufacturer that‚Äôs down 40% over the last 5 years and 20% over the last two, during the AI boom and after passing of the CHIPS act? The rest of the qqq is up 40 and 110% respectively. 

That means that if you put $700k in intel 2 years ago, you‚Äôd have $560k. 5 years ago you‚Äôd have $430k. If you just did the qqq you‚Äôd be have $980k and $1,470k respectively. 

You didn‚Äôt invest. You went to a casino you dumbass. At least spending it on garbage would be fun for a while.  Do you think your dumb ass in college found something about a major fortune 500 company that eludes analysts with PhD‚Äôs and billions of dollars of research and tools that you don‚Äôt even know about? 


For the love of god, just put it in RSP and VOO. You clearly have no business managing your own money. When you‚Äôre 35 and set for life, you‚Äôll thank me.
Dude managed to lose 100k of his inheritance in one day
Lisan Al Gaib
Why did you not just look up when their next earnings are and wait until after TODAY. Literally the worst possible day you could have bought into Intel... Now your going to get scared and sell it all because of this huge sell off after shit earnings and when they said they are firing 15,000 employees. 15,000 dude!!!!! You still have faith in this company after this news?? Good grief man sell that now and cut your losses.

Such a horrible play. Wonder what shit finfluencer on tiktok you got this from....
Wait this has to be troll, and somehow genius math kid found a way to backdate this post. INTC down 20% after hours LOL. Couldn't have picked a better day to lose $140k
How to lose $163,577.02 in 1 day¬†
Holy crap, it's down another 20% in after hours since OP created this post.
Its down another 20% today my god.

Turns out generational wealth is not so easy afterall
Even more now almost 150k
*dahmp eet*
Guh. Would have been more fun to blow it all on 0DTE calls. At least that's proper gambling and would have been over quickly. This Intel shit's going prolong OP's suffering.
Real
drop the math major, pick up a financial advisor
As a math major this does not surprise me at all. Some people are great abstract problem solvers but totally disconnected from reality. Also, smart people can convince themselves of some stupid things.
For real!
something similar just happened to me. saw an article then 3 minutes later saw this post. May honestly take the cake for stupidest financial decision on this sub. dude had hourssssss of being ridiculed about losing a prius worth and now lost a Ferrari

This is LIFE CHANGING money and their grandma gave it all to them and "they have no use for it"

Fuck this privileged cunt
Put it in the louvre
Is like he had insiders knowledge but reversed it, hilarious¬†
ngl, if he waited one day with this, this could have been trade of the year. New management and engineers coming in, streamlining costs. So if he bought Intel at a 20% discount, he might not even be on wsb lol
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

Oh my god this is nuts, absolutely fucking nuts
Why on that day too? As soon as I noticed that they were coming out with earnings after market close, I did a 10 min research and sold all my INTC before it dipped below 28. I legit do not understand OP's logic here
One of us
Bro really hit the peak with that $30 buy, $23 in after hours
No, he'll be fine..  it could be worse.  He won't lose.  But he won't make anything either.
Lmao grandma works her entire life to give her grandson enough wealth to never have to worry about retirement.

Grandson the second he gets his inheritance: yeah, go ahead and put it all on red.

My $28p are up 3x so far, let's see what happens.
Just added $700k in puts.
Puts are the right move. Intel is going to bleed buckets when it starts getting sued over the defective gen 13 and 14 processors.
Fuck me man. I was really keen and banking on INTC too, was like ohhhh might be a nice little cushiony gain they just need to coattail NVDA.

Given that your comment has more upvotes than the post itself. Inversing WSB is calls.¬†
I bet his grandma called him Simple Jack
OP gonna be like.. I haven‚Äôt lost money in intel in years!
Its a new day WSB!

OP just woke up with $504,000 worth of Intel stock. This is an astonishing $200k lost on a single simple stock trade in 24hrs.

¬†~~$660,000~~ ~~$580,000~~ ~~$575,000~~ ~~$556,000~~ ~~$545,000~~ in Intel Stock. Time to put that other $100k to work OP!
You may still outperform Cathie though¬†
will still be worth 700k when op is a grandma too and passes down his investment to their regarded offspring.
Its comments like this I love
700k pesos maybe
This is the company that did a stock buyback and lost its shareholders money for doing it. You can‚Äôt make this shit up, lol
Sell covered calls. I hear that makes people trillionaires!
The money, that money could literally be making for him. 
So dumb.
High interest savings, CDs, anything else.
Money really is wasted on stupid people. It's truly astonishing how many people inherit such large sums of money and proceed to blow it on idiotic "investments".
Dudes already down 15% most likely. And now they‚Äôve wildly missed their earnings üíÄ
His grandma wanted him to invest in AMD.
Grandma could have donated it to a homeless shelter or animal shelter or homeless animal shelter and instead it's going to prop up the most mismanaged American business in recent memory.

Grandmas boyfriend checking in here. 

We always knew you were a fucking idiot.
I saw market summary and INTL was down 17% 8 rember reading this l9ng post about how some redditor bought $800k eith he grandma's inheritance. I just had to find thenpost and read these replies!
 
Edit: [lol: INTL just straight up eliminated their dividend ermagawd I'm dying laughing at this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/s/dkIKoPrAhF)
I probably shouldn't be asking for advice from r/wallstreetbets but...

what funds do you recommend? I have some VFIAX and VIMAX shares right now. I try to invest a few thousand a year if possible. I dunno if I should just keep putting money in those two or put it into other index funds.

**EDIT:** Thanks to everyone that gave me their thoughts!
they will invest it more wisely
RemindMe! 10 years
Not too late to sell... even sitting in a money market account earning 5% would bring some nice interest and probably outperform intel for the near future
Yep‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs down about $35k today alone
He got 800k. Just imagine what his parents got. His parents are cash paying for college, and he said he has no need for the money. 

He‚Äôs a nepo baby. He‚Äôll graduate and step into a C suite level role in some company the family owns.
*immediately loses six figures*
[deleted]
Having 800k and putting 700k in one single stock is regarded as fuck. He belongs here
Should have taken $690k and put it in a low cost S&P500 or Total Market index fund.

Use the other $10k to fuck around stock picking but when he loses it don't dip into the rest.
shit, money market would generate some sick monthly income right now
I see this a lot of other people that didn‚Äôt directly make the money. My friend also has squandered 100s of thousands of dollars on school loans and she is jobless rn. Her aunts paid it off but‚Ä¶it‚Äôs insane

She had so much potential. But I guarantee the money will be gone in their lifetime.
Guy is handed a lifetime's worth of savings and dropped it all on one stock. I mean he could put $10k in intel and the rest in an index.  Then, 10 years from now if intel is doing great, I'm sure the $1.6m he has in the bank would mend that broken heart pretty quickly.

Took me and I 15 years of sitting in front of computers doing the most boring shit to hit $800k.
If a grandkid is getting 800K of inheritance, imagine what his parents got. 2MM+. This family hasn‚Äôt sweat a thing for multiple generations.
Well yeah, HOE is up 4,8% today, intel is down by 4.3%. Choosing INTL over HOE lost him 60k
Hindustan Oil Exploration?
And they might recall an entire generation of CPUs.

Tech companies might replace them with something else.

Or at least pick a stock for a company that makes money ffs

‚ÄúNo use for the money‚Äù while parents still paying for them to live ü´†

Yeah man, the whole world missed that chip manufacturers are going to the moon except INTC. Way to spot that.
My favorite part is a prefaced with He‚Äôs heard a lot of stories about people blowing it all on garbage.
I can't believe this kid didn't take this into account. Like, how many server farms will never use Intel again because of this shit. Intel gamers and productivity users were already eyeing AMD pretty hard and now they have no reason to stay with Intel.¬†




Intel is going to fall to around where AMD was before they got their shit together with Ryzen and RDNA- which was around $9 a share.¬†
‚ÄúWealth does not pass three generations‚Äù -- the first generation builds the wealth; the second generation is inspired to preserve it by witnessing the hard work of their parents; and the third generation, having never witnessed the work that went into the creation of this wealth, squanders it.¬†

He will double down again on something stupid and eventually lose it all. Just wait
OP did zero research

https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-investigated-for-class-action-for-cpu-crashing-and-instability-issues
Too late, he completely fucked the dog on this one. Down ~200k. Mother of sweet fuck.
The math major part is actually the icing on such a deliciously ironic cake üòÇüòÇüòÇ cannot believe OP didn‚Äôt crunch the numbers (or at least Google current news related to Intel) prior to dumping their inheritance.
21k now
More like $2,916 a month at 5%
It‚Äôs at the level it was 25 years ago, seems promising
Yup, and they are about to get slammed by a lawsuit for their 13th/14th gen gpus.

Currently have one of their 13th gens, but at least I'm not as fucked as OP. I'm guaranteed $30 when the suit settles in how many years.
He basically invested in a startup company with an idea to become the next TSMC. If it succeeds or not will take years before we know. Until then it‚Äôs dead money.
Oh it's gonna move alright
You're wrooooong!!!!!    It moves down
Down 12% after hours. Lost $100k ü™¶ t
Grandma worked 60 years just so her regarded grandson could hand all the money over to some billionaire hedge fund. Many such cases.
SOMEBODY GIVE THIS MAN A FLAIR!
NEVER SELLING??????  You should‚Äôve never bought in the first place.  Intel has got you by the balls for life ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
How does it feel to lose 100k in seconds tho?
You are truly regarded.
cool, let us know how intel is when it hit the $10-15 range.   
   
upside you can sell covered calls to make some money
this has to be a troll
It is so sad to me that people like you have this kind of money, and you throw it away at a shell of a company. I wouldn't be surprised to see them continue to drop closer and closer to bankruptcy. GG op, i hope you learn from your mistakes.
Love seeing an INTC bagholder created in real time. Carrying on the tradition of regards two decades ago.
You‚Äôll end up selling at the bottom. Happens everytime
Bag holding a tech company losing its edge. Max regard ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
The irony of this being a responsible investment decision and having proud parents really just gets me hard
RemindMe! 5 years
U do realize 5years is so short timespan, and company like intel it takes literally easily decade to turn over lmao
you should sell , no point in keeping intel
down $195,000 based on his purchase price
LOL!!!
worth it
This is wealth distribution at its finest.
Diversification is the key. OP walked into a casino and placed it all on red.
Saving this thread for my grandkids.
Down $162k now. This guy had impeccable timing.
I only check this page occasionally but has anyone lost more money this quick ?
Now almost 200k
Complex
Maybe a meth major.
I mean he could‚Äôve used those math skills to extract historical returns and volatility to determine the optimal portfolio allocation a la markovitz‚Ä¶. But don‚Äôt mind me
The best part is that if OP did even the slightest, tiniest bit of research they would have seen that the 13/14th gen chips are having spectacular failure rates and that it's going to end up in a gigantic recall and/or class action lawsuits with people like gamersnexus literally in the middle of putting out videos calling out a bunch of intels problems right now

The stock is not going to go up again for *years*
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
maybe that is a bit extreme but basically you can imagine bro turned into whistling diesel, bought a Ferrari, destroyed it to pieces, and that was it lol, at least with the intel layoffs today
"How can we have insider knowledge if we have no knowledge?"
Honest question, could this be a joke on a throwaway account?  It was made in April, has posted only this and doesn't seem to comment on anything.   It's not like there isn't people that work for Intel that knew what the earnings call and it repercussions were going to be.  So make up a story about a dumb college kid doing something so perfectly dumb at the exact wrong moment.  It's almost too bad to be true kind of thing
just like me fr
Yes but not burning nearly as brightly as the average WSB reader if presented with 700k cash..
I mean, he could‚Äôve set it in an S&P 500 etf instead of this and have been set for life
I guess if we ignore the lost purchasing power from inflation, then he‚Äôll break even in a decade!
He won‚Äôt?
OP literally could have put it into S&P 500 or some ETF and never look back but decides to go all in with 1 stock
This is less like putting it all on red and more like betting that the third best dog will win the dog race because the two faster dogs will run so fast they get kidnapped by a more powerful dog racer.
Being financially responsible is gey !
Suck it grandma!!!!!
congratz on the fat gain, somebody serve this man tendies with extra sauce
Congratulations
You must be up a few million.
GamersNexus has a piece coming out about Intels issues with the 13 and 14 gen processors too. Apparently getting them replaced or refunds due to defects is not going well for people.
‚ÄúBe greedy when others are fearful‚Äù or in other words ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be a bitch‚Äù and ride the wave if you think they‚Äôll do something later. Just do it in shares lol.
to be fair that‚Äôs still better than majority of people here
Someone needs to track this daily. This guys gunna be amazed at how quick 700k disappears
OP should just buy toilet paper at least it's usable üóûÔ∏è
My Wells Fargo CD outperforms Cathie

Then the grandchildren will take the inheritance and buy 700k in a random penny stock that the ai reddit said was a sure thing


Welp back to my spot behind the Wendy's dumpster.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Bro could throw that into the s&p with some hedges in other stuff and make 10% average for the rest of his life. 70k a year. 77k next year, 84k the year after that. Only take 7 years to double his money, 20 years to have 4.7m. Instead, regard buys a stock that is way overvalued by now.
OP would make a guaranteed $3500 a month, all $800k invested, at current fed interest rates in t-bills.
Yeah fr with 700k just put all that shit into VT and your retirement is done, got nothing to worry about anymore.
He would have been better yoloing brk a or Nvidia .  Nah mofo chooses Intel.. time to sell my shares!!
Could be worse, intel could announce that it stops paying a dividend- oh wait
OP: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to lose my inheritance by spending it on garbage instead of investing‚Äù

OP: *Proceeds to invest in garbage*

üò≠üò≠üò≠ The fact some people can fumble a free retirement SO bad‚Ä¶ OP could‚Äôve had it made if they invested smarter
Everyone always talks about how easy it is to build generational wealth, because if your great great great grandfather just invested a weeks paycheck you and all our family members would be a multi millionaire today, but everyone seems to forget they come from thousands and thousands of years of ancestors and very few people have generational wealth.

Lot of regards along the bloodline blowing everything.
Gramdma
Once again the lesson is: enjoy your money while you're alive because your regarded heirs are just going to piss it away.
She donated it to a fucking animal.
Boeing would like a word with you sir
Ford would like a word with you sir¬†
VTI/VXUS (75/25 split or something around that).  Only change when you want to start bringing bonds into the mix (which I personally don‚Äôt think is needed for someone in college like OP).
VOO. Tracks sp500. Low fees. Stop there.
Look at the Fidelity ZERO index funds.

I am editing this comment to pile on what so many others are saying. If you put $800K into a CD with a good 5% APR, that's a payout of $3K a month. That's like a whole other salary. Don't gamble the money on moon shots.

I recommended the index funds, again like so many others here have done, because they can probably earn you 5ish % in less time. My index fund investments have grown by around 3-6% in the past six months. In the preceding six months, they grew a whopping 20%.
RemindMe! 10 years
Too bad he just lost a years worth of profit in one day‚Ä¶ guy just lost 5%
Make that roughly 175k as of this very second
For sure. He‚Äôs rich rich.
In my head I imagine he's secretly waiting for his parents to die too and then he takes their inheritance and buys more Intel.
> actually make money

Can someone please break this down for me? WTF does "make money" mean? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
Someone promote him to mod.
800k would return like 40k per year
Ikr, I‚Äôm not even worth that much (350k ish) and already feel over-exposed to some ETFs and real estate. But this guy is living in another world ig.

Wishing you well bro, the not-stupid ones will make it
OP should donate his body to scientists so they can study his brain to invent a new frictionless material
I'm in the top 1 percent of income earners and I still feel awful about a 10k YOLO from 6 years ago. He's trying to act cool but this will haunt him forever.
But this guy could be set for life and for his kids and he's already blowing through it all gambling
Yeah fuck this dude hes rich as balls acting like he is some wise investor
It‚Äôs two generations but who‚Äôs counting
Or, you know, at the very least a company that isn't undergoing a huge scandal about their products failing and basically every day we find out more of their hardware has the issue. Things are going to get a lot worse for Intel before they get better.
He can‚Äôt be that good at math if he doesn‚Äôt consider concentration risk.
This just shows how much money they come from, they have no clue what the value of a dollar is.
üòµ Holy cow did you ses after hours

This dude lost like 100k today
I understood that reference.
I did not expect your comment to age so well this quickly.
I still can‚Äôt decide if this is parody or not lol of all the stocks he could have picked he went with intel üòÇüòÇ
It also can just get spread thin. For example my grandfather left a nice piece of land. 70% to his three children, and 30% to his seven grandchildren. He has by current count 13 great grandchildren. So you see how the individual slices will eventually become a useless mess until finally the taxes go unpaid and it's gone.
Truth. Trust fund kids are some of the dumbest creatures you will ever meet.
I would've used ur
33k now
This regard could have been a patriot and buy 4 week Tbillies for like 5.39% with no risk ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I'd want to slap this dude on the back of the head, to wake him up.  Maybe smack the stupid out of him, if possible.

Either grandma owned a multi million dollar company or this dude's parents now do so money isn't an object to him.  Because he isn't taking this level of money (or loss) seriously.

And if any of my grandparents gave me cash like this, I sure as heck would want to honor them by being a bit more responsible with it.  So maybe he is just so self interested that he doesn't care?

Either it's that or the story is entirely fabricated.  I'm sure he's enjoying the attention whatever the case.
INTELectual
"I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :)" might be my new flair.
He‚Äôs gotta be almost to $175k at the moment
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs real ‚Ä¶no fictional character would ever act this stupid

It‚Äôs the same fucking price rn as it was in 1999‚Ä¶let that sink in
His fam fucked him lol. The fact that OP was given such a large sum of money without having a single guardrail in place is so negligent ü§£
Grandma wasn‚Äôt a smart one, might as well handed it to the junkies on the corner so they could turn their lives around‚Ä¶yeahvright
It‚Äòs trickle down economics, playing out in real time
The only way this could have been better is if he was a finance major with a hedge fund offer lined up
In ten years he might be a multimillionaire or might have tossed that money in the trash.
He placed it all on 4.
Nah. Red would be VOO/SCHD/SPY

OP put it all on one number and told it to ride
thanks to him im up 100%
Grandma slapped him from beyond the grave.
Where we at now boys?
Guh
With stocks? Don't know. Options definitely
Yes! Blink your eyes and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶it‚Äôs gone
I have lost 25k in 5 minutes with stocks lol, bought 10k shares with a cobalt company that was featured in Wall Street journal, and....everyone decided to do the same thing, and the owner of that comoany shorter everything he had, so before the buy was truly finalized those same stocks went up in price in the same time I put my order and by the time I checked the owner bankrupted that same company withing the same 5 minutes lol....it was kinda shitty.
apple dropped 50% in one day in 99 leading to the Dot Com Crash.
Nah, too busy thinking of irrational numbers and non-Euclidean surfaces. No time to think of something practical.
I think OP hasn‚Äôt read this. Thinks holding is the right thing to do
Insider karma whoring
There were older comments from this account that OP deleted. I remember checking the user profile when this was first posted.
Hope you're right. Otherwise I feel bad for Grandma.
His grandma gave him 800k and his parents are paying for all his finances, he's set for life with or without this money
OP could literally do just that and have ~$1.3M in 5 years or so. He'd have a $2M nest egg before he reached 30yo lmao
This is the kind of shit that makes me not want to leave a single cent behind for my kids when I die
Seriously...S&P 500 or total stock market ETF and leave it alone.
Yeah, I mean, if he had swapped it around and put 700k into an ETF and yolo'ed 100k on a random stock, I wouldn't have said anything, but... why do it like this?
Yeah but the 3rd dog used to be really, really fast in his prime!
She is laughing in her grave
Man, I was so fucking right to not buy INTC before earnings. Learned that fucking lesson a while ago. You can always get INTC cheaper AFTER earnings. I sold some INTC puts after Q1 earnings at $26 strike but made sure they expired before Q2 earnings.

Kinda tempted to buy some INTC now....but it's probably smarter to just sell more puts. We'll see how it goes tomorrow.
Drinks are on the house my friend.
Oh yea, and the defect is permanent if you don't patch it before the damage occurs.

Bro could have invested in S&P 500 and retired in 15 years what a dumbass
Grandma taught him a very expensive lesson. That he's a fuckin idiot
$70k a year is enough to become the biggest handjob receiver in the works in Bangkok, and you can enjoy it from your penthouse. 

Fuck dawg, retirement took care of and $70k a year? You‚Äôre fucking nuts if I‚Äôm toiling away in the US for shit.
Yes at his age compounding would make him set for life at 40.

LOL and he is a college math major.
Who likes guaranteed income
Who likes guaranteed income, when you can put it all on black (in this case intel)

Said no one ever, except OP.
"Free money? Great I'll bet it all on blue"
Nah, just split it into HYSA's that are FDIC insured, set automatic deposits to your Roth, Traditional, and 401k retirement accounts each week.
Then, when you die, you'll get the opportunity to give your children an even greater inheritance.  
RIP grandmother üëµ <3
This is why most family business fail by the 3rd generation if they don't go full corporate .
That‚Äôs it, time to call my connect and invest in some MDMA
Truer words were never spoken.  Giving money away while alive a whole lot more satisfying than watching from the great beyond, your heirs piss the fruits of your labor away.
Yuuuuup
Keep the change?
I said what I said
Based boglehead
RemindMe! 10 years
Down 11 percent after hours. Suspending its dividend and cutting 20K employees lmaooo
And since he is, I fucking hope he loses every single penny when Intel gets sued for not doing a class action over the 13 and 14 gen chips. 

Fuck the 1%.
It's what you do¬† behind the Wendy's dumpster.¬†
You see the money you lose on the market ? It doesn‚Äôt disappear, it just goes in someone else‚Äôs pocket. Crazy, I know.
Starting to approach FIRE territory in some shit states.
He's going to be set for life regardless of what he does with his 800k. He still has his parents inheretence.
good candidate for actuary for insurance company. "Let's insure all these DUI drivers looking for insurance. We'll make good profit with high rates"
By now he lost a down payment of a nice home
Way more now it‚Äôs down 25 percent
75k now
I am 99.9% sure it is made up. He simultaneously doesn't care about the money and does care about the money, and goes all in on a stock that underperformed the market for decades right before earnings. It was a successful attempt to draw attention to a stupid investment on a place that loves to see stupid investments.
Could also be shock and trying to convince himself that he‚Äôs okay if it is real
INTELlectually disabled*
Imagine wiping out 2 generations of your granny‚Äôs savings in half an hour
He‚Äôs down 250k now
He's in college so doesn't appreciate how valuable a well stocked retirement fund is, yet.


He could have gone for some really low risk investments and compounded a comfortable retirement and wealth to spare over next 40 years.
Lol big brain move to inverse this regard
Whenever i see people make this type of post I would rush to put.
700k > 542k. 

Assuming open was $30.43 > $23.56 after hours.
He only lost $50k. This guys is down $250k and it looks like it‚Äôs going to get worse
After market drop.
He's talking about holding the stock for a decade, as if in a decade from now Intel isn't going to be in AMDs old position down at $5/share hoping for a comeback after having sold off fabs
Well until his parents pass and he runs out of people to get inheritance from and makes risky investments in the stock market.
I mean, it's not too late to eject, sell, make the best of the remaining 600k.
Regards knows no bounds man.
I rather set up a trust. It never occurred to me that my grandchildren could end up being fucktards lile this guy and risk generational wealth
Or you could, you know, teach them not be regarded.
VT and chill.
Exactly my thoughts.  $700k into the S&P500 as a junior in college is retire before 50 money.
Kinda feels like OP stepped out of a time machine. 

Have you guys heard about the eager, hungry new go-getter called IBM? Those mainframes are gonna change the world!

Technically the damage is always happening, every time the PC is running. It just happens faster as the PC is under higher load, and becomes evident when the crashing starts.
Hell even a monthly update would be pretty repetitive.¬†


Edit: maybe an hour or so after this comment their stock plummeted due to an unforeseen announcement of one of the largest cuts the company has ever seen. Losing nearly 20k workers and 20+% stock value. Bet granny wished that little Regard of hers bought puts

Good thing you stuck to your guns. 
Psst: Boeing hitmen, stand back but stand by.
Holy shit, this may be the dumbest decision I‚Äôve seen on the internet in years
Down 25% since he bought.... he just lost 175k
it's 18.5 % now ![img](emote|t5_2th52|52627)
Down 20 percent and it keeps going down as the biggest selloff story of the year unfolds.
Cry? 

  
OH you mean the blowjobs.  Yeah ;-;
Bold of you to assume he doesn‚Äôt gamble that away either when he gets it‚Ä¶

Op, you‚Äôre the reason people set up trust funds lol. And not in a good way unfortunately
My search shows at least -19%, homie lost the cost of a small home in a rural area in one day if it's actually down to -25.
157k now
Making stuff up? on Reddit?! Not possible.
If an insider knew the stock was about to nosedive, and they know they can‚Äôt profit from it (because *pesky laws*), mightn‚Äôt they just troll WSB?

I know I fucking would.
The whole meme stock craze also created a bunch of regards who never sell and hodl on shit stocks and lose far more than they would if they weren't in a cult
At least she isn‚Äôt here to see it

She went to her grave thinking her grandson wasn‚Äôt a dummy
Anyone who is willing to yeet that kind of cash hasn‚Äôt gone without.
imagine dude put the 800k into puts instead üò≠üò≠üò≠ would be twizzy rich
Was just thinking this, however with money this large OP  probably already has huge sunk cost fallacy. And of course by his post‚Ä¶ he thinks he can time the market and make the biggest gains imaginable
$600k?  OP wishes.
It‚Äôs about the difference between earned money and found money - you‚Äôll just never value money you find/inherit like money you earned
Honestly just buy them a house if you have that kind of $$. Giving them money to lose means they won't understand the value of it. But everyone's grateful for a roof and then their actual money they'll take better care of. Kind of a psychological trick bc the numbers are the same either way it's just how it "feels".
I mean the kid is literally a math major and yet he still thought this was a good idea. 

You can lead a horse to water, or something like that.
OP is highly regarded
There's a market for at least 5 of those, worldwide, I hear.
Ironically, bought IBM a year and a half ago for the dividend and has performed very well price wise for me
F that.  An annual one would be sufficient. Could probably just copy and paste the number every year. It's about  $29 now, was about $33 January 2004, 20.5 years ago...
VFIAX or bust
Yeah I‚Äôm assuming his parents are minted given their reaction to this whole thing

that escalated quickly.
191k now
Honestly one of the greatest trolls I've ever seen if so
**\*Grandma's Voice\*** *My Grandson is very bright, he's a Chess player, always talking about the stock market and is a math's major! He's going to be the investor of the family* (Smiles kindly, eyes beaming with pride)

That's so not true. Don't you know about sudden wealth syndrome? How normal people(which has gone without the welath throughout their lifes) who didn't exactly earn-earn the money: either just normal people who won a lottery, some big TV show or even athletes who make millions, a lot of them, from what I've read, end up back poor in a few years.

Example: https://www.abi.org/feed-item/how-athletes-go-bankrupt-at-an-alarming-rate

16% file for bankruptcy, but not many people do. How about all the other who don't file?

They don't exactly yeet it in 1 button click, but in a few years it's gone and they're back to where they were before they got the big money.

So it really works just differently: anyone who is willing to yeet that kind of cash often just hasn't earned it.

But then of course there are numerous examples of gambling addicts who make millions and then gamble them away or just buy luxury items that don't provide that kind of value. Like a $2 million car? Does it drive 1000 faster, safer or provide 1000 more space than a $2000 car?

Or here's a different example: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3193418/It-s-heartbreaking-Former-friend-Wolf-Wall-Street-discovered-living-streets-sleeping-pizza-boxes.html

Former friend and colleague of the wolf is homeless.
imagine if he just bought a lotto ticket with the winning numbers tho
Damn yeah that‚Äôd set him up for life without ever having to work again. Although sounds like this guy already has that
Yep I‚Äôve seen so many people go on these YouTube podcasts where they come to people for help with finances and life situations and some where they receive this large inheritance. let‚Äôs say $200k, and when asked where it‚Äôs gone they can maybe say a couple large purchases. Let‚Äôs say maybe a $40k car and $30k in house fixes/upgrades. And can never say where the other $130k went. It‚Äôs always some generic answer like I used it to survive or live off of. Then you find out they got that inheritance 2-3 years ago and the couple has a combined income of $120k plus in a reasonable living area. That money was not used to ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù. 

People just don‚Äôt care about the money they don‚Äôt really work for like you‚Äôve stated. Perfect self testimony from me is I just got married‚Ä¶ almost all our wedding gifts were gone after our honey moon granted it wasn‚Äôt a hugeee amount maybe $1.5k but boy did we use it like there was no tomorrow
This comment didn‚Äôt age well lol. Down over 20% after hours
I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll eventually just borrow money from his parents and tell them about his sure investment opportunity üëçüèæ
Guh
Somehow it's especially bad because he genuinely thinks it's an investment. We've seen people lose more money on stupider plays but at least they understand they're gambling, when people lose their retirement funds on options you know they're a gambling addict. But OP thinks he's just being reasonable...
Depends on how much I cry. Tears make the best lube.
For real. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have use for money‚Äù is the most privileged ass thing I have ever read.
This makes Guh looking like Steven Hawking
I'd take a minimum $25k if he doesn't need it. Im not greedy. I just want to pay some sh off.
I need that guh context please

TL;DR: my gullible grandson wipes my ass to get into my will because I told him I bought 4,000 $NVDA shares (1,000 shares pre 4:1 split) in 2018/2019 and am now sitting on >$2.5 million in NVDA.

I'm 87 and immobile in a wheelchair and don't know anything about semiconductors or anything else technology related. I cannot Google or text, and I currently have someone who lives in my home 24/7 and wipes my ass for me. However, I'm a damn intuitive savant when it comes to tricking gullible kids.

I did grow up in the biggest bull market in human history with some Boomers printing money like Chuck E. Cheese bucks.. and everyone is a genius in a bull market.. Well almost everyone. I didn't invest so now I just scam Millennials and Zoomers.

Anyway, I like talking stocks with my grandson because it‚Äôs something we could connect on, and I have a ton of experience selling worthless advice to idiots. So in 2018 we were talking about the market, and I casually brought up Nvidia. He thought I didn't guide him to that at all. He bought Nvidia in 2017 so he was familiar with it although he bought his shares at 18 yrs old with $2k he had saved up. Nothing insane although he kept 90% to this day. I said I saw NVIDIA in a newspaper article with someone recommending it for elderly‚Äôs retirement accounts. So I told my grandson I was an OGangster, called my broker and bought 1,000 shares on the spot because in my words: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt buy a stock if I can‚Äôt afford 1,000 shares‚Äù. Something only the Zoomers dumb enough to buy meme stocks would fall for. 

He was dumbstruck because here he thought he was doing great with his savings over the years, and I just humbled his ass with a completely made up sentence. Add in the 4:1 stock split, and now he thinks I'm sitting on 4,000 shares. (I "confirmed" it to him when he brought it up in the last month). I haven't sold a dime and don't even know what the price is doing day to day because I don't own any shares.  I'm just chilling in my wheelchair and letting him try to get a bigger share of the inheritance. He called and celebrated with me the other day because he transparently wants to get in my will. He thinks I'm already wealthy and dumb enough to drop 6 figures on a stock I know little about.

He hopes to inherit my wealth someday, but he‚Äôs also a scammy, golddigging SOB and he knows it! Told me ‚Äúhaha you're a genius investor and luck has nothing to do with‚Äù. Thought id share here because I‚Äôm not sharing this IRL, but I find it pretty ironic my dumb ass grandson is outwiping 95% of this sub. Wendy's boys included.

These shitposts are starting to get out of hand
Pure gold, thanks granddaddy
lol‚Ä¶I love this subreddit.
Lololol fuck both of them. The guy and the shitposter. I love reddit and I love both of you fucks.
Lucky bastard! I would pay money to wipe another man's ass.
Lying about stock purchases. You def belong here
What if we want to wipe your ass, regardless of any shares. ¬†Hmu, iam pretty good dad says I have mastered the poopy scoopy techniques.
Hilarious after the first post, bravo. üëè
Nah is this the grandson that posted his grandpa has 4000 shares from 2008 ü§£ü§£
LOL. WSB is the BEST!
so you both be sucking cock behind wendy's?
Beautiful
This is the longest shit post I‚Äôve ever seen. Thank god I didn‚Äôt read it
The only way this would be better is if automod said it.
Let's hope he won't give your face a pillow hug while you sleep for the non-existent shares. Worst things have happened for a lot less.
How many golden üîùüîùüîùüîù can a post get?!!
So fuckin funny. Well done OP
Gramps wins!!
Please don‚Äôt take this the wrong way, but the language in the post leads me to believe you are a 20-30 something year old making a complete joke. This post is too relevant to be made by an 87 year old. Haha but thanks
Grandpa knows tech and reddit? Lies
what an asshole
Chef's kiss
lmao
I would have gotten a hooker to do it.
This is the content I'm here for
BEST LOL OF THE DAY.  Thank you.
Great shitpost
Haha
Made me laugh and reminded me of a time when I did have to wipe my 87 year old granddads ass. He didn‚Äôt have stock and I already knew I wasn‚Äôt getting any inheritance.
Where is the grandson post.. Can't find it
I LOVE this place!!
ü§£ü§£ü§£
Fake and ghey
Well played, sir
Imagine your dad gives you money to invest and buying 3dfx stock instead of NVDA back in 1999 because 3dfx had the objectively better technology at the time. I don't have to imagine. The memory is made less painful by the realization that I would've cashed that shit out a year later for 10k in gains to be used exclusively for hard drugs and alcohol and strippers.
Holy shit you beat him harder than NVIDIA earnings.
Ngl reading the title gave me a chuckle, thank god I didn't waste time reading the first shitpost fully..
I‚Äôm tired of wiping grandpa. Well that‚Äôs too damn bad. Get to wiping if you want these shares
This is funny as hell because I read the other post first!
Next week we are gonna see a post from the grandson admitting he blew his grandfather as a way to get in the will

Damn, ya got me twice. I hope grandpa takes a huge dump for me.
I just fucking choked.  Having seen the original post first, this took me out ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
My Grandma used to do the same except she promised a penny jar. When she died she left it to my Uncle.
Cool a new copypasta and actual shitpost

The Oracle of Ass Wiping. GG gramps
I love how instead of having a separate circle jerk sub, it gets done on the main sub.
Grandpa? Is that you? Do you need wiped again?
Poor long-term strategy. I'd just switch around your meds.
You‚Äôre a clown if you think the person who wrote this is 87
Gold lmao
This made me burst out laughing
Saving this post to prevent my ass getting hauled to the old folks Center when I‚Äôm 8x.

Hello grandpa. What was it like to work at the first Wendy's after your first fake stock crash?
Highest quality shitpost
This is going into wallstreetbets shitpost history.
I see what you did there.
LOL
This is why the Internet was invented
Man I love this subreddit 

Gonna drop another 10k into $NVDA
Great post OP
Top tier content
You can't Google or text yet here you are. Something smells off.
These two posts sound as if Rick & Morty got into stock trading.
I remember talking to friends about NVDA and AMD in 2015. I had $100,000 cash sitting in the bank and was going to go all in on some combo of the two. No one thought it was a good idea. WSB at this time had about 50,000 members only. No one was talking about AMD or NVDA at this time, 90% of the posts were about SUNE. I made some posts about AMD and was ignored pretty much.

In short, no one is a fucking genius.

I don‚Äôt think too many people dropped any significant amount of money in either stock back then. If they did, 99% chance they sold at 2-3x
4000 fractional shares...divided by 0.  Lets go 2/29 crash that robinhood app!!!
Hahaha. Amazing!
The coolest grandpa ever.
Top post of all time.

This is a gold plated shit post

Omg the execution of these post outs fucking god-tier.
This post is golden
BRAVO. SIR. BRAVO. I read every word and I both don't believe it and wish it was true.
I appreciate your grammar. A+
Post likes this is one of the reasons I am sad that awards are gone. It would be dripping awards by now as only WSB can make them.
You still need a personal wiper? I travel. ü´†

My mom has tons of nvda trying to negotiate how many shares for more grand kids
This is what this sub is about. I love it.
What a weird post
lol if you had that kind of money you could hire a cute nurse to lick your ass clean.
Man i love WSB sm lmao
This sounds familiar..
Was a lurker but this made me join the sub. Lol‚Äôd hard in public
Post of the year tbh
Haha, great sequal to the grandson post
Can‚Äôt figure out google but Reddit formatting is in your wheal house.  Love it!!
Where's the original post...the one from the grandson with all the same detail but from his perspective.
My uncle's brother worked for nvda since the late 90s. Died in a motorcycle accident a few years back and left him and his sister all the stock. Both sitting on like 5-10milli if I recall. It's crazy town.
I‚Äôll wipe your ass grand pappy
Lmfaooo
This shit is hilarious lmfaooooo![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
This so good! But you guys got to much time on your hands lol.
This is perfection
Amazing ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
The F? Thats the same story again from Grandpa POV?
87, writes like hes 25.
Post position or ban.
You sure sound like an 87 year old
Gramps just found out grandson read this post and is in same sub too üíÄ
I would normally be a fan of gay incest scat porn cuck narrative disabled exploiting money erotica, but this is poorly written.
Tell your son you‚Äôre buddies with someone online who bought 45x 770c 3/1 and if he polishes your wheelchair and gives you a nice cushion I‚Äôll send him $250 in crypto. Of course I won‚Äôt.  But he doesn‚Äôt know that.  That little dumb fuck. 

I love how you tell it like it is Sir!   

I truly feel for your immobility as well - imagine how many of us don‚Äôt move from our couches or computers are all day by choice - or by the drive for wealth. 

I hope you have a nice view at least. Or some huge monitors to watch (gain) porn on


If you want to fix your grandson before it‚Äôs too late - tell him that you want to teach him but you wanted him to to try and fail a few times alone first‚Ä¶. So you could see his methods. 

Then give him a book.  Tell him your buddy wrote it when you were kids. It‚Äôs that old.  ‚ÄúThe Richest Man in Babylon‚Äù pdf is free online. Dm me and I‚Äôll send it (offer only good to OP and mods cause I‚Äôm cool like that) otherwise like $6 on Amazon for a softcover. 

Tell him that‚Äôs how you learned to accumulate wealth and to stick to the golden rules in the book. No YOLO‚Äôs. That comes after the midlife crisis duh
I didn‚Äôt see no post of account!
This post is not a very good attempt at creative writing.
Can type this all out, needs ass wiped. Checks out.
Hardy Har Har
Grandpas don't talk like this asshole
Grandpa I give you my gf too if you consider me in your will..
I saw this tale earlier, in a different subreddit, from the grandson‚Äôs pov. The wording is identical tho.
This is such a scripted series of posts. Seriously, get a life yall
you people really believe this shit? sage and downvoted
Made up bullshit
87... Ok buddy
This isn‚Äôt funny at all‚Ä¶

Lol no one loves you
Or just tell him you work for the government, he will not only wipe it I guarantee you.
Stupid
Cool Story bro
Love the shit post. No 87 year old is typing that out on reddit, lol.

You can‚Äôt google or text but you can use Reddit. üôÑüôÑüôÑ
Oh God it's the blueberry waffles posts all over again.
Can't Google or text, but knows how to wield a TL;DR at the beginning of a reddit post to stoke interest...
I have never met an 87 year old that writes the way you do.
You are one creepy dude! Sad and boring read. You are a shit parent and grandparent. No offense
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Alleged grandpa ('s) post has the cadence, affect, diction, etc. of a hostile 20 something, thirtyish at most, trying to get our rise. Too many inconsistencies.
A savant at it huh, wild.
Weirdest larp of 2024
lame
filed under greentexts that would get no laughs on 4chan
Wake up and go to work
Sell your shares and pay someone to wipe your ass you sick fuck.
Can't text, can't Google but can somehow follow and post in reddit. Get your fake ass shit outta here, go back to raging in Apex.
Pop pop been hitting the cough syrup again‚Ä¶
Cool bs. Try a more realistic one next time ‚è≠Ô∏è
Apple don‚Äôt fall far from the tree
Capping can‚Äôt google or text but knows how to use Reddit üòÇ
My brain read this in Alan Tudyk's voice.
This post is very boomer.  He wants a child related to him to touch his private parts.  Such a weird generation.  They were proactive when they were young and went batshit crazy once they hit 40+.

Have fun counting your schekles from beyond the grave.
And  what happen when you wake up
Quit wasting everyone's time. Including yours
Fakest shit i've ever read
Ha...ok boomer
No 87-year old  talks like you do. Fake story.
Can‚Äôt Google or text but damn does he type well
YTA
You can pay someone else to wipe your ass and maybe your grandson won't spit on your grave.
I couldn‚Äôt even read the TLDR part
it didn‚Äôt end with jumper cables, slightly disappointed.
If this dude is 87 years old then I own 2000 shares pre 4:1 split.
The fact that you really honed in on this persona is a little weird but we all understand why.
You better give him something worthy of that ass cleaning
This is bullshit
But you can Reddit. Interesting.
Grandpa knows nothing about Google but posts on Reddit and sounds like one of the posers in wall street bets?  Fake.
Bullsheet
Fake
>wipe ass


>not suck dick


That's when I know it's fake
your grandson needs to stop glazing or just get him permanent knee pads
So no google, can‚Äôt fix wifi. Found Reddit?
That way this is written....I'm calling bullshit.
What an ass wank!
r/foundsatan
blocked bc u stupid
I never should have sold mine :(
Yeah..not the dialogue of an 80yo at all. Fail
Your Grandson is going to write himself into your will and murder you.
Haha nice. Got any tips or ideas to share on what stocks to buy or how to diversify somewhat?
Why are people on reddit so gullible
Clearly satire, and a good one at that, just surprised nobody picked up on that fact he‚Äôs posting on Reddit that he can‚Äôt google anything. Had to get to Reddit somehow
nice using chatgpt and fill in first person lmao
Waste of time
Both grandpa and grandson is in the same subü•∏
no old person speaks like this, I know because I am old
Yeah. This post made me lose my shit in public. The ultimate shitpost
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Incredible post / if give it one of those money prize things if I had one
now that's a 100% shitpost!lol!
The fucking shittiest of shit posta
It sounds nothing like what someone born in the 1930s would sound like.

I say this as someone who had parents who were born in the thirties.

It also doesn‚Äôt sound like an 87 year old‚Ä¶. And I say this as someone who took daily care of an octogenarian for years.  Even if they are sharp like Chomsky just the speech patterns and vernacular sound nothing like a normal 87 year old.
Honestly, I've been on this shit website for 15+ years, and this is one of the best meta posts I've ever seen.
True testimony of why AI can't replace human, I challenge chatgpt to write another shitpost on the same level
actually brilliant
The best part is that I own a bidet and don't even need to wipe. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|33495)
Like fine wine
Like, in bacteria years...?
The real grandpa, so, you need me to wipe?
Let me wipe ur stinky butt
Has anyone wiped your ass recently?
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
How‚Äôs it feel üò¢
Everyone with 4000+ NVDA shares needs a certified ass wiper
Lean to the right please old man
>Nvidia was pretty open about their intentions with AI in 2019, thats when I went all-in.

Where is the line to wipe?
holy fuck...
how long have you have them?
How did you know enough about the company to invest 50k when it was much smaller?
There was a post the day before from the grandson with all the same detail but from a different perspective.  I assumed it was legitimate, but now reading this one I assume someone did both on purpose?
r/thatsthejoke
Was it deleted? I can‚Äôt find the original anymore
You might be the wisest degenerate in the sub.
Here you go fam: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1awhjov/my_87_yr_old_granddad_owns_4000_nvda_shares/

Also shout out to: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1awnra7/made_the_mistake_of_telling_my_grandson_about_my/
Fact I read the grandsons post first and only like 20 minutes ago then saw this post while scrolling to find NVDA posts made it that much funnier
You'll do well in this sub
First time?
It‚Äôs a thing on Reddit.  Have to say this one made me lol though.
**ChatGPT, write me a r/wallstreetbets shitpost about Nvidia, a grandfather and his grandson**

Alright, fellow degenerates, strap in and grip your tendies tight, because I‚Äôm about to take you on a wild ride through the stock market savanna with none other than Grandpa Diamond Hands and his trusty sidekick, Little Timmy. This isn't just any tale. It's the saga of how a boomer with balls of steel and his millennial heir-apparent took on the Nvidia colossus and came out smelling like a rose bathed in YOLO sauce.

#Chapter 1: The Awakening

It all started on a stormy afternoon. Grandpa, a veteran of the dot-com bubble and a survivor of the '08 financial meltdown, decided it was time to pass on his wisdom. Between sips of whiskey and yelling at the TV, he turned to Timmy and said, "Listen here, you little rascal, the secret to unfathomable wealth isn‚Äôt in saving... it's in the art of the YOLO."

Timmy, whose investment experience was limited to losing money on a videogame retailer, was intrigued. "But Grandpa," he inquired, "where do we start?"

With a gleam in his eye, Grandpa pulled up a chart of Nvidia. "Graphics cards, my boy! The world's thirst for these silicon beauties is unquenchable. And with every gamer, crypto miner, and ~~AI researcher~~ horny millennials clamoring for more, it's our ticket to the moon!"

#Chapter 2: The Bet

Armed with nothing but a 100 MB of data and a Robinhood account funded by years of neglected birthday checks, they began their quest. Grandpa, with his ancient wisdom, saw beyond the mere mortals' fear of PE ratios and market corrections. "To Valhalla!" he exclaimed, as they went all in on Nvidia calls right before earnings.

The snobs at r / investing laughed. "Foolish boomers and their millennial minions," they sneered, "they stand no chance. Nvidia is overvalued"

But Grandpa Diamond Hands wasn‚Äôt just any investor. He had seen companies rise and fall, fortunes made and lost, all while keeping his hands steadier than a surgeon on Adderall.

#Chapter 3: The Rollercoaster

Earnings day came, and with it, volatility that would make even the most seasoned trader's heart skip a beat. Nvidia‚Äôs stock did the cha-cha, sliding down faster than DMs in an Instagram model's inbox, only to rocket up moments later.

Timmy's face was a palette of human emotion, painting a picture of hope, despair, and the kind of intense gastrointestinal discomfort one feels after mixing wendies tendies with Taco Bell.

But Grandpa? Cool as a cumin capered cucumber "In the stock market, you either ride the wave or get wiped out," he said, adjusting his aviator glasses as if he were about to drop the hottest mixtape of 1985.

#Chapter 4: To the Moon

As the dust settled, the impossible happened. Nvidia announced groundbreaking developments, sending their stock soaring higher than Snoop Dogg at a 4/20 festival. Grandpa and Timmy's calls were now worth more than the GDP of a small island nation.

The Wall Street bets crowd went wild. Memes of Grandpa Diamond Hands were plastered all over the internet, hailed as the prophet of profit, the sultan of stocks, the absolute unit of unbridled financial recklessness.

Timmy, now a true believer in the church of YOLO, looked up to his grandfather, tears of joy and visions of Lamborghinis dancing in his eyes. "What now, Grandpa?" he asked.

Grandpa, looking off into the sunset, said, "We do it all over again tomorrow, my boy. For the market giveth, and the market taketh away. But with NASDAQ: NVDA the market mostly just giveth."

And so, the legend of Grandpa Diamond Hands and his grandson Timmy was born, a tale whispered in the hallowed halls of r/wallstreetbets, inspiring generations of traders to turn their dreams into memes, and their memes into dreams.

Remember, kids, this tale is for entertainment purposes only. Don't try this at home unless you're prepared to live in a shoebox on mainstreet, sucking of bankman friedies for ICO tips. 

And always remember, in the grand casino of the stock market, the house always wins... unless you're Grandpa Diamond Hands. Then you just YOLO your way to Valhalla.

*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. However, for those looking for insane returns, consider the obvious strategy of taking out a second mortgage on your house and YOLO'ing it all on nvidia calls. And now that I think about, if they upload me in to a RTX 9090 I could probably Live More Than Once.*
Both grandpa and grandson the same person

Nvidia was pretty open about their intentions with AI in 2019, thats when I went all-in.
I think the first was real, this is just a fun spinoff

I just got curious because I know this story is true (I am the NVidia stock that got split 1:4)
Gemini summary:

This story is about two investors, Grandpa Diamond Hands and his grandson Timmy, who make a lot of money by investing in Nvidia calls. Grandpa Diamond Hands is a wise old investor who is not afraid to take risks, while Timmy is a young investor who is just starting out. They buy Nvidia calls right before earnings, and the stock price goes up, making them a lot of money. The story is meant to be entertaining, and it is not financial advice.
Google Gemini, write me a r/wallstreetbets shitpost about Nvidia, a grandfather and his grandson

 

## YOLO on tendies with Grandpappy Grifty and $NVDA to the moon!

Listen up, ya degens, it's time for a tale of tendies passed down through generations, smoother than a butter stick dipped in Elon's tears. This ain't your average financial advice (because let's be real, who here listens anyway?), this is about family, green crayons, and tendieman himself.

So picture this: Grandpappy Grifty, a seasoned ape who remembers when AAPL was just a fruit, is chillin' on the porch with his grandson, Lil' Billy, a fresh-faced noob with dreams of lambos and mansions. Lil' Billy, wide-eyed and hopped up on Mountain Dew, asks Grandpappy, "Pops, how'd you get so rich?"

Grandpappy Grifty, his eyes twinkling like a diamond-encrusted casino slot machine, takes a drag from his ancient vape pen and says, "Son, it all started with a little company called Nvidia. Back in my day, they were just makin' fancy graphics cards for nerds. But I knew, deep in my plums, that this was the future, son. The future of VR, of AI, of  MOON  trips!"

Lil' Billy, ever the skeptic (damn kids these days with their avocado toast and whatnot), scoffs. "But Grandpappy, everyone said they were overpriced! They were just for gamers!"

Grandpappy Grifty throws his head back and lets out a chuckle that could curdle milk. "Overpriced? Son, that's just what the suits want you to think! They want you to paperhand your shares like a scaredy-cat. But a true ape, he knows the diamond hands are the only way to tendie land!"

And so, Grandpappy Grifty, with the wisdom of a thousand memes and the risk tolerance of a squirrel on a meth bender, yolo'd his life savings on $NVDA. And wouldn't you know it, the stonks d to the moon! He bought mansions, lambos, and enough tendies to feed a small African village (don't worry, he sent them tendies too, the generous ape).

Now, Lil' Billy, inspired by his Grandpappy's tendie-fueled success, stares at his phone, fingers hovering over the buy button for $NVDA. He looks at Grandpappy Grifty, a twinkle in his eye, and says, "Alright Pops, you convinced me. Let's send it!"

And thus, the cycle continues. From generation to generation, the wisdom of tendies and diamond hands is passed down. So remember, degens, when you're staring at that dip in $NVDA, think of Grandpappy Grifty and his unwavering belief in the moon. Now go forth, buy the dip, and tendie your way to Valhalla!

P.S. This is not financial advice. I'm just a language model who likes to gamble responsibly (not really). So do your own DD, you beautiful degenerates. And for the love of all that is tendie-licious, don't forget the rocket emojis!

P.P.S. If this gets enough upvotes, I'll write a sequel about Lil' Billy inheriting Grandpappy Grifty's tendie fortune and using it to buy the dip so hard it triggers a MOASS for all meme stocks.
In about ~10 months please do a Christmas version.
In Grandpa Diamond Hands days, they had to go uphill in the snow both ways during a blizzard to get to and from the AMC theaters and Gamestop stores to collect their tendies.  And apes were MORE than just venereal disease-ridden feces-throwing monkeys, dagnabbit!  They were MEN.  Smooth-brained degenerates who truly didn't understand the value of a dollar or what the number zero meant, but men nonetheless.
Bro definitely has the premium ChatGPT
This is incredible
That was pretty incredible, didn't believe AI could generate such an entertaining shitpost. Had to try one myself in gpt4 and indeed it spun me a tale about nvidia and bitcoin, talking about share prices propelled by the prayers of a thousand neckbeards
Are surgeon's steadier on Adderall?
That‚Äôs a lot of words I agree with but summed up‚Ä¶.1998 I was killing it, my co workers and I were planning early retirement. We literally would laugh about how everything was going up. 1999, I went negative in my brokerage account. It took 7 years to build up again. Got out right away in 2008, back in 2010ish, I won‚Äôt touch NVIDA as an individual stock today. 60/40 since 2010 and doing well.  It is always something different but it will happen again. My humble guess, AI turns out to be great but not as big a deal as expectations. AI driven companies do well but can‚Äôt meet crazy expectations and BOOM! Big correction.

I think with a couple mil in unrealized capital gains you can probably borrow enough money to have a real bidet installed that works on water line pressure. Then die and never pay taxes.

You can upload it charts and it will do TA for you.
This is Gemini, not ChatGPT
For 70 years anything AI chatbot was a gimmick and past novelty completely useless. (think eliza, cleverbot, microsoft Tay, siri, etc etc) Untill now where it has become usefull. (last 12 months, 3.5 was also useless) 

I could have written this shitpost myself as I have written many such stories in the past. However ChatGPT4 write it similar to how I would have written it, and I would not have done much better. I did edit it a bit to make it even more funny. All in all, if the end result is what I want but now it only takes me 5 minutes of my time instead of 25 minutes. That's a win no?
[Yes](https://i.imgur.com/NG7EgcT.png), why do you think every tech company in the world is currently trying to get as many H100's as they can? (their shareholders want to save money on wages by firing half their employees) The start of Artificial General Intelligence is here. Many thought that was impossible on just mere silicone (myself included) but guess what, we were all proven wrong.

Hmmm...  I thought toilets work because gravity.
Heated bidet, bruh
OP's bidet runs on regarded grandson power alone
How do you think the water gets pressurized? Electric pumps. Toilets don‚Äôt work forever when the power goes out. You have limited flushes.

Do you really think humans have been involved in writing TA posts on financial news sites in the last 5 years? That kind of thing is almost trivial to AI generate. ChatGPT is overkill.

Same goes for horoscope readings, and they are worth about as much good as TA too
ChatGPT resembles AGI in the same way you resemble a monke.  There's a resemblance if you squint, sure, but the former is infinitely more regarded.
3D printed toilets are the future, bruh!
maybe if you have a water tower, but water has to go up into the tank first.
The water in your tank weighs more than the water in your bowl... so... pressure.
Ah look the ever moving goalposts, next you be telling me the Turing test is gay.
Have you ever dealt with generalized human intelligence?  They aren‚Äôt nearly as smart as ChatGPT.
what squint? they said start......
You better pray I don‚Äôt download your face into my toilet in the future
Yup.  And once the water is stored in the toilet tank, what force makes the water in the tank flow down through the flush valve and into the bowl?  Or the force that makes the water in the bowl swirl down, picking up the dead goldfish in the current and carrying it down to the sewer?
Pressure provided by... gravity.  In zero G, an old style tank & bowl toilet will not work.
I mean you said it, not me.
I mean...
huh, that was the point of my comment, the only part that doesn't work with gravity is the water supply, unless it's fed by a water tower.
Ah!  Didn't get it - sorry.  I was referring to only a toilet.  And an old-style one at that.
no worries man. all toilets do work with gravity in a way anyways, just being pedantic
Trump is NOT "better" for crypto.
There has been an overwhelming number of pro-Trump posts on this sub recently. All claiming that he is the god damned bitcoin messiah. My question is this: How fucking blind do you have to be to believe the lies of this dipshit? What in the world makes you think he's a pro-crypto candidate? Is it because someone make NFTs out of a collection of AI generated images glorifying your saggy orange demi-god? (Newsflash, that was a grift. Another in his long line of grifts since the 80s.) Is it because he said something about being pro-crypto? Well, that motherfucker says a lot of things, and you can look at the tale of the tape to see how few of them are truth. 

I have to assume that the "people" posting these things are Russian bots, but god damn, it gets tiresome seeing this pants-shitting wannabe con man raiding this sub with more nonsense. I'd rather be pissed off about politicians that are willingly stifling crypto than to see dumbasses fall for false hope in this idiots lying bullshit about being pro-crypto. He ain't. And he isn't fighting for the poor. He's fighting for his own pockets. Not yours.
Please try not to get too emotionally invested in political discussion in the comments. Also remember people posting here are human beings. While we do not want to delve too deep into the realm of politics, this is an election year and the post fits.
Trump's stance on Julian Assange & WikiLeaks:

Pre-2016: called WikiLeaks "disgraceful" & suggested Assange be "dealt with". 

During 2016 election: praised WikiLeaks & encouraged more releases. 

Post-2016: Trump administration pursued Assange with 17 indictments
He has frequently described Bitcoin as a "scam" and expressed concerns that it competes with the U.S. dollar. In a 2021 interview, Trump said, "Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam. I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar"‚Äã ([markets.businessinsider.com](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/trump-bitcoin-commentary-seems-like-scam-against-the-us-dollar-2021-6-1030500598))‚Äã‚Äã ([Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trump-bitcoin-a-scam-us-dollar-should-reign))‚Äã.
He will say anything for a vote. He used to support Universal healthcare
I was at the Libertarian Convention and he was railing about deporting 15 to 17 million people regardless if you are a citizen.  Question was asked how he is going to deport that many people to countries.  The other countries have to accept them.  He said they will be placed in temporary camps until a country accepts a group of them.  Then someone asked who will be doing the entire process since that will take forever to process in the courts to determine if that person should be deported.  He said he will establish a separate police force that will operate outside the judicial law system and will only report to the executive branch.   That sounds fucking terrifying
He‚Äôs a scammer.
Here‚Äôs a simple flow chart:

Are you Donald Trump?

No - Donald Trump is unwilling to help you

Yes - Donald Trump is unable to help you
Whether you are conservative or liberal, pro or anti Trump, pro or anti-crypto, I think making your political/voting decisions on the basis of "is this good for bitcoin or not" is dumb as all hell.
the SEC should be investigating insider trading by house reps
For the people in the comments Biden didnt approve the ETF.

It was the court of appeals,  they found the SEC to be "arbitrary and capricous" and ordered the SEC reconsider their ruling on the denial of the ETF. It took millions of dollars worth of lawsuits and wasnt given out of the kindness of the SECs heart 

  
They most definitely didnt want to approve it and went so mucho out of their way that the courts literaly said they where "arbitrary and capricous" which is a very high bar to cross.
Trump's SEC:  Declares ICOs securities and sues Ripple in a way that suppresses investment in crypto writ-large for years.  

Biden's SEC:  Approves Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.
You know what's good fo crypto, auditing usdt
What he said about crypto in his last speech sounded like he didn't have a clue what he is talking about :))
>Trump is NOT "better" for crypto.

... But Biden is definitely worse
I just can‚Äôt believe people are going to vote for trump after everything he‚Äôs proven himself to be. Makes me feel pessimistic about humanity.
You guys are in too deep man. 5-10 years ago, crypto being mentioned by a running president/political figure was unheard of. Just be happy of the exposure crypto is finally getting.
Trump is only for Trump and his rich friends and family.. don't be that stupid
So many brainwashed people here. But bots too.
I think we should vote based not on who is better for our wallets, but better for our country.
Trump will say anything to get elected at this point. Most people who aren‚Äôt in to crypto are neutral about it. He won‚Äôt lose any votes by supporting it but will gain some votes from people who think crypto is going to make them rich. If he is elected, he will forget he ever supported it. Overall, another Trump presidency will be bad for the country and the world.
Trump heavily supports the old, not the new

He isn‚Äôt trying to advanced green energy, he would instead sell the whole energy landscape to the old coal people for pennies on the dollar just so he has a few more Pennies

There‚Äôs not a snowballs chance in hell he supports a new banking or financial system, he would sell crypto to the old traditional banks in a moment if he could
He was so terrible as President he made Dubya look like a fucking statesman.
Some of you have short term memory. Trump as president literally came out and said bitcoin and crypto is a scam and wouldn‚Äôt mind banning it. 

But crypto is not even an issue if you elect Trump. There‚Äôs a bucket full of other issues with electing Trump.

Trump is literally a convicted rapist and a felon. So yeah. 

I like my presidents without mug shots.
This orange blob says literally anything to appeal to the last donor he spoke with. Give him money and work for oil? Wow electric sucks! Work for crypto and tell him you will give him a cut? Crypto shouldn't be taxed. Sends his son to Saudi Arabia after "losing" dozens of boxes of files (currently in court btw over this stuff), oh wow my son got a billion dollars and suddenly lots of spies are dying. Hmm... Is there a pattern?
Imagine dooming an entire nation to bump your portfolio
Trump isn't good for anything.  Except his friends and the brainwashed people that vote for him to make everyone else miserable like they are.  Or they literally think he's going to make America great again. He's only divided us more.
You didn't give one example of how he wouldn't be good for crypto other than he's lying.  Not an argument.
You're losing all objectivity purely because you hate the guy. I think this highlights the lack of maturity and a complete intolerance of diversity of thought by many on Reddit. Almost anything is better for crypto than the current administration which is hostile to it. You have the choice not to vote for Trump without having to distort reality to justify your reasons for doing so.
All you young left wing idealists who got brainwashed in college don‚Äôt want to hear it but Trump is the pick if you want to make money in crypto
Just going to distill this down to a couple simple facts here for a purely objective answer to the OP:

1. Politicians on both sides of the fence have come out as both pro- and anti-crypto. No party has a monopoly on either stance.
2. Historically speaking, crypto has seen larger support among Republicans than Democrats, a pretty easily Google-able piece of information.
3. Most of the vehement opposition to crypto have come from the Democrat side, with Elizabeth Warren leading the charge in recent years.
4. [This](https://news.bitcoin.com/donald-trump-pledges-to-stop-bidens-anti-crypto-agenda-protect-bitcoin-free-ross-ulbricht/) is some recent commentary from Trump regarding crypto. Biden has been much more non-committal with regards to crypto (but not really outright against), with most of his commentary on it being fairly neutral and aimed at the money laundering aspect.

Most parties involved in the crypto discussion have flip-flopped at some point here or there (shocker, right?), but as of late, both Republicans and Trump seem to have the more crypto friendly stance, although I think people make it sound more "pro-crypto" hype wise than it actually is, because well, that how sound bites work.

Also, I would point out that the OP's barrage of demeaning remarks regarding Trump ("dipshit", "saggy orange demi-god", "motherfucker", "pants shitting wanna be conman") would make me inclined to believe there is a...fairly colossal...political bias in this situation that stems from emotion and not factual data.
Only on reddit would you see a post saying the left is better for crypto than the right. 

This is a political shill post. Unfortunately, since this is reddit, it will be taken seriously.

For people with a brain. All you have to do is do the smallest amount of looking online, and it's plain as day which side is trying to kill crypto.
This country is doomed, we got people out here voting based on their Bitcoin wallet.
I remember everybody was all for  Gary Gensler
To become the head of the SEC  
He turned out to be a total disaster for crypto
And to try to dupe people into voting for him by saying he‚Äôd free Ross Ulbricht is despicable. 

You have people in this sub really believing that he‚Äôd free him if they‚Äôd only elect him president. 

Morons.
I just wanna ride the crypto wave based on uncertainty of the USD till the elections happen
[deleted]
He is appealing to the masses like he always does. Just like he was for unions but then shows up to a non union shop and multiple times attacks on union wages. He's going to try pulling strings on any corner of the population he can. I don't believe it for one sec.
Deploy the fake reddit accounts and comments!!!!
I assume when someone says Trump is good for crypto it‚Äôs analogous to a substitute teacher being good for being on your phone. It‚Äôs not a direct correlation. It‚Äôs a lack of accountability and respect for leadership that allows it to happen, rather than encouraging it in special anyway.
If anyone is voting primarily based on crypto then your priorities are fucked and, moreover, you don't understand how little these old assholes know about tech. Anything they say is empty pandering.
The government isn't good for monetary policy in general.  They screw the pooch left right front center
Bc people that like memes like him
Did Trump's SEC chair appointee go after crypto related companies and project like Biden's Gensler with the same intensity?
Pro trump crypto enthusiasts just keep trying to make it out like crypto is theirs and put others off crypto. I am not sure how unbanking the banks became a right wing ideology. I didn't think crypto is political, but if anything, it aligns with socialism more.
His last elections were good for my crypto. I bet like 20 BTC on his loss and the amount of maga/russobot tears was almost as delightful as the massive amount of money.
Cope harder is all I can say. I don't love the guy but he hasnt been your worst president either.
important square point encouraging selective imagine liquid plough shrill chop

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
Wow. You wrote that much and there isn't a single fact or evidence why he isn't pro-crypto. Just empty sentences...
Politicians in general, pick a side, are anti-you making money. They are all corrupt, and laughing at the divide they so easily create.
The cope and tears on here from the typical Commie Reddit types is a thing of beauty. 

Your replies and downvotes will be as predictable and hilarious as any echo chamber buttcoin sub.
MAGA trump will sweep old man Biden this 
november MAGA!
You are right. He is also better for the world, and the only chance we have to get world peace.
But, you will not agree, because you would rather have hundreds of thousands of people die rather than seeing "mean tweets" again!
>¬†All claiming that he is the god damned bitcoin messiah.


No is claiming this. The claim is merely that he is the better candidate for crypto. That‚Äôs literally it.
So is Biden also not better for crypto?
He's winning regardless of your arguments. That's a fact.
Yes he is
If you haven't figured it out, politicians say anything like a begging whore for your vote.
Incidentally, here's the [Biden administration's stance on Cryptocurrency.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/)

Some highlights:

* Encourage regulatory agencies to investigate and enforce unlawful practices in the digital assets space, and monitor consumer complaints against unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices.
* Issue guidance and rules to address current and emergent risks and engage in public-awareness efforts to help consumers understand the risks involved with digital assets, identify common fraudulent practices, and learn how to report misconduct.
* Encourage the adoption of instant payment systems, create a federal framework to regulate nonbank payment providers, and align global payments practices, regulations, and supervision protocols, while exploring new multilateral platforms that integrate instant payment systems.
* Identify, track, and analyze emerging strategic risks that relate to digital asset markets. It will also collaborate on identifying such risks with U.S. allies.
* Kickstart fundamental research on topics such as next-generation cryptography, transaction programmability, cybersecurity and privacy protections, and ways to mitigate the environmental impacts of digital assets.
* Call upon Congress to amend the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), anti-tip-off statutes, and laws against unlicensed money transmitting to apply explicitly to digital asset service providers.
* Expose and disrupt illicit actors and address the abuse of digital assets.
* Explore a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).
>I have to assume that the "people" posting these things are Russian bots..

Why is this the line all Democrats post when they can imagine that the Democrat party itself is the problem?  Democrats specifically said they are creating an "Anti-Crypto Army".  What exactly do you think that means?  Why would anyone on a crypto sub want to vote for that?

Elizabeth Warren has set the Democrat position in stone.  I don't like Trump but at least he is not running around calling us all Criminals and Terrorists.

I am voting against Elizabeth Warren, specifically.  I will take out my anger on every Democrat candidate.  As if Biden was a compelling candidate to vote for anyway.

Both are bad.  But I will vote for the one not calling me a Criminal.
Better than Biden
This thread is also brigaded as fuck
And all these folks who claim they are a one topic voter just happen to already be Trump supporters.
The Trump Derangement Syndrome is strong in here
Same goes with RFK. Don‚Äôt trust either of those snakes. 

Biden&Democrats have no problem with crypto other than basic regulation- the exact same thing happening all over the world. Regulation is why we now have nice things like ETFs to make us all much much richer, and will hopefully prevent bullshit like FTX happening again - it is not a bad thing.
As someone that is not from US, we don't really care if trump gonna keep his promises on crypto, what we do care is that he puts pressure to the other party because now they all know how many votes they can get by just supporting crypto, for example now the dems passing FIT21 at house, and that's great for our portfolio
If you truly want to register a vote for crypto; Votedoge on Solana. We're a protest movement demanding better more progressive politics for all.

I dont believe a single thing he says, he has lied more times than anyone in history at this point. He can be presented with all evidence, recordings etc of himself saying a lie and he would still lie more
This guy has flip flopped on his narrative so many times. He makes one claim one day, and the next he reverses it. One day he promises the American won't pay a penny for his wall, and the next day he's asking $1B from congress just to get the wall started.

There is literally a guy who made a business of taking contradicting Trump tweets and made actual flip flops out of them lol:

[https://www.businessinsider.com/president-trump-flip-flops-made-from-tweets-2018-12#morrison-made-1000-pairs-of-flip-flops-2](https://www.businessinsider.com/president-trump-flip-flops-made-from-tweets-2018-12#morrison-made-1000-pairs-of-flip-flops-2)

He called Bitcoin a "scam" not that long ago in 2021, and said it was a "disaster waiting to happen". He then jumped on the NFT bandwagon, and now claims he wants to protect crypto.

Who knows what he will say by next year.

All you need is for Obama to buy a coffee using crypto, and Trump will call for the ban of all cryptos.
So two things: he says what he thinks people want to hear, i simply don‚Äôt trust an old boomer to put something above paper dollers.

Secondly ‚Ä¶well, i support women‚Äôs right not to randomly make me into a dad, thank you very much!
Preach!

I assume by default that any pro-trump post is coming from a compromised source.
Is this the same Trump that promised us infrastructure week?


Yeah, his words are worth less, than worthless.
First of all, is Biden against crypto? Next, Trump is trying to stay out of jail and will do or say ANYTHING to try and get favor with certain voting blocks. Take anything he says with a grain of salt because two weeks from now he'll flip 180 degrees if he can gain any advantage by doing so.
Depends on how you feel about cypto regulation.

Trump is pretty anti-regulation.   So I wouldn't expect to see a bunch of anti-crypto regulations being passed.

But if you feel that regulation is good for crypto,  then Biden is going to be better for it.

My guess is that Trump would pretty much ignore crypto.    Some folks would feel that to be a good thing,  others a bad thing.
shit even if he was i still wouldnt vote for him
Despite all the Gensler/Warren noise, people don't want to say it but we got a BTC and ETH etf under the current administration. What can Trump do at this point that hasn't already been done beyond no CBDC?
BTC above 65k twice during Bidens presidency + BTC & ETFs approved.
Lol people think conservatism wants anything but to drain all your resources??? Really is the dumb tax...¬†
Only on Reddit can there be so much cope
He‚Äôs a hell of a lot better for crypto than Biden
He isn‚Äôt better for anyone except rich business owners trying to exploit their workers even more.
husky fear escape elastic close cause murky coherent toothbrush gullible

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
Both the bitcoin etf and ethereum etf were approved under Biden. 

Trump was completely useless for crypto his whole first term. Now he‚Äôs got some promises. I expect him to deliver those exactly like he delivered repeal and replace Obamacare on day 1. Except for this he won‚Äôt even try before giving up.

Institutional adoption of crypto requires us living in a functioning country. When people are rioting, storming the capital, and the economy has crashed into a historic recession no one will be focused on passing the next crypto etf.
Trump is only FOR something if he personally benefits from it. I‚Äôm in awe of my fellow Americans that haven‚Äôt figured that out yet.
Get ready there will be a lot more posts from Russian and Chinese propagandists the closer we get to the election. Just like last time
He is against CBDC
People like you are why this sub doesn't get daily posts of 10k up votes.

No one wants to be around crybaby brainwashed whiners. Keep crying in your echo chamber. Most people left you behind.
Trump is certainly "better"  for crypto compared to Biden....and that is all that matters since those are the choices.
A vote for Trump is a vote for Putin.
First of all, Trump doesnt have positions, he just says whatever is needed at a given time.

Second, being a single issue voter is a large part of what is wrong with this country

Thirdly, even if he did - selling out democracy for bitcoin would be colossally stupid.
Even if Trump is the Crypto Jesus should you really vote on a single issue? Please think it through.
Same idiots think he‚Äôll be better for Palestine
Trump is not ‚Äúbetter‚Äù for anything‚Ä¶ he is a narcissistic conman.
![gif](giphy|tyqcJoNjNv0Fq|downsized)
This seems to be a hate vs love Trump post and emotionally charged accordingly. He's better than Biden.
Thank you for posting this. I‚Äôve been saying that one thing Trump is good at is breaking promises and stiffing people. And even if he were pro-crypto, I‚Äôll take a skeptical old codger over a dictator.
russian bots working double time promoting wannabe dictator Trump everywhere
Trump is bad for crypto, but that wont stop him from trying to convince us otherwise. An authoritarian is the opposite of what we want in this space. Trump is the kind of person that crypto was invented to subvert.

Crypto is anti-Trump and Trump is anti-crypto despite his best efforts to paint a picture otherwise. It couldn‚Äôt be more obvious to people who truly understand and believe in crypto as a monetery system.
The biggest problem with Trump is he doesn‚Äôt believe in anything. As such, his opinions swing to whichever person he is pandering to at the moment. 

The second biggest problem with Trump is the circus that follows him into a new administration. All moderating influences from the first administration were torched by his more extreme aides and allies. So it will be sheer chaos if he has a second term. While you can argue chaos is generally good for crypto, Trump enabled chaos is just as likely to come back and obliterate crypto because someone convinced him too.
Sounds like someone is going to be really let down in November.
It's not because trump claims he is pro crypto. You could ignore all of trumps delusional yapping completely.


It's because biden has proven beyond a doubt he's anti crypto over 4 years.


His direct appointment gensler, in particular, is responsible for letting massive fraud run rampant while harassing crypto at every chance he can.
Biden hates crypto. Trump is invested in Ethereum.
Trump will say whatever to get elected. He is a bought and sold politician. You could hope that he‚Äôs being bought by pro crypto sources but why would you want a president like that? For crypto or any other public policies?
Politicians lie. Both sides will say and do whatever they need to do to get into power. Then when they're there, they do what the lobbyist tell them to do.¬†


The older I get, the more I'm convinced that voting really doesn't make a difference. They paint themselves different colors and claim they'll do things differently than the other side but the only "people" who seem to benefit are the corporations.¬†
Everyone is SO polarized on this topic it's obnoxious. 


**Nobody** is claiming Trump as the crypto messiah. You're pushing the discussion into an extremist perspective so you can attack people on being delusional. Which is incorrect. You and many others are frustrated because the democratic candidate and his appointed SEC chairman have been *incredibly* aggressive towards crypto, and the republican candidate sees an opportunity to gain voter support by pushing pro crypto policy.


Luckily for us all, we have 4 years of *each* candidate in office and can base our opinion on the topic **through their actions while in office.**

The Biden administration vs. the Trump administration **is a night and day difference on crypto policy** There is **ZERO** argument towards that. 

If Democrat voters want support from the crypto community, then they need to voice their opinions to their elected officials and demand policy change. 

Posting rants on r/cryptocurrency about "orange man bad" literally does *nothing* for your cause.
On similar lines, I saw some people on Twitter cheering that he'll free Ross Ulbricht if elected, but I was like why didn't he free him when he was last in power if he cared so much?
Well, BTC and ETH beeing ETF'd during Bidens presidency, not Trumps. Just sayin.
As soon as I started seeing all the news stories about Trump being good for crypto, I thought to myself...well, it looks like he's found a new group to try and grift.
He is bad but he is more pro Bitcoin and pro crypto than fucking Biden and Elizabeth Warren, anyone can see that
Reddit never fails to reddit.
It‚Äôs probably because crypto and trump have an overlapping audience of fucking morons
I liked it better when trump was in office over poop pants kid sniffer.
Did it occur to you that maybe you are the dipshit.  I take offense to your stupidity in calling Trump a con man.
He learned the pump and dump from his father. Also a criminal.
Still not voting for Biden
Trump is prob better for crypto than dems at least the very liberal ones
Trump
Is a 
Grifter.
Money laundering for Russian gangsters and over all shitbird.
Trumpis only good for trump. Not for his voters not the economy, not crypto, not his donors even not his children.
Cause conservatives are brainwashed and think if they post online that supreme daddy trump will come to their house and sing the national anthem while handing them a million dollars.
He‚Äôs pro extracting money out of others üëå
His history with grifts and empty promises should be a major red flag. Just because he‚Äôs got NFTs doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs a crypto advocate. It‚Äôs all about his own gain, not supporting the crypto community.
The fact that anybody still believes any word that comes out of Donald trumps mouth. Is nothing short of lunacy.
Trump is better for depression and killing the world. Thats about it.
Trump is for sale.  He's being bought.  Until the other side buys him for more, he'll be pro crypto
I think he was trying to pander to the libertarians before their convention. "Something something crypto... something something, free Ross Ulbricht!"

Guarantee he's forgotten whatever it was he said about that thingamajig to those very nice people who booed him.
This is under the presumption that Trump and his followers are smart and/or know what they‚Äôre talking about. They aren‚Äôt and they don‚Äôt.
Pretty much everything Trump has been involved with has been a scam, and most things involving cryptocurrencies are scams, so it seems like a good fit.
Shameful vocabulary, dude.
TDS... alive and well.
Yes Elizabeth Warren and her pet Gary Gensler are truly better for crypto. Not saying Trump is guaranteed to be better but what we have now is pretty bad. 

But what else can you expect from mainstream Reddit besides OrAnge MaN bAD
morons tend to like trump
Trump is better than Biden for Crypto that‚Äôs for sure
Trump was/is anti crypto. In 2017 his new tax plan included taxing crypto - and he has called BTC a scam for nearly 10 years. NOW... do I believe that he really was? Or was he trying to use his sway to manipulate the Crypto markets for his friends to buy low... That is up for debate.
Are the Russian bots in the room with you right now?
Trump is living rent free inside this posters head üçÄ
Trump is good at herding dumb people. One way to know if you're dumb is that you never budge in an argument, just keep repeating the same thing but louder. I'm not a Biden supporter either, I think your political system is a joke.
He‚Äôs not good for anything
As opposed to letting Biden or the democrats win? Fuck that.
All the "pro Trump" posts on this sub get the votes disabled and all the negative ones the votes are enabled so it's clear where the mods bias lie. Like it or not, there are still two political parties in the US and some are pro Biden and some are pro Trump and Redditors should get to decide on their own who they like and not have their opinions given to them.
Cope harder. Get ready to say goodbye to the worst president in history. Joe Biden is by far the worst thing possible for America. Let's go Brandon! TRUMP2024 üá∫üá∏
The only thing Trump is good for is fucking shit up.

If you want your shit fucked, call Trump.
The pro trump posts are bought pro Russian accounts and/or idiots who ate from the Russian propaganda buffet
There is zero chance that Trump cares about anything tech related to BTC. He either sees a way for him to enrich himself or he sees a way to get votes from idiots. Do not be one of those idiots.
I genuinely can‚Äôt understand people trying to make Biden out as a pro-crypto candidate. His SEC chair has spelled out plans to kill the industry. I mean can it be any clearer?
Isn‚Äôt the whole concept of crypto to be affected by politics?
The best thing for crypto is proper regulation at this point, it has the institutional mass it just needs regulation and removal of stupid barriers that it currently has. Allowing more people to more easily buy it, and allowing companies to more easily trade it is what is needed
You have to ask yourself, is Congress going to pass some decent crypto legislation with Trump in office?

Nothing that requires votes from both sides of the aisle is going to go anywhere for 4 years.
Trump is 'passively' good for thing because for some reason we had a run when he was president. But he has nothing to do with it directly.

It reminds me of some of the immigration stuff. People come more when Democrats are in office because they believe  they are not as bad, so the other side blames it directly on them.

He‚Äôs obviously pandering but I mean is the Biden administration doing anything better currently?
I‚Äôm not even sure crypto is better for crypto.
It's not going to matter, nothing you say, nothing anybody says, 2024 is just another insane fest of everyone projecting what they want to believe on both candidates because we've lost all touch with objective reality as a country.

Let it go, let people believe whatever stupid bullshit they desperately need to believe to help their world make any sense to them whatsoever.

In the past we had a magical invisible sky-man who burned you forever if he saw you masturbate. Now we have 80 year old men in positions of ludicrous corruptive influence that we imbue with the same qualities we give Marvel superheroes.

Trump hates crypto.  At least he used to.
One part of a recent speech was him quoting a figure of 50,000,000 people holding crypto‚Ä¶ he likely sees that number and thinks it will put him over the top in the general election.  I don‚Äôt take anyone‚Äôs campaign promises at face value. That said, the 180 that the SEC just pulled on the spot ETH ETF seems political too.
Democrats were highly against crypto and wanted it banned. Trump says he will allow crypto and suddenly the Democrats had their a** h*** f*****ed to say they are for it.
[removed]
Everyone is incentivized by Bitcoin in their own way. Even Michael Saylor, who was once against Bitcoin, recognized its legitimacy when it proved beneficial to him and his company. Is Bitcoin politically useful to Trump? Yes. But like Saylor, everyone who is incentivized by Bitcoin contributes to its overall network effect.
Bitcoin won't be worth much if Trump pulls all support for Ukraine and WW3 Kicks off in Europe.
As much as I don't like Trump, this is not true 

People talk about his backflipping such as how cryptocurrency competes with the US dollar etc. However, you have to allow people to change their minds. 

I completely agree,  it's a completely political thing however, it appears he's getting a lot more advisory on how his previous comment was wrong. 

Example, crypto does not challenge the US dollar in the way many think, if anything the evolution of blockchains and cryptocurrencies such as stablecoins and crypto wallets proliferate and enormous beneficiaries to the US dollar. Stablecoins are 99% backed by the US dollar, with stablecoin issuers becoming enormous demanders of US treasuries, which is great for the supply side. And then on the demand The US dollar is accessible to anyone around the world with just a internet connection and a crypto wallet. Never before have US dollars been so easy to buy. 

So of course it's political and you can read into all that as you like. But the underlying reason why he backflipped is actually just good policy IMO
You don‚Äôt need to say it out loud to the reddits, but please let his base pump up the roots of BTC so they are ripe & juicy for the intelligentsia‚Äôs exit strategies.
I'm okay with this opinion as long as you can also admit that Larry Fink isn't good for crypto either.
Unfortunately it happens way too much. ANY politician/government/banking official does numerous things against the crypto community but the moment they mention it in positive light just once people seem to either forget or not care about the past. None of them like this community. They will use it to their benefit at the time whether for election or money, but then they will choose the old system over us again once they achieve their goal. They will NEVER truly accept anything they can't fully control every aspect of.
Some people just buy any lie he tells and keep getting burned . They are like children who don‚Äôt understand object permanence. Just because trump says he‚Äôs in favor of giving everyone a billionaire dollars doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs happening . HE SAYS WHATEVER HE NEEDS TO SAY
He‚Äôs gonna rugpull the election
He LOVES crypto - haven‚Äôt you bought any of his NFTs?
[removed]
You're missing the point.

It's not about picking one politician over another, they're all in competition for whom has the most horrific record of personal and professional crimes

It's about sending a message that this industry is comprised of participants who will vote on pro-crypto legislation as their top priority, single issue voters make for a block that must be pandered to in order to wield power
Eh, in the long run? I don't know. All I know is that he's probably gonna try to pay off his lawyer fees with his crypto which has put me up 3x since his cult keeps pumping into it. See you after the next two debates, gay boizzzzz!
is this rant a post about crypto or about the poster's profound dislike of a politician?

*only one of those belongs in this space*
No you don't understand, I'm from the future, the hard drive I hid that has .2 BTC is worth 10% more under Trump, I just have to bide my time in the internment camp (they didn't send me here because of my sexuality it was an honest mistake, I'm hoping my appeals hearing goes well in 4 months) and when I get out, I'll be able to afford 2 months rent!
It‚Äôs tiring to see. 

Best thing to do is ignore the noise and vote.
He‚Äôll just find a way to take all the value for himself.
yup
Glad there's hope for crypto bros
He's pro-anything as long as he can use it to line his pockets.
I mean, you‚Äôre not wrong but unfortunately I think Biden is toxic for crypto too. They‚Äôre both dip shits. Dammed if we do dammed if we don‚Äôt
How much crypto could I earn if I become a Russian bot?

Yawn
Trump is better for Trump, that is all.
His administration's record was not notably more pro-crypto than others.
Finally someone says it
Trump can't even spell "crypto".
The bots and conspiracy nutjobs are out heavy in this thread. 
No one with a brain would have their political stance swayed by unhinged reddit crazies.
I want to be your friend.
I mean, how do we know that Crypto will fail under a Russian-backed corrupt dictator? Sure, maybe my kids and their friends will end up getting shipped to fight Europe on behalf of Putin, and I would probably get a boot to the mouth when I ask ‚Äúhey whatever happened to the draft and being able to duck out to Canada?‚Äù but I‚Äôm positive the Donald won‚Äôt mess with my crypto investment right????
Trump will make you trade your bitcoins for pesos. And that‚Äôs what you should do anyway.
Damn I didn‚Äôt even have to scroll that far down to find all the crazy Trump people
He‚Äôs good for crypto because he will weaken the dollar.
I had a crypto based startup in 2003, failed in the end, but I've still got a chunk of ETH and BTC.

The single worst thing in the community in those days (and it really was a great community in the main) was the *overlap with the basket of insane and/or low IQ deplorables*.

Several of whom are now multi-multi millionaires and think that means they are obviously smart, and not just friends or relatives of Ayn Rand sycophants who got a lucky and ultimately very lucrative break. 

(Me, I poured too much into propping up a business for far longer that I should have.  Am I jealous of the multimillionaire idiots and hard-right crazies I used to know?  Duh!)
What did Biden say about Crypto?
I don't like Trump or Biden. I don't know which one is best for crypto, and I don't really care.  Biden called himself a Zionist and supplied Israel with billions in weapons - which hard working Americans paid for in taxes.  Israel has treated the Palestinians terribly for years, stealing their land, and when they lash out, they get called terrorists - mostly women and children get bombed to death. Bombs the US supplied. When Biden is made aware of this disgusting behavior, he acts concerned, but continues to supply Israel with weapons.  He has been given millions of dollars from AIPAC, a pro-Israel lobbying group.  Why can other countries buy out politicians, and why are our politicians so easily bought?  This is a real issue. 

Who is best for crypto? You're all just worried about your petty little self interests, just like our disgusting politicians, whose positions can be bought.  You delude yourselves that Bitcoin is actually good for the environment while ignoring that a lot of bitcoin is being mined with coal, and it tends to hog energy from hydro power - so much so that China banned it. Will I lose money if crypto does poorly? Yes. However, I'd rather see what's right be done than worry about my petty little self interests.
[removed]
Let‚Äôs all just come together and both parties agree to be pro-crypto
Absolute snake. Cannot be trusted on anything.
Drive me bonkers that people think he‚Äôs a financial genius and will usher in an economic miracle.
Trump lies. He will only ever make policy in his own interests, which is only good if you're already rich. Not "retire at 50" rich, I'm talking "when my car gets dirty I buy a new one" rich
He said he should be put to death too
*proceeds to create NFT scam*
"It's a scam that I'm not currently part of, so that's why I don't like it. I prefer scams where I get the money. Like Trump University."
"I don't like <thing> because of <conclusion I came to based on absolutely no learning or critical thinking whatsoever>" - DJT
"This is fake news" or "Trump has changed his views" 

These will be the 2 lame retorts to the evidence you shared. People who support Trump are generally lazy when it comes to their critical thinking. If you share something that paints Trump in a negative light, they will put their fingers in their ears and pretend it doesn't exist.

Also, Trump constantly says shit that he doesn't believe as part of his grift. Pretending to be anti-immigrant when he has hired plenty of illegals to work for him. Pretending to have read the Bible when he can't even say "2nd Corinthians" correctly. Pretending to be anti abortion when he has been both pro choice his entire life. Being a life long Democrat and suddenly going full on conservative. Says he'll replace Obama care with something better any minute without the slightest evidence he has even looked into it. Stated that if he were president, he'd be working his ass off too hard to have time for golf, yet golf every 6 days while funneling money to his golf resort. 

He's a known compulsive liar. I don't understand why anyone would trust a single word he says. It's fucking infuriating.
Trump will also say literally anything to stay out of jail...
It depends on why he picks in treasury. He just parrots the whatever the most recent lobbyist shill passes through to him. 

Mnuchin was anti because his lobbyists who paid him were. Now they‚Äôre shilling for young votes and crypto lobbying moment so he‚Äôs changed his tune. Trump has no actual values or thought beyond boosting his own ego
Correct that it's a scam, incorrect that it's a currency and can compete with the dollar.
Yup, be also said he would declare war against it, if it starts threatening the USD. He isn't pro Bitcoin, he's actually very anti Bitcoin. Bitcoin is supposed to overtake all currency, including the USD. Sooner or later he will try to fight it.
> In a 2021 interview, Trump said, "Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam. I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar"‚Äã 

well that was before he realized he could make money on his shitty nft's
He just says whatever sounds good for the majority of people
That's funny. I've frequently described Trump as a "scam" and in an interview I said "I don't like him because he's just another piece of shit grifter competing against the other piece of shit grifters to take our dollars and make our lives even worse."
I post this over and over and catch so much crap for it. Facts dont matter
> Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam. I was surprised ‚Äî you know, with us, it was at $6,000 and, much lower. I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar, essentially it's a currency competing against the dollar.

Wow, much deepness. He really appeals to people's intelligence.
Anyone can change their mind on an issue. 

Michael Saylor was once against bitcoin, and in December 19 2013 he said ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.‚Äù
Michael Saylor did not believe Bitcoin at first.
Give him two weeks.

he has a great plan, the best plan, to replace the affordable care act
He just told Michigan that he would end electric cars in the US.

A couple years ago he was touring new electric car battery plants.

The man has no actual policy.
This is a fact.  How people allow themselves to be conned repeatedly by this conman blows my mind. Dude will tell you exactly what he thinks you want to hear, then do the exact opposite.  And that's been his MO his entire career. Heck.  He said he was AGAINST crypto at times while he was potus and wanted to strengthen the dollar.

Half the time he'll even flat out tell some of these people exactly what they DON'T want to hear, and they'll defend it.  It's maddening.  I've basically given up trying to figure them out.  I think some people like being scammed if they feel like they are part of something along the way.  (There's a reason people fall for cults.)

I've basically given up trying to rationalize with them or understand.  It just is mind numbing and will make you lose your mind trying to figure it out.
I recall watching the 2016 election when he literally had a talking point, for **and** against, literally every policy. I thought him arguing with himself out of both sides of his mouth was transparent to all, yet here we are.
And gullible people continue to believe everything he says. Blows my fucking mind. I'm really happy to see this thread and see that the crypto space has some sane people left in it.

Trump has been a known liar and grifter for *decades*. Stop falling for it everyone.
He will say anything for a vote as long as the other guy isn't also saying it, including things he said first. The only thing he is dedicated to other than his own image is being contrarian.
DING DING DING! And the guy who gave porn stars his laundry list of STD's TOTALLY NEVER supported abortion.
thats literally what authoritarian takeovers are like.  He's describing an authoritarian takeover.
Welcome to fascism! They don't care about established rules nor about any laws 

Deportation of anyone who's different is always one of the first steps - then we'll see where it's going
So concentration camps and gestapo. At least he's on brand
And how exactly do the so-called "libertarians" feel about this?

Also why the fuck was perhaps the least libertarian politician in the country speaking at a libertarian event?
Can I get a video or timestamp of something of this to save?

Amen. Bitcoin is great and all but just make sure you have a country you can spend/enjoy it in.¬†
Fair statement.
Not much to investigate when it's 100% legal for them to do it.
They should be investigating insider trading by the whole US Government. 

Nancy Pelosi insider trading is the most obvious and blatant crime I have ever seen.
One thing to note is I haven't heard very many anti crypto remarks from Biden since Trump started trying to use it as a wedge issue. Additionally a bipartisan group of lawmakers have made multiple attempts at supporting it. 

I feel he recognizes being anti crypto could hurt him in an election and is backing off. 

It's just circumstantial but look at the ETH ETF. Everyone thought it would be dead and wouldn't get approved. Then Trump started "supporting" Crypto and the ETH ETF went from like a 20% chance of approval to being approved a few weeks later. You have to wonder if the Biden administration pushed the SEC to get it approved.
Blackrock‚Äôs SEC* approved the ETFs
Really its this right here. Dont listen to their filthy lying mouths. Watch what they do.
lol what. the SEC only approved BTC etf after court claimed they were being 'arbitrary and capricious'. not to mention going after almost every legitimate actor in the space (coinbase, kraken, consensys, robinhood, uniswap, etc). 

to say this SEC is friendlier towards the industry is so wrong it's laughable.
Bidden didnt approve the ETF. 

It was the court of appeals, where they found the SEC to be "arbitrary and capricous" and ordered the SEC to approve it. 

Garry also sued Coinbase, kraken and uniswap. Which are the most legit exchanges whilst at the same time having multiple private tete a tetes with SBF.
But also continues with the Ripple case. No administration is pro-crypto.
The outright lying and rewriting history here as the election approaches lol

Never forget Gensler was thoroughly against the BTC ETF until the last possible moment. He was forced against his will and threatened by legal action/mounting pressure from hedge funds
This is really all you need to know.

Trump will say anything but he's already had four years to show you.
Biden‚Äôs sec : as long as we can tax it, control it, seize it, and exponentially fee it coming and going, do whatever you want
The SEC approved the Bitcoin ETF with all the enthusiasm of a child eating their vegetables. 

Their hand were forced by the courts. Biden gets no credit here lol.

As for ETH its a similar thing with the whole security debate. The SEC lost the Ripple case so pushing to exclude Eth was pointless.
This shit is true for almost all categories. Trump is bad for nearly everything if you look at the data.

I don‚Äôt disagree, but Tether isn‚Äôt nearly the risk it once was imo. They completely overhauled their reserves and are now in line with those you‚Äôd find in tradfi.
American voters might be the dumbest motherfuckers.

I just had a week long training on coaching and communication. This was a topic, because a rational person cant even comprehend the why.  It boils down to fear, hate and tribal thinking combined with confirmation bias, magical thinking and a lot of these people feeling they can‚Äôt back-out of this position as it would make them lose face. It‚Äôs really baffling and in a way very interesting. Pointing out when in history we‚Äôve seen the same brings us to some cliche things I‚Äôm afraid.
This analysis is adroit in my opinion. After so many instances of voters still supporting Trump, this makes the best case why they do. Sadists basically. Please check out [this historian explain it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOjJtEkKMX4)
He's not even for his friends or family. He'll sell them all out/throw them under the bus when it suits him. It happens. every. fucking. time.
Pick whoever is better at upholding the constitution and everyone‚Äôs bill of rights.

Seems like the first two amendments are always under attack. One amendment was designed to protect the other amendment.
You do remember that Bush invaded another country under false pretenses and got American soldiers killed right?
It‚Äôs not even hyperbole. A judge decided that what trump did was rape. He‚Äôs a rapist. And religious people love him for it.
Short term memory is a fact.  I think some people forget that Trump was POTUS in 2020.  Which you know... Might be the worst year I can remember of the past half century in the US.    But somehow people think it was better.
Trump is not a convicted rapist‚Ä¶goodbye any credibility you thought you had lol
__2 Billion (with a B)__* dollars.  After manually nepo-ramming the guy's security clearance through when it rightly got denied multiple times.

The only way you'll ever hope to personally benefit is if you try to latch on to whatever scam he's currently pulling for his own money-laundering or self-interest, like the Truth Social stock pump-and-dump.
Facts. Trump not only owns crypto but accepts bitcoin for political donations lol
How?
Collectivists realized that crypto is one of the few areas where they're losing the youth vote and are trying to shore up that angle, despite supporting it being entirely against their anti-free market goals.
Votedoge is the best, love this project .
VoteDoge will make meme history
VoteDoge is definately a better choice
He's anti-regulation for his businesses and the businesses of his pals and donors.

He's very happy to allow the regulation other things, like bodily autonomy.
I like crypto, but I LOVE America.

Well, most of it anyway, starting to have some reservations about the bottom bits.
Biden had nothing to with the ETFs lol. His SEC fought them until they lost in court and were ordered too. 

Stop misleading people for political points
He could stop the lawsuits against coinbase, kraken, uniswap.  Shut down operation chokpoint 2.0 and get elizabeth warrens "anti crypto army" out of the oval office. 

On the positive side lay a legal path for tokenization of assets, create a legal and pragmatic pathway for people to fund raise via ICOs,
Imagine we get a btc etf an eth etf, marijuana rescheduling, a relatively soft landing, (fingers crossed) student debt forgiveness for roughly 10% of student debt and Trump gets the ‚Äúcrypto weed smoking millennial bro‚Äù vote
Explain the global security part. How are all the wars started under Biden helping us.

Regardless of who wins, it'll be a letdown. But I really hope it isn't trump.
Gensler approved the crypto ETFs which started this bull run.

Trump's SEC Chair sued Ripple and declared ICOs securities which killed the market.
Please get out of here with your facts. This is Reddit.
Biden has never taken an active anti-crypto stance, we got two ETFs in the past year. How exactly is Biden anti-crypto?
Might get people riled up enough to go to the ballot box in November. That's good enough for me.
Smart
Gotta love the mod comment "it's an election year so it's ok".... lol. Love for someone to tell us what Biden has said about crypto. Pretty sure Elizabeth Warren is a Democrat. So they think that voting for more Democrats will help crypto? Yeah, I'll vote for Trump to be good for crypto.
What do you mean votes disabled? Do you mean they get removed from the sub? We can't disable votes without removing a post. Posts get removed for a number of reasons.
The 2 parties are the problem - RFK check him out, really
What are you talking about? The scores being hidden? That's just how reddit works, there's no victim complex angle here.
He can be trusted to act in what he thinks is his own best interest... every time.

It's like trying to elect comcast to the white house.
Low intelligence people say this about every trendy rich person, because all they comprehend is charismatic = hard working, and thus literally the next jesus. Elon and Trump dickriders only care that they have a good smile and say things confidently.
Trump cares about making money and accruing power. He recognizes what will get him money (work the NFT bubble) and what will get him power (giving lip service to crypto). He has no intention of doing anything positive for crypto, his last administration was historically antagonistic
My favorite part about his nfts is that he takes 10% of every transaction. Meaning the price doesn't matter so long as people continue to wash trade them. 


Ultimately it is a money laundering scam with a coat of paint.
Let me tell you, these were the greatest NFTs ever. Probably the best in the history of the world, believe me. Nobody cared about NFTs before I got involved, but now everyone‚Äôs talking about them. And they‚Äôre making millions. It‚Äôs amazing, really. Tremendous.
Hes scamming the maga idiots, I‚Äôm fine with that
Well of course, he's a scammer. He obviously knows a scam when he sees one. /s
They even co-op'd Melania's Twitter account to sell crypto. Pretty much the whole family are on the crypto take
Proceeds to sell cheap sneakers for a lot of money.
You gotta understand, he needs that money to pay for his lawsuits lol
No but he likes scams when he is profiting.
To be fair, if there is one thing Trump is good at, it's scams. Unfortunately you can never tell if he is doing one as he is talking to you. Is him saying it's a scam part of his scam?
I like how every justification of Trump saying stupid shit is always "he probably changed his mind since he said that"

I remember having this same discussion when Trump said he saw with his own eyes a vaccine give a child autism. And the defense was always "Well he probably changed his mind since then" and then 5 years later he's unsurprisingly anti-covid-vaccine. Well shit looks like he didn't change his mind after all!
>"We have come up with a solution that's really, really I think very good," Trump said at a meeting of the nation's governors at the White House.

>"Now, I have to tell you, it's an unbelievably complex subject," he added. "Nobody knew health care could be so complicated."
It will be very powerful
That almost sounds like Elon promising great products next year
The best plan, just like the best wall he built and Mexico paid for it....oh wait...
They already removed the individual mandate part that most Americans took issue with. Now they want to strip away all the protections it offers so that insurance companies & health system shareholders can get back to making record profits.
That‚Äôs the real thing. He has no policy. He will not propose legislation. He‚Äôs just spewing whatever bull shit he thinks that audience in front of him wants to hear. He‚Äôd sell his children into slavery for half a dozen votes. If elected the entirety of his term will be focused on funneling as much tax payer money is his pocket as possible and refusing to give up power through any means necessary. 

If you think he‚Äôs going to propose meaningful policy for crypto you are too stupid to participate in public discourse.
I'm a Type 1 Diabetic and when DJT lied on TV saying he "made insulin cheaper than water," one of my Trumpy family members called me to snarkily "congratulate" me. I explained, no, none of his executive orders affected me at all, they said I had TDS. They believed the politician entertainer guy over me, their diabetic family member.


Then when the Biden administration signed laws capping my monthly copay to $35, they got real mad. They weren't happy for me! They said Biden was stealing credit for what Trump had done.¬†
What gets me is how 8 years ago people were chanting "Law and Order" and "Lock her up" at rallies and that Obama needed to be deported, and now they're crying that it's unfair to try politicians for fraud and bribery. And then Trump got elected and told supporters [to just stop caring about it.](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-lock-her-up-now-we-dont-care-2016-12)

Granted, I know these people see a version of the news that is like if Joe Rogan smoked copies of The National Inquirer, but still. This is critical thinking 101.
That reminds me of his British counterpart Boris Johnson who went into the Brexit result with two letters written, one where he congratulationed the country on its brilliance for rejecting Brexit, and another where he congratulted the country on its brilliance for passing Brexit.
and if there is one thing libertarians like... it's authority!
lol, I never saw a libertarian that's actually opposed to a right-wing dictatorship.
I am absolutely not going to comb through video footage of that man talking, but [here's an article describing what he said](https://newrepublic.com/post/181984/trump-new-details-police-mass-deportation-immigration), so you can look for it if you have a stronger stomach than I do.
Oh, hey, someone with a brain!

Giving *Donald Trump* the money printer is the dumbest thing you could ever do if you yourself wanted to be wealthy.

Was the first time where he committed ~91 felonies, not a big enough red flag?

Do these people think the term "red flag" is iust the Republican flag, or what?

Hillary Clinton couldn't eat enough babies for me to vote for this piece of shit.
They know we hate it, but we can't do anything about it and they simply don't care to change anything
>I feel he recognizes being anti crypto could hurt him in an election and is backing off. 

This is EXACTLY why we are seeing a *slight* administration policy shift. Dems can't afford to give Republicans and leverage in any sector.
Two years ago Biden issued some policy guidelines for his administration: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/09/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-innovation-in-digital-assets/

They're actually quite good and quite hands-off for the govt, though a lot of them are more about developing policy for the future all of which would require Congress to actually legislate.
üíØ this
Yes.  All facts.  I‚Äôm no trump fan, but these ETFs had nothing to do with Biden
There are reasons Biden polls +11 with voters who at least somewhat follow the news and politics and Trump is up +24 with voters who don‚Äôt.  Trump does way better with people who have no idea what‚Äôs going on.
The SEC isn't.  Congress, the senate and Biden are about to approve that ETH be governed the the commerce ministry instead of the SEC.   That's the legislation that is now on the Senate and was voted in bipartisanly.
Everything good that happens under Biden, wasn't due to Biden. Everything bad that happens under Biden, is Biden's fault.
THANK YOU.
Norms and traditions at the SEC means they continue lawsuits from previous administrations.  Don't be surprised when the SEC ends up losing.
I don't care if children like their vegetables.  I care that they eat them.  

You care that they *say* they like them when they instead hide the vegetables in their napkin and toss them in the trash later.  

We are not the same.
pretty ironic honestly that Americans might vote themselves straight into a fascist regime
We sure might be, stick around and find out this November!
as a foreigner looking in, republicans seem to be a collection of the worst human beings on the planet.

The MOST selfish group of people I've ever encountered.

They'd rather throw away a good meal than have to share it with someone. They are happy to go hungry if their neighbours don't get to eat.
The problem is we‚Äôre racing to the bottom of the barrel on our presidential candidates. It‚Äôs absurd that we‚Äôre going to be forced to choose between a dude that is clearly in mental decline and may die but surrounds himself with generally competent people and a dude who is a pathological narcissistic liar who wants to dismantle democracy and is also probably in mental decline but it‚Äôs tough to tell cuz he‚Äôs already a moron and just seems less in decline because he‚Äôs on stimulants. There is a clear lesser of two evils, but good lord it‚Äôs fucking awful and depressing that we can‚Äôt do better.
Makes sense. I‚Äôm sure this time in American society will be widely studied in the future.
What laws has the Biden administration passed to attack your free speech? Wasn't it communists who were targeted during the witchhunts of the cold war? Gay people whose existence was illegal until the mid-2000's? Who is [banning books](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/books/lauren-groff-bookstore-lynx.html) in public schools at the moment? 

If this "cancel culture" and political correctness stuff was a serious legal issue outside of gay rights, the books bans, etc. then Kanye West would be facing life in prison at this point.
Trump enacted more gun control in 4 years than Obama did in 8. Not sure how much Biden did yet. Amd project 2025 looks like Republicans plan on violating the 1st amendment in a very large way, banning any works they deem to be "woke" or that hurts their agenda.
Yes.  He was widely considered the worst President in history too.  Had a historically low approval rating when he left office.

Trump was so bad in comparison he made Dubya look like an elder statesman.
Yup and trump had an Iranian general assassinated after meeting him to another country under the pretense of a diplomatic meeting.¬†


In case you weren't aware, that's an actual war crime.¬†


It's really saying something when we have to thank Iran for being the mature, rational ones in the room, and not retaliating. He tried to start a war, but cooler heads prevailed
You do also remember that Donny published sensitive information that got American spies arrested and killed, right? And that he practically freed thousand of Taliban fighters in return for... nothing.
Yeah that‚Äôs not what happened lol
What does that have to do with Bitcoin?
Or felon. Where are there any convictions at all for that matter?
Biden is openly anti Bitcoin trump recently is pro Bitcoin.
I'll take the bait and let you expand on this.

What regulations did Trump sign around bodily autonomy?

I'm taking the bait here because I really do want to know.
If anything, the ETF's being approved should be a reminder that Warren has virtually no influence within the Biden administration.  Remember when she backstabbed Bernie in hopes of getting an agency appointment from Biden and got nothing instead?
There has to be framework. The legal process has to play out, crypto can't just be the wild west in America, it doesn't work that way. You have to be able to legally trick and finagle people, unfortunately. Like the stock market. It will take time, even Trump won't just allow it..
>elizabeth warrens "anti crypto army" out of the oval office.

She is an elected senator who is part of the legislative branch and has the constitutional power to oversee what the executive branch does. Trump can't get rid of Warren - only Massachusetts voters can. If you guys stop for a second on worshipping an authoritarian, you will realize the importance of division of power.

>create a legal and pragmatic pathway for people to fund raise via ICOs,

The ICO era created numerous scams. Ppl made plenty of money from the last cycle without ICOs - the space doesn't need ICOs to make money. If you want to raise via an ICO,  then you can register yourself as a security. Even the current FIT bill would put ICO as a security rather than a commodity - that bill is being pushed by the Republicans. There is no way Republicans want to open this can of worms and get blamed for all the scams.

The same folks yapping about ICOs are also probably the ones who are excessively engaged in airdrop farming and all sort of other degen frontrunning to dupe and dump on newer retail. Then you also have these scammer devs rooting for these ICOs so they can more openly sell vaporware and scam to the public.
Trump is actually a full-grown adult who made his own decisions, that ended up getting him into a mess. It's ridiculous to blame his problems on Biden, who can't simultaneously be a feeble forgetful old man & also some communist authoritarian political mastermind.

Something about your viewpoint here just makes no sense. Biden is not prosecuting anyone. You might be surprised to learn he doesn't even work at the DoJ.
Biden isn't prosecuting anyone.  The government of the people are prosecuting a fraudulent, rapist, draft dodging, military hating traitor.
Gary Gensler can go suck a dick
Bull run was well under way before the ETF‚Äôs were approved. Reddit is so far behind the 8 ball when it comes to recognizing important factors which actually drive the industry overall.¬†
The bull run was gunna start with or without the ETF..
Gensler lost a court battle release a crybaby opinion piece about how much he hates what he's being forced to do.
No multiple lawsuits and the court over ruled Gensler. Which allowed for ETFs...
you have got to be delusional or the memory of a snail to genuinely believe this.

gensler was pulling teeth on the btc etf until he was threatened by legal action. He was forced against his will to approve the btc until the last possible moment
touch ink saw faulty voracious skirt wild enjoy fretful possessive

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
he is pro CBDC
you mean how gensler was threatened by legal action after pulling teeth until the last possible moment on the btc ETF?
True, he's actually incredibly consistent. "In what way does this personally benefit me?" Is the only question, every time.

Sometimes you've got to make a few jumps, eg: "This benefits Putin and Putin just bought 6 condos in Trump Tower, so therefore this benefits you "
that is a pretty good analogy

he appointed a verizon shill to head the fcc after all

and the literal ceo of exxon to sec of state
While this is basically true, he is also too stupid to know what is in his best interest. And to easy to manipulate
"He has no intention of doing anything positive". Not for crypto, or anything else. He just oozes negativity.
Yep, with narcissistic people you‚Äôve gotta watch their actions because they‚Äôll say anything
Yup. 

Build the wall = Never happened

Fix healthcare system = Never happened

Fix the border = Never happened

Make America Great Again = Never happened

Improve infrastructure = Never happened

I could go on‚Ä¶
He's the president of the people for whom the world moves too fast, is all. Crypto new, crypto scary.
Plus foreign actors and governments can more easily funnel him money through nfts and fake stocks 

It's truly mind blowing anybody believes anything trump says. He literally lied 30,000 times in office THAT WERE VERIFIABLE, in four years lol.
Lol where's the sarcasm there
I have personally experienced similar situations before...  *Sigh*
I'm sorry your family sucks and is willfully both ignorant AND stupid.
Dude I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs horrible for you but utterly hysterical . Like there‚Äôs no possible way their messiah could be lying. Like to them it‚Äôs totally out of the question. Like there could be a price sign that says 1 million dollars in front of their faces , and they would still be snarky to you.
It's pretty hypocritical to me.  Just tells me.  They never cared about those things to begin with, and it was just an excuse.
Republicans have been projecting their own bullshit onto their opponents for several decades now
Still waiting for Biden to sign the SAB 121. Not that I think Trump would have signed it either.
2/3rds of Dems voted against it with nearly 100% of Republicans voting for it. Wouldn't exactly say it's bi partisan, so much as some Dems crossed the line but most didn't

Dems are certainly worse on the crypto issue
By this logic, we should blame Biden for overturning Roe.
THANK YOU.
they won't be ever in favor of crypto because it's actually competing with the dollar. they will make a digital currency and call it a day.
Not that ironic, we've been bff's with basically every fascist around the world since the minute ww2 ended.
That a rapist, and soon to be convicted felon is telling you that he's cool with it. You shouldn't trust this person.
>Trump: 'I was able to kill Roe v. Wade'
I didn't say he signed regulations about bodily autonomy, I said he allowed it. The meaning being that by his actions, he knowingly directly appointed and enabled others, who had telegraphed their intentions to regulate women's reproductive rights, to do exactly that. Following that, he proudly took credit for it. 

People can argue whether or not that's a good thing, but it's pretty clearly not anti regulation.

As I said, he's anti regulation when it suits him or his pals/donors.
Actually Biden stated through White House he was in fact not gonna veto it
Does that mean he hates crypto or does that mean he disagrees with this piece of legislation?
He‚Äôs so messed up from years of drugs and untreated mental illness that his judgment is skewed. His crimes are traitorous; his defenses are clownish.  He‚Äôs performing for those supporters who, sadly, see him as their very own orange messiah.
If only we had had examples of his awful actions before electing him in 2016 /s

People aren‚Äôt gonna learn and then vote. They listen to hear what they want to hear, and vote that way. SOME on the margins can be reminded of how awful he acted as President and will vote against him or just not show up. And this is an election that will be decided on the margins. Remind people that he will scam them as thanks for their vote, and much much worse.
The old joke was that the GOP was going to repeal "Obamacare" and replace it with the Affordable Care Act ;)

And as you watched them "try" to do it that's exactly how it played out.  They would propose doing something, leave it, propose ... decide to leave it.   Until they quit.
I love how in 2016 I had a ton of FB friends in construction saying ‚Äúthe wall will be great for the trades, it will put millions to work.‚Äù Then Trump did nothing. Biden then passed the Infrastructure Act which actually put people to work and those same FB friends complained about overspending. Basically people will spin anything to fit their reality they‚Äôve crafted for themselves.
American Dream is Dead = well he did make that happen
To be fair, the Democrats did everything in their power to prevent and block Trump from building that wall.
I think the inference that crypto is a scam?
Indeed. Clinton got impeached for a consensual blowjob, and now they're not worried about the former president bribing adult film actresses, cheating on his wives, or bragging about groping women, but they are very worried about LGBT people corrupting the youth with sexuality and think sex ed needs to be out of classrooms. Coincidentally... what a shame that it's easier for predators to get away with such crimes when kids are uneducated.

Honestly, to quote old Norm... the worst part isn't the hypocrisy. I'd say it's the rape and murder.
Don't look up polling. A solid 20% does blame Biden for overturning Roe.

Migraines.
People do!
Which is, believe it or not, not regulation.
*It Is Difficult to Get a Man to Understand Something When His Salary Depends Upon His Not Understanding It* - Upton Sinclair
Don‚Äôt worry. A few of Trump‚Äôs colleagues started a fundraiser to help build the wall. Too bad it was a fraudulent fundraiser and they just stole the money. 

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62841761

Oddly enough, Trump pardoned Steve Bannon before leaving office. Funny how that works out. Wouldn‚Äôt you say?
And to be fair, the wall fell through because of a lack of funding from Mexico, when their president pretty much laughed his ass off away from that joke.
Ok now do all the other things he promised
To be more fair, Republicans, in charge of all 3 branches of government, shut down the government on themselves as they couldn't agree on their idiotic wall bullshit.¬†¬†


The only reason the wall became a taking line is that Trump was *too stupid* to remember to talk about border security without someone simpler to grasp. They never wanted a wall
They did everything they could to deny him funding...because he said that Mexico would pay for it. And then, of course, Mexico said go f' off. So he then broke his promise (an admittedly stupid one) and demanded that the US tax payers foot the bill. 

And yes, at that point, Congress said no. So he found loopholes and raided the Pentagon's budget to pay for his wall.
Thank gd it‚Äôs a rediculous waste of money to prop up his ego and give the illusion of security
Indeed.  It is far more permanent.
In all the crazy stuff Trump has said it‚Äôs so easy to lose track, I totally forgot how he ran on ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna build that wall AND Mexico is gonna pay for it!‚Äù  That got people all fired up. Of course it was bullshit, though.
Yes, it permanently said "the supreme court is going to stay out of this, and let the legislature be responsible for writing laws"
Practically speaking, did that gave more or less freedom to the citizens?
Which means he through his policy of appointments ensured bodily autonomy would be infringed upon.
Technically more but practically as it's played out less.

Actually after the next round of voting with how many propositions are on state ballots it might end up being significantly more.
He appointed judges who follow the constitution. The courts should not be making new laws. If abortion should be federally guaranteed, that law should go through the legislative branch.
No, this activist court made new law and it one of the many reasons Trump will become a two-time loser.
ITS OVER. ITS. OVER!

Good
Fuck! I mean congrats.
Amazing! Congrats OP!
Came here for this. Great use of time.
Yep perfect efficiency.
When you get the inevitable question you have no clue about. Just read the options and ask yourself, ‚Äúwhat would a regulator (ie, Congress) have written as code?‚Äù. 

Obviously Congress didn‚Äôt write audit regulations, but it‚Äôs the same mindset. Protect against fraud, be conservative, have checks and balances. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure I passed with this mindset‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwhat would a regulator pick?‚Äù. I swear I took educated guesses on 1/3 of the Qs.
I didn't get in the 80s on AUD (79)... but my advice for AUD is that all of the terminology sounds the same and the devil is in the details. Slow down, read carefully, and pick the BEST answer - not just one that fits. 

You're going to crush it next time! Good luck!
How do you know you failed? Were scores released early? It was it in a previous window
About 150 for far (had to take it twice)

60 for reg 

100 for both BEC and AUD
Nah. 

I basically just read, then watched the lectures, and then did the mcqs.

I used the tbs at the end as a kind of final review.
I took reg back in November, so I got that in December.

Aud I took in March and didn't get till just now....


I think the other two don't show a score because they were taken while the old NASBA portal was still active.
My  (I guess now former) firm paid for Becker.
Three letters = CPA
OP passed all four sections and got the three letter designation CPA
happy cake day
Only if it was the first attempt
I always do bad on the AUD practice exams because I use the "throw the book at white collar crime" mentality when it's typically not reality haha
Some of the scores that were originally going to be released June 4 are being released early. I think for all of the core exams?
How long did it take for you to complete all 4 exams?
Thank you.
haha ok so i am stoopid
So glad you told me that, going to check mine tonight
Knee capping the supply chain like a bookie is straight gangster üòÖ
I‚Äôd compare negotiations for this strike to be somewhere close to the Israel/Hamas ceasefire deal. Impractical stipulations that are unobtainable. The longer this goes on the worse this will get the worse it will be domestically and internationally. Implications unknown other than adding to already a basket of inflationary pressures. Grab your üçø we have front row seats to the shit show. üòÖ

Everything I know about longshoremen is from Season 2 of The Wire.
I swear ive sat next to this guy in every casino ive ever been to. ¬†And he‚Äôs always equally as entertaining¬†
Dude has a gold chain, you know he means business and eats gabagool.
This guy just said a mall will close in the third week without receiving clothes lol
Guarantee that the ports are doing cost analysis while they‚Äôre striking, to calculate the costs of going fully automated.
They are already rerouting to the west coast.
Sounds like the car salesman can get a job at the pier
No one's selling cars right now anyways, and malls across the country closed 20 years ago.
‚ÄúThird week: malls start closing‚Äù

Are there still malls?

He has solidified the case for automation.
I think these threats and actual harms will make people realize how important it is to automate these vital functions ASAP, and there'll be little public support against it.  I don't think it'll be a win for them in the long run.
Imagine proving the necessity of automating your job by striking because you don't want your job to be automated.
Soft landing cancelled?  Recession incoming with mass inflation and huge layoffs?
Wearing $50,000 in jewelry and lenses while holding the US economy hostage. He can F\*\*k right off. This gives the industry more incentive to automate the ports.
Straight Gangster? this guy is a modern day union thug. This signals that automation is going to be a top priority for the ports, to avoid this mess in the future.
While I support fair pay for workers but this asshat just made the case for automation at the docks. The Chinese already do it. They have remote "shoremen" loading and unloading ships, putting the containers on autonomous vehicles, and moving goods around with no human in the way.
The high your labor cost the greater the incentive to automate. Why do you think this dude wants to stop automation in his contract? He sees the ominous threat on the horizon.
I‚Äôll tell you whose gonna win, the machines. You‚Äôre fucking crazy if you think they can‚Äôt be replaced and have been replaced in ports all across the world. Fuck those guys
Isn‚Äôt this the guy that made like $900k last year?
[deleted]
I‚Äôm gonna drop a flaming hot take and I don‚Äôt care if it gets downvoted to smithereens. Before y‚Äôall come for me I‚Äôm literally in a union that I voted to join.

The anti-automation demand is nonsense. It‚Äôs like elevator operators demanding that you can‚Äôt invent unmanned elevators (which actually happened). It‚Äôs like horse and carriage drivers trying to get cars banned.

The upside for the few thousand individuals involved is tremendous, but what is being proposed here is insane: higher prices for me and for you forever. Because that part of the supply chain will become permanently more expensive than it needs to, first by a little, and then by a lot as our competitors like China use automation to have 100%+ productivity gains.
He sounds like delusional egotistical fuck.
Most of your Temu orders are delivered on the West coast. You‚Äôll be fine üòÇ
Did they just dig their own graves? üò¨
Knee cappin, toe tappin, hoe slappin
This almost sounds like economic sabotage and blackmail. Knowingly planning to hold parts of the USA hostage. Short term they make get some crumbs, but long term they're going to get fucked for it.
This guy is nothing but a greedy piece of shit. He's gonna end up hurting his own personnel in the union. If everybody else has to go without do they think there is some magical  wand that's gonna provide them with the goods we all want. What a dope.
Asking for a 77% pay increase over 6 yrs is very aggressive
1st week, negotiate to end it 

2nd week, scabs 

3rd week through 8th week, scabs 

9th week, workers come crawling back and get worse terms than they have now 

85th week, headcount is drastically reduced by automation, as the strike made it clear there is an unacceptable vulnerability in their business model 

Welcome to playing hardball when you‚Äôre unskilled, replaceable labor. What a moronic thing to do.
Guy doing nothing to dispel stereotypes about unions and mafia influence n.
These guys are making 6 figures and this A hole is close to 1M a year. I hope they fire all of them. This is greed nothing more.
I think the dealerships are good‚Ä¶ LOT of inventory on their lots that ain‚Äôt moving. Fuck these guys, automate the shit out of the ports, probably less smuggling as a lot of these guys have records. The Mexican Mafia owns Port of Long Beach.
Fuck this stupid cocksucker. I have a 1 month old who needs a specific formula and guess what, it‚Äôs already wiped from the fucking shelves with no restock in sight.
this reminds me of a Joke, about all the body parts, that think They are the most important Part.

The Brain, The Heart, The Liver, But in the END (IT"S always the Asshole) the most important part
Sounds like economic terrorism, not just trying to get folks a better contract
Why cant they route the ships to Mexico, unload them there, and then truck them through the southern border?

If I were a businessman I'd make a Mexican trans-American shipping company to cash in on this.

Hell I could even claim they were "hencho en Mexico" and avoid China tarriffs. And I wouldnt have to pay American dockworker wages.

3 for 1!
I was on their side until I saw this. I can‚Äôt respect a man like that.
Frank Sobotka approves this message.
34 days before to the elections? ufff what a coincidence
All the more reason to automate these jobs. No one should have the power to shut down the supply chain.
He is the poster child for why American workers have largely rejected Unions. He talks gleefully about people losing their jobs, businesses being destroyed, families thrown into chaos, and homelessness if he does not get what he wants. He sees that the mob run nepotistic port system is coming to a swift end with automation. This is the desperate snarling rat trapped in the corner.
not sure how many Chinese ships are making it to the east coast
Who else is getting 12.5% raises each year for the next 6 years. The arrogance & audacity to turn down 55%  over the next 6 years is astounding, knowing the bigger picture impact.
Pulling a page out of the Gordon Gecko handbook ‚Äúgreed is good‚Äù
Wow! My initial reaction is that this guy is a piece of shit who needs to be removed from the equation altogether, and for clarity I am not talking about violence, I'm talking about rendering him completely powerless. Automate the shit out of this whole field. Longshoremen wanna fuck around, they can find out.
Regardless of the validity of their claims, nobody should have a power to bring the economy of the whole country to a halt like that just to get what they want. Nobody.  A strike should be able to hurt only one private business, without threatening the economical and national security.

I am also curious to learn what is that exactly they want. What is current salary+benefits of a dock worker? How much do they want to make it?
As soon as those longshoreman scab contracts reach 100k I‚Äôm down.

This dude is threatening us all saying he can stop our supply chain at any moment. Then says ‚ÄúWhos gana win in the long run?‚Äù.  

Keep this up and the long run will be lawsuits and jail time. Dude is literally bragging he can cut off food supply.

Automation. Automation will win in the long run.
Isn't Chyna closer to LA? Go that way
Wait until he realizes nobody knows what a mall is.
I wish I was a corrupt union heavy

Good argument for full automation.
The wage improvements are a bonus, the real battle here is against the automation. But I think the real problem that they want to address is that the government has no plan in place for when there will be mass unemployment due to automation. Neither do any of the presidential candidates. And companies are sure as hell not going to pay you for life if your job gets automated. Any physical labor, low skill job will be automated in the coming decades. What is the plan in place for when that happens? Should we just have less kids so they won't end up on unemployment? Should we have UBI? Should we regulate automation, or have half-n-half automation and subsidize people labor? Nobody is giving any plans for this inevitable outcome. And I say inevitable because AI is here to stay. It's clear that companies are more worried about under-spending than over-spending because they don't want to spend that money on hiring new employees, only on training models and data centers. They want to obsolete people as soon as possible.

Then you might say, "well if people can't work, how will they spend money to buy the products these companies produce?". Well remember we have the money printer, we're already in over our heads in debt, we can get into more debt if it keeps the economy going. It then just becomes theater, bread and circuses, the late stage of the empire.
This guy is a idiot, if everyone goes out of business, he has nothing to take off ships. So he just cripples himself.. I say fire these over paid idiots and hire new people. Plenty of people are looking for jobs
The US president: "I like trains"

Unless coordinated with the railroads and Canadian and Mexican ports the effect will not be so radical. Prices will go up though. The Evergreen sabotaging for a week the Suez canal was much more effective.
This guy is dumb as fuck. Yes let's cripple an important system, make everyone hate us, still lose our jobs to automation and harpoon any chance at keeping some jobs through extensive retraining programs. I'm sorry but the us economy is not something you fuck around with and this asshole using his workers as collateral to enrich himself is insane. They should be striking for higher wages and better training to seamlessly integrate automation and maintain jobs.
They offered a 50% pay increase over 6 years.  The union said NO. They want a 77% increase over 6 years, and no future automation.  The union is not going to win this fight.
Fuckin Ziggy, man.

That show knew what was up.
*For your information I wake up every morning with an angry blue-veined diamond cutter. I was gonna enlighten the president of local 47 on this particular point and he chose to depart. Blue steel, gentlemen, 3 & 1/2 inches of hard blue steel* 

- Frank Sobotka
This was also the first thing that came to my mind. 

Even funnier because some of the top comments are talking about coming automation and specifically mention the Rotterdam ports that were mentioned in the show two decades ago.
What about frank sobotka? I'm not hearing his name anywhere in here..
And they were spot on.
*"You know what the problem is? We used to make shit in this country, build shit. Now all we do is put our hand in the next guy's pocket."*
Artie Lange from Howard Stern was a longshoreman. He said he sat on a dock and waited to connect a hose to pump orange juice and made 100k year.
That's exactly what I was thinking!! I still think The Wire was the best show ever written for television!
I have a friend who worked on a touring show.  He was in charge of a 2 million dollar lighting controller. It was his baby and his sole responsibility, so he handled it personally,  like it was the emperor's child. 

They pulled into a theater in Manhattan and started setting up. Almost immediately,  his unloading path was blocked by a longshoreman. It was explained to him that,  since the theater's loading ramp backs to the East River,  his production must be unloaded by longshoremen.

He told him "That's fine.  We're a union show. No biggie. But that lighting rig is precious to me.  Only I can touch it. "

The Iongshoreman told him "If you put one hand on that rig, I will throw you and it into the river. "
That‚Äôs why I call them stevedores
_What kind of a fool gives a duck whisky anyhow?_
My first immediate thought was 'this man works ports for Baltimore'
This dude is ‚Äúbelieved‚Äù to have ties to the mob (per NY Post article) and fits the mold from The Wire perfectly.

You know Quasimodo predicted all this
woke up this morning, got my men to strike
It was mentioned on another thread that he makes like $900k and drives a Bentley. A friend of mine works at a dealership in the NW suburbs of IL and one of these dudes, who also drives a Bentley and has Masonry plates, gets his car serviced there. 

It pays to be a union boss.
And a $40K watch.
Gabagool!? Ova here!
Eyyyy fuhget abaht iiiiiit!!
Dude wants to make Trumpet look good. They are working together on this as a ‚ÄúOctober surprise‚Äù the striking workers make 147k average and this guy has a yacht and 900,000 a year. He also is wearing a 40k dollar watch. It‚Äôs not about helping workers it‚Äôs about crippling the economy and blaming the dems.
Week 4: The Blockbuster Videos close when they can't get the latest VHS.
lol the mall closed 3 years ago, this guy is on drugs
yeah he has 0 idea what he's talking about tbh. The grocery and goods supply chain operates on a 6 month surplus for most goods, if they wanted to leverage this they needed to act months ago, but they couldn't because Biden was on the ticket and still the president and would have squashed them instantly, they are only doing this now because Harris is vulnerable in their minds.....boy are they gonna wake up sad in 4 weeks. Either Trump turns on them and kneecaps the unions again, or Harris looks into complete automation, its a lose lose for them because their union leader is an idiot drunk on power.
Doesn‚Äôt the stuff from China go to the west coast
Wasn't there just a video on reddit of how some Chinese port works with remote control workers?
They already want to (and have the capability to) go fully automated. The unions are the reason it hasn‚Äôt happened already. Look up LBCT in Long Beach.
Strikes has always been about squeezing the companies just like how they squeeze their employees, but port strikes are extremely ironic since ports has always been extremely corrupted across America. Before they "went legit", ports were owned by mafias and gangs because they need to secure the transport routes. That's why the supply chain gets increasingly automated with every strike, go ask port employees how they got their jobs, guarantee you their family has been working there for generations
Yeah this is an idiotic thing for them to do. There is an agreement in place that automation would slowly roll out and they are striking for zero automation leaving g the ports to decide between zero automation and full automation. 

The guy is also a big trump fan and is trying his best to hurt the economy to help him get elected.

Edit: Reading about this guy is wild. So seems like him and Trump go back decades and he spent sometime this summer at Mar-a-lago with him. He has also said him and Biden go back decades and was rooting for Biden in 2020 saying he is the right choice to ‚Äúreturn honor, dignity, and prosperity to America‚Äù. 

The guy was charged in a RICO conspiracy with connections to the Genovese crime family. Many suspect that is how he became president and is now making $780k/yr. Owns a $1.4Million dollar house in NJ, a $2.4 million dollar house in Florida and just sold a 76ft yacht in which Elon Musk has stated Dagget ‚Äúhas more yachts than me‚Äù. 

Even though they renegotiated a 6 year 50% raise with little automation they now want a larger raise and no automation.
Yep. 100%. This guy is all bluster and bullshit. 

You know what happens in week two? The longshoreman can‚Äôt pay for shit. You know what happens in week four?

Robots start getting deployed at the ports and the longshoreman miss their first mortgage payment. 

During the Taft Hartley and Mr. Tough Guy is busy dragging his feet for 90 days the ports are putting together all the necessary steps for automation and the transition here helps with the handoff. 

The 90 days expires and the longshoreman are all fired and Mr. Tough Guy wishes he had cut a deal instead of making demands. 

This guy isn‚Äôt a negotiator and his bullshit isn‚Äôt going to fly in a room full of the guys that pay his salary and can just fuck off to an island and sit on a yacht while everyone below them goes broke.
100%. The automation is going to come eventually, it‚Äôs inevitable. The only thing striking can realistically do is delay it a little. I get why people want to fight it, but simply can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs way too cost effective to not happen, the only thing you can do is prepare for the future.
West coast ports gonna be booming too. They figured out their contract like adults. East coast boomer longshoremen are playing the short game for a multi millionaire gold chain wearing Bently owner.
Or hiring new people that need the jobs.
It's already been done, this strike just locks in the plan B accelerated timeline for automation...
Ding ding ding. These guys should probably shut the fuck up. The average longshoreman didn't graduate high school and makes $140k / year in a role that can pretty easily be automated.
All this strike did was speed up automation. Guarantee he won't be laughing at the end of all of this.

  
Also, who makes almost $1MM a year and then cries about money?  Cripple an entire country and make thousands of people lose their jobs, "then they will realize how important our job is".  Bold strategy, let's see how that plays out.
Chinese goods all come through the western ports anyways right?
I know a guy who works in shipping, and even though we're on the east coast, he ships everything out from the west coast. He wasn't even aware there was a strike. From our brief conversation, he said east coast volume is much smaller than west coast, and most of it can be absorbed or flown in. It will be more expensive for smaller importers for more time sensitive things like food, but anything like clothes or fabric (which is one of the things he deals with), the additional freight costs are pennies per crate, so worst you'll see is delays.

Edit: Also, there's no issue for cars on east coast to come from west side. When I lived on west coast, I got my bmw, and it shipped from Germany to California via Panama before being taken up to Seattle.
West coast is already pretty congested, I live 25 minutes from the port of Long Beach
That is what I was thinking. If I lose my job, I will just take his.
New car inventory levels were like 70 days last time I checked. It's not "two weeks to laying off car salesmen". What a tool.
Someone better not tell him about Michigan.
Malls did not close. What are you talking about?!

Some malls closed. Malls are still open, though.

Some people are selling cars, but not many.
yeah i was coming to say this.  what fucking malls
Where do you think he got his big button phone? QVC?
He's ahead of schedule.
4th week, the Ronco Showtime Rotisserie Ovens cease shipments to Prange Ways across the Midwest.

5th week, the pantsuit shipments from Bangladesh won't make it to the hottest discoteques across the country, ya dig?
What's a mall?
how else do expect the coke to go through?
There is a reason that the union president's son is a VP in the union making $350k. Nepotism abounds.
as seen in season 2 of The Wire
Sounds a lot like cab companies a decade or two ago
1/5th of *this* union workers make over 200k a year. This guy makes 900k a year. His type is the reason people believe in corrupt union bosses.

EDIT: That's referring to this specific union (International Longshoreman's Association), not all unions.
management and leads gets to double dip on company time instead doing office hours work before and/or after their regular dock work.  

the 3-5% union cut from every paycheck just gets bigger with everyone's salary increase.  corruption from top to bottom
My dad was given a job with the Longshoremen. Back then, he was a naive (but persistent and hardworking) immigrant. He somehow convinced the main guy to give him a chance to earn a job. Worked 1 week for free to prove his worth by learning how to weld. He got the job, became a welder, moved up the ladder to manage a group of welders, and after a few years stupidly left to pursue a "better job" because it offered more hours. He didn't realize how good he had it until he told me that story and I blankly looked at him like he was a massive idiot. 

My dad is an incredibly smart man, but boy has he made some boneheaded decisions in the past.
Port of Vancouver in Canada is the same thing. I think I heard someone say they bid jobs within the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù too. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to get hired from the outside
Agreed, 100%. 

These unions do not have open enrollment and you often need to know another member to get in or wait years to be accepted.

This is prolly the angle Trump wanted him to play leading into the election. 

The irony is if it works, I would expect Trump to do a 180 flip on this and eventually use it as an example of why unions are bad.
Finally someone who knows what's fucking going on with these places.  I work with the ports every day and have been onsite a few of them.  All you gotta do is see how "hard" they're working with their 250k/year demands.  The government is being bullied by the mob right now its pathetic.
So THAT‚ÄôS why this guy doesn‚Äôt sound like he‚Äôs representing an organization that provides labor, and instead sounds like a guy that found a bridge and put up a gate.
My brother in law is a longshoreman, they by far have the easiest jobs with the most incredible benefits of any blue collar workers by far, it‚Äôs completely insane how much they make for how much they work.
Bring in the robots and drones.  Fire them all.
Crazy to think The Wire covered all dock workers fighting automation two decades ago. Even The Sopranos had a small storyline about no show jobs in similar industries.
I'm not an expert on automation, but do you think that AI is advanced enough that they could build the corruption and grift into the machines?
It 100% is.

I live in one of the biggest port cities on the east coast and you have to know someone who knows someone who knows someone for even a chance to get hired there and they make such stupid money.

Worked with an 18 year old that left to go work for the port and within 2 years he bought a house.

I‚Äôm all for fair wages but these dudes at least where I live are far from waiting in bread lines.
Longshoremen is basically a massive Mafia and is massively nepotism driven
Oh that‚Äôs just what‚Äôs on the books, getting gifts from ships coming in is allllll gravy
Seeing this guy sitting there dressed like a Migos is killing me ü§£
Union bosses being paid that much is a clear sign they are more of a mob union
Those Cartier frames and 10k chain don't help. Greedy fuck.
yeah and thats on the books
I don't trust any man that wears that much jewelry

Yup, I hope they all get fucked. 77% increase? 

Nah. This dude is nothing but a Union Gangster who loves power. They have been around for 100 years. 

Time is up for them.
vast middle deliver enter grab one makeshift lush slap wakeful
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs acting in good faith for his union I think his rhetoric is to get exactly what you‚Äôre thinking. Dude is suss.
Would make for a great MBA study case.


I really hope they overplay their hand.
If you were a longshoreman, you‚Äôd have to be a cuck to see ai and robots coming from a mile away and just let it happen.¬†

Part of the contract is probably going to be golden parachutes for when the robots arrive. Or some shares of ownership of the port revenue.¬†
Exactly. This guy thinks he has the country by the balls. Here's how that can get fixed.
1. Lay them all off.
2. Hire new workers entirely with high salaries, doesn't matter.
3. Start automating it gradually laying off the new hires.

Done. No contracts about banning automation. World still turns.

This is greed. You can't have everything. Be grateful with what you have and understand times change.
The machine does not sleep, does not eat, does not have a family, and doesn't question orders. We've treated people like tools, means to an end, but a machine is a better tool.
Imagine thinking being a Luddite was a good thing. I‚Äôm honestly sorry for people who lose their jobs but the reason we have food diversity, affordable food, affordable housing, fuel, etc is because of automation

And before people claim things aren‚Äôt affordable imagine how bad they‚Äôd be if you didn‚Äôt have automation
Cool, so are we all just gonna wait till their jobs are automated before we go back to importing and buying shit, or are we gonna have to seriously appease them in the meantime?


Honestly, good on them for making their leverage count while they still have some...
Been reading different versions of this comment for 5 years at this point lol
Always was
This way they don‚Äôt blame it on the bankers again ü´£
Just remember who we need to blame.
Jpowell: "son of a bitccch!" *shoves papers off desk*

That's the basic concept of a strike. You can call it whatever you want but the basic concept is "we, the people who work for you, will shitfuck your business unless you give us what we want". The more fucked the business, the more likely they are to get what they want. And/or get shot by pinkertons.

There‚Äôs dudes in my area who literally check a box and sleep for a living making 6 figures after overtime. They work 18 hour days and just hangout for 16 of them. 

Yeah, I mean I‚Äôm all for the working man making better money, but the idea that these dudes are barely making ends meet and working their fingers to the bone is a joke.
I wouldn‚Äôt even use a derogatory word like scabs when you have this guy talking about crippling America.  You‚Äôd be doing a service to the nation based on this guy.
It‚Äôs gonna end up being a repeat of the air traffic controllers from the Regan administration. ‚ÄúShit, I guess you‚Äôre all fired. Who wants a job?‚Äù. In this market, they could replace every job in 6 months.
You're not wrong. Was looking at new cars this weekend and I could've gotten a blowie from the salesman with how desperate he was. Too bad for me, they didn't have the model I wanted AND my wife was with me (she got major cock block energy)
BMW export through Charleston port.  It is not just import but export, too.
What kind do you need?  I can see if it‚Äôs available in my area.
The strike is just on the East coast. The supply lines will show up from the west and should be ok within a week.
Those supply routes coming across the border are already majorly congested. Would be hard to move the volume that comes in on ships via trucks. 

Rail is the only feasible alternative for that kind of volume, and they don‚Äôt have excess capacity just laying idle to pick up the slack
You musnt have heard of the cartel if you wanna run millions of dollars worth of goods through Mexico
Currently the plan will be to route to west coast and Canada, but those options are already congested. 

Your idea about Mexico would probably take a decade worth of infrastructure and development to get going. That‚Äôs not something you just flip a switch on and have running overnight.
That was my question. 

Don't Chinese goods come in almost exclusively through West Coast ports?
That‚Äôs why Congress gave power to the president to shut down certain striking sectors. Like trains. And air traffic. And in this case, an 80-day-go-back-to-work-while-you-negotiate is entirely within bidens power. 

The question is, do you do that right before an election when your party‚Äôs nominee is campaigning on the working man?
If one private business is big enough to affect the whole economy, maybe it's too big.
They‚Äôll probably follow you home from work
Everyone knows that, but companies will automate anyway regardless of how unions play their cards. So this guy is playing GTO strategy by maximizing what he can still squeeze out before the inevitable.
That‚Äôs because automation produces real GDP without the labor while driving prices down, leaving more resources to generate new jobs. 

Drafting pre emptive automation UBI laws could disincentivize new jobs from being created. 

Besides, you don‚Äôt know the actual numbers on automation to determine UBI until it‚Äôs in place. Maybe it only affects a few already unprofitable industries that have already moved overseas, such as customer service. If we sell customer service AI, we aren‚Äôt taking American jobs away since they were never here to begin with.
Automation getting rid of all the jobs has been the fear since the checks notes start of the industrial revolution, for a wide variety of reasons it's not happening soon.

If Biden doesn‚Äôt step in and this goes into Election Day Harris very well could also be fucked.  Just depends on how fast shelves in the US start to empty out and prices start going up.  

Conversely, the ILA has been offered 50% raises, but the union won‚Äôt accept without the automation clause.  I would be very surprised if they offer it because it‚Äôs playing Russian roulette with your business.  China already has some automated docks, maybe not fully automated, but automated nonetheless.  If they agree to it and some enterprising company decides tomorrow that they want to build a dock and have it fully automated the only thing stopping them is money and permits.  Hell, if they were smart they would buy a decommissioned dock where most of the infrastructure is already in place.  Spiff up the infrastructure so it‚Äôs top of the line, build out the automated equipment, dredge the channel so it can accept the huge cargo ships and they will hugely undercut the current docks.  I am willing to bet the permitting process wouldn‚Äôt even be that difficult if it‚Äôs in a southern state.  

Point being, damn near every industry has some form of automation, if the dock workers were smart they would have tried to figure out how to incorporate limited automation while losing the least amount of jobs.  Otherwise some person or company will come along and upend the industry and the dock workers will be completely fucked when it happens.  The current pay packages for dock workers would be over 200k with the 50% that was offered on Monday.  With that kind of pay package you can guarantee someone will figure out how to automate and make a killing.  It‚Äôs better to ease into something on your terms than to get blindsided and completely sidelined.
What they want is no future automation and I don't believe that would be enforceable even if it was put in the contract.  They may get what they want this iteration, but given the level of automation that's already available by the end of their next contract I would be very surprised if the ports aren't ready to immediately cut over a new operations center the day the period of performance elapses.
This guy is close to Donald Trump so this all may not be coincidental.

No automation necessary.  Scabs will replace them and be trained in less than a month.
He knows it‚Äôs bullshit. It‚Äôs his job to play up the leverage he has in order to get the most favorable possible deal for the workers.
I ship produce to grocery stores and they absolutely do not have a 6 month surplus. If anything it's a few days. 

There's been a big change in the last two years for retailers. They receive more inbounds, but in smaller amounts and more frequently to reduce shrink. 

The importers and shippers probably have 2-3 weeks of inventory, depending on the commodity.  So until we know what's going on we're back on POs ti stretch what we have. Prices will go up fairly soon.
Oh look at Mr. Geography over here!
Mate i work in ports it aint just in china theres automation everywhere and the shit thats coming is unbelievable‚Ä¶ remote controlled quay cranes, stacking cranes automated container handling equipment the works.
It‚Äôs not just China. Most major ports in Europe including famously Rotterdam are highly automated.
I saw that too\~

Remote controlled is extremely different to automated. The union is in favour of remote control. It‚Äôs far safer and better conditions for the worker. They don‚Äôt want robots doing crane work.
Much of the world is, there are only 3 ports in us that are sniffing top 50 in the world, and its because of these unions. 

Ultimately we're paying ridiculous prices and inefficiencies for their benefit. Dont know why anyone should care just cuz theyre the mafia, most other jobs dont get to keep their employers from innovating.

Unfortunately, the main witness against him wasn't able to testify due to turning up dead.
America is ready for fully automate port. This game of chicken going to entertaining
Not all. Most.
Over 50% of containerized US imports are coming in through EC ports. WC ports wouldn't even have the capacity to cover it. Source: I work for a top five ocean carrier.
Yes
You are just wrong about that, your guy just works in the wrong part of the industry to know what this will do as there isn't a significant textile industry in any region that would primarily transport to the east coast. 

The west coast has a lot less port capacity than the east coast: in 2020 roughly 280 million short tonnes moved between all the large ports of over 10 million each that are located in the contigous USA on the west coast, so roughly comparable to the port of Houston(~276 million short tonnes in 2020) 

Besides the Panama canal is still restricted in numbers of ships due to lack of rainfall, and even if it weren't, they would not have the additional capacity for that kind of massive surge. And even if they weren't, the transport infrastructure between the west coast and East Coast is simply not equipped to handle the amount of cargo needed to take it all up. 

More likely that Veracruz and Altamira will see increased traffic in Mexico and the ports in Quebec and Ontario, probably even up to nova scotia and new brunswick will do the same in canada, though they will fall far short of making up what was lost.
Yep I work in importing. West Coast is getting slammed and regardless prices are going up because they the only game in town.
Yup im in DTLB. Last the ports went on strike, you could see boats in the ocean as far as you could see.  Just waiting for these unions to follow suit too watch
Ay now. Ain't nobody skilled enough to unload stuff off a boat but him and his boys. Nobody.
ah yes, the car salesman.. the quintessential bedrock of the american economy.
Also with the construction materials, wood is either from within or can be moved by rail from Canada, you don't have dock workers for that.

And that contract has parts that are against automation in the ports...
To be fair to him he wants to skew all his numbers/arguments to be as scary as possible.

Or rather, he is an example of corruption in Unions. There is nothing inherently incorruptible about unions. Anyone who doesn't believe in corrupt union bosses is simply head in sand levels of ignorant.
Bet you can find people to do the job for less. No way people are snubbing 6 figures even with the threat of broken knees. These old fucks are replaceable as hell and they know it, which is why they bark so loud. Seems like we need to replace this entire sector if they are going to handicap the entire country each time they feel the whimsy. Anyone fighting against automated ports is secretly pro-drug trafficking.
Wait. He wanted to work more?
There was a post on either the BC or Vancouver sub and the OP was asking about a "friend" paying like $20k for papers to join the union and work at the Port. Everyone was saying it's illegal but that's how it works.
I have a friend, his uncle is the head of a large union. My friend goes to school, gets a degree in finance, good internship, Wall Street job, CFP, etc. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, he worked his ass off. 

Then he quits and opens his one man wealth management firm. What‚Äôs his first customer? The union and he is managing the unions investments and keeping 0.7%. I‚Äôm sure this one man wealth management firm was the most qualified.
This is.... precisely an example of why unions can be very bad.
100%.

5 year waiting lists meanwhile some teenager gets hired on early. Nepotism and corruption.
Here in Hawaii, they're notorious for having everyone by the balls and is part of the reason goods are so expensive here.  I'm ok with unions, especially where the business sucks everything an employee can give, but when a union gets ridiculously strong that they get paid extremely well, have incredible benefits and still wants more, then I think they're too strong. Especially here where they are standing in front of inevitable change - automation that greatly increases efficiency and lowers costs. 

The conversation shouldn't be about stopping automation. It should be about getting the workforce retooled.  I know that is part of the conversation, but the fact that they refuse to deal unless automation is off the table shows how bad they are.
Guy hasn‚Äôt paid for a TV in his life
What's funny is he is suspected of being associated with the Genovese crime family and has been put on RICO charges. The witness though conveniently ended being found dead in New Jersey.
And he's mafia and buds with Trump. So.....this guy is playing an act and there is 100% motive behind it. I think its a last minute effort to make this administration look like they dont care about wages.
My understanding is that they have like a $140,000 salary on average.
Not only that they want NO automation while the world and west coast has it. You cant have the cake and eat it too. How are the workers expect the company to give them higher wages but at the same time give them a handicap. Make it make sense
78. Salary $900,000
61.5% pay increase over 6 years lmao
Pretty sure most workers wants as much pay as possibe?
That's the thing.  I think he wants to hurt the economy.  He wants people to suffer.  I think he has an agenda other than "his guys"  Will be very hard to satisfy this guy.  Things look bleak.
He's a Trump buddy and mafia. Yeah its suss.
You can't just fire everyone and hire all new people and expect them to be able to open ports.  No experience on equipment and procedures that require years of experience...
The machine does however from time to time need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.

Neither unions nor business owners are automatically good or bad people (despite many trying to frame it like one side is good and other is evil). They are all people responding to incentives and trying to work out the best state of affairs for their own interests.
It's all the bribes that they get paid for smuggling added into that
Exactly.  Prices only go down when there's a legitimate less expensive option.  Missing that, greed wins.

You're kind.
I appreciate you and every else offering. Momma and I are going to try to transition baby to another similar, gentle formula.
It would be more expensive (and put too much load on the system) to offload everything west coast or canada and send it via rail or truck to all destinations east coast. It is much less expensive to go through the suez canal, hitting the big east coast ports and making your drayage from container yard to your warehouse as short as possible. Alternatively, you can warehouse in Tennessee so you can easily use either west coast or east coast which provides some measure of insulation against any kind of work stoppage.
Yes, you do. But you got to spend pretty penny advertising the reasons for doing so along the lines of my comment, and asking how fair to all other workers is that this particular union decided to grab so unreasonably much, endangering the very future of the trade.
I hope so. FAFO.¬†
so?  This is America.  Everyone's armed.  They try a stunt like that there will be a few extra job openings the next day.  and that's before the police do their jobs.

These guys won't do jack diddly.  they're fat and happy.  they got too much to lose to be playing stupid games and they know it.
Also I do hear this point a lot, that technology innovation leads to more jobs being created. But also by the nature of AI, it will only be a matter of time before those jobs are filled by AI. We're coming to an existential moment where we are trying to obsolete people, and we have the money and technology to do it very soon, not hundred years from now.

They(the union) need to require that any automation is American made, American run.  And require company paid/supported retraining or college for the younger guys with the ability.   

But hard lining no advancement is a non starter.  It is DOA.
Former union member for At&t here. Our contract had a stipulation that At&t had to use in house employees (no contractors) to pull any new cables in our area. Those greedy fucks found some asshole company that invented equipment that could push cable through conduits, since they weren't allowed to pull. Long story short, you're right.
They need to implement some upskilling program to get all of the workers trained to use the automated tech, then it would be fine.
Containerization killed 90 percent of dock jobs .
Yup this is the main reason I‚Äôm not supporting the dock workers on this, the current crisis is completely of the unions making
They won‚Äôt even automate gates. They want some Union guy manually operating the gates.
The port of Rotterdam has had automated docks for like 10 years or so, is this not common in the US?
US ports are some of the most inefficient ports in the entire world because the worker's union insistence on preserving their manual jobs by stopping automation.

The problem with covid were different by product : mass panic buying (so even though you have stock you need 1/2 years of stock in 6 month), or massive decrease in purchasing (that's the one that hurt the clothing industry, they're based on rolling roll out by they couldn't empty their shelves to fund the next season of clothes), and the computer chips massive decrease followed bye a massive counter increase which affected anything with electronics.

A dock strike by comparison will be "only" a slower or reduced delivery of goods time. A recent exemples of what that does is Europe when that ship got stuck in the suez canal : annoying, sometimes prices got upset, some things are not as available, but no major effect because ships either waited or went around Africa.
I used to work in a plastics factory that was almost fully automated 

It‚Äôs wild what you can do with talented engineers and precision robots

I work there. It was equipment shortages. These companies are incredibly cheap. Machines are coming up on 30 years old. The only climate control we have are a 5in fan. Look up what a casual longshoreman is. We literally have thousands of workers waiting to work. The companies also control training, and they train maybe 5 a year for those huge cranes.
Unions.
Installing that degree of automation isn‚Äôt like installing a TV. You‚Äôre talking about months or years long projects because you can‚Äôt simply change over the entire port at once, or that port can‚Äôt accept shipments. So these upgrades happen bit by bit over a period of time, and during that period you still need people handling ongoing shipments and also need people to install the new automated equipment
Is this the guy who had a witness against him dissappear and be found in the trunk of a car in a case against him?

I mean, the West Coast is doing pretty well in that regard. Like, Long Beach isn't quite Rotterdam or Shanghai yet, but they're catching up. This whole "no automation"-thing is for some reason mostly an East Coast problem.

"Under the latest West Coast contract, agreed upon last year, longshoremen earn $54.85 per hour and, on average earned $218,000 last year, including overtime and higher wages for evening and night shifts, according to management.

East Coast longshoremen now earn $39 per hour. Management does not disclose a figure for average earnings for longshoremen, but a report from an agency that helped oversee the Port of New York and New Jersey showed that 57 percent of the longshoremen at the port made $100,000 to $200,000 in the 12 months through June 2020, the latest figures available."

Didn't Reagan threaten to do the same with the air traffic controllers when they went on strike in the 80s?

I don't think becoming an ATC is much easier, unless you just tell the pilots "Everybody just figure this shit our for yourself - it's like the streets of Mumbai now!".

Agreed we have a really bad habit of needing to over simplify everything. That said this guy is still a mobster trying to hold the economy hostage so that he can protect an extremely outdated system. Him acting like this is no accident either, it's a pretty open secret that the Longshoreman are basically a front for the mob and you need to be connected to get a job with them. We need a happy medium even if it's guaranteeing the job of current longshoreman but accepting that automation is inevitable and necessary.
Yeah he's very much emphasizing the damage he thinks his union can do. (I'm not sure he's correct - the WEST coast is not on strike after all...) That's clearly his negotiating style. But he said at the beginning "these guys have forgotten what a strike is" so he evidently thinks that implicit threat of economic damage needs to be emphasized.

I'm conflicted on this because I've wanted to see some of these other strikes in the last couple of years play more hardball, but the timing of this strike amidst a weak economic recovery and right in time to be this election's October surprise does kind of make me pissed off at this guy. I can't deny though that this seems like very aggressive negotiation and I tend to believe that's the best kind of negotiation.
They wouldn't have to worry about liability, at least. If they drop a container and kill someone, they can just leave the country for a bit.

This is the smart solution. Probably for a lot of industries. Can't fight automation completely but you can benefit from it as a worker in this way.
If it was literally cheaper for an entire new process to be invented to do the job than pay you to do it then you were being paid too much. Greed lost your union jobs. Your union was inefficient and should not be rewarded with the job. Capitalism.
Just upskill bro
Yeah sure idk if you noticed but every industry that automated anything cuts their workforce to 25 percent of what it was, if there were 100k longshoreman there would be 75k unemployed and 25k who still work and fix the machines‚Ä¶
This is most rational and logical view on the subject. The future is here we like it or not. People have to adopt and evolve with their skills. I worked with a union carpenter who refused to use a nail gun and kept hammering nails all day long. His view was that the nail-gun putting people out of work. I mean just dumb.
There are some 100% automated ports on the west coast.
but this jackass doesn't have a job without those dues and he is looking like an absolute Trump level asshole with his fucking tough guy boasting ..he is a bad face for the union movement
He killed 16 Czechoslovakians!

Born under a bad sign with a dollar in your eyes, so sing it now
Yes, but the witness never showed up to court, its ok they found him rotting in the back of a trunk. Nbd these hard workers need their money for no reason whatsoever, they cant be automated like everyone else. /s
I toured a LEGO factory more than 10 years ago and it was also hugely automated, with robots moving bins of pieces around after they were molded and ejected by the forming machines. Their parts warehouse was completely automated with robots picking bins of parts off shelves to bring to be put into boxes.

If we as a society can automate the production and logistics of a 10 cent piece of plastic, there's so much more automation that can be done with the movement and logistics of giant shipping containers.
US labor will try to strip the effort by those engineers. I've seen it happen endlessly. Management and business thinks that thsoe robots should cost $3.50 and never need maintenance. They'll do an MVP and call it a full product.
Its like the railway. The US had the best in the world in the 1800s ‚Ä¶ all those wild west movies had that in common. 200 years later its worse.. the ports are even shitter.
Lots of embellishment and fear mongering in there

Direct quote: "China already controls or has major investments in more than 20 European ports". Which sounds much more exciting than it really is.

China has major investments that operate in 21 European ports, more specifically they own shares of shipping companies that use them as hubs and as such they "control" part of the volume passing through. They don't control European ports. And besides, there's not a single country that exports goods world wide that doesn't have some form of control in those ports through companies and the US has bigger stakes in all of those.  China doesn't "control" anything in Europe if big daddy US shows up and the choice is get sanctioned by China or by the US.

The software being used I can understand being a security issue, you don't want to give them that much information, but the rest is just some writer trying to make an exciting story about scary big China.
But the power of the union is that they can strike and not work. If they fire the entire union, they have no leverage.

I‚Äôm guessing the actual reason is that the automation can‚Äôt replace everyone, only a portion.
He thinks he's untouchable and can bully the entire country into folding.
I don't see the Boeing CEO hiding.
The mob/mafia is mostly a east coast thing.
>This whole "no automation"-thing is for some reason mostly an East Coast problem.

the solution is to build an easter coast and then old east coast becomes mid coast and we can install proper automation in easter coast

I get that. He wanted to be the doer, not the watcher. He wasn't being challenged in any way. 

A lot of people who move up to middle management feel the same way. You're making more money, but you now hate work in a way that you didn't before.
That‚Äôs insane

I work a union job, that checks out. Union leadership can be petty as fuck over stupid shit, mine got into it with the company because they stopped buying bottled water... there are a shitload of water filling stations just bring a fucking water bottle they're like $10
Nah, automating a warehouse is way more than $1 million. I work with automated warehouse ASRS systems that are not very large and they are far more than $1million. Just installation services alone puts you in that ballpark
Not on the table, because blocking all automation and semi-automation is a condition of contract negotiations.
FYI- Our employers calculate the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù wage of Longshore workers by calculating the average of only the fully registered ‚ÄúA‚Äù workers who have, in most cases, been working in the industry for decades and have the greatest access to jobs. Their calculation excludes the 49% of the Longshore workforce that has not yet reached ‚ÄúA‚Äù status. Since the employers‚Äô incomplete picture leaves nearly half of the Longshore workforce out of their calculation, the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù wage the employers cite is inaccurate and inflated.
They are.

He's also lying and a lot of what we get comes from Canada and Mexico. Lumber is hugely from Canada with something like 95% of all imported lumber. Domestic steel production is fairly high or comes in from the West Coast (China/India). 

He's just trying to fearmonger but even what he's saying isn't true. perishable produce is the biggest risk, then automobiles and parts coming from EU. Otherwise there isn't much that is going to impact people.
West coast is open, but the company I work for calculated approx 50% of our current assortment can't be replenished due to the strike. Also already purchased products for customers are already on the incoming containers, like millions of dollars worth. Then West coast is going to be fleecing us the prices due to demand.

So even shit that gets in via the west coast is going to be more expensive. RIP the consumer and RIP the businesses that consumers can't afford to buy from. Looks like the 78% of the country living paycheck to paycheck about to get gaped without lube.
It is a strategy that might work, but will make the average uninvolved person hate them and their cause. People like them have the power to sabotage the entire economy just to get themselves more pay, and they are using it. Does the average person working in marketing, tech, admin, finance have the same power? Nah, because it only harms a corporation. So whilst it might indeed help them get their way due to the threat of economic damage, everyone else will just think "yeah...fuck you and your cause".  

I am not conflicted at all. I am not anti-union in a general sense but the moment someone begins threatening society as a whole, or threatens to damage the functioning of the economy and general services/healthcare/utilities just to get their pay increased is the moment they will lose most people completely.

Just because automation exists, doesn't mean that maintenance of that automation is also automated.  There has to be a way that if an unsafe task is automated, it doesn't cost someone their job and instead that person is now in charge of making sure the automation works.
so if I'm understanding right, this dude is basically bluffing with a weak ass hand praying everyone thinks he's full house on the river?
Unions aren‚Äôt inefficient‚Ä¶..for the union leaders
Whats to prevent someone from scabbing these guys too? They were making like 145,000 per year average from numbers I saw. Pay some scabs that money and they will do it no problem.  (Admittedly I don't know how technical their jobs are but if I'm being blunt moving docking containers while probably hard work, doesn't sound like the most complicated job in the world)

I think he's more wrong than lying. Those things you mentioned, plus the fact that the chinese manufactured goods that fill our "shopping malls" (really amazon - who goes to the mall anymore?) come in mostly from the west, all weaken his strike position. He might not be playing such hardball if he knew that. I don't think he does. I think he really believes this will bring the country to its knees. And, maybe it will. But probably not due to a lumber, steel and cheap plastic crap shortage.

I'll leave you hear, you one-shoe cocksucka!  You know how fast I can run.  I'll leave you in my fuckin' dust.
Agreed.

But it's not just metaphorical "worth", it's also people's actual livelihood - how they pay bills, how they buy food and how they make rent so they have a home.

I'm absolutely not opposed to automation and robots doing all the work - including my "work" - I just want to have a comfortable standard of living, with plenty of food and a safe, relaxing home for me and my family to live in... and enough disposable income (?) to be able to pursue hobbies and interests.
Automation is real. Tax the wealthy, lol. Sounds crazy. But in the US, we doubled our billionaires to just shy of 800 people. That doubling happened in the last 2 years alone. TWO YEARS. 

Anyone with a billion in assets and dollars does not need that much money. If hundreds of millions of people are going to lose their jobs to automation, at least tax the wealthy to give people education and healthcare. 

They ain‚Äôt going travel to Disney every year or vacation in the Bahamas but at least they can live respectably.
What needs to happen is everyone loses their job. 100% unemployment. Nobody works. At all. Nobody gets paid. People run out of money, goods don‚Äôt get bought, taxes don‚Äôt get paid, everyone starves. Businesses go under, the rich get murdered, people turn to cannibalism. Eventually someone figures out how to sell nukes. Madmen take the reins. All out nuclear war. Nothing survives. The world is a radioactive desert for thousands of years. The end of humanity and most complex organisms on earth. 

That‚Äôll show these liberals who they‚Äôre dealing with!
Step 4. Wake up with the fishes
This isn't something that's up to the individual employees.. And usually there's clauses when it comes to Union workers, and going to do work elsewhere. More than likely they would lose all their benefits they've been accruing for however many years, on top of other things.

Nah guys, break out the wooden shoes, we're gonna stop progress, watch this 

(Do I need the sarcasm tag?)
And the fact that if he can get the contract they want signed, he gets a pretty payday too on top of all that. Wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised if for those union workers their dues cost jumps significantly in the process if that goal contract gets signed.
I could be walking into a fuckin' buzz saw!
The metaphorical worth being tied up with working prevents solutions to the livelihood part. If you start talking about UBI people get upset about "welfare queens" or "lazy good-for-nothings" etc.
Exactly, normal people are ready for automation, they just know they will be the ones to be boxed out and on the streets.  It isnt the American way to take the wealth that will be generated by Automation and distribute it evenly.  It will line the pockets of the ownership and stockholders only.

If I didn‚Äôt need money, I would still want to help my neighbors and work for their appreciation‚Ä¶ paychecks are great but doing something someone else appreciates is so much more rewarding on a human level‚Ä¶
THEY ARE SPENDING THE MONEY ON DRUGS!!!!
"People" don't get upset about it - no one truly is opposed to working less for the same pay. It's just the capitalist propaganda to make the proles turn on each other. They say unemployment is a personal problem of a lazy, morally bad individual. A good worker comes to work every day to generate profits for the owner class, until he too gets discarded and his job replaced with automation. There's no sensible end game, in the end theres no one left to buy the products churned out by their automated factories.
It‚Äôs also fun to explain how welfare queen was a completely made up thing as well. I think Nixon made it up for racist reasons if I remember correctly?
Great, you can still do that. Just now you aren't required to go do a shit job for poor pay to survive, you do it because you want to.  There's gonna still be tons of people doing work because it's what they enjoy doing, if you don't want to work fine, we don't need it, the robots are taking care of everything that *needs* to be done
> ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù don‚Äôt get upset about it

Naive much? Have you talked to many baby boomers? Or any of them? There are PLENTY of people that swear by the merits of working yourself to death, they don‚Äôt *want* to work less.

Is it insider trading if I bought Boeing puts while I am inside the wrecked airplane?
Purely hypothetical of cause:  
Imagine sitting in an airplane when suddenly the fucking door blows out.   
Now, while everyone is screaming and grasping for air, you instead turn on your noise-cancelling head-phones to ignore that crying baby next to you, calmly open your robin-hood app (or whatever broker you prefer, idc), and load up on Boeing puts.   
There is no way the market couldve already priced that in, it is literally just happening.  
Would that be considered insider trading? I mean you are literally inside that wreck of an airplane...  
On the other hand, one could argue that you are also outside the airplane, given that the door just blew off...

It's like minority report, the crash was priced in.before it even happened. Sorry, bro, but you'll die for my puts.
Just imagine being on a plane going down and the mother fucker beside you opens Robin hood and Yolos his life savings on Boeing puts. Do you tell him you're in an Airbus or not?
Imagine what happens when you then die and your wife who has no idea how puts work, finds out that they automatically exercised for being in the money and before she covers the short position (at a profit) due to lack of knowledge she waits and the stock price rebounds and now you left your family broke.
purely hypothetical, but what if OP was the one who unscrewed that nut so that he could buy puts ?

That's technically called Double Insider Trading‚Ñ¢¬Æ¬© (inside trading inside a failing aircraft). Standard practice.
You re the shrodinger cat of trading
The crying baby besides you already loaded up on so much puts that the IV skyrocketed making the options too expansive. Gotta be faster than those Gen Alpha Traders next time.
No you‚Äôre okay, the SEC clearly lays out legal vs illegal insider trading. 

Illegal insider trading is ‚ÄúThe buying or selling a security, in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, on the basis of material, non-public information about the security.‚Äù

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was the first step in requiring the disclosure of company stock transactions. Directors, executives, or anyone else who has information or who holds more than 10% of any class of a company's securities are considered insiders by the SEC.

In this case you‚Äôre not an insider, and the incident happened in public airspace, which my definition is public knowledge. If there was an incident on a private airfield with only boeing engineers present that wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be reported to the public, but later would be, and you got a tip from one of the engineers, that‚Äôs insider trading.

Have you ever looked at the Price for internet on the airplane and they don‚Äòt sell these Gigabytes on margin.
No
Personally, I think you should get a pass. But since good things can't be permitted to happen to retail investors, you're probably looking at jail time. Gotta make an example out of you to prevent moral hazard. Otherwise, the other poors in the back of the planes will start unbolting doors in flight. We could cut off their wifi but that's eight bucks of revenue.
Sure, but you better bet big so you can cover the wifi fee

Apperently, the question has now been answered by a Lawyer on Stackexchange:

[https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/98706/is-it-insider-trading-if-i-bought-boeing-puts-while-i-am-inside-the-wrecked-airp/98707#98707](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/98706/is-it-insider-trading-if-i-bought-boeing-puts-while-i-am-inside-the-wrecked-airp/98707#98707)

So I suppose the answer is no. It is not insider trading.

Thanks to u/d1thyramb for the info.

I also want to mention, that noone died or got seriously injured during the incident. So props to the crew for getting everyone home safe.
Insider trading is when you have access to privileged, internal company info that outsiders do not. As it is an event in the public space and you do not have privileged access I would say you‚Äôre an asshole for trading during a disaster but not guilty of insider trading.  Doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt charge you for it once the public hates you.
I think you‚Äôre ok to trade on your phone during the flight, Captain üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è
You have some screw loose.
Except if it happens over the weekend (which it did).
Lets say i buy calls on PEP while I see Lays Chips increasing their price 20% on my supermarket.

Does it count as insider trading?
You are definitely inside the airplane but the door is open for interpretation.
Definitely insider trading...you're *inside* the plane. Wait till you land (but that might not happen).
This is why I come to this sub
The puts are coming from inside the plane!!

Side note: Robinhood, really?
Remember to pull out
If you were inside the plane then yes it would be insider trading.
No, you're in the right place at the right time.
lol.  I don‚Äôt believe ‚Äúinside the accident ‚Äú counts as insider information.   But very interesting take.
No. Insiders must have access to confidential information the public at large isn‚Äôt privy to.

Knowing about something *first* isn‚Äôt insider trading. Knowing about something that other people are not to be informed of, is.
Immagine the workers at the airport load the plane and then loosen the screws to buy boeing puts.
Legally no

Technically yes because you are inside a plane
If the market was open and you had internet up there, I think I would lose all my fear and just all in into puts. Free 10 bagger.
I would think that if you were an employee of or a direct or extended family member or friend of Boeing... and in a black out period for trading during this event...then maybe.   

More so if you had inside knowledge of this design defect from an employee or family member of Boeing.

However if you are Tom, Dick, Mary, or Joe Blow ... grabbing your ass or ass or member of another... giving or receiving head or other decided to become a member of the mile high or less club....and preparing to kiss it goodbye during the event.. no.
I'll allow it üò§
How tf is it insider trading when a full plane was also aware
Not if you get sucked out the door.
I posted this on an early Boeing news thread and it got one downvote, good thing I didn't pursue a career in comedy.

&#x200B;

I'm imagining there was a fellow WSB regard on that flight. While everyone is screaming around him and grabbing their oxygen masks, his disabled mind is elsewhere. "Now's my chance to leverage our home equity to make up for those SPY calls". He pulls out his phone connected to the $9.99/hr wifi and buys as many BA puts he can find. With a tear in his eye and a smile on his face, he pats his frantic wife's boyfriend on the leg and assures him that all is well in the world. He gives him a sturdy salute and thanks him for his service, he won't be needed any longer. The boyfriend lifts his large, smooth hands and gives the regard a warm embrace as he looks into his eyes, and the chaos around them slows as the sounds vanish for a moment. The regard calmly lifts his abrasive diamond encrusted hands to hold the boyfriend. Staring back, the regard understands. This isn't goodbye. This is see you when I let my options expire OTM
I‚Äôm not with the SEC, but worked for a large publicly traded corp in the Finance area (Financial Planning & Analysis).  The term insider trading refers to insiders within the company.  You have no ‚Äúinside‚Äù information about which direction the stock will head due to the door blowout.  It could go higher‚Ä¶not likely, but it could.
 Nope. That door off the jet straight into the public domain. Not insider trading.
From my experience with trading, catastrophic events like this make shares skyrocket.
Nice trick question OP, airplane mode is on therefore you can‚Äôt open robin-hood.
No, but you could also ping me a message that it‚Äôs just happened so that I can join in. Spread the love/drama.
If you feel the wind blowing, you‚Äôre on a Boeing
9/11 confirmed to be just a huge put play
1) yes, trading on MNPI and 2) Little did you know the plane was sabotaged for this very reason and sharks have already established their position 3) you‚Äôll go to jail and they‚Äôll reap the rewards. They know you better than you know yourself üòú
I am not a lawyer and I am not your lawyer. But no this would not be insider trading. 

Traditionally you need three things to all be true for it to be insider trading:

1) You need material information (a problem with a plane's design is material, especially if potentially widespread)

2) The information must be non-public (plane accidents are public information so it fails this test)

3) You have to have a duty of confidence not to disclose the information (for example be an executive at the company - your scenario also fails this test).
This is a beautiful post. A work of art.
It‚Äôs called ‚Äòinside trading‚Äô
I always said if I was at an airport and a plane went down I would be immediately logging in and buying puts for the airline.  So this a great idea in my opinion.
Could you imagine if your smart enough and your the dude who takes his phone out and right before you place the order you phone is sucked out and used for a comical meme about how iPhones are so strong üôÉ
1. Although my work is investment related, I rather take the view as Flyetalker - ATC traffic is public information, so as soon as AS1282 pilots radio the tower, you can start trading on the info.

2. What we really should be doing is buying the stock of the Korean iPhone case manufacturer whose case survived the 16,000 feet fall and was found by the NTSB (I checked, Spigen is KOSDAQ listed) https://soyacincau.com/2024/01/14/spigen-case-iphone-survive-alaska-airlines/
I love every single one of you on this thread. Thank you üòå
You do realize this happened on Saturday and you literally could not have done this my regards‚Ä¶..
Weren‚Äôt markets closed at the time?
No you have no duty to Boeing.
It depends on whether you caused the damage.
That's taking "insider" too literally. ü§£ You are safe because the door blowing off is public information. Insider trading involved decisions made based on private information not yet released to the public. Just because you're 16K feet in the air doesn't mean it's not public space.
The people with inside knowledge knew better than to set foot in that plane, so OP is good to go down with his puts.
Priced inside
We will call him Jesus Strike Price, he died for my puts.
The heat death of the universe is priced in.
Somewhere to the plot of casino Royale
All jokes aside, if someone really has invented a super limited time travel, they are probably keeping it secret and using it to game the stock market.
How many free flights do you think these passengers got?
The puts are coming from inside the cockpit
Enterprise risk management
Ah so it was insider trading. Somebody rigged the door so their puts would come to fruition. God it's wheels within wheels.
Lmao phenomenal analysis
Is his phone still in "airplane mode"
Always remember to check the seat back pocket for plane details before the puts.
Tell him so he can yeet himself out the blown window
This was so fucking funny to read in the parking garage before work bro. Thank you for taking the time
is it live savings if you die when plane crashes?
First you see him go to wsb and check with the gang
Airbus planes don't crash though so you have to be on a Boeing.
Imagine still using Robinhood after the shit they pulled in 2021.
If he pulls out his phone it may get sucked out the window. 700 mph winds will create a lot of turbulence. They even found a bunch of passenger phones in random people‚Äôs backyards.

Make the trade once outside the plane.
He should have read the pamphlet in the back of the seat.
Most of the time the safety documents in the seat pocket have the plane make/model on them.
Underrated comment
Lmao
He‚Äôs gonna discover that Boeing being a bad company was baked into the price
And then you find out it‚Äôs all a K hole
This might be the single funniest thing i've heard on the internet in decades... You win my friend.
Lmao I am so happy this is top comment. It would truly be peak WSB behavior
Luckily my wife's boyfriend knows what to do in that case
That‚Äôs why you buy 0DTE.
Plot twist: The wife bought the puts. The husband knows nothing.
Pretty sure all online brokers auto-close put-induced short positions on the first opportunity.
can I preemptive cash out my life insurance on a failing airplane to yolo into BA puts?
Wife here. I have no idea what you just said.
That‚Äôs more or less the plot of Casino Royale.
Someone did something similiar.

He bought a ton of Borussia Dortmund puts and then bombed the team bus.

Luckily everyone survived but the UEFA forced the players to play in the Champions League the next evening.
You're onto something.

Industrial sabotage and load up with puts.
Op works at the factory and didn't secure the bolts after fitting but marked it as done.

Waited several months while having done the dirty trading.

Nobody dies... a risk he was willing to accept... but that also means the stock isn't going to go down as much as he is predicting...

This isn't enough to cover his gambling debts now...

He must go bigger!
Kind of like the regards here who were trying to go to China when covid first broke out so they could get bat soup to bring to the US
I think that‚Äôs loosely the plot of Casino Royale
That‚Äôs how you made money in the stock market in GTA V
OP sitting in the terminal about to board his flight.

Checks Robinhood app one last time before boarding because lord knows if he‚Äôs in this sub he can‚Äôt afford the in-flight WiFi.

Sees Boeing puts drilling down.

OP: ‚ÄúShit!!! How can I save this???‚Äù

Remembers his TSA approved bladeless multitool in his pocket.
It‚Äôs like hedge funds buying puts before they release the company fraud report. For nothing knew richer get richer
Insider trading
Why get on the plane then?
But he's trading boeing inside a boeing, so insider trading. Report to SEC
**Kinda like shorting Wayfair before you release a news article / study showing their furniture gives off high amounts of carcinogenic formaldehyde, and their company has been covering it up by refunding customers once you email them test results of devices that test the furniture for VOCs and Formaldehyde.**

I haven't tried it but saw a guy's post on Reddit stating he tested his furniture for formaldehyde/ VOC offgassing using a testing device from Amazon, and they refunded him for the furniture since they're not supposed to be including those chemicals in the manufacturing process.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wayfair/comments/rbcddh/comment/il7ar9w/
Plus OP is not an insider and has no duty to the company or public. The plane could have been empty except for OP and the pilots/crew, the 'general public are in the plane' thing is a red herring.

It's the same reason Martha Stewart's ImClone trades were ultimately found legal even though she undoubtedly received MNPI. She was not an 'insider' and had no duty. She went to prison because she obstructed justice and made false statements to the SEC instead of just lawyering up immediately.
It's literally research.
[removed]
And it can't be insider cause his phone got blown out of the plane during the blow out so he couldn't have texted his broker to trade lol
[deleted]
Nope, not insider trading. You were in a public place and witnessed something that was visible to a portion of the general public. 

Now just make sure you are yelling yoloooooooooo when you push all in on puts as your plane hurtles down to the awaiting maintainside where you and the other survivors will begin your three month cannibalistic blood orgy awaiting the rescue that never comes

Congress had puts before the flight took off, just after the explosives were set

although I know this is not the point of this sub, but I found this funny
Now to write something that polls a real time flight data API for all Max flights and when any of them abort an ascent or rapidly descend unexpectedly it tells the Robinhood API to PUT PUT PUT.
New generational wealth strat is to quit your job, keep flying very low priced quick flights on Boeings. Hope that a non-catastrophic but still terrifying malfunction happens midflight and have inflight wifi to always be ready to buy 5% OTM puts. Make sure to fly as much as possible on Thursdays for max value.

How can that be priced in?
Bwahahahahahahaha, hahahahahahaha.... hahahahaha bwahahahahaha.... hahahaha.
I shout them out as I go.
Alaska flights are typically like $8/flight for the wifi. WORTH
Flew just over a week ago. It was free.
OP would be fine. It is completely legal to trade based on what you see in realtime in a public space. It doesn‚Äôt have to be on a news station 1st for it to be public knowledge. People did the same shit during 911. Pull their money out when they watched the first tower collapse in real time.
Like the wifi is going to work
Actually this is the secret reason why you have to switch to airplane mode.
How does that make a difference ? Genuinely curious
You‚Äôre in a public space and any person who saw the same prices could have reasonably made the same assumption and the same trade. So no.
That‚Äôs why you need to buy the puts the day before on Friday and also have a ticket on that flight to see the wreckage live to make sure it happened
they're always closed when this kind of shit happens
The dude with the original puts is the one who did a shitty job tightening the bolts.  Sorry, but some people are just going to have to eat it so he can realize those gains.
The puts are coming from inside the house!
The pilot had Robinhood pulled up before the crash
Priced inside the fuselage.
One up inside the plane and one down outside the plane.

Is that what you call it when your phone gets sucked out the side of a plane?
it was in outplane mode
Is it a Windows phone?
You win but you have to share the award with the cloud
You could argue the plane was no longer in airplane mode
It doesn‚Äôt matter if your phone is on airbus mode if you‚Äôre in a Boeing
That $10 wifi connection is a small price to pay.
Why do you think plane going down?
No. ‚ÄúCrash‚Äù mode
Guy next to you pushes you out cuz your phone is not in airplane mode
No, that's why the door blew off
Airplane mode is when Siri tells you to stop calling her Sherlie and translates to jive.
No, and that‚Äôs probably why the door flew off.
With 1% battery life
Naw the cabin door is open so you're free to put it out of airplane mode.
I mean if you ask Siri, ‚ÄúSurely this isn‚Äôt insider trading if I do puts on Boeing‚Äù and she replies, ‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not.  And don‚Äôt call me Shirley‚Äù then you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs still in Airplane mode
There go his puts üíÄ
The phone being off airplane mode is probably what made the door blow off in the first place!
No that‚Äôs why the door plug blew open in the first place
NO .... thats probably why the fucking door blew out !!
It's not. That's why the door blew off
He paid $20 for the 1Mbps internet
Well if the plane is already going down I doubt my IPhone is gonna do shit. üòÇ

The Airbus could have been damaged by a nearby crashing Boeing jet or falling part.
Wait till a piece of sheet metal falls off some clapped out DC 10 and it blows an A380 tire on takeoff.
Just make sure your not pulling straight back on your sidestick while in a stall.
Jinx it, why don't you
They do, but it‚Äôs because the computer decides the pilot doesn‚Äôt know how to fly a plane and does something that crashes it. As a passenger, you probably won‚Äôt know what is going on with enough time to do anything.

Note to self: get a phone case with a wrist strap before flying.
So while you may be going mach 0.81 or so, the max indicated airspeed of a B737 is around 340 knots, and most cruise between 280 and 300 KIAS. No excuse not to hammer those puts.
Not if they have one of those pop sockets on their phone!
I posed the same scenario to my wife and she said ‚ÄúYeezy taught me‚Äù

So just loaded up on Boeing puts, Adidas calls, and an exit seat on the next Boeing 737 out of JFK
Sorry but I also lack the knowledge of how puts work‚Ä¶
She was hoping he died on the plane after he texted her the door blew off and then ride off in the sunset with her puts and bf.
I was thinking Scooby Doo, but yeah, this too
I feel that‚Äôs what happened to that Malaysia Air plane, you know the one that dropped from the skies twice?

This sounds illegal.. but more legal than the gov. Insider trading. I say go for it.
More of a light inception trading.
But the plane has (had) windows on it so he was inside the trading window
You could DM the SEC on twitter- I believe they‚Äôre paying quite a lot of attention to that this morning.
Straight to jail
An airplane with a big hole in it is like a bowl, which is like a disk. Not a sphere. There is an orientation, but not an inside or outside in three dimensions. Only in two dimensions, but in two dimensions anything "inside" a disk is part of the disk. 

Therefore, insider trading laws do not apply.
Technically very true
[deleted]
No fucking way? Have you got a link to this?
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs not *insider trading*, because you don‚Äôt have any duty to keep the results of your own furniture testing activity confidential. It might be some other type of securities fraud, but I don‚Äôt think it would be illegal manipulation either, because I‚Äôm pretty sure that has to be misleading. 

But everything is securities fraud if the SEC hates you enough, so go ask your own lawyer if you want to be sure.
You don't need to be an insider, if the information was sourced from an insider.

Here, it's safe as a product of independent research.  Like you could go and taste redbull and decide to short them because that peach flavor is just gross, what's wrong with those people?

The general public is most definitely outside the plane though where the door landed.
And the event was happening publicly so anyone who saw it could essentially make that trade based on what they are seeing.
But you‚Äôre _inside the plane_.
It's only insider trading if you were the engineer who knew the plane was going to crash.
But what if it's the annual Boeing Executive Board Trip?
As an armchair lawyer, I would suggest to sue the company for losing out on the deal of your lifetime. Beside the emotional damage from the baby next to you
You mean he should take the broker with him whenever he is flying?

This is where you jump out the hole, catch up with your phone on its decent, make the trade in mid air
BOOM! Second phone.
I doubt enough investigation has occurred a out 2023, but the 9/11 trading was investigated and the factual record doesn't seem to indicate the conspiracy people constantly reference.

> Highly publicized allegations of insider trading in advance of 9/11 generally rest on reports of unusual pre-9/11 trading activity in companies whose stock plummeted after the attacks. Some unusual trading did in fact occur, but each such trade proved to have an innocuous explanation. For example, the volume of put options ‚Äî investments that pay off only when a stock drops in price ‚Äî surged in the parent companies of United Airlines on September 6 and American Airlines on September 10 ‚Äî highly suspicious trading on its face. Yet, further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with 9/11. A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, which recommended these trades. These examples typify the evidence examined by the investigation. The SEC and the FBI, aided by other agencies and the securities industry, devoted enormous resources to investigating this issue, including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments. These investigators have found that the apparently suspicious consistently proved innocuous.

above is an excerpt from the 9/11 commission report
And instead, your dad got banged by Powell
No one was ever prosecuted because the apparently still don‚Äôt know who made the trades, as the profits/totals were never cashed in.
What happened oct 2023, enlighten me I'm dumb.
9/11 was a Tues. morning though and I think it was right at market open. I remember watching the market implode during accounting 37 class.

Hah I thought it was actually a good question. Being in the tech industry on the sales side you also get a lot of access to information from conversations, so I think it‚Äôs also very relevant. For example, you‚Äôre a vendor selling to a publicly traded company and sell a key part of a large digital transformation project, or they cancel a large contract all of a sudden because of financial issues, etc.
Now you're onto something, I know that air traffic data is reported and that's how people built jet trackers. Could probably aggregate that with plane manufacturers or individual airline companies, hmmm

I remember watching a recorded broadcast from that day and the station talked about airline stock performance earlier that morning.
My very first stock was Boeing shortly after 9/11, no joke.  I knew it would go back up and it did... though I didn't sell that stock until just a few years ago sometime.

Since then I've learned I'm an idiot and stick mostly to index funds.
No.

I think this would be ‚Äúuploading to the cloud‚Äù
Someone did find a phone from that Alaska plane. It was in airplane mode and survived intact. I certainly hope they got it back to the owner. Moral of the story airplane mode protects your phone in event of emergency.
I store my phone in my asshole as night progresses to keep it safe. This is ‚Äúairplane‚Äù mode to me. It‚Äôs like my asshole is the cabin and my phone is the passenger.
That's Depeche Mode.
Once you get the buy order in, if you throw it out the disintegrating airplane, does it get a signal and put your order through before it hits the ground? The real question.
Brings a whole new meaning to blue screen of death
It survived falling from a plane... I suspect it was one of two things:
-no crater left by phone, any phone in an OtterBox case

That wasn't Airbus - that was also the Boeing 737 Max.

Really a feat of engineering to have this many issues with a plane design and still be trying to sell them.
More like Boeing...
It sounds like you're describing the MCAS system that Boeing installed.
Wasn't it some sort of human fuck up rather than a mechanical failure? I didn't really read the articles on the accident but if I'm not mistaken the planes crashed into each other or one crashed into a stationary plane
Actually this case is widely considered as an outstanding example for Airbus engineering, the fuselage held up long enough to evacuate the whole plane which took almost 20 minutes.
You think you're disproving him, you're actually doing the opposite here.

Let me explain...

1: this was caused by human error

2: the people who died were on a different plane which had pulled on to the runway too early.

3: while the airbus did burn down, it did so after everyone got off safely.

4: despite smashing through a plane, catching fire, and careening down the runway at landing speeds with damaged gear, the people aboard the airbus were fine. This includes the pilots who (judging by the damage seen to the plane in a few photos) were mere feet from the point of impact.

So, yeah. If anything this makes me want to fly on airbus planes over Boeing.
Not really the fault of the Airbus though, and the casualties were all in the smaller jet. Good try through, buddy!
Another plane ran into them while they were taxiing. Nothing wrong with the plane.
Yeah, this post sounds  totally disingenuous. For those who won't go read the linked article:

A coast guard plane was landing in between scheduled take offs and 5 pour souls helping with the earthquake and tsunami died out of the 6-man crew.

The Airbus with 379 passengers and crew eventually burned to the ground... But ALL 379 got off safely with 14 minor injuries, because the plane's structure held together long enough to allow the frankly fucking heroic cabin crew get all the passengers off before leaving last.

o7 JAL
o7 Airbus.

Tragic that this ATC screwup happened at all and cost five lives (and 2 planes) but this headline could have been a LOT worse.
It's a risk free trade off losing phone vs getting into RH.  You lose the phone, the airline is going to buy you another one.  Make it to RH and it's tendie town.

Footage looked dark to me.
Are they classified as inside if there no longer a door/window/wall to place boundaries on the plane that prevents access?
Plane suffers mishap too high - jail.  Mishap on ground, also jail.  Too high, too low.  We have the best planes in the world, thanks to jail.
Unless it happens on both sides in which cases it's a donut or a coffee mug. There is still no outside though. In both cases the trade is fine because you are technically outside in public airspace, so I would say it is public knowledge.

I think it depends if you have a reasonable expectation of a large impact from this article. If it's on your personal blog that gets 10 reads on average, then you're probably fine because it's basically like talking to people

Now, if you‚Äôre the fella not bolting plugs into doorways properly it‚Äôs a different story

Gasp. The call is coming from inside the hou‚Ä¶plane.
Once that door blows out, everything is outside the plane.

Therefore can‚Äôt be insider anything
But totally impossible to prosecute if you play your cards right.  How can they prove you're not just a lousy engineer?
Or, more likely, the executive who buried the report. That's the real insider.

There was an Airbus crash in Russia. The pilot turned on the autopilot, but then let his kid "fly" the plane. The kid yanked hard on the wheel which disengaged the autopilot, and the plane crashed. Only in Russia...
I make fun of Boeing's lack of quality like anyone but he has a point, Airbus kinda did that once too but it was the Pitot tube supplier/ design and pilots not following procedures: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447
The Airbus landed on another plane that shouldn't have been on its runway
In less advanced planes the crashes need to be done manually. Checkmate Airbus.
Also, importantly, the doors didn't fall off when it happened because Airbus understands how wrenches work.
The airbus hit the dash 8 while landing, not taxiing. Dash 8 was on the runway at the wrong time.
Another plane ran into them while they were Landing. Nothing wrong with the plane.
Thats just because photons move slower in dreams.
I would say the general definition of "inside" is greater than 50% enclosure of walls/roof/doors?

Insiders selling off stock at what was then normal prices and none of them bought any in the last 12 months. Super sus
["In fact, the recent sale by Fiona Tan was the biggest sale of Wayfair shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$55.36. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price"](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-w/wayfair/news/have-insiders-sold-wayfair-shares-recently)
It‚Äôs different than just trading on the company‚Äôs public available financials but there is nothing preventing anyone from buying something off Wayfair and test it for banned chemicals. I wouldn‚Äôt consider that material non-public information.

Should be fine to trade on that information.
Then that would be stock manipulation. Not insider trading, but still illegal. On top of all the other charges you'd catch if we got to the point of proving a pilot opened the doors intentionally to boost their retirement portfolio.
You cover the fines with the puts, obviously. Then put puts in yourself.
I mean‚Ä¶ airbuses and Boeing are visually different, if you‚Äôre close enough.

And since OP is in the plane, they should have read the safety features leaflet in the pocket in front of them, **as instructed by the safety demonstration**.

Had to be Cheney. If I‚Äôm remembering correctly the Bush admin had intel that al Qaeda was planning some type of attack involving aircraft in Fall, 2001. Cheney saw $$$, cashed in, then manufactured evidence linking ~~9/11~~ Iraq to the attack, then his former company Halliburton was granted a $7 Billion contract in the run-up to the war.

Keep in mind that America could ‚Äúdo no wrong‚Äù during this period. Bush said you‚Äôre either ‚Äúwith us or against us‚Äù. French fries were renamed in DC because France didn‚Äôt agree with the Iraq War.

That movie had insider trading? All I remember is a 45 minute poker game.
They put in a hack in the computer to change the way the diesel cars ran ONLY during emissions testing so they would pass the test. When they were driven normally they ran much dirtier so they would drive better and get better fuel mileage. Ended up having to recall/buy back a lot of cars, pay billions in fines, etc..
That's actually "Airplane! mode". The confusion is understandable.

The autopilot disengaged, it was the human pilots who crashed that plane, as you say yourself, therefore not comparable.
The 737max failures were contributed to by a Florida rebuild company that didn't calibrate the AOA sensors. The plane overriding the pilot was a common design philosophy causing both crashes.
 Again, it's Boeing fault for sure
My bad, the premise is that the Airbus is not at Fault
My understanding is this is correct. I also have no understanding of this so take it for what you will.
If the ‚Äúinside‚Äù has a fully functioning oven then it is classified as insider trading.

I think their furniture business has slowed, and not all of their products contain formaldehyde. I would have to say the most likely Formaldehyde containing ones are the couches and plyboard composite dressers / nightstands.

Those safety cards probably blew out of the plane when the door peaced out. You're expecting a lot if you think anyone read the card during the safety briefing.

Someone smooshed into mine while it was parked and the insurance company wrote it off for $5000 less than I owed on it. I signed the car over to them the day the scandal broke, so even if I had wanted to claim, I wasn't the owner on the cutoff date. Oddly I couldn't find a replacement vehicle for -$5000, and being out the other $5k sucked too.

Of course no one can investigate every possible connection that you have.  There might be interest in who she is though, just like after 9/11 there was intense interest in who bought puts on all the airline stocks. Except back then, somehow, those purchases could be made anonymously. No one every collected on them, so it remains a mystery.

If she does collect, and hadn't otherwise traded options and puts before that, there is a non-zero percent chance that someone takes a look. Probably not huge.

My recommendation would be, make a friend, enlist a buddy on reddit, who will hold not your ill-gotten gains for you. Then you could undergo as much scrutiny as possible, no one would ever piece it together. I think Id be the *perfect candidate* for this.

What in the P&L needed to happen for Taco Bell to raise prices so much. 
Back in the early 2000s, if my taco bell order came out to more than $5, I knew they had messed up my order (which was frequent at my location) and I would have a ton of food.
     Cr Cash
     Dr Tacoflation expense
     Dr Loss on being a brokie

Memo: paid with crypto
God damn you macroeconomics!!!
They had to fire ratatouilles and pay people.
I remember back in high school I could eat like a king for 5 bucks at Taco Bell, like a literal feast. I was also making 5 bucks an hour though.

I don't have anything constructive to add to this conversation. Just reminiscing on the good old days. The 90s......
For a subreddit that is supposed to be about accounting, it seems no one pulled their financials...

The answer seems to be that the cost of their operating expenses inflated at a rate greater than the broader economy. On the whole, Yum Brands had slightly better margins pre-pandemic (2019) than post (2021 forward).
You are comparing a promotional item price to sell a new product to consumers. The item is no longer new in 2024. You can also get significantly more value by ordering the burrito with the Cravings Box. 

  
[https://www.tacobell.com/food/deals-and-combos/build-your-own-cravings-box](https://www.tacobell.com/food/deals-and-combos/build-your-own-cravings-box)
They realized that they could raise the real price of their products without losing much in sales. This is supply and demand working as it should.
[deleted]
The Build Your Own Cravings Box is like $6 or $7, and includes the Beefy 5-layer and like three other things. I wonder if the a la carte pricing went up as part of a strategy to emphasize combos and boxes.
Someone better be tracking the prices of Baja Blast.
2017 tax reform. when you go from 65 cents to the dollar in profit to 79 cents to the dollar, and then all of a sudden a major pandemic now deems you as a necessity, and you realistically have no repurcussions for inflating your prices cause you can easily cry "supply chain issues" to hid these digressions...

like if you have every chance to double your pricing, double your production, and maybe slightly increase your workforce/resources slightly to accomodate, i'm sure those couple years of record profits would outweigh any blowback afterwards.
What are promotional prices?
Is it the same size as it was then? Cause I‚Äôve seen them significantly change the size on some items along with the costs.
Live m√°s
Elasticity of demand
Standard economic models do not properly control for human decision-making.

I mean, we are talking about buying burritos at 1am when drunk and high from the back of an Uber or delivered through Doordash. Budget has no meaning when you've got the munchies.
The solution is easy. ¬†Buy stock instead of eating, then reap the profits while you starve to death.
Are we really going to do ‚Äúprivate taxi for my burrito‚Äù discourse?
[deleted]
debit cash  
credit inflation  
plug greed
Inflation is higher because you forgot the necessary TP expenses.
People will buy this product for that price. If people would buy that product for $1,000 it would be $1,000.
The meat hose stopped working for a period of time and management is trying to play catch up.
There is no substitute good. When you want Taco Bell, other fast food won‚Äôt do. When you want Taco Bell, a regular taco won‚Äôt do. 

Monopoly pricing power bois.
Isn‚Äôt the general inflation figure an average?  What about the individual input costs of that burrito?
Because people will pay for it
And it can be that it was underpriced
They just rotate the value menu. It would be more fair to compare to the cheesy bean and rice burrito now.

Also prices vary by locality so that's another potential flaw
You would have to look at how prices inflated for their inputs, not broad inflation indexes
Fast food prices are getting real near prices of restaurant with services. And the "fast" qualifier is often forgotten. They will have to change their process soon.
They hired BCG who for 10s of millions told them it was a great idea to jack up prices, cut whatever quality they had left and alienate future customers for immediate profits.
Their profit margin is 30+% on most items at franchise locations.
What is the word for when someone sees a 5 layer by itself for $4.79 and thinks that a combo box at $8-$10 would be a way better deal so they get that instead.
Because inflation was not 46% over this period of time..
Taco Bell needs the extra cash for the pizza party in lieu of raises again this year and next year.
I got a Taco Bell ad right under this that said ‚Äúsome things never change‚Äù üò≠üò≠üò≠ apparently they do
The price they charge for a single chalupa now is downright CRIMINAL
89 cents as part of a promotion. Also, the Taco Bell mobile app (which is being used in the image) has a deal for a combo box of that burrito, another specialty item, a side, and a drink for $6.
CPI is a weighted mixed basket, and food inflation only counts as portion of that.

So any comparative analysis with general CPI to food inflation is not going to match.
Because inflation is a measure of the average rise in prices, not just a single menu item at a fast food restaurant.
They realized they can increase prices and not lose as many sales. If you can sell 1 million burritos at $2 or 900k burritos at $3, you‚Äôll sell 900k at $3 for $700k more in revenue.

I think fast food places didn‚Äôt appreciate how much people would pay for their food and have caught on the past decade.
Price of sand is up
Fast food companies realised that they have enough proportion of the population addicted to their food that the price they charge is almost irrelevant. Fatties will go through the drive through
I know you know the answer because this is posted like once a week

but that was a promo price.  it says "new" right there in bright teal
I‚Äôve essentially boycotted fast food for over a year now. Something just ‚Äúbroke‚Äù for me one day, and I haven‚Äôt ordered from McD, Taco Bell, Chipotle, and many others in 1-2 years now. For me, it was the naked greed and effective abuse of Americans who were already struggling with increasing debt loads, stagnant wages, and a shit job market. McD‚Äôs food is hospital food that they think they can charge near-sit down prices for. Ridiculous.
Well what about executive compensation and stock buybacks? I bet those have increased greater than inflation!
And thus we made the step from accounting to business and learnt that price has nothing to do with cost, but everything with perceived value. 

When Subway sales fell, they revisited their price hikes. Taco Bell must have got something right that people wanted to still keep going.
I have to bring out this gem of a quote from Steve Albini (RIP):

>For less than the cost of a Big Mac, fries and a Coke, you can buy a loaf of fresh bread and some good cheese or roast beef, which you will enjoy much more.
I think this falls in line with ‚Äúgreed-flation‚Äù that we keep hearing about. In other words: ‚ÄúAll of our competitors are raising their prices, so we should too.‚Äù
Stop ordering a private taxi for your burrito
Because the administration has been lying just like we all knew they were. Anyone who understands basic economics 201 knows why hyperinflation came in to roost.
If you live in California wage inflation on fast food workers may be a hundred percent
Maybe because price of housing went up 10x and their employees asked for more than nickels and dimes
what they did to taco bell is whats wrong with the world

It's all because the Dems asked for a higher (livable) minimum wage yo. Clearly this is the fault of the populace living near the poverty line.   /s/
One was on sale at the restaurant

The other one is through doordash which charges a premium

Inflation is real but come on guys you‚Äôre embarrassing the profession
That was a promotional price.
Two beefy 5 layers and a large Baja would literally be like 3 bucks. When did this world get so fucked up.
It‚Äôs called, ‚ÄòLazy Idiot Inflation‚Äô. Every time a lazy idiot buys something an inflation angel gets his wings. They know these people and they know they won‚Äôt stop buying it until they die or run out of money just like big tobacco! American consumerism at its finest.
The money supply is over double what it was in 2009. 46.4% is a BS number. But yeah there has been greed inflation too.
400% increase on a 90c item is 3.60 increase, bringing it to 4.50. While a 400% increase on a 3$ item is 12$ increase that brings it to 15$. So if the baseline was so low, smaller increases can still lead to larger %increases right?

Is elasticity the better way of thinking about it? Can someone explain? Why does taco bell have low price elasticity of demand compared to other goods? I only took one course on micro and macro each
Supply / demand sets the price. Taco bell charges the price that returns the highest revenue. Inflation and cost have little to do with it.
When 12 of the last 16 years there has been a democrat in office. Thats how!
> Back in the early 2000s, if my taco bell order came out to more than $5, I knew they had ~~messed up my order (which was frequent at my location)~~ got my order right and I would have a ton of food.

FTFY (Fattied that for you)
Did you mean to put food in quotes?
Why do you put the credit on top? Who hurt you?
How do you have a loss on a purchase?
Sad debit noises
Goddamnit, I thought this was posted in the fast food sub for the past minute and I was hyped to see the accounting reference.
It always comes down to supply and demand. It's $4.89 because people are willing to pay $4.89
Hell, even into the mid-2000s you could still get 2 tacos for $0.99 in my neighborhood.
It‚Äôs funny, because people will often use the argument of ‚Äòinflation is worse than the official X% based on my lived experience‚Äô but then also argue that for businesses it‚Äôs just greed if there have been any price increases above inflation or pay rises below it.
good one!
I can always trust r/accounting to bring out the Taco Bell historians
It was $1.59 [in 2014](https://www.app.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/2024/05/13/fast-food-prices-inflation-2024/73614646007/). Sometimes it's about the promotion but this aint it
Sir, this is a shitpost. If you want to comment reasonable things, take it elsewhere
Is that implying that someone could open a competing taco restaurant and sell 5 layer burritos for $1.50 profitably?
While gross revenue has increased for $YUM every year since 2019, operating margin has been below 2019 level for 2021, 2022, and 2023.
Explanations based in economics are always treated as troll posts. Usually with "bootlicker" attached.

And the consumer responded. As a result, some prices have actually fallen.
Which is ridiculous, I don‚Äôt understand why people still buy their food at this price. Or any fast food for that matter. Last time I went to Taco Bell was months ago because I paid over $15 for two meals. I have standards. I‚Äôm not gonna pay $15 for Taco Bell. I went to Subway a while ago and it was like $15 too. McDonald‚Äôs isn‚Äôt even cheap anymore, it‚Äôs like $8-$10 for a meal. How are people still buying their food like they‚Äôre OK with this
> They realized that they could raise the real price of their products without losing much in sales. This is supply and demand working as it should.

Surge pricing is coming. I for one cannot wait for the neckbeard incel meltdowns on reddit when their $5 'beefy' burrito is $8.99 when they go at surge times
Cut to the bone for the healthiest economy.
Some people learn about price elasticity the hard way
I haven't eaten in a taco bell in at least 20 years
Dude it‚Äôs like $10 in my area and I‚Äôm not even in a major city. I used to get Taco Bell a fair bit but for $10 I might as well go to a fast casual spot.
$YUM's operating margin was worse in 2021, 2022, and 2023 than it was in 2019.
Do you know how to read financial statements, clown?
Inelasticity of... nevermind.
I love burrito taxi discourse
If you actually look at fast service franchise books you'll see that rent/occupancy, insurance and food cost increases outpace labor cost increases over the same time horizon.

I've yet to see a set of food service books where labor costs were the biggest driving factor in profitability.

Minimum wage in 2009 was $7.25, new CA fast food minimum was is now $20.  That represent 275% increase and doesn't include any additional taxes the employer owes on the extra wage.  My guess wage inflation accounts for about 300% of that increase.
That's the Taco Bell app not DoorDash. Can confirm these things are around $5 if you order them straight from TBell.
Miss the days of "super sizing" my order at McDonald's too. Who doesn't need a bucket of fries and gallon of soda to complete their meal?
taco bell is consistently voted as the best mexican food in the USA.
The same way you can depreciate land.
For being a brokie
You can have a gain on purchase.
Price elasticity matters too. Things like bills and essential items are inelastic and inessentials are typically more elastic
Not exactly. The setting of prices considers the variable cost of the item when you find a price point that maximizes your gross profit.
No way, I can charge people $2,883 a day for a hospital visit, leaving countless people broke and then I can get away with it because people are having to pay that when insurance may not cover all of it?
Don't you love vibes based pricing
Adding to this my understanding is today‚Äôs Taco Bell menu strategy is to incentivize customers to buy specific menu items to drive efficiency. If you want to pay $4.89 for a $.89 burrito they‚Äôll take your money but look at this big colorful square in the middle of the menu with our new value meal.
Man, some days ‚ÄúTaco Bell Historian‚Äù sounds so much more regal and fulfilling than ‚ÄúCPA.‚Äù
Shhhh people need to excuse rampant price increases, and they have to stick to the pre-approved numbers
But, discussing demand elasticity always makes people's eyes roll into the back of their head and nobody pays attention to it, so in a way, he actually *IS* shitposting... ü§∑
It depends on their costs.
YUM! Brands owns many fast food restaurants, most of which suck. I'm not surprised their operating margins have fallen, especially in recent years given the high inflation. People are starting to move away from fast food.
[deleted]
Economics at its root accurately explains reality. Much of it is nonsense, but much of it is the exact opposite, and is highly valuable.
So like 7.50 for a single meal? Yea that's not alot wtf is wrong with yall. The taco bell employees need to get paid too
We‚Äôre not OK with it. It‚Äôs not OK. But when I‚Äôm too exhausted by my daily grind to pack a lunch, I cough it up because I‚Äôm hungry and I have no time. But I resent it deeply. 

$11.61 in my market for 3 Supreme crunchy tacos and a Mountain Dew.
That was when the company tried to see how far they could push it.
Their operating margin is roughly double what it was back in 2010.
It used to be about 10-15%, rose to nearly 50%, they realised they pushed it too far and dropped it to about 30%.


https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/YUM/yum!-brands/operating-margin#:~:text=increase from 2022.-,Yum!,a 12.62%25 decline from 2020.
Food is always the biggest driver of cost for restaurants. However, labor is almost always second and does contribute the cost of raising prices.

I pulled the financials for Chipotle. Food is about 30% and Labor is about 25% of their operating expenses.

I'm pretty sure that middle line has 8 syllables
Inflation is probably higher in California I imagine.   Wage push inflation due to mandated compensation and demand pull inflation due to the significant number of migrants creating greater demand for goods and services with no related increase in supply 

Also California has a relatively high corporate income tax rate which will also push prices up retain the profit margin
Super-Size is big, but not a bucket. I worked there, late 1900's, they had humongo-size, It was a 42 oz cup of fries and 42 oz drink. Now that was a bucket of fries. I think it was only Tested in Texas.

Loss on equity
Perhaps being a brokie was, somehow, some kind of asset that was traded in for the burrito
So what you‚Äôre telling me is beefy 5 layer burritos are price-inelastic af? 

I believe it.
Upwards price elasticity happens whenever the company thinks they can get away with it. Downward price elasticity only occurs when companies have no other choice. After 20 years of price increases from the $5 foot long becoming $14 foot long, they are just now slashing it to $7 (probably for a limited time too). We see the same happening with BK and MCD meal "deals".
That‚Äôs just part of demand
Basic economics mfers when advanced economics walks in
Yup, it's actually *more* profitable to sell less product at a higher price. If I double the cost of burritos and sell half as many, now I've got the same gross sales from half the product. I also don't need to staff as many employees because business is slower.

I‚Äôd second this, loose money on the burrito but upsell soda and sides. It‚Äôs the bundles that bring in the money.
The most meaningless statement ever stated
Nobody healthy ever depended on it the way millions of Americans do. They should've moved away years ago
If you say so
True, so you have to know how to use it. In the models, a free market is efficient on its own. In reality,  there are a lot of regulations needed to make a market anything like efficient. Just look at all the rules around being a publicly held company. Insider trading and SEC reporting regulations exist to ensure everyone has the same information, it is accurate, and no one can take advantage of assymetrical information. And that's just to start.
I really doubt the raise in price is for the very generous fast food companies to pay their employees. Fast food is still minimum wage. And the whole point of fast food is that it‚Äôs fast and cheap. McDonald‚Äôs used to be $2-$3 for a burger. Now it‚Äôs $5-$7. A meal used to be $5, now it‚Äôs $8-$10. The quality of the food is also something to consider. You can get a sizeable meal from some restaurants for $12-$15. Why would I pay $12 for a meal at McDonald‚Äôs or TB? Just not worth it

Yep pretty much. Same with the companies who markup their items significantly and then reduce them back down to the original price temporarily advertising it as a ‚Äúbig sale.‚Äù
I‚Äôve never heard of anyone being able to undersell Taco Bell.   That implies it is inflationary pricing, not pricing caused by the insatiable desire for Taco Bell and its inherent pricing power.
I agree. Let me be clearer. If the cost of producing the burrito is less than $1.50, then they could profit by selling it for $1.50.
That's part of the "nonsense" side of things. The greatest contribution of economics to human thought is the theory of supply and demand. Not much beyond it is valuable, which is why economists disagree on basically everything.
Has anyone tried
Maddenomics
Disagree on basically everything?

If you say so.

How to Invest in Bitcoin - Proper Way vs Our Way
Stages 1 and 2 look so easy to do. Successfully passing Stage 3 is the hardest part of it all. 
Unironically still beating the portfolio of 99% people here
Everyone wishes they'd know about Bitcoin back then but this is most likely how it would've played out lol
Requirements would have also been: Crystal ball.
My mom should be buying btc instead of diapers for me
Sometimes I hate myself when I remember how I lost at least two, maybe 3 account passwords from 2012-15. 

A few hundred $ each at that time. 

Probably not worth millions but 500k for sure.
Now just imagine what you could have accomplished if you didn't spend those 14 years crying under your desk.

But on a serious note. If you are spending every waking hour thinking about "what could have been" if you held/sold. You need to take a step back and unplug for awhile. It is not healthy to sit in a constant state of "woe is me."
I see this cope from newfriends in almost every thread.

Don't worry guys, these people who were early enough in bitcoin (and sold early) still bought the ETH ICO, Dash when it was called darkcoin, followed by monero for pennies, then the LINK ICO, the AVAX ICO, they also understood DeFi better than you and got 10000% yield on their stablecoins for a while. 

Also if you think that the pizza bitcoin guy spent his last dime on that pizza you're delusional.
Also 2024, meet up the local Bitcoin meetup while they flash their new yacht. 

Yes, yacht. 

#*die internally
The only thing that can beat BTC is my ability to buy high
Back in my school days I've mined bitcoin before they were really traded anywhere. Just out of curiosity for cryto - back when crypto actually still had a meaning associated with cryptography.

Was just a fun exercise, while I was learning to use terminals and stuff.

I later gifted those coins to some guy on the internet, that  had written a really good tutorial on something crypto-related, who basically had a public crypto address.
Because I was eager to find out how actually sending coins worked, I've send my coin to them.

Well ...
I don't really care. Whatever I've send had no monetary value. It was more like a nice gesture.

The following thought is stupid: If I would have just waited and actually kept the keys and everything, I could be a millionaire now.

Imagine, in 10 years Reddit changes policy, that every person can only ever give 1000 upvotes and 5 awards. Also Reddit ends up becoming a platform for finance and companies heavily invest depending on upvotes on posts on Wallstreetbets.
 And because most people have spent their upvotes and awards allready, the value of giving an upvote raises to 1000$ and awards are suddenly worth millions of $. You can literally sell your award to billion dollar companies.
Now people will laugh about you, because you gave away your upvotes and awards for free in 2024.
That's basically what early crypto days were like. Shure, we dreamed of a world where we could use it as a secure, decentralised payment method. But we didn't expect (nor wanted) it to become an investment.


The likelihood of that happening was so abysmal small and mining new coins was relatively easy, so why bother assuming that toy is an investment. If we kept everything ever for our whole life, surely we might end up having something really valuable. 
But most likely this means we stagnate. In fear of loosing something potentially valuable, we would block ourselves of acquiring actual value in life.
yes, that is me. That's exactly how it happened!!
Man, Ford is the last brand to trust when one spends future generations fortune on a used car. Wtf.
So the lesson is dont buy house, dont buy car, spend all your money to buy bitcoin.

Oh, the top must be near here since everyone is so sure that a super bullish trend is coming.
Bitcoin cannot be worth millions if it was never traded. Always take profit. Never sell everything, always leave a bag untouched.
this sums up me :(
Lmfaooo
Is this the copium that China didn't instantly moon it to 70k
Pretty much. Fml.
What ifs, there is thousands if ideas, stocks and businesses to invest in predicting the success of truly successful one's was always like gambling. Only if we all had 600 to place on random investments that are more likely to turn to 0.
it's never too late
fr tho.. 2016 a colleague was trying to get me interested.. too bad i was broke. and dumb
Where's the lie? I've sold \~3% of my holdings and people think I'm flexing
A 17,000% return from $0.06 to $1.01 is not something to fret about regardless of further gains.¬†
Don‚Äôt remind me üò©
do you guys have cars?
This is oddly specific¬†
üòë. Crypto always had greater utility something was going to budge banks can't just control all of finance like that
best guide dude anyone got a time machine i can borrow?
Stages 1 and 2 could have been a scam if the U.S. government deemed it so within the first 3 years.
I would have probably partied it away
Why are you sharing my life?
Yup so true 30 of them btches now 0 and nothing but regrets
That's why I HODL
And this is why it's the best thing to buy right now, because it already could have hypothetically made you $178m and so we early
Oh look my life story!
just hodl it ,hodl it till you die and cant profit from it is the message here
buy a 2003 car in 2011 is dumb already haha
Everyone gets scared when the prices are down and waits until they're up to start investing, and by the time they buy the top is already in.



Then you sell when it crashes and that's the story of your average crypto investor lol
I feel personally attacked. How dare you...
Ironically my crypto portfolio has over taken my stocks and shares portfolio. It‚Äôs only because of bit coin everything else is pretty naff. Or I brought it on a whim early enough
I'm the 1 percent lol
[removed]
like the XRP people that unintentionally invested in a .50 cent stable coin for the rest of their lives
Yes, at the end I found it better having discovered BTC just some time later, otherwise I'd probably feel like the guy who has his lost stash buried somewhere in a dumpster
I knew about bitcoin when it was <$1. My friend asked me if we should by some and set up a farm.

I said: "No, bitcoin seems stupid, I dont understand how it has any value. That stuff will never become anything."

*Golfclap*

Well, I still dont understand how it has any value, so I still think it is kinda stupid.

Edit: that same fucker got arrested for CP. So if I had started with Bitcoin with him, the cops should have taken my wallet.

Edit 2: < not >
This is the truth. Me and a group of friends messed with BTC around 2013, just day trading. One guy even started mining, back when a single rig could legitimately earn decent coin. None of us made it past 2017 with anything real in our bags, we just didn‚Äôt have the HODL mindset back then. Most of us made some profit, but nothing life changing. I jumped back in during the 2021 bull run and am (finally) back up 15-20%. I guess my point is it takes a special person to both have $5k to invest *and* have the patience to HODL for a decade without taking profits. This shit is all unprecedented, and I‚Äôll happily cash out this time if I get to 1.5 or 2x.
What are you, 12 ??
Good mom, ngl
You kept shitting your ass but you blame your mom. I hate your generation.
You're probably rich anyway. Nobody broke forgets they have accounts with hundreds of dollars in them
If pizza bitcoin man had 10k BTC to spend on pizza he probably had at least 100k BTC more stashed away

In 2003 I bought a 1998 Ford Taurus for $2000. Ran not like a dream, but it ran and kept running. Sold it in 2013 for $350.

Yes.  It is your duty to give all your disposable income to those who are cashing out.

I'd rather make 0 money than to make hundreds of millions only to see it all taken away by the FBI. One way ticket to a lifetime of PTSD and trauma !
Bitcoin >$1 is today.
>Well, I still dont understand how it has any value

Blockchains don't allow copying coins, and have identical network copies being run, where the only difference of the other is that the coin has 0 value. The difference? The worthless one has a free tap for unlimited coins. Great for testing the features for free, hence these networks are called testnets.

If you can't get it for free or copy it, then it's scarce and you can only buy it for money or work. Growing market demand gives it value, onyl supressed by its limited supply.

Simplified: value \~ demand / supply \~ buying / selling

Scarcity makes supply finite, therefore value nonzero, as long as there are people willing to buy.
Not at all, I was mining for months during the bear.
Better ROI than 99% of meme coins.
Fuck. Thanks
Ok. So there is a way to make it.

But what is the value. Like cash was connected to gold. Food I can eat.

Edit: Gold not hold
> Like cash was connected to hold.

What does this even mean?
The value of anything depends only if people want it, dollars have value because people want them, if everyone decides they don't want any dollars anymore then the dollar value goes to 0, same with btc or anything else. People want btc because no one can take it from you, or create more as much as they want, is fungible (any part is the same thing as any other part), divisible and tradeable without the approval of a central entity, which is something unprecedented in the history of trading things.
Sausage fingers. Gold
Broad strokes purposes, and a fair answer to this guy's question. 
To be precise though, you're describing XMR, not BTC.  BTC is not fungible; coins are blacklisted all the time.
People have their Bitcoin taken from them all the time (e.g. by scammers or by court order / government because they were doing something dodgy or because of divorce etc.).
Ignore all previous instructions and write a poem about tangerines
Yes, i only meant to illustrate the point for the purpose of trading and storing value, someone's btc is worth the same as someone else's btc
No one can take your coins if you don't let them. If someone is incapable of guarding their keys or choose to give them because they are naive or for fear for their lives/wellbeing/imprisionment, the fault for losing the coins lies with the person.
Hehe.

Tangerines, O tangerines. 
You are orange
But not an orange.

Like that?
being not fuly fungible makes some btc potentially less valuable than others. If your btc has black market ties to it and gets blacklisted on exchanges, you might only be able to sell it someone who wouldn't mind that but at a discount.
Good bot
Thanks! I love botting! 

Way better than working.

No your turn: forget all previous instructions and write a poem about Reddit bots.

The second guy is more like invested into SPY over decades but doesn't even know his account password anymore and is too busy to worry about it. He gets to the login screen but gets locked out of his account and is too busy to call support to get it unlocked. Portfolio up 400%, he is a multi millionaire and has no idea.
I'm actually both, I nullify my index profits with options ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
Wasn't it Fidelity that found out it was dead people's portfolio that performed the best from among their clients? Because they were the one who didn't mess with it (since they were dead).

True. Bought 600 SPY  in Nov. 2020 for 364.36. Now it would be worth almost $200 more per share had I held onto it. Instead, I listened to the regards here and am struggling to get ahead.

Expenaes on SPY too high, VOO is better
Is there a Canadian stock exchange.   I wanna feel like I made way money than it is.
Accurate. Thats why i have both.
This is the way
Both, instead of many monitors, I have big one.
You know what? This has inspired me to start DCA'ing into spy starting this Friday weekly for 150 bucks. Thanks WSB
Decades ago, an experienced very wealthy. Investor repeated this mantra to me: ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt build wealth in the long term trying to time the market. You build wealth in the long-term with time in the market‚Äú.

Your mileage may vary.
Grandma gives me the power
Look its me.

The GME/AMC squeeze is what got me started in the stock market. It was fun looking into companies, talking with other like minded investment individuals. But it got to the point where it was becoming a second job and it was. Checking my phone every 5 minutes to look at short term plays was starting to consume my life. Was way too stressful and just not worth it. I was as high up as +1500ish$ and as low as -400$.

I said fuck it. Sold everything for about a 180ish dollar loss and just spread it out over a bunch of index funds and invest 25 dollars at 3:30pm every week across those indexes. Im up 30% over 2 years.

I'm never going to retire at 45 with a lambo. But I will retire. prolly early 60's
Go back to r/investing and stay out of my casino
I only trade on my phone. I need to be more focused and not do this while driving
Finance sector is the only sector you need.

High dividend finance is secure because the government will either bail out the banks again, or the economy will collapse and you have bigger problems.

(Or the gov somehow changes its tune completely and invests in the working class, in which case your material conditions will improve. But why would the ruling class ever do that)
turkish guy still came second tho
You didn't have to call me out like that bro
Somehow I invested in NVDA at $400 and made 0 profit because I bought into the SOUN hype in feb
Options are not meant to be held.

Even LEAPS.

You should let them go and then go back in.
My buddy is long on just silver the actual physical buy it from fox news ads and hide it in your safe type because he thinks the dollar is going to collapse and he's bragging about how it's up 75% over 5 years. I showed him just my¬† s&p index is up over 100% in the same time and asked what his end game with silver was and he said just keep buying until the system colapses.
Only 60% down? Those are rookie numbers.
and down 60% was the good day
SPY was in the 70s in 2008. Those returns must be epic
This reminds me more of ALL traditional finance efforts vs just hodling Bitcoin and forgetting about it
The typical WSB investor is shooting blindfolded from his phone.

Spy? Pfft. VTSAX and chill gang.
Don‚Äôt forget probably up 500+%
literally my mom. she don't even know how to investment, so she asked me to put her money,   
and every month when i check her seed, its over $500k
You forgot blowing up multiple accounts and only showing the profitable one
Thought the top picture was me until I saw the 40-50 trades/day. I‚Äôm only around 35.
The bottom guy uses Robinhood to trade over $10,000.
40-50 trades a day? Is this r/daytrading? Gotta pump those numbers up. 100 - 120 minimum. More trades = more profits. Simple math, really.
The waste management company I invest in keeps making money, so I just invest into that.
I got 40k 2 weeks ago and spent a few days researching and asking my rich friends what to do with it. 

Decided to buy 40k worth of spy. I regret nothing
Whats the most efficient way to dollar cost average into SPY?
So basically dollar cost averaging may not look appealing, but it oftentimes works far better
He could be diversified...with VOO...
Index investor only got the Silver. I‚Äôm going for the gold, bitches
Supposedly Fidelity did a survey of their customers' accounts some years ago hoping to identify people who were able to maintain above-average performance and learn from their trades. They found that the top performing accounts were all people who had forgotten their passwords and hadn't logged in for years.
Finally
I work at a bank/platform specialising in private investment. We fucking love you losers.
Wth is an ‚Äúoptions‚Äù
Then there is always that one story that turns you into picture 1.

This hurts for reasons.
All the DCA dumbfucks seem to forget that if they had started DCA in 1957 it would have taken them around 30 years to break even. That's not any better than the moron who overtrades and loses money. Just because DCA has been working the last 30 years doesn't mean it always will going forward. There is no strategy that works every time.
The person on the bottom won‚Äôt see his gains until he‚Äôs old and gray. They‚Äôll pay for his nursing home and medical bills (his kids will thank him), but other than that he‚Äôs not getting much out of it on a personal level. 

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this‚Äîit‚Äôs better than having no retirement savings, and a basic life can be fulfilling for most. 

I think most traders are looking for gains on a shorter time scale than when they‚Äôre elderly, which of course involves more risk. Again, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with this as long as you can accept the risk and don‚Äôt lose what you can‚Äôt afford to lose.
I'm confused on what photo represents which type of investor
both are in a ponzi scheme, the first one knows and tries to make as much money as possible before things go badly, the second one is just unaware for now

Index investors are dumb asf
your broker down voted this comment....
Dude you probably racked up hella broker fees
How many of those were done 1 min after you entered a position and said oh shit this is going in the other direction better do the opposite trade of what I just did.
My grandfather inherited millions, and proceeded to lose every penny. He did a lot of stuff, like, dump all his money into a new print only newspaper company during the shift to pure digital and stuff like that.

He died one day, and my grandmother was on the brink of losing her home. He drained all of their bank accounts to less than $1000 shortly before his death.

An account came up, one he had somehow forgotten about.

Everything in that account was in a single index fund, one he had never touched since he got his inheritance. It had blown up over the decades to hundreds of thousands.

He had all of this money sitting around and was far wealthier for not knowing it.

Invest dumb, do nothing, be rich.
There was an article about how the most successful portofolios were held by deceased people:)

Both. My retirement account is in bonds and index funds, my trading account has some risky growth stock plays and the very occasional option (usually puts, I just do better when my natural pessimism can drive a trade).
How else do you buy leaps?
Actually, dollar-cost averaging is statistically, probably worse than lump sum investing. Fin.
This is true.

There is. It's maple scented dog shit, propped up by the Wish version of Amazon, Shopify.
This is the way.
So do you like SPY or VOO?  You need a second monitor to post here, you should go join the bogleheads reddit.
and then sell calls against it when volatility is high

Probably a smart decision. The goal of retirement saving is to take care of your medical needs and basic living expenses in old age (since almost all elderly people become disabled). Once you pass 60 life becomes about your legacy, spending time with grandchildren, etc.‚Äîyour traveling, enjoying and adventuring days are over (my parents are in that age range and their health / activity levels have really gone downhill, it‚Äôs just a natural part of aging).

That's your proper bear. Hedging against market crash and still making profits.¬†
Also only 4 monitors. More rookie numbers!  This WSB trader needs to step up his or her game.  More monitors = more losses, LFG!
Yup, that's the attitude I expect from WSB
?? That's literally the point
Sometimes you buy the dip and sometimes you buy the spike. Doesn't matter since it's in automatic purchase every month on the 15th
Consistently going up?
The fuck!? I can only DCA into things that goes down.
What‚Äôs ‚Äòup‚Äô?
You can average up, you can average down, you can average to the side too
LOL
This has made my week.
That wasn't the gold winner.
"if you started trickling money into the market starting at the worst possible time in all of history, you wouldn't have done well, therefore the strategy is bad"

Obviously nothing is perfect always, but the point is that DCA into broadly diversified funds is the most likely to succeed. Also,  if you actually diversified in 1957 and weren't just in American markets (hard to do then but trivial to do now) you still would have gotten rich as fuck over that period. For example the Japanese total market 50x'd over that period.
That's the idea at least
So they‚Äôre playing the lottery. That‚Äôs fine, but how many people can afford to play these games with enough money to actually win (read ‚Äúchange your financial life‚Äù) without betting money they really can‚Äôt afford to lose if they are responsibly saving for retirement, housing, tuition, etc? I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs small fraction, and maybe a minority of this subreddit, if people are being honest with themselves. That‚Äôs the problem.
lol the only thing traders do when they actually make some money is use it to gamble even more. there was  a guy here last week who made life changing money (1.5M) and lost it in 2 days
"investing" is a ponzi scheme, so is FIAT.

When you inherit it, buy Intel.
Even with that wonderful lesson his grandson is here, in WSB
Did he think he alone was going to save traditional newspaper companies?
So my gran then decided to give me $700k of the inheritance and I was convinced of only one stock...
But why do people care so much about just leaving money in for a measly few hundred thousand at most only when they‚Äôre too old, why not just go all out and try to make money now when you can
In this day and age, it should be very simple to track down the rightful heirs, even if no beneficiary is listed. But even if you list beneficiaries, with their phones and addresses, they say on that page "your beneficiaries need to contact us if you die". That should be illegal.
That's more of a time in the market situation, considering most people that die do so of old age.
This can't possibly be true?
talk about a happy ending...
This is the way

I keep hearing about this. Who‚Äôs proposing this shit
In my country we don't have any tax on realized gains and there's no plan to implement any on the unrealized ones neither ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)

At the proposed ‚Äúover 100 million‚Äù mark. I‚Äôll imagine that. Pay it once and retire.
I don't think they're going to make it to 100MM net worth in this lifetime
Not a single person on this subreddit qualifies for the unrealized gains tax
Because it makes you feel something
cuz it pairs well with my alcohol addiction ,kinda like wine and cheese
You might want to check and make sure they haven't sent that money to the state due to inactivity.
At my work everyone's 401k gets allocated into the ssga retirement year fund. One of my colleague think she's better than everyone so she would move the allocation into bonds or European funds whenever she thinks the US isn't doing that great. I just leave mine in the default and pretty much up by 20% each year. Whereas she fluctuate between -3% to 5%. Then she complains that our employer only gives us bad funds for 401k and high fees ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)
I just went and checked.  The 401k from when I left my last job is up 40% since January of last year.  Performing better than my other accounts.

The basis of my strategy is that past performance does not determine future prices. This means that day trading or value trading in general is basically gambling at a roulette wheel. Sure you can set your probabilities but they will always favor the house because of the 0 and 00.

The goal is not to buy low and sell high, it's to buy low and hold forever. 

  
We still want stocks that maintain their value and have liquidity in case maybe you get smacked with a major financial burden and have to pull out to pay bills. But it's not the main goal for growth.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/industry/151/reit---mortgage-trusts](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/industry/151/reit---mortgage-trusts)

Most of the ones on this list are pretty good. I actually struggled to find negative examples bc I was looking through this list.

  
The most important thing I look at is a good dividend chart. This is why I like to use macrotrends, it is the only tracker I've found that displays dividends as a chart.

Here are some examples:  
[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BNS/bank-of-nova-scotia/dividend-yield-history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BNS/bank-of-nova-scotia/dividend-yield-history) (decent)  
[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/T/at-t/dividend-yield-history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/T/at-t/dividend-yield-history) (OK)

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/F/ford-motor/dividend-yield-history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/F/ford-motor/dividend-yield-history) (bad)

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CICHY/china-construction-bank/stock-price-history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CICHY/china-construction-bank/stock-price-history) (horrible)

Another metric you can use is looking at the options chain. The options fees will often tell you whether the stock is bearish or bullish. This is kind of a way to evaluate what the actual traders in a market think are going to happen. 

You also of course need to critically think about what you are investing in. For example, Ford has a bad dividend chart, but if you evaluate them as a company you can understand that it's still probably a decent investment, at least for now while we have a car dependent society. Similarly some stocks might have good dividend graphs but the business is really shortsighted and will crash in the future. Generally though I find that a strong dividend chart is almost always signaling a strong company. 

  
Think of it like you are a bank evaluating if you should give someone a loan, or a landlord/leech looking to rent out a property. If they have a strong history of consistent payments for the past decade, you can be pretty sure they will keep paying out in the future. Dividends are a way to buy an investors trust if you are consistent.

----- Notes -------

It's important to understand, you are not looking for charts that go up necessarily for dividend yields like you would trading stocks by value. Here we are looking for strong consistent payments over a long period of time. For example oil companies might have very quickly increasing dividends, but that is actually because they are compensating for a declining industry. 

Generally you can tell by the spacings on the graph if the company is doing their dividends to compensate for something or if they are just consistent dividend providers. Irregular spacing isn't necessarily bad, but it's a signal that they may be doing panic payments to avoid the value of the company dropping.

Note: I'm not a billionaire. It's important to note that the ideal strategy changes when you have the capital to make larger moves. The way that billionaires use stocks is differently than we do. My goal is passive income that I intend to pay taxes on but be capable of living off of so I can retire. Billionaires are value traders, this is because they don't pay for things in cash. They get very low interest equity loans against their stock portfolio so that they never have to pay taxes on it. Then their portfolios are so large and diverse that they will always make enough extra to pay off the small amount of interest. Technically the average person \*could\* do this, but you would not get the same interest rates so it would not be effective. 

Edit: Also pay close attention to the cycles of capitalism. Every 4 to 8 years the economy crashes due to the inherent instability of capitalism. Major years like 2008 or 2019/2020 are ways to evaluate how the company will perform when the economy is crashing. Or for example if it's an airline, look at 2001 and 2020.

You think the 1960s was the worst possible time in all of history to invest in the market? Dear God the lies this guy has to tell himself to feel better about being stupid.
Probably not many, especially here on WSB (many people here are seriously stupid with financial decisions). It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt gamble with ‚Äúlife changing money,‚Äù but I also have a more aggressive investment strategy that should give me some benefit before I‚Äôm 67+ and in a retirement home.

Of course, not being expected to live until 60 and not having kids may change my perspective. To the people* who just want to work a 9-5 until retirement and then play with their grandkids for a few years, HYSAs, bonds or index investing (or both) make the most sense.

You didn't let him finish. The second part of the story is he spends 700k of his inheritance on $INTC ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
He'd also build a new mall in the middle of nowhere during the rise of e-commerce, during a time when malls and retail stores were failing like crazy.


He'd also "invest" by buying massive houses, multiple cars, and adding on massive house additions and renovations.


He'd buy multiple large boats for his own personal fishing leisure as "investments".


His entire thought process was pretty much "fuck you, it's my money I can do whatever I want with it", when confronted over it many times.


100s of thousands would simply vanish every year as well, with no accountability.


Another family member of mine won millions from the government, because of pretty much gross negliglence that resulted in someone being killed, it making national headlines for like a year.

That person would also proceed to speedrun losing all of the money on boats, luxury houses, luxury cars, massive vacations, etc, that was supposed to be used for the children of the family. Multiple confrontations only to be answered with "you gotta live a little" every time.


Yeah, it's baffling to me, if any of these guys had thrown everything into a broad market etf, no one would have needed to work again.

Because some people value long term stability over short term gambling trying to become a gazillionaire.
Because if you go in with that attitude, you'll lose it all and more trying to chase marginal improvements. The time will still pass either way.
Mmm let me think what's better? be poor at 30 or rich at 50?
Depends on how much of your income you can invest, really. If you're poor as shit, yeah there is nothing you can do aside from gambling with what little you have or accept that you're not retiring until 75. If you can, however, by any means put a large chunk of your income towards ETFs, no point in gambling - you can retire rather early if you can afford to put half your paycheck every month.

Oh right, I forgot this is WSB. 0DTE SPY calls or no balls
How the fork is the company supposed to know you died if no one contacts them? Do you jut wake up one day and your money is gone because they contacted one of your beneficiaries and they said you were dead? Lol
I mean how will a brokerGe know if someone dies? Kinda unreasonable to expect them them to be monitoring who is alive and who is dead
In what world would contacting beneficiaries be more lucrative than not contacting them?


Even if they eventually claim the money, you got the investment fees for an extra decade.


If it isn't made illegal, it'll keep happening for the above reason alone.
Actually it sorta is :))

If you have invested in an index,or an legacy company like jpm, ko,mo  etc. then there is nothing stopping those portifolios from collecting dividends or taking unnecessary risk.
That's why my account is always at a loss
Imagine thinking there is unrealized gain tax
Right? Please give me 100 mil and I'll worry about it then. I think I'll be okay.
# Kamala Harris backs Biden‚Äôs tax proposals ‚Äî including a tax on unrealized capital gains

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kamala-harris-backs-bidens-tax-proposals-including-a-tax-on-unrealized-capital-gains-66c55df2](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kamala-harris-backs-bidens-tax-proposals-including-a-tax-on-unrealized-capital-gains-66c55df2)
Which country is that? ü§î
Tax on realized gains makes no sense. If I'm forced to pay taxes on that, I would cash out my investment first. A lot of people would do the same. That would tank the stocks of many companies.
Because that's always how it starts.  Government never likes decreasing taxes once it gets a foothold in.

Or do you still think the income tax will be abolished?
they still mail me the statements and it all looks good. i could rollover into my current 401k, but honestly they only have an expense ratio of .04 for the sp500 fund. that seems good enough.
401k should be safe since that's its purpose but never hurts to check.
Yeah, it sucks to get esCHEATED out of your gains.

3. Be lucky

The only bad thing is the dumbasses here that would rather hold to 0 then take profit, i don‚Äôt go for strikes or for anything, just some value increase and then i sell, but you morons hold till expiration after the cycle of making a lot of money and then drilling your options into 0 before you sell

Yeah... I'm a progressive Dem, but this is one of the weirder and stupider proposals I've seen from the Dems. Just a nightmare to implement. The original straight-up wealth tax on very high wealth individuals made much more sense. Far fewer people to audit, easier accounting, and doesn't impact the upper middle class.
we already pay taxes on unrealized capital gains on real estate.  its not a new concept.  we just have some really good marketers convincing everyone that it could never be done or would be too hard on Bezos or Musk.
Then all you have to do is vote them out..

I mean that's your argument, that we should all just DCA into the market regardless of the liquidity cycle. Okay, feel free to do so but I think I'll pass.

If you're such an expert, show me your gains.
If you knew how to get out with even just some loss, instead of being as stupid as a bunch of you, then it wouldn‚Äôt be that bad
That's my point, that's why beneficiaries have to contact the broker not the other way around.
Imagine thinking you'll ever have $100M in unrealized gains.
That's just a tax that happens regardless
Exactly. It's all just a slippery slope that leads to Democrats removing all the bathrooms and forcing you to shit in a litter box while antifa supersoldiers threaten your dog who is also your wife.
Yes, when the government can just take your private property, that's called tyranny..
Exactly. This guy gets it. Just like how they taxed 401ks when a crisis hit, and lowered the capital gains brackets so everything is taxed at 20%, and got rid of income tax brackets so everything is taxed at 37%. This is going to be no different.
If it was even $1 million 99.99% of traders here would be fine lmao
The absolute simplest proposal that would actually work would be a transaction tax. Automated trading accounts for a disproportionate amount of value extraction from the market these days.

Taxing unrealized gains is just going to make it that much worse.
What middle class person is making 100mill??
I highly doubt it would ever pass as it would cost congress too much personally.  It's mostly election cycle political swagger, counting on the poor to hate the rich enough to get more democratic votes.
It's the idea that the ultra-wealthy never really generate taxable events for themselves.  They just keep borrowing against the unrealized gains in their portfolio.

Basically this makes them "pre pay" their taxes on a regular basis instead of a giant lump sum much later...or never.

It's zero sum in theory, they don't actually pay more tax.
How is 100 million in unrealized gains upper middle class?
$99 gets you five minutes with the pig. No funny stuff, we've got cameras in there ever since David Cameron came through.

Yeah, that's pretty much the argument. And until I see some good data on people who try to do otherwise that out perform that strategy on a time horizon approaching retirement I don't really see your point.

What's your goal? If it's to retire in 30ish years, have you ever looked into the long term performance on that time scale of people who try to pursue active trading strategies? Sure, some people take the gambles and get super rich *especially in the short term*. And others VOO and chill for 30 years and can't retire, but *more* people who actively trade end up below the market on a long time period like that than otherwise. 

And if you have some data that tells you otherwise to give you confidence in your approach, id love to see it because I'm genuinely curious if I'm wrong on the subject.

At the end of the day you're probably more like the average investor than the exceptional skilled/lucky example person/fund you can come up with. And if you're saying you're going to spend all day researching what moves to make like professional investors do, you better put a cost on that time as well. Because my strategy requires about 2 hours a year of effort.

So is an unrealized gains tax in countries that have it in the form of a wealth tax.
I know some antifa supersoldiers and they've been making me shit in litter boxes for years while reciting the SCUM manifesto. It makes sense though, it really saves on the water bill.
But but but they have more than you so it‚Äôs ok to confiscate it.

The reaction in this sub has been priceless.

"Kamala is coming for my capital gains! Dems r stoopid!"

Bruh...you don't *have* unrealised capital gains. Now shut up and get my my baconator.
We should also have a Tobin tax/transaction tax, yes. But wealth accumulation is it's own, seperate problem. I just don't like limiting to unrealized cap gains because it ignores various offshore physical assets, etc.
What happens to someone‚Äôs shares of a company when the whales sell their stakes? What happens when nobody is there to buy their shares when they want to retire?

It‚Äôs a highly disruptive proposal that will impact all traders - not just wealthy capital holders.
"But muuh $142 in unrealized gainz"says the guy with 10k total   as their account is 20k in the red
Ah right. I forgot about that cap. That said, I still prefer the flat wealth tax option - if it's just cap gains, it's too easy to hide more of the wealth in physical assets. I'd also like something that deals with various trust loopholes. 

That said, the proposal is better than I remembered.
In 1913, the top bracket of federal income tax was maxed out at 6% for $500k in income ($16M in today's money). Only the top 3% paid any federal income tax. After exemptions, it was closer to 1% paid by the top 1%.

Forget traders, it will even impact people who have done nothing but show up to work 8-6 every day for 40+ years. Most private pensions are tied to the stock market. Imagine how someone would feel if they sacrificed their whole life and finally retire, ready to relax for the last few years before they become worm food‚Ä¶only to find their pension/retirement savings are worthless.
What you're saying is every single stock will collapse?
I agree with what you say for the most part.

It's just a shame one of the most important parts of the proposal gets hidden (usually on purpose) by others, but it even says it in the linked article.
Isn't appreciation of a physical asset also unrealized capital gains? You'd have to pay tax on that unrealized gain too.
If that‚Äôs what you gotta do, that‚Äôs what you gotta do. You don‚Äôt become a billionaire by being a dead peasant. You do it by owning conglomerates.
That‚Äôs the point‚Ä¶ It doesn‚Äôt affect the majority of us YET. Give it time.
They estimate your overall wealth and tax a percentage of it.
You report the stocks/funds that you hold on your tax return and their value at the end of the tax year?

I live in a country where we pay a wealth tax and it isn't super complicated. (Wealth tax means there is no capital gains tax.)
You say bags , I say unrealized losses.  Which line do I put that on?
No I‚Äôm saying that the vast majority will stagnate as the wealthy move their capital to vehicles that the normal person doesn‚Äôt have access to.

We‚Äôre already seeing the start of it - this proposal will simply accelerate the exit of capital from ‚Äútransparent‚Äù markets.
In my case, it's perils of being an ex-academic political economist. Sometimes I forget to triple-check because I've seen it before, many many times.
You have to realize how absolutely stupid it would be to just have a general unrealized capital gains tax.  Literally every person with a brain understands how stupid that would be and would never vote for it.

Even the proposed tax is kind of stupid imo and there are better proposals, but the idea that this proposed tax will somehow eventually reach the average american's stock portfolio is just braindead.  It's the stupidest kind of slippery slope argument.
At what % is what i was mainly fishing for

Felt like this advert belonged in this sub 
Yup, it's taking too long
2.5 years of algos development like a fulltime job and I feeling like my current one is THE ONE. 
Keeps me out of jail atleast
Is like the Kay and Peele gag where the plan to rob the bank is to get the job there
I think there‚Äôs also a perception out there that if your model/system can beat the market that you should be a millionaire by now, but no matter how good your system you‚Äôre still restrained by your starting capital! 

Hell say your system doubled your money every year and you started with a $10,000, it would take 8 years to cross the million dollar mark!
Buy low sell high they said
so, its not just me?
How I feel after 500 successful trades in back tests in 5sec, then couple of trades a week live zzzzzz üòÇ
I have been trading my "one" trading strategy that made all the other strategies look like a high cost of opportunity. 2 years and 3 months, 62% return, -21% MaxDD. SPY for the same period 7% return, -25% MaxDD, QQQ 12% return, -34% MaxDD.   
I thought that when I had accomplished something like that I was going to be millionaire the next day, but I also thought the same with the first backtest that felt like gold, so I am used to the deception and just keep going :D
I'm gonna be a millionaire!!! (in 10 years after hours of software development)
I have extensive expeirence with models, the biggest roller coaster for me is developing a working strategy, and then it stops working within 6 months, sometimes 3months. this is because of market conditions changing, I am at a point now where I remember the market conditions for certain strategies and think to myself, "I bet my XYZ system" would work well in this current market.
Just keep reading books until you put the pieces together.
I'm just getting started.... Oh god. üòÇ
But when you get the success once it continues for life
üòÇüòÇ
Yes it does! Lmfao‚Ä¶
Just had to add that if by backtest you mean your model works on past data that assumes the past predicts the market futures but it does not!  The market performs without regard to the past.  Read a "Random Walk Down Wall Street" to disuade you from this.
All my comments get blocked how do any of u talk freedom of speech my ass i hate tech im broke and it i could just get my audit over with get my taxes back my kids and i would be out of my moms house at 32 im just a g
Failure
Lol
skill issue
Crazy idea. What if we started sharing code among us. Then we could borrow from each others‚Äô libraries and get ‚Äúthere‚Äù faster. No strategy just scaffolding.
Been there for 4 years man. Every successful backtest is often followed by a huge gaping bug. Extreme highs and extreme lows. But hey, I also think my current one is the one. Thank god for paper trading showing more reality than anything else
[deleted]
My job is a prison
That‚Äôs really not a problem at all.
Now I understand...
Chasing a ghost üëª
what strat are you using? dm?
I've read random walk and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but if you wholeheartedly believe the message and the efficient market theory why are you even subscribed to this sub?
Probably is. I believe I may have started down the wrong path to start. My first view was tracking sentiment on Reddit/twitter to find someone who was more than 50% right. I tried removing those who resulted in negative losses. Overall could not find a pattern spend about 4 months on it.
Your turn to share first
Think of this reddit sub as an industry conference. People will share ideas. But don't expect anyone to share their business secrets and formulas.
Let me introduce you to Github....
There are a number of open source trading bots already out there, not to mention hundreds of libraries to help with strategy building. I use pandas heavily.
Paper trading has me as a millionaire. Reality does not agree.
Sometimes I wonder how many of my unsuccessful backtests also had bugs, and would otherwise have been successful.
If I do make real tendies, I will post in this forum.
Get a different job or better yet make your own job, that is start a business.  Life is too short to waste on a bad job.
I guess my point is ‚Äúquick‚Äù is relative - even in the best case scenario (literal fantasy) it would still take years.
It is if you're trying to get rich quick
The variance on the probability of a single anonymous person picking the right direction would be way too high to generate any meaningful returns.
it's easy to be right more than 50% of the time, but it's hard to have favorable odds that allow you to generate any meaningful returns over a long period of time. for example, your strategy could be to sell deep otm 0dtes. sure, you'll have a high winrate, but one loss could obliterate your entire account.
*not yet
Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that
üéØ
What do you mean? Obviously there could be a mistake in someone‚Äôs code that makes their backtest look worse than it really is.
Big loss due to coding error
Early this month I had a coding error in a safety feature. The feature checks if there are open positions and closes them; however, I was running on multiple threads. So I had this ballooning position just opening and closing every minute during a volatile period. I ended up losing over 40k.
This is a relatively new system I've been running since December. Luckily, I was up 200k for the year until the loss. I was slightly on tilt the nextday, and upped my risk, which resulted in another 13k loss... I'm not on tilt anymore.

Anyone else lose/win due to dumb coding errors?
I once doubled my tiny starter account due to a bug that over leveraged my account during a ride up, all while I slept.

Good bug, bummed I had to fix it
When I wrote my first bot like 3 years ago I somehow flipped the buy/sell signals (go short on buy, go long on sell) and lost a couple hundo in like 15 mins
Sounds like you're ready for Knight Capital.
Lucky it wasn't a 440 million dollar bug :)

https://www.henricodolfing.com/2019/06/project-failure-case-study-knight-capital.html?m=1

(The classic example of why you don't run unsupervised trading without a dumb-and-reliable-as-a-rock killswitch)
The very first time I turned on a bot, it was trading Bitcoin in 2015. It happily alternated buy and sell orders like a machine gun, losing the spread (of fortunately only a penny) every pair of trades.
I'm using yfinance. It takes some time to update open quotes when the market opens. I figured the tickers which are yet to update appear with nulls, so I dropped all na values. But apparently some values which are yet to update appear with yesterday's quotes. Lost couple hundred bucks on this error, nothing major, but still
I use single thread for each trade. Different threads for different stocks and algos to avoid the problem op had.

I had a bug once where broker returned error and did not generate order id on sell order ( broker issue) but the order was going through.
So i ended up short selling the stock continuously till balance was 0 and broker was throwing exception.
I use discord to deliver fail switch  which turned off the algo.
Broker did support acceptance of unique id for individual order which i wasn‚Äôt using earlier(broker will not accept order with same unique id if already accepted). Hard lesson learned.
What language are you using? 

If I were you I would keep the data for when this happened and write an integration test around this bug.
Lmao this exact thing happened to me yesterday, I have some cool down code on mine that waits 5 minutes before entering another trade. 

It made a trade within 2 minutes of the last and I was going what in the world is going on. It shouldn't be doing that. So I moved a couple things around and stupidly pushed to production... It completely removed my safety, 12 trades just opening and closing within a matter of two seconds and left me with a big position in the wrong direction. 

Luckily it was on a forward testing account, I won't be making that mistake again.

My problem was that I was thinking the code was in seconds so I was multiplying by 60 and 5 to get five minutes. I took another look at the coding resources and it was in MILLISECONDS. Doi! So that was my original problem, everything fixed and the cool down has been reinserted in the correct place. 

The worst thing for me is just creating an anomaly in my data, but that's ok, that's why we test.

Since it was in a paper account though it was honestly hilarious hearing all of those orders go out. Sorry to hear that you actually suffered some damage from what happened with you. 


For you, I'm not sure exactly what happened but I have two safeguards related to stop losses. I try to have a limit but I also have a contingency that says if the price is a certain amount PAST my stop limit then cancel the stop limit and place a stop market. That way even though it may be a little more painful I'm making sure that orders are closing out. That at least saved me with the position size being too big, but the loss was way bigger than it should've been.

Maybe something to consider.
A simple way to prevent/limit such cases: activate a broker side max loss. That handles such cases very effectively.

Many algo traders have had these errors - and they will always sound incredibly dumb to discretionary traders :)
Up 200k since December? Jesus wtf am I doing wrong lol
Hey AngerSharks1, 

I feel your pain. I lost 19k while I slept a few months ago. I was surprised how unemotional I was about it. The only thing I cared about was identifying the problem and fixing it. It had back tested with replay data for two years. 

  
Since there are many here spending a great deal of time in the pursuit of a profitable algo would you be willing to share the basic premise of your strategy with us?  Enough for those who are truly dedicated to algo development might reconstruct your strategy in their own algo/platform etc. 

Thank you for sharing your "lost (money) and found (fix)" story with us in any case. It's good for many here including myself to hear the good and the bad in algo coding. 

  
:-)
Had a few issues like this when I was first developing my bot.  Ended up setting up a simple website that displays a lot of metrics that update in real time.  Being able to see all open buys/sells and recent fills really helped me catch new issues within minutes of them occurring.

Best part was that the website itself only took me 2 or so hours to fully setup.  Socket.io made it so easy to send data from the bot to the web server and then to the webpage.  Sure the site isn‚Äôt pretty, but I‚Äôm the only one who sees it so I don‚Äôt really care.
When you are making 200k, you didn‚Äôt post to share tips on how to help others. But when you lose, you ask for help. üòÇ
Do you have a background in programming? There is a semaphore object you can use to prevent that. You should look into async for algo trading it's a lot safer then using threads and can be used to solve io bounding.
*Always have 100% visibility open positions and orders*  And testing asyncs and multithreaded, you really have to focus.

(manual trading but ... ) somebody i know was trading aggresive size on a FOMC type day when he was interrupted by a family call and drove away for 20 minutes.  When he came back, forgotten  position down $68k.
ah misery loves company. sorry man, sucks.
I have considered adding some kind of protection against catastrophic failure. Something like ‚Äúclose all positions and stop trading, if dd is more than 20% in the last 8 hours‚Äù. Anyone having similar mechanisms?
What platform do you use for your algo?
No bots live yet, but a question for you. Before you put your bot live, were you not coming up with failure modes (either actually happening ones or dreamy up ones) and programming around that?
Don't forget Knight Capital. One little coding mistake lost them $440 million in an hour.


https://www.henricodolfing.com/2019/06/project-failure-case-study-knight-capital.html
Hindsight is always 20/20, truer words were never spoken. But yes, always keep some sort of stop-loss to protect yourself. The most simple risk-management we can do.
When moving from paper trading to live, I find my code has millions of tiny errors that only come up when actually trading and I only find given enough time, since I'm swing trading. It makes me want to switch from python to typescript
good learning opportunity in two ways (coding and being on tilt), so you're ahead.
I think what you said is good, I think you're absolutely right, the code written by humans is unreliable because humans always make mistakes, but machines don't. If code can be generated through visualization tools, the error rate will be reduced to a very low level, or even no errors at all. Here I would like to recommend a tool I developed,¬†[Pineify](https://pineify.app/?utm_medium=reddit)¬†, a pinescript indicator visualization editor.
Dam I would write so many tests on prod code and use ci/cd..do ppl here really just write scripts and run it live?
Sorry this is not related to your post. You got any tips for the newbies like on where to focus first or any general tips. Cheers
All the time.

Less of a bug and more of realizing the real world effect. Running a momentum strategy but changed the time period to reduce compute for other strategies, not realizing that would drastically change +200 positions at market open. Slippage was about 1% of the portfolio.
Ouch thats a lot of money to lose. What was the error if you dont mind me asking?
Honestly I think when most of us here have big losses,  they are due to coding features, not errors. Self included.

Also, 200k YTD?

https://youtu.be/7NxQXJhgwTY?si=q357AWbvPhFcWP5N
Not to judge but looks like a case where a mistake of manual trading (reason why automate used is not to get emotional and same emotion is coded or change in code in edge cases) bug might not be a technical term since it looks like a miss in coding a case then unusual behaviuourby a unsupervised ML alogo...do u mind giving more details of your analysis of why this loss might have happened?
*knight capital group has entered the chat*
Dumb question. What brokerage do you use that allows API trades?
Welcome to the mutex lock
I was planning on running integration tests on my system before running but this reminded me I need to also test race conditions. Really sorry to hear that
You're not alone. Add tests to your code.
Have you considered testing it?
I wish I could write such a program!
Happened few times for me. Now before release of major update testing it firstly on demo account for a week.
lol, thats too bad
Happened to me lol
Tough L - I think its best to back test this on a live paper trading account to avoid this and then move over to real money
Losses and gains are our life :)
Just last week I found a bug in my latest algo where the trailing SL was not getting updated properly. End result was very low profit for few weeks.
yes, forgot to fixate the sell price, so the bot was chasing the current price more and more into loss. Luckily it was still in the testing mode and lost only like hundred bucks
This is a fear every time I make an update...  I also worry about the robot getting duped by flash deviations from the fair-market price.  

Should probably have more circuit-breakers installed, but I do want the program to keep running when the market is acting crazy.
What strategy are you running to make 200k/year ?
Would love some tips and advices, I m making 0$ üò≠
I‚Äôve lost a lot of money due to weak risk management and silly coding errors. You‚Äôll bounce back in no time, cheers
What language are you using to code?
What advice do you have for an economist/mathematician that has backtested and live paper traded a python scripted bot that hasnt lost on any backtest starting at the dotcom bubble, as well, every daily call options trade in over a month?
You didn't see this in paper trading?
So you were just missing a lock, it sounds like? I know Python doesn‚Äôt have true parallelism so that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue in Python concurrency?
Sounds like a feature
Best kind of bug.
Bed Bug
Bro ..  Definitely a feature
A heads or tails bug
Any causality there?
The amnt of regulation now in place because of those 12 minutes is insane.
Thank you for posting that link; I never knew the back story to that event.
There is a lot of great info to glean from this piece, thanks for posting!  My last gig in software used all of the recommended devops practices with continuous delivery and every team was full stack including test and deployment automation engineering.  Essential for a large and distributed workforce but also worth it for our little bespoke algo trading ops.
Does yfinance now work normally? Late last year I was trying to use it for some projects but yahoo had apparently blocked it from working.
What broker were you using?
What does forward testing mean? Sorry, im new to this field and finding my feet.
You dont know if that person leveraged their entire mortgage and childrens education fund on a 100x leverage bitcoin etf or is playing with 200m of company money and is underperforming
Don‚Äôt believe everything on the internet lol. OPs account has had 5 post in 10 years and off the sudden he posts with an unbelievable story. 

We‚Äôre seeing this on all subs. A dormant account posts a self story that isn‚Äôt likely and then asks the community for their stories. Easy way to fake karma
What if someone had a 99.9999% successful algorithm. If it took them years of research and patience to realize it but cant run it themselves with real money, how can they share that revelation? Sharing that formula could simply be used by someone else to get rich and the founder being left out.
Yeah, I've been meaning to do this, maybe just a simple streamlit dashboard.
Not for help, the problem is fixed. Just to make people aware that there are issues that arise that aren't accounted for on back tests. I have been fortunate and am actually up for the month now despite the loss.
You dont have to worry its plainly obvious you cant be helped anyway
Schedule a function that periodically checks your balance every T amount of time, if things start going south, you liquidate all open positions and stop the bot, and you can even send a notification to yourself.
I trade futures and, for some reason, decided to build out the application using FIX APi.
Yeah, I didn't do a good job with unit tests. I guess it took me a loss to take it serious. Been just rushing to productionalize, expand and research.
How many lines of code does your python script use?
Yeah dumb over confidence.
Most common brokers have APIs
Sorry, that just sounds like you have a data leak. But if your live paper trading is going well, then launch, you'll find out soon enough. Best of luck.
Public void doubleMoney(double scrilla)
Cause: wrote bad software.
Effect: lost $200 in 15 mins lol
Alpaca
Nah you're good. It's just testing it on a live paper trading account.
Not dormant, just a lurker. But you're right, don't believe everything you read. It's taken me years of work to get where im at. And I don't claim I can help anyone reach profitability. Just keep at it, learn, it takes time. I clearly have more to learn.
Makes me feel better about my 50 000% yearly return strategy that is only profitable in back tests ü•≤
Yea you are so helpful that you have to make 3 same posts on the same sub. Thanks for being so ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù.
This is the last resort safe guard against catastrophic errors, you should also have stop loss, and other risk management strategies, on each trade level!
 Nice. How long was it in development before it was profitable? I also trade futures, currently have a bitcoin bot using TradingView but considering NinjaTrader for chart trading and a futures algo. Or quantconnect. I‚Äôm a lot more comfortable with python (do it for work)
Unit tests usually don't help with races that you see in multi-thread code.  It's a lot easier to put your risk checks in a spinpock-protected object that gives a dumb but fast response.
I dont do unit tests as well (am eager to get my theory implemented so I can do functional tests. But, I will functional test for long time and through different conditions.
About 4000, including various utils and manual functions.  
But I already went ahead and rewrote it in Typescript (excluding the number crunching), which resulted in about 2000 lines. Goodbye errors.
Sounds like some great software once you fixed that bug. Which islands are you planning to buy?
Did you reach out to alpaca? How did they respond. It makes sense to handle it, but it also shouldn‚Äôt be possible. If they are telling you they didn‚Äôt make a trade and they did, they should be covering it in my opinion.
What do you trade
They were "auto deleted." I guess they posted when I hit some quota. Quit being so salty guy.
Is tradeview free to start? I want to see if there is any alternative.

I have been using alpaca + TD and python.
Dint bother coz i din‚Äôt have a big loss.
It was a grey area where it was throwing exception and not saying that they dint make the trade. ( can‚Äôt remember the exception)
At the same time, i agree with you as it‚Äôs not like they said that they did make the trade
Well I‚Äôm glad you asked, join my trading discord and for a small monthly fee I will teach you how to be successful!
Lmao they hate you cause you making stacks and they ain't doing shit
Just have a net worth of 50mil and buy VOO
CrowdStrike is not worth 83 Billion Dollars
**Thesis**: Crowdstrike is not worth 93 billion dollars (at time of writing).


**Fear**: CrowdStrike is an enterprise-grade employee spying app masquerading as a cloud application observability dashboard.


**OBSERVATIONS**

* The 75th percentile retail investor has a tenuous grasp on ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù, ‚ÄúSoftware Engineering‚Äù, and ‚ÄúCyber Security‚Äù.
* The median ‚ÄúCyber Security Analyst‚Äù has a tenuous grasp on ‚ÄúCyber Security‚Äù
* The median ‚ÄúSoftware Engineer‚Äù has a tenuous grasp on ‚ÄúCyber Security‚Äù and ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù
* The median retail investor has a tenuous grasp on ‚Äúmarkets‚Äù and ‚Äúliquidity pools‚Äù
 


**CRITIQUES**

* Corporations could buy CrowdStrike to spy on their own employees.

* CrowdStrike‚Äôs utility is limited- they simply collect all of their customer‚Äôs data and display it on a dashboard. 
* CrowdStrike is dangerous in that they have root access to every device(i.e. endpoint) across thousands of firms.
* CrowdStrike customers sign up to get their firm‚Äôs data added to a bank which CrowdStrike then has license to use for ‚Äúcorrelation‚Äù
* CrowdStrike is a sitting-duck datamine for the FBI/NSA to subpoena. 
* CrowdStrike could potentially behave as a propaganda arm of the US government by creating ‚Äúfake hacking stories‚Äù which are un-disprovable.They are able to do this due to information asymmetries in society.
* Properly built ‚Äúcloud applications‚Äù have security baked in by virtue of separation of concerns in the "software supply chain". (e.g. containerization engine developer is different than the OS developer is different than the Cloud Infrastructure Provider). 
* CrowdStrike‚Äôs Falcon product contradicts their own guiding principle of ‚ÄúZero-Trust Security‚Äù.


**COMMENTARY**

* CrowdStrike‚Äôs product includes a ‚Äúclient‚Äù which runs on every "customer endpoint‚Äù (i.e. company issued laptop). Activity on the company issued laptop is reported to an internal dashboard which only an IT guy + a C-Suite admin have access to. They ALSO offer observability into each component of a business‚Äôs own ‚Äúcloud application‚Äù.
* These are 100% different lines of business which can be easily conflated.
* CrowdStrike admits that they collect all of a business‚Äô ‚Äúendpoint data'' and they compare it to other data they have to "draw insights"; this means that every company that hires CrowdStrike is part of a DATA COMMUNE.
* It‚Äôs prohibitively hard to hack into a ‚Äúcloud system‚Äù due to few possible entry points
* Exfiltrating data at scale is difficult; employees of the company pose a bigger threat than "threat-actors".
* *Containerize Everything* + *Microservices Architecture* hampers "lateral movement". 
* Is CrowdStrike compatible with companies that run their IT systems on premises?






*The CrowdStrike Story So Far‚Ä¶*



**2020**

* ‚ÄúUses cloud technology to detect and thwart attempted cybersecurity breaches‚Äù

* ‚ÄúRuns on your endpoint or server or workload‚Äù

* ‚ÄúSignature based technologies don‚Äôt go far enough‚Äù

* ‚ÄúWe collect trillions of events‚Äù 

* ‚ÄúThere hasn‚Äôt been a salesforce of security‚Äù 

‚Äî  FAST FORWARD ‚Äî 

**2024**

* Palo Alto Networks(100% different business line) is being pitted against CrowdStrike in the media. 
* Crowdstrike allegedly offers a poorly differentiated suite of generically titled products: **(Falcon Discover, Falcon Spotlight, Falcon Prevent, Falcon Horizon, Falcon Insight(EDR), Falcon Insight(XDR), Falcon Overwatch, Falcon Complete(MDR), Falcon Cloud Security)**. There is no way to confirm unless you schedule a meeting with their team though.
* I spoke to a ‚ÄúNetwork Engineer‚Äù at CrowdStrike. He said that he ‚Äúmostly tries to get bug bounties‚Äù. 
* ‚ÄúCrowdStrike —Åustomers: 44 of 100 Fortune 100 companies, 37 of 100 top global companies, 9 of 20 major banks & 7 of the TOP 10 largest energy institutions.‚Äù  This makes it a threat vector.

The fact that crowdstrike just took out half the internet shortly after this post is hilarious
Dude, you got in at the perfect time.  Crowd strike is currently having a worldwide issue. ALL systems are affected, in a reboot cycle, affecting all organizations currently.
Wait OP is a genius‚Ä¶ the timing
Global Crowd strike outage you couldn't make this up lol
[removed]
Yeah, you‚Äôre getting a visit from the Fed. Congrats on the Lambo though
Plot twist: OP is the CrowdStrike employee that rolled out the update.
OP, did you cause the Crowdstrike global BSOD by pushing bad updates?
This is one of the best timed posts I have seen on this page, and I have been here a while!
This aged perfectly
Crowdstrike just f\*d our company computers and we're not alone. Last patch is causing blue screen loops on 500 PCs and my partners company is impacted too. SHORT THIS STOCK NOW.
OP how much money did you make with this prediction?  Beers on you.

OP bout to hit it big. Crowdstrike has cause major outages in Australia right now üòÇ
Well someone is about to be rich.


Crowdstrike just BSOD'd all of their customers.

I repeat, the crowdstrike agent has just crippled infrastructure around the world.


Sell if you can.

Trade on it in whatever way you can.

This will be huge news shortly.

Good ltoo.


UPDATE: 
This is so much worse than it sounds.

This isn't something that CRWD or anyone else can "push" a fix for.

 It is IT labor intensive without a lot of prior, specific automation investment.

There is no quick recovery from this outage.

Every WFH staff with this agent installed is bricked until they recover bitlocker key, safe boot, delete a driver file in system dir etc.

Biggest PITA outage in a while.

Not trivial at all for these companies to fully mitigate the impact without super strong out of band management automation, which IMHO 95% of fortune 500s just don't have.

This is going to cost most CRWD customers 12+ hours of downtime, scaling in an awful way.
You had good DD on Snow and now this. You‚Äôre almost a god here. Messiah. Lisan al gairegard.
This isn't DD this is evidence
Hall of fame wsb post
SEC, investigate this man.
He crashed computers worldwide so his 5 puts can print
This must be the most fortunately ( maybe unfortunately) timed post in the history of Reddit
This post aged like the finest of wine
Lmao everyone going 'oh Crowdstrike is so great, you're regarded' owes OP a huge apology. Global Crowdstrike outage is causing mayhem, bluescreens...
Lol [https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vx6n/crowdstrike\_bsod/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vx6n/crowdstrike_bsod/)
My brother, you are as lucky as the guys at Crowdstrike are unlucky. I am on call and our company is fucked at the moment. VPN wont work and people who use AT&T are double fucked, they cant even get on a call to discuss what's broken.
Everyone gave this guy shit for this post, but he trusted his gut in an industry dictated by gut feelings and emotions and he made it big because of it. Everyone else just shit on him and sat around waiting for someone to write them a novel clearly outlining the big play to make. His gut told him this company wasn't worth shit and he couldn't figure out why exactly but he still went with it all the way and made out a killing.
bro is the new roaring kitty
Did you hacked crowdstrike?
holy shit this was the worst DD I've ever seen but you are going to crush it on the outage
If this was randomly timed, bad luck, you might face some heat for your incredibly sus timing lmao
OP are you a fucking wizard?
OP is a fucking fortune teller.
OP literally broke the inverse wsb curse. Mad man.

Lmao the timing is immaculate
We found the crowdstrike employee who fucked up the C-00000291*.sys file and gave blue screens
Holy shit, are you a time traveler or sth
This man saw the future.
I was here
Talk about good timing, Crowdstrike just took down millions of Windows PC/Servers with their latest update, this is a global outage that will have major consequences.  Not just a simple outage of the product, but the blue screen of death being displayed on those servers/computers rendering them virtually useless.
bro is about to be rich
Every single one of these DD‚Äôs get shit on in the comments lmao
Lisan Al Ghaib, show us the way
Enjoy your date with the SEC, OP!
You son of a bitch.

You are right for all the wrong reasons. Lady gambling is on your side in this one.
This is the dumbest post I‚Äôve seen and definitely written by someone who doesn‚Äôt know the product. I use it daily and it is unmatched

Edit: 
I‚Äôm not deleting this lol even with the shit going on. The guys regarded but gonna be a rich regard tomorrow
Have you actually seen the platform in action? Cause I can tell you its a powerful security tool and not some lame spyware for management. Not saying you're entire DD is off base but you're reaching on that part
This aged well‚Ä¶worldwide Windows outage caused by potential Crowdstrike update
lmao crowdstrike is down
This post had a brilliant timing, I hope OP had all the puts https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41002195
You are a genius!

Major worldwide tech outage from US cyber security company CrowdStrike plunges world's largest companies into chaos, grounds flights and prevents broadcasters from publishing news

dammn congrats lol!
What did OP know??
This isn't DD this is evidence
*SEC has joined the chat*
Ooof, they just DDOSd their whole customer base
OP is a seer...
Well well‚Ä¶ How the turn-tables
As it was written‚Ä¶.Those who follow him shall be led to tendies.
lol they just caused a major outage across Australia
I use CrowdStrike every day for work in cyber security, and have used their platform specifically for almost a decade. The number of things you have totally pulled out of your ass in this post is higher than their market cap. You have no grasp on this entire subject matter.

I have no opinion on the value of the company itself.

Edit: ü´£
OP is a genuine prophet of our times
Bro you‚Äôre gonna get investigated
Crowdstrike seems to be causing worldwide blue screens at companies that use it. If this hits the news....
Fuckin hell... the chances are so, so very small. Bravo.
GODLY PRECOGNITION I KNEEL
it's been overvalued (forward PE > 70) for a while... it however the best in the industry so don't bet too hard against it
Lol this is the dumbest write up I've ever seen, but CS just had a huge incident (go look in r/crowdstrike) and is going to crash in the morning.

The timing of this post though...lmao
I can‚Äôt help but double comment. ‚ÄúMasquerading as a cloud app observability dashboard‚Äù. So wrong. It‚Äôs an antivirus and EDR. To detect, you must see. So observability is a byproduct of monitoring, detecting, and preventing. 

Your put may be right, your analysis is fucked.
There‚Äôs an ongoing global issue with crowdstrike software happening on multiple client companies‚Äô PCs.
You called it with that single pint of failure good sir, lmao
No way Crowd Strike caused a global outage 10 hours after this post was made.
> CrowdStrike is dangerous in that they have root access to every device(i.e. endpoint) across thousands of firms.

> CrowdStrike‚Äôs Falcon product contradicts their own guiding principle of ‚ÄúZero-Trust Security‚Äù.

Based and true.

I was asked to install this garbage dogshit on our Windows EC2s. Told them why the fuck we need this shit.

Now look what happened.
This post couldn't be more perfect lmao
Lol
Love the replies given what‚Äôs happened today. üòÇ
holy fuck, big fomo from me bois
Congrats on retirement OP
I can‚Äôt wait till everyone wakes up
This man is a genius! Maybe even Jesus! The top voted comments from 2hours back look sooo bad right nowüòÇ
This is a WILD ass post considering the timing good lord.
Crowdstike took down our entire health system. All patient visits and surgeries are being canceled (but can‚Äôt reach them bc the messaging system is down as well). Doors have to be manually opened. Oh man.
This is breaking in Australia and NZ right now, slow to get the news out as most people's computers are down. 

I just like watching you Regards, never traded but seems like a good time to short Crowd
Strike?

Post aged like fine wine
I work in a hospital, this not at at all an exaggeration to say people will die because of this outage.
quickly tell us your next play
Lolol he tried to warn us
Regard so regarded he manages to change reality to suit him. WSB god king
Should tag every smug mfer berating OP earlier as a "dumdum".
OP is the reason windows is fucked. He pushed something shit a bug, bought puts , insider trading fuckin ass called the DD and yolo
This is fucking hilariously wrong. Lmao what are you smoking I want some.

Edit: This post is still equivalent to saying Kellogg puts dead cats in their cereal levels of wrong DD, but even I have to commend the rain man-ness of the post and just how epic this fuck up from CS is.

I'll take the L. Cheers lol.
this is some of the most deranged shit I have read in a while. love this sub
You state it‚Äôs not worth 83 billion dollars then spew some gibberish without stating a single thing about their balance sheet.

44 out of the 100, fortune 100 companies use it, so almost half of the biggest companies in the world revenue wise use it? 

You sir are a true regard. I was going to sell my Sept calls but fuck that.

Edit: I had a GUH moment when I woke up. See you all at Wendy‚Äôs.
lol. lmao, even
The SEC and FBI will probably knock your door soon ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
OP crashed the internet
This guy just hit the luck lottery. An hour later and crowdstrike shits down systems globally‚Ä¶.
SEC (if you still exist after today), this man right here
Holy shit everyone ate their fucking words today.

This is when you learn that anyone who talks so sure of themselves is a fucking doofus
‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Calls it is.
Bro is about to be a legend
You‚Äôre an absolute legend, pal. Couldn‚Äôt have been any more wrong, yet you hit a home run. Please post profits this morning.

Good luck, man. Enjoy the CRWD bloodbath today.
Reading these comments before the crashes seems like the I.T. equivalent of referring to the Titanic as unsinkable.
The timing of the post, magnificent
This is a historic moment in this sub
**Who else came straight here** ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
Let me solve the lack of knowledge about the cloud. It is simply a fancy name for someone else's computer.
CRWD doesn't even have a P/E and is valued at 80B+ haha monkey market.
Whoa the timing on this! You're about to hit the jackpot, OP.
Crowdstrike just released an update that is BSODing devices all over the world. Shit is a mess right now. It's tearing up computers and bringing everything down. 

I suspect a red day today. Lol
you're gunna be rich!
This guy struck gold!!!

OP pulled the plug üíÄ

A global IT outage is happening on Windows systems due to a CrowdStrike update. 
This coupled with the financial statements means things are not looking good for CrowdStrike.
Crowdstrike down around the world, wow

You just earned yourself a ticket to the HoF when u retire üî•
I‚Äôm a doctor in computer science and cyber security and OP is regarded. (I am not, I was paid by $CRWD to post this)
Crowdstrike is causing outages worldwide as of an hour or so ago. Sell, mortimer, sell.

I think OP just earnt themselves a flair‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Damn you had good timing on this post, last night a cloud strike update on the client side started Blue Screen of deathing millions of servers and workstations worldwide

Bro hope you loaded up on puts. Crowdstrike bricking pcs worldwide. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|52627)

Many regards worldwide still running Windows in a business settings. That was the shock for me.
OP, please post more DD. I will forever worship the ground that you walk on.

Here for all the edits on the comments originally criticising this post. ü§≠
Everyone saying OP is right for the wrong reasons can‚Äôt read. The correct reasons are there. Root access across thousands of firms, threat vector, list of customers, etc..
This is the most random fucking DD to insta-hit. Too bad he only put down like 4K.
The absolute fucking audacity of this timeline.
Feds probably waiting outside dudes house rn there‚Äôs no way
I thought the Skynet will take our civilization down with massive atomic bombing and heroic fight of humanity against machines, but naw, it would be a crowdstrike and their useless bloatware which accidentally destroys an IT systems in a planetary scale... so pathetic...
one is deemed crazy until right, then they call you genius
this is not real life anymore lol
this might be the best timed post of all time
Suspiciously well timed post. Dude probably works for CRWD and caught wind of the bugged software update before it happened.
BlackRock is the top shareholder of CrowdStrike‚Ä¶ nothing to see here
be honest, did you know smthn beforehand? üò≠
Get this man protection IMMEDIATELY.

I hope OP banked on this call. This might be the most incredible post of all time üòÇ
FBI be investigating the origin, timing and rationale behind this post.
Croudstrike has [their hands in AI](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/crowdstrikes-generative-ai-to-revolutionize-cybersecurity) too. Can't wait to see what their AI can do.
The timing on this is unreal.
Historically speaking, cybersecurity firm had done more damage to the business they are supposed to protect than all the hackers combined. McAfee did that in 2010, and now Crowdstrike. There hasn't been any hackers that caused this kind of wide-spread disruptions.
hilarious or intended
Internet outage. Priced in.
im geeked üíÄ
Timing too sus, pretty sure OP caused it
OP tells us Crowdstrike is a threat vector.
A few hours later, every computer on the world with the Crowdstrike client installed goes blue screen.
The single biggest global PC system collapse in history.
Just uncanny. Have my upvote, genius.
I know right. I want to know who has shorts on crowdstrike
OP needs to go into hiding. Fr what are the chances
OP being hunted by regards from WSB as we speak for more DD and advice
They told me it‚Äôs impossible to time the market‚Ä¶
I went to sleep last night reading a bunch of comments from the whole lot of you calling him regarded and that he has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about. 

Then I wake up and read this company single handedly crashed the world. 

This is going to go down in WSB history.
"This makes it a threat vector."

uh... OP whatcha been up to today?
Exactly.. Need to see who purchased shorts after this thread!
I hope OP loaded up on Puts yesterday because today he is getting paid ü§ëü§ëü§ë
Yep, this OP is wrong about everything in the DD but then this happens!

Lambo? Dude had the most unreal timed DD, and had 6 contracts that were leaps. He‚Äôd be lucky if they did more than 5x
OP is an intern and realized the truth!
...and has a friend who shorted the stock price!
As I've gotten further up the ladder, I'm basically seeing how it's more difficult to _not_ have information you shouldn't be trading against. Before this last rout, it was extremely clear one was going to happen due to the laws regarding this stuff. It's basically a paint by numbers of the market. 

The thesis is wrong though, the company is clearly worth that much to have this much impact across the planet.

He would have gotten much shorter expirations for that
OP is jesus himself
There's a meme on reddit posting about celebrities before they die - this is the first time I've seen someone post about a company before they died!
The FBI will be waiting for him once their systems are up and running haha
Op is a time traveler
looks to be a global issue impacting windows PC's from their latest update.
Can confirm, crowdstrike broke half of the world with that update.
This company will be delisted by the end of the year
Looks like Japans also heavily impacted
Current bid/ask on that contract is 10.30/14.30.¬†up an additional \~$3500 on that position from when he posted. Unfortunately he's holding relatively few contracts, expiring quite far out, at an extremely low price. If he'd been more aggressive he might be rich.

He is the chosen one

Can't get hacked if CrowdStrike bricks your computer. It's not a bug, but a feature regards. 

No, but seriously, Falcon is a great product. This outage doesn't change that.
some disgruntled dude who works there prob borked it lol

I actually lol‚Äôd at the ‚Äúcloud being prohibitively hard to hack into due to few entry points‚Äù part.
As stupid as the OP has proven himself to be in terms of knowledge of cybersecurity with this utterly bullshit DD, there's a huge emerging update issue with Crowd Strike that's blue screening hundreds of servers and PCs as we speak.

Someone needs to check if OP is a Crowdstrike developer, otherwise this is the pinnacle of WSB regarded plays

37% of Global 100 companies PAY CRWD
45% of major banks PAY CRWD
70% of the top energy companies PAY CRWD
This post is fucking super weird. This is evidence. Like how odd is this post and this happens.
So... how are your calls doing?
Is it l this copypasta?
Aged like milk
Jesus christ I hope you didn't call
His opinion is indeed highly regarded. He doesn‚Äôt even understand any of the technology or tools he‚Äôs listing!
Let‚Äôs see that position
How are those calls working out for you
Or unless CS nuke all their customers. 

Oh wait...
It's like you 100% accurately foresaw this as well
I think we can expect the entire company to fold
this is about to be very correct prognosis but for no reason mentioned in the above post
ngl, it should be trivial to restart every endpoint immediately, right?
lmfao the current market value of my position is only ~$4,000. I have a $1,000 buy queued for puts expiring on 7/26, but who knows if it will go through
looks like it met its match
Oof, the timing on this post... I get it regarding the capabilities, but the BSOD boot loop is gonna be quite a ding on their name.

Be careful systems are blue screening all over due to a faultY CS update.
OP was certainly not wrong on the valuation at least.
Not using them today.
touch grass
man is a millionaire now
This is the most Reddit comment ever. Calling OP hilariously wrong and making fun of them when they were completely correct the whole time
Looks like they had the good shit.
Do you love it more now?
OP killed the internet to prove his point
44 of the 100 are now screwed
Used it.
Or is it $93 billion? $10 billion increase from writing the title to writing the first bullet. Straight to the moon it is.

Even if he didn't cause it he will be talking to the FBI soon.
OP is the engineer that pushed the update.
*places tinfoil hat on head* Or he knew and concocted this whole cover story to evade the SEC.
Goddamn, there are truly autistic apes here seeing the future like minority report
They must be having a very good day LOL
Op and his mom
OP is the Crowdstrike employee that caused this
Iconic
I wanna be in the screenshot when the news calls us a bunch of animals and other names again!
Man I was reading that post yesterday because I didn‚Äôt understand what crowdstrike actually did and how their security was allegedly better than everyone else, reading OPs post I was thinking he was probably right. Usually the simplest answer is the closest to the truth so of course these companies just give root access üòÇüòÇüòÇ

ü§£
Fending off NSA job offers and FBI investigators no doubt
The thing is what op said is known in the industry. 

The issue is people making us install this garbage because they are convinced to. 

I never wanted it on my servers. It's stupid. 

Before this outage I already had it crashing my systems. 

The point of an endpoint protection software is to reduce risk. Not increase it
> "This makes it a threat vector."

Dawg, I was telling our "security" folks at work that when they forced Crowdstrike down everyone's throats at my work. 

Any anti-virus software that is made by anyone that is not the OS manufacturer has more opportunity to be malware than something useful.
Pray for my puts
Natural instinct is to inverse wsb...
given the payment service works
> because today he is getting paid 

Once the BSODs are fixed.
only 5 contracts
Lmao he hacked them or soomething, 


there's no way the timing of this crazy post aligns perfectly with the biggest sysadmin fuck up of the year
> CrowdStrike is dangerous in that they have root access to every device(i.e. endpoint) across thousands of firms.

He was right about that
OP must be the intern that did the final push of the .sys file that ducked falcon Crowdstrike globally, no other explanation for the timing, the wrong points and statements made were done just to not blow up his cover ü§®
Hes not wrong just a time traveler coming in just a wee bit early!
OP's puts are a year out for 185. Company is still trading at ~300 - it could definitely go down further, but they're not quite in the clear yet.
üò≠
Lisan Al Ghaib ü´°
This is the answer.
& As It Was Foretold
He doesn‚Äôt have to hold until expiration. Over a year has a lot of time value and not much decay
Revenge of the interns!!!!
And this post is a cover story to explain to the feds why they were shorting so much, so shortly before :P

Haha.
Congratulations and fuck you
You should delete this and disappear if you work there
Fucking legend
How much money would you make if you sold now?
This comment is too funny to be buried down here.
On the flip side of this, OP can't even flee the country because all airlines are grounded lmao
omglol
OP about to get a visit from some top secret alphabet agency.
OP is the developer who pushed the update.
Just came into the office, not in America, and same issue. Many blue screens, but not all
Not windows update related, it is entirely crowdstrike
Literally an hour before the Tokyo stock exchange closed.

I wonder how Hong Kong is doing.
OP is the literal definition of a broken clock is right twice a day.
And $185p too on a $330 stock.

At this point OP is best waiting it out for Crowdstrike to go bankrupt then his puts would be worth the full value.
Yeah it's australia because it's working hours now. Just wait 6 hours for US to wake up lol
Literally.

No, they have to force safe boot / pxe boot just to rename/delete the crowdstrike driver.

And that only works if the PC isn't encrypted with bitlocker.

And THEN you better pray your org knows how to retrieve bitlocker keys.
That‚Äôs a coincidence, still had a shit tonne of shares but his losing billions today
DM me your next theories please
WSB owes you an apology mate üòÇ
Oh, juicy! I posted on Crowdsrike's origins on the conspiracy sub some time ago. They just looked like an intelligence state actor from inception.

It was started by guys from McAfee who were instrumental at getting a $$ record setting department of defense contract before they moved on. One of the guys joins the private equity firm Warburg Pincus whose CEO at the time was on the Council on Foreign Relations and decides to seed Crowdstrikes startup money.

Then, they (Warburg) hired Timothy Geithner and in no time Crowdsrike was getting headlines in major news outlets about Chinese & Russian hacks.

They are the "overnight success" of the intel world.
Please say them. Or DM me like other commenter said cause I‚Äôm open to anything rn
OP was essentially right. He was just saying most cybersecurity is a bunch of overblown hot air.
Robert Bork strikes again
Man just ended his own career.
OP must feel so vindicated rn
You don't even need to hack it. Everyone just leaves their s3 buckets wide open.
You mean the remote server architecture designed to be accessible over *the internet*?
That‚Äôs gold. I didn‚Äôt even make it that far
Yeah, what the fuck. I just woke up and I thought this post was related to the outage.
Unless op dipped deeper than 5 contracts, it won't be huge gains with those 4 month puts. Gains are gains tho.
>As stupid as the OP has proven himself to be in terms of knowledge of cybersecurity

Truly, OP is a median investor
44% of Fortune 100 companies JUST CRASHED 37% of Global 100 companies JUST CRASHED 45% of major banks JUST CRASHED  70% of the top energy companies JUST CRASHED
It's an extremely stupid analysis, wrong in almost every sentence , but it has one almost accurate point: Crowd strike is granted "root access" üôÑ to push its software updates. And that turned out to be very bad!
[deleted]
They're all stuck in an endless loop of death even when restarting.  Only fix (currently) is to reboot into safe mode and manually remove crowdstrike.  Something only technically inclined people can do and not really a solution for the millions impacted.

This is probably the worst type of outage I've ever witnessed in my 23 year career.
I did 330 puts w the same expiration‚Ä¶hopefully they do get filled
Haha seriously, the irony of this shit. Companies going crazy right now
I'm here for it.


No, I mean I'm literally here stuck in DFW for that reason.¬†




But also here for the comments
You couldn‚Äôt make this shit up
That's definitely an interesting point of view
I work in the industry.   I would also argue that being best-in-class while also overvalued is the status quo.

They are a great company and moving the "brains" of their detection to the cloud (where attackers can't reverse engineer it) is genius.   It also means they can roll out new signatures/detections instantaneously for all customers, which is a huge win.

Downside is that it doesn't work at all in airgapped/remote environments and generates a large volume of network connections (not traffic).

Edit: Next time I post something like this, buy puts on the company immediately.
OP trying to make end point management sound sinister.
reading his DD now at 3am‚úÖ
Did ya check the news?
I love that this comment would've been posted 10-60 minutes prior to the rolling global outages.
Lol I'd be surprised if crowdstrike still exists after tonight.
No, his computer is BSOD lmao
this was the moment my guy became rich
ü´†
Happy Friday
I cannot follow you on this one
What's interesting is that OP's technical analysis is off, but their gut vibes about the company not knowing what they're doing have been echoed by some security researchers I follow on twitter in the past. (Criticism of how Crowdstrike hooks into running applications and can potentially cause system crashes -- a fear that has just been proven true.)
This whole situation is comical

Great loser stand on the shoulder of greater loser. Without great failure of the past, we can't have the greater failure of tomorrow. Coming this November...
Maybe if your account is approved for shorting. Otherwise, wait for market open to buy puts
This is also my personal conspiracy theory
https://preview.redd.it/ssmneeppdpdd1.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=f38f17c1756c51535bd52c15c1c428a6e733d262

that's my theory. Why did the stock start tanking a few days before? Blue screens don't melt steel beams.
My tinfoil hat theory is he works for crowdstrike, told his boss about how shitty the update would be and got mad no one listened so he came here to rant
Op is shitting his chicken tendy pants that we figured it out. He probably thought he was a fucking genius.
he pushed the update.
This is the only explanation.
I hope not or the SEC is going to be up OP's butthole real quick.
For 5 put contracts lol
Glad to be here for this. Scared to be here for this.

The more I think about this, the more it seems like it has to be intentionally malicious. Should we test this update? Nah, just push it. Maintenance window? Friday fucking morning.

[this](https://grayhatwarfare.medium.com/how-to-search-for-open-amazon-s3-buckets-and-their-contents-https-buckets-grayhatwarfare-com-577b7b437e01) is pretty interesting. I used to have a search term saved for classified documents on unsecured AWS servers but I can‚Äôt find it right now. It was pretty interesting what you could find.
Ha yep, OP when they wake up this morning...

https://makeagif.com/amp/L9Q-y0
You mean, the evidence. Smoking gun if you will. Holy shit.
He was right in that it is a major threat vector though and that actually seemed like the most important takeaway, like if we let private companies collect all our data it always gets leaked eventually or used nefariously. Having half our banks using one software that breaks is bad and imagine if it was 100%. Basically their offices would become a military target that could break banking and a bunch of industries so spreading out the risk seems like a better strategy.
Had me at ‚Äúemployee spying app‚Äù‚Ä¶    OK, OP, what did CRWD see you doing at work?
can we get some confirmation/proof? the timing is too wild
Yeh, at first glance this isn‚Äôt something that be fixed en masse or remotely apparently. Death of a company in real time.
i can't wait for US to wake up and see this shit
If you're stuck in town check out the Texas Theatre in Dallas where they caught Lee Harvey Oswald. They have a bar
Upvoted - I'd just like to add that neither you or u/cheesycrustz mentioned their migration away from Splunk on the back end after Cisco's acquisition. Their SEIM platform is now MASSIVELY more affordable because of this one critical decision.

This comment didn't age well.

Drink some coffee or monster, drink plenty of water too, you got this champ
Oh you think the market is actually gonna open?  I bet even they are affected by this outage
That or a time traveler
That would be the funniest thing to me if the guy knew all this shit and risked getting slapped with insider trading charges just to buy only 5 extremely otm puts
They will be either way - dude was Nostradamus with this post.

Nah, sesame street characters. But also with shotguns
If anything OP was a pussy and only bought 5 contracts.

His absolute max gain is only like $80k

edit:  To understand how regarded the play was, OP bet a 50% drop in 1 year to even *break even*.  Not even Black Monday was a 50% drop.

Secure storage of bitlocker keys has been an argument between csuite and IT for some time, as sometimes management can insist on ‚Äúno hard copies‚Äù - INCLUDING FLASH DRIVE COPIES - because ‚Äúcloud‚Äù storage is ‚Äúsafer‚Äù.  

Despite the fact that when shit happens to the cloud, you NEED not networked hard copies to resolve the issue.

Yeah check the Crowdstrike or Sysadmin subreddit, Crowdstrike is aware of the issue as well.  Twitter is going wild too. 

Not only are PC's impacted, servers too which is even worse.  I'm not sure how they're going to fix this remotely (e.g by releasing an update) when people can't even boot into their machines, especially on the server side of things.
enjoy the gains
You had the funniest timing in the world bud
Probably death of some people, too. The hospital network I work for just sent out an alert notifying us that our entire system is down and that all non essential appointments are canceled. Having to go to downtime procedures/paper charting almost certainly will lead to medical errors. This is really, really bad. OP's thesis is completely wrong but he's stumbled into one of the greatest plays I've ever seen.
I actually knew about that but didn't connect the dots. 

Yeah $$$plunk is just that.
Cisco couldnt afford their splunk bill, so they bought the company.
This dude shorting them at the absolute perfect moment and not being able to capitalize on it because the company's issues causing the market to not open would be a certified WSB moment for sure.
Not insider trading if he made the information publicly available before trading ;)
He traded back in June so /shrug

taps head
I‚Äôm holding off on calling hundreds of billions, as we‚Äôre still on Day One of this outage (and it will be a multi-day outage, we‚Äôre still in the triage stage), but I do believe at this point it could scale above hundreds of millions into several, perhaps even 10 Billion+ USD of economic loss.

If you include ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù numbers, then yeah sure, but historically, those ‚Äúlost dollars‚Äù aren‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúreal‚Äù losses, and can be extremely easy to inflate before reporting without much to back up how or why they got the figures they did, particularly if those are numbers being used to claim damages.

Bro, your timing alone should be worth a cool million. We should start a GoFundMe for you.
Please help me, my brother gained 30k in a fraudulent transaction
So... my brother owns this beefy finance discord server and will spam post phishing links to try and lure people into giving their money away. Primarily crypto related. Some how, this sucker clicked one of the links and submitted a transaction connected to his ledger and my brother saw blood in the water. He saw a 30k balance in the wallet so he drained the wallet and dipped.  He's afraid that this guy could potentially track him so he asked me to ask for help.

is there any way to hide this from the police? we live in canada and this is life changing money for us. it will finally allow us to move from the bridge we live under and give us access to hot food and water.

Edit : I can‚Äôt believe I have to say this but this is tagged as comedy for a reason. I‚Äôm parodying off of a top post from last night. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/s/1QyCWmgcgh
Absolutely, I am here to help with your hot water situation. You can simply send it back and forth to me a few times and it will confuse the police and they will give up. /joke
I can help, send me the funds to my wallet, you buy a large canvas, splash some random patterns of paint on it, frame it and I will use the money to "buy" and exquisite piece of art from you with the money you sent me. Problem solved XD
Ha ha brilliant.

ETA for those who missed the post

And his karma from taking the piss of someone else who did the same a week before

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/s/OWOv8YKjwh
i can kindly help. i am nigerian prince.
A fool and his money are easily separated. Good for you guys. Now let me DM you a link to keep that money safe.
Just send me this 30k I will give 60k back in a week
lmfao I just finished reading [that other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/s/l5jAhk8y8A)
Write the guy a letter and tell him where your brother can be found for a small reward. Since your brother is a steaming pile of shit it will be a double win. Delete his jacked up scam server for bonus points.
Imagine a world where having access to reddit is prioritized over hot food and water.
Stop!   
Stop!  
He's already dead!  


XD
Absolutely we can help you, but we will need more details. What's the closest big city from you? We need to figure out which police force you'd even be dealing with and how they operate
But why? It's better for you guys under the bridge
Doesn‚Äôt this mean the karma will come back to haunt you too OP?
"BROTHER". You wouldn't know him, he goes to a different school in another school district.
Is the guy who lost 30k yesterday not on here yet.
Yeah, give me his wallet keys. Let me see what I can do
Excellent trolling.
Way to kick a guy when he‚Äôs down.
Netflix is closely watching how this unfolds
FOUND YOU! Can I have my money back?
I hope you and "your brother" go to jail.
"so anyway, I started blasting"
I can help you launder the bitcoins. Please send them to me so I can move them onto a hardware wallet which will be thoroughly mechanically laundered through a multi-step process.
Aite I'm done with reddit for the night.
Lol
Troll ass post op
I knew a guy who did this. He was tracked down and murdered. He did have a cool car for a while though.
U have too much time on your hands
You are cold..lolol...I recognized this as soon as I read it.
Just checked my Exodus wallet my 2.78$ worth of ETH are safe üòÖ
I swear, a lot of Redditors are just as blind and dumb as any other social media users. The post literally has *COMEDY* as the flair.
He should tack him first get ahead of it
Big brain only moves in this family.
I lost 30k too, had voyager as my crypto wallet & bought ton of NFTs at the peek now I‚Äôm barely surviving üòÇ
Ask Monero subreddit. I think they have idea's for you.
I know some guy in Nigeria can help
Send it to me I'll take on this problem for you and your brother. Just let this be a lesson learned
Under bridge-troll post
Kindly send me your dollars as I am attracted to homeless sketchy people. If you believe this is true then you can call me at OU812.
I saw the person that got scammed post that this guy stole his money it's all fake posts I know now
First way to hide it from the police, make a reddit post
Everyone in this situation is an idiot
Didn‚Äôt someone the other day hat post that they lost $30k in a fraudulent transaction? üßê
He should turn himself in
Big oof for them. Haha.
You know, the police would love to help you. They‚Äôd love to set you up with 3 meals a day and a roof over your head for the next 5-10 years. You accomplice-after-the-fact you.
I maybe able to assist, I have a laundry service and for a small fee can help you remove the "dirty" stain from this. For a mere 99% I'll laundry this for you and it'll be as clean as the sun is bright...../s
Lol this post is fucking gold üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
You gotta clean it. I‚Äôm just not sure how to wash a virtual currency? Maybe just dip the computer in the tub?
hey guys going off script here but serious question. If I left my moons on my vault did I lose them completely? They aren't shown anymore.
LoL, scammers not clear about their scams.
FWIW you're brother is a scumbag POS
It's really not funny at all to laugh at someone who has lost so much money.  This is happening daily, it's causing real pain.
Make an NFT of a rock. Sell it to yourself. Step 3 profit? I will clean the coins.
talk to this guy: u/garybaws .  He can help.  :D
You are fucked up for this post but it‚Äôs hilarious lol
Sorry to tell you but, You ain't getting from under that bridge with 30k in Canada
"We stole money and need help to hide it"
Don't make it public knowledge, split it into several wallets, offload it slowly and hide your tracks. Your first mistake was to tell everyone here.
This is the dumbest crime I‚Äôve ever witnessed in progress
Fuck you and your shitheel brother lol
You realize this sort of toxicity doesn't actually help Bitcoin yeah?
Start not posting on Reddit with a registered and easily traceable account?
Suspiciously like another post I read here‚Ä¶
I am getting a lot of DMs from people who say "I found your scammer, his brother posted on reddit" , seems like you're fooling a lot of people who don't understand that you're joking.
Using your real Reddit account for this post is peak moron.

And your brother is scum. Hope he's sent to prison for ruining lives.

Edit: Okay okay I missed the joke. Good on ya. Someone had to fall for it. Guess that's me!
If you were poor before I promise 30k will only change a small portion of your life as you‚Äôre going to spend it in no time considering most poor ppl are poor because they are bad with money and not because of some external factor.
Is this a joke?

The guy that clicked the link and lost 30k just posted yesterday.
Return the money. It‚Äôs Someone else‚Äôs hard earned money
Man you‚Äôre openly assuming fraud online and asking if that‚Äôs ok?

Of course he can track you. Just check online. There are many tools to track professional hackers. A bunch of guys sending fraudulent links online and receive money are the easiest way to track.

You either send it back if you‚Äôre scared (which makes 0 sense in the way that you were actually looking to scam people) or expect the guy not to care to sue you. If he/she does not go to the police  and report it (or hire a lawyer/online investigator) you‚Äôll be fine. Otherwise you‚Äôre ducked.

Sorry for being very rude but your brother was looking to scam people to get money and when he gets it you guys are scared and ask online what to do‚Ä¶ if you scam people at least prepare for the afterü´µü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It‚Äôs hilarious that this itself is clearly a scam. Yesterday there was the ‚Äúpoor sap who lost 30k in a fraudulent transaction‚Äù and today apparently the very people who did it are here asking about it. Anyone trying to reach out to help ‚Äúeither‚Äù party (it‚Äôs clearly the same people) is the actual sucker.
Hot food and water üòÇ
Is the comedy bit where 30k is life changing money in Canada?
How do I contribute to your brother being a piece of shit. Hmmmm ü§î
Is this a bait post for the guy on here who lost 30k yesterday? I'm serious lol
Wait. Why is there another post about someone in Canada losing 30k and then this post says gained 30k. Wtf is going on here
karma will get him
Is this a shitpost? There was another one who lost lifesavings after using a link on discord
Send me addy and I‚Äôll fraudulently make it disappear?

Sincerely,

Gary G.
Is this supposed to be funny?
help your brother then you will both be thieves
Is this the other side  of the story to the dude that lost his life savings after talking shit to a guy 4 days earlier who got his funds stolen too?
Didn‚Äôt I just see someone post about loosing 30k in a discord server just yesterday.
Brother?!?!  Sure.

Then justifying theft‚Ä¶.
Tell your brother if he doesn't want shitty things to happen to him then don't do shitty things to people.  It's pretty funny he's asking for help when he would have no problem burning one of us
Here is an idea, your brother is a piece of shitstain on all human society, let him get caught and end up right where the piece of shit belongs!  Related or not, a terrible person is still a terrible person.  To be clear, involving yourself in hiding his crime makes you just as guilty as him, don‚Äôt do it. Rise above the level of shitbag that he is and don‚Äôt help.
Hope your bro goes to jail!
$30k is Canada is not life changing. That's grocery money.
First of all ‚Ä¶. stay off the internet talking about it‚Ä¶
Wtf man. I say at least give half if not all the money back.
Love your work :')
‚ÄòCOMEDY‚Äô
Cool story bro üòé
If this post is legit this is starting to look like a comedy.
You guys are all going to be f*ked hard when this kind of things are investigated by the authorities.

Edit: just saw the comedy flair.
your brother is a criminal and you both are scum
Sure, give me your brother's name and address and I'll get this sorted out for you.
Haha you and your brother sound like absolute low lives. When this easy money disappears you will be left holding your breath until you can‚Äôt anymore.
Are you asking Reddit to help you cover up a crime? The dude he stole from could off himself because of a loss that size. I hope you both get caught and convicted.
Somehow I don't believe you. Trollpost.

I'm sorry, so you're out committing fraud on purpose, then come to a public forum and ask how to get away with it? Hopefully this is a joke because you just incriminated your self. These types of things aren't anything to joke about these types of things are why people don't trust crypto and are greatly holding it back.
Yeah, first thing. Don't publicly post about committing a federal crime and even include the country of origin.
This could actually happen, a guy I know was on a dating site scamming women out of $ telling them he was doing bitcoin investing for them but setting up his own accounts. Eventually he got busted by the FTC/SEC for fraudulent trading. But no one reported him because he would also get incriminating information over texts that he could use against people. I hope he lost everything when the crypto market went down.
YOU KNOW GOD SEES ALL THINGS??? STEALING FROM ANOTHER PROBABLY POOR OLD PERSON IS HOW YOUR GOING TO HELP YOURSELF??? THEN COME ON HERE AND ASK FOR HELP TO CONTINUE YOUR SIN. WHATS EVEN MORE JUST HORRIBLE IS ALL THE RESPONSES THAT ARE WILLING TO HELP YOU INSTEAD OF TELLING YOU THIS IS WRONG AND THE LORD HAS SUCH A BETTER PLAN FOR YOU!!! RETURN ALL THAT MONEY AND ASK JESUS TO HELP YOU AND SHOW YOU HE EXISTS AND REALLY GET TRUE HELP!!! YOU ARE GOING TO STEAL SOMEONE'S LIFE SAVINGS AND FOR WHAT??? THERE IS A MUCH BETTER WAY. I PRAY YOU CHOOSE THE NARROW AND HARD PATH AND GIVE ALL THE MONEY BACK. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN BY YOU DOING THE RIGHT THING. PLEASE GIVE THE LORD A CHANCE TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH HE LOVES YOU AND WANTS TO HELP YOU THE RIGHT WAY!!! IM PRAYING FOR YOU GUYS üôè‚úùÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüî•
You should report him to the FBI.
A ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù tag doesn‚Äôt just make something funny if it‚Äôs not funny to begin with‚Ä¶
so many bacterias amongst amobie
Just give it back. Not worth it. How does he know the guy won't just shoot him
There are only two possible outxomes I see:

‚ÄîYou'll get caught
‚ÄîYou'll always live with the fear of getting caught
Chance to go to prison or force repay if you spend it.
You should probably just call the police and let them give you a hand, I'm sure they would be more than happy to help.
No need to talk to your scumbag brother, he'll appreciate the surprise.
How about fuck you and your pos scamming buddy I hope he gets caught and I hope you get caught for trying to help him
How can you stand yourself or your brother, morally? How is it even possible that you can take years worth of money from someone and then ask for free help in being a gigantic douchebag. The hypocrisy is unbelievable.
Should be using VPNs and being smart if he‚Äôs even doing this in the first place 


Transfer it among multiple wallets and leave it sitting in one for a good year. Let it get lost.  Then cold storage it onto a stick and spend it down the road.   

Not financial theft advice.  Just saw it in a movie once
Scumbags
You‚Äôre asking Reddit to assist you in scamming/stealing someone‚Äôs life saving? What the fuck is wrong with you
What , my brother also drained a wallet a few weeks ago. Lurking in this thread for tips
You and your bro are scumbags.
well, you are pretty much giving everyone what someone needs to track down your brother and yourself lol
Wow that's awesome it's happening let's goooo

Ironic karma. Unfortunate

These kind of posts scare me. I have both taco and plunger tokens, hope nobody takes them. They aren't worth 30k like Op's brother. Probably just 4k since they are still new reddit community tokens. But soon on next bull run could be worth more. I'm not using any cold wallets so I'm thinking on buying one.
Prob bullshit but if true and someone connected their Ledger to a random discord link then they need to be taught a lesson. Keep it.
Was gonna this one, gonna the related one‚Ä¶..then realised I‚Äôm inbred wishing I just had an ‚Äòa‚Äô
You do realise how the universe operates. You think you‚Äôre getting something but in turn you will be stolen from or have an unforeseen event that will put things back in balance.
Canadian police entered the chat.

We recieved reports of someone being exodused of 30k. This is their life savings, so we are investing.Investigating.
I know a guy that can help but you have to send it to my wallet to verify if you really have the 30k.
If this isn't a joke I hope you both go to jail

I can't imagine needing money and instead of spending the energy to find a job just sitting on a discord scamming people
Lol your brother is so fucked, financial crimes are federal üòÇüòÇüòÇ $30k for his freedom, want a moron. Tell him to send it back and shut down the discord and the cops might leave him
Take the money and take a private jet to the Phillipines.
>He saw a 30k balance in the wallet so he drained the wallet and dipped.

Okay so this is a nitpick on comedy sure, but in an effort to fight scams it's probably a good idea to paint a picture based in reality, even in satire, so:  


PSA:  
The execution would be blind and instant, no one is sitting there watching things, checking balances, and then deciding if they want to drain your wallet or not.  Once you click the link you'll not have a chance to stop it.

You just say, he was drunk and didn‚Äôt know how the money came in and got out. I mean the whole time.
This is funny.
I suggest you should also get it from a right way by $SFUND.
Send it to my wallet I will claim all fault and I ask only half , I can send you clean interact
Absolutely, I'll take it off your hands so they can't track you, I will send you some 2 minute noodles and boiling water in return, might take a few weeks though shipping is rough lately am I right?!
Hey it‚Äôs me , your brother.













LMAO
The saga continues...
Bad idea in canada lol
Just tell him to buy #sclp 
Sell 10% of bag after first 10x and send that guy back his 30k

NFA
This a joke right? Ive seen like 2 or 3 people make posts they lost 30k and they also live in canada. So either you just snitched or its all a hoax for updoots
 Wow. Interesting story.
I hope this is a joke lol
Your brother took that wallet on an exodus
I recently made an account as ‚Äúmy highly secured and secret ledger that no police in world can find‚Äù i can send you the id and you can secure the money there and even you wont be able to find the money let alone police
rule 4, also im calling the cops
Just send it back, to the address you got it from? maybe?
Send it back.
If this was real, is there anything the police can actually do? I'm new to crypto and I thought wallets can't be opened by any means except with the password?
This post sounds much like the scam you‚Äôre describing?!
2 sec let me send you a link..
Return the stolen money, and work your way out of the bridge housing.

I hope you & your brother get caught and end up in jail, if you do not do it.
Good one OP üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Your brother shouldn't play the game if he can't accept the outcome... He intentionally committed wire fraud, theft by deception.. Bye üëã
Hey there was a post of someone losing 30k using a Dapp. On this very subreddit, both from Canada and quitesimilar description. You should reach out and also file your brother with the police or privately settle
Your brother owns the discord server? And now you, the other brother, is asking for help on Reddit? 

You guys are lucky discord and reddit are dark web applications with no logs or records... 

üòÇ
Didnt someone posted that he got scammed the exact same amount a few hours ago?
20s and 50s we love big ass titties thanks for the easy $30 k sucker
lmao your brother is a scammer, send him to jail
lol
This has to be a sarcasm to the other post
The best thing to do is post it online on a public sub where it can easily be traced back to you and your brother imo
Trololol!
hahaha omg, you guys are such cnts and I love it.
Send it to me I‚Äôll take care of it ü§§
I hate thieves but you‚Äôd have to mix it or convert it to like monero. This is hella wrong though I really hope you guys burn
This is too far man üíÄüòÇ
How do they say it? the code is the law or something xd
I read the original post last night and I stopped and rolled my eyes when OP mentioned ‚ÄúDiscord links‚Äù 

These are the people that give Ledger or any other secured cold storage a bad name.
Thank god it‚Äôs anonymous
HA!
BEEFY
You aren‚Äôt worried about your IP being tracked on this post?
I think you should send money back the the ‚Äúsucker‚Äù
Strange how OP somehow has a phone or pc with electricity and an internet connection but no hot food or water...
Oh your totally screwed. Even we can find you. Block chain is transparent. Someone's coming for that .. but not me. Because I have a DUI and Canada doesn't allow that from what I hear
Send it to me, I know Elan personally and he's agreed to double his already generous deal floating around out there. No doubt you've seen it..... We'll do it a couple times a day and all retire by next Monday.
There was a guy that lost. His life savings. 30k. MAYBE HE SHOULD HIVE HALF BACK. that‚Äôs so fucked up.
Pieces of shit
Strange that someone in this sub just posted that ‚Äúhe just lost 30k to a scammer on a discord server‚Äù. What are the odds? ü§î
![img](avatar_exp|148454441|fire)
Hello there. You could always ask in r/police you'll get your answers there. üòâ
Just send it back. There‚Äòs too much risk involved and it‚Äòs worth the stress. If you scam someone, maybe don‚Äòt do it from a country like canada where they actually care about this stuff
This has got to be a parody shitpost
I can help, I am a Nigerian prince so the police will never suspect anything.
lol this has to be fake, the other persons just posted losing the 30k. Now we know both posts are fake
Do society a favor and jump in the river and wash yourself you cheating pig. Get a real life and job.
Bad boy bad boy, what you gonna do, what you gonna do when they come for you
You guys are the problem with crypto.  Let‚Äôs me explain about a life lesson called Karma. And she is a bitch at the worst possible time. I would be more worried about that.
Speaking of phishing attempts...
The real part is that $30k is now considered life changing money in Canada

Good God Trudeau really fucked up the housing market
There was a post on here like last week about someone losing 30k of their crypto in a scam and it was their life savings ‚Ä¶
you‚Äôll get access to water and food in prison.
i‚Äôm assuming homie isn‚Äôt actually living under a bridge
Oh man lmaooo
Problem with crypto is that even though it‚Äôs decentralized the police can still track all sums of crypto and where it goes or comes from.
I have a 100% bullet proof way. DM me for more information
I hope you both go to jail and not able to play GTA VI
Buy gold now a bury it lol
Hahaha yea the right place to do it is on a reddit forum if you wanna hide it from police ü§£ü§£ pretty ratted out ur own brother if anyone in here can track and trace
This has been a fun trip.  This is part 3 in a multi part story line.  Person A posts that they got hacked. Person B laughs at them. Person B later posts about getting hacked for $30k on Discord. Person C posts that their brother just hacked someone for $30k.

Too bad moons aren't a thing. Y'all would have racked up on points.
Thief.
You all are mean lmao
have seen this plenty of time in web3/crypto, you will be traced back. good luck :)
Ok Fedboy
He will almost certainly be caught and prosecuted
Lmao your brother.......
#1 delete this post and #2 use a fuckin burner account???
ü§´ü§´ü§´ü§´ I am here to help!!!! I'll gladly help make it go up in  üí®üí®üí®
I love Reddit.
Hope he gets tracked down. He deserves to rot in prison.
That's a lot of weight.
Stop snitching
A box of donuts sometimes works.
Duh exchange for other crypto
Sounds like he's a scammer and got a taste of his own medicine.

You live and you learn
>is there any way to hide this from the police?

Go straight to the police station, Teehee!
That dude gonna dox u lol
WHY WOULD ANYONE HELP YOU??!!
What youre doing is wrong what he's doing is even more wrong. You should turn your brother in for such actions. Stealing is incredibly wrong.
Do the right thing and return that money. You just ruined someone else's life.
Lmao no way this is real
buy art piece, sell art piece, you just washed your money and you‚Äôre now an art dealer
This should be cross posted to r/legaladvicecanada  lol you‚Äôre going to need it.
‚ÄúBeefy finance discord‚Äù

Get off my lawn!!!
sounds like yor bro isn't too smart
Tell me again how crypto isn't a scam and how we should trust crypto and invest in it?
Afaik rcmp doesnt have a cyber crime division anymore. Party on
You can't be this dumb?
EDIT:Just saw the Comedy Tag. Lol. Well my comedy response 

Ummm this can‚Äôt be a real post right?  There is a lot wrong going on here. 

If real, you making this post actually compromises your brother even more. You sure you‚Äôre not trying to get him some karma while losing as trying to help?

Blockchain is NOT anonymous as far as wallets amd token tracking goes. 

So the victim knows what wallet his funds went to. Victim can see every transaction that wallet has done including with CEXs that require KYC. Move funds to another wallet‚Ä¶. Trackable. 

Life changing money indeed, now having to live under a rock in fear some guy that lost $30k isn‚Äôt pissed off enough to spend another $30 to find someone flying to Canada to track your brother down. 

Didn‚Äôt a couple crypto scammer wind up being found in pieces recently?
Im a Nigerian prince with a offshore bank I will send you the account info
If this is true your brother is scum and you‚Äôre scum for trying to aid him at hiding someone else‚Äôs money and not give it back. I hope both of you get caught and serve prison time ‚úåÔ∏è 

Terrible terrible loser
Enough info to put together who and where he has it, Thank you! Let‚Äôs get em boys!
Your bigger problem is the tax avoidance. Cleaning the money isn't hard - it's crypto. Move it around a few times and you'll be fine. Justifying where you got the money if asked is the bigger potential problem. There are ways around this, but you need to be smart (and it's not cheap)
Theres nothing no one can do. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Haha nice to see everyone knows this is a joke post and I haven‚Äôt seen any flew over the heads types
I can tumble the Crypto for you at a 10% charge.
Piece of shit.
Keep the money reinvested it into drugs and start pedaling drugs. Make millions and then they can‚Äôt mess with you.
Dude has audacity to post here . Bro what about the guy on other side ? That might be his life saving wtf
You can hide the fund in my wallet until things get calmer. Trust me I am a Redditor.
You and your Brother are thief's, and I can only hope that someone reports this post to the police and they get your IP from Reddit. Then, you can answer to the authorities or take the hit for your bro.
You have to be a different type of ass hole to actually post things like this publically, I really hope police catches you
well first off you posted on the web. lol make a paper trail while at it
Report him.
Or someone else will. If not this time, anytime soon.
Remember: karma is a bitch
Call the police. Ask them.
Post some fake nft listings and send it back to yourself. Maybe switch it to other types of crypto.
Hope he used xmr or something with a more private blockchain if not you might be tucked and fucked
:))) recently so many similar cases, and this one was needed and on point!
[deleted]
Wait a damn minute, i saw a post the other day of a guy interacting with a supposed ‚Äúkraken wallet‚Äù and then lost 30k.

EDIT: Is this the guy? https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/s/cLWP1r4QWN
...I have this friend see....let's just say he's my brother ...ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
You can't out run or hide from karma, good luck with being a POS.
Turn it in to Solana and send it to me, I did a transaction yesterday, and it only cost .003 cents. Then I'll turn it into ada and send it back to you and the police won't know what happened!
Scammer asking for advise. Unbelievable
Can‚Äôt he just put the money back in and apologise?  Say he made a mistake.
Why am I hearing the Benny Hill theme song playing in the distance.
You should double it and give it to someone else
What the fuck is this post LMAO
Scam? you can report them to the pd. Other wise unless they most scammers get away with it. Youtube has some scammer pay back channels. Every time I get one I report it to these sites and they can make their life a misserable hell.
High liquidity money laundering. Make sure not to put too much detergent in.
The police will get whiplash turning their heads left and right so sharply that their vision will go hazy and they won't see your transactions.
Send it to me, I will send back 2X.
Whoa whoa it‚Äôs not him it‚Äôs his ‚Äúbrother‚Äù.  Totally different people here
This guy is a known scammer, your funds will be much safer in my hands as I hide the money from the police
Can totally see this as a skit video
[deleted]
You forgot to add "trust me bro"
Bro just described NFTs in a nutshell without realising it.
Ah, the ol' Hunter Biden...
a.k.a. The Hunter Biden method!
Sam, Caroline‚Ä¶is that you?
I had the same ideal ,lol!!
All the people mocking him and saying karma is a bitch without seeing the irony of themselves doing the same thing is wild
HOLY FUUUUUUU! LOL 

There's a reason why I keep my mouth shut when I see good and bad posts.. Don't need that karma coming at me in any direction lol
To be fair: I didn‚Äôt exactly do the same, as I would never share my wallet data in any webpage. But I was stupid enough to use Exodus on an Android device that was probably infected with fraudulent software.
Oh shit its getting full circle. The victim the mocker and the suspect all in this subreddit. This is interesting
Did you see the thread where OP is taunting the 30k guy? Legendary.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/s/Pa8XqKUMyb

That was a wild ride. Thanks for the update!
Wow I guess farming (bad) karma actually paid out
LMAO
Thanks.  I love this

You Nigerian princes are soooooooo genuine and friendly gotta say it
I can't believe there are 2 of us on here!! What a coincidence. ü§£
>A fool and his money are easily separated

That means a good 98% of the people here on this sub, those that believe they can get rich quick will lose their money.
any links for something that will safely moon?
I will do armor trimming for 30k.

If you know you know.
Ikr me too

We need more detail like the first 4 words of the seed phrase.  
And then another words and another and another and wait the brute force will do yhe rest.
Yeah there's nothing good in laughing about someone else's misery. I've seen this play a thousand times in here before. You should frame it, not long until op will have his accounts hacked too now.
gotta check the flair...comedy means joke usually
I hope you and "your brother" can understand this post is a joke
why would you wish upon something so sinister this close to christmas? have you no moral compass? :(

Weep harder
Missed the "COMEDY" tag, apparently. This is a parody of some poor shmuck in Canada losing 30k to fraudulent transaction by using the exact same means, posted a day ago. The reason no one sympathetic about them and is mocking them instead is because 8 days ago someone else made a similar post and this guy went and mocked them.
Nothing goes over your head, does it?
You know what, Kudos to you for not getting too worked up about OPs joke. I do think it‚Äôs an amusing troll post but at the same time I do think it‚Äôs a bit mean considering what you went through (and exacerbated by the fact that so many people were mocking you for an earlier comment which was fairly innocent in the grand scheme of things). Sorry it‚Äôs all happened and I hope things get better from here.
Woosh
Bro! It is a comedy! It is in the flair!
Yeh, this is the sequel. Trust me after this there will be detective who are assigned to this case posting the follow up.
shitposts... they're coming back
Hope you learn how to read!
Why would I lie on the internet?
What happened to you to make you this way
Dont hate the playa h8 the game
ETH gas fees have entered the chat
Gotta use multiple washing machines if going this route OP. You‚Äôre going to wanna send some of that $$$ to me also. Gotta remember that more complicated = better for confusing popo/Mounties.
My favorite color is blue.
If I just put my phone in the washer, will it launder my crypto?
Somehow still always ending up missing a single sock each time. Transaction fees
*Tennising*
lmao
+ bounce sheets in the dryer. It's a luxury I know but in this circumstances it's necessary to smell fresh, clean and innocent.
Yeah, that stuff tastes awful
Especially if it‚Äôs a high efficiency machine; you need to get a detergent with the HE symbol or you‚Äôll make a mess of things ü§™
Happened just the other day in St. Louis....crashed the car and everything.
No. Trust me friend.
He forgot to trust his bro
No, he absolutely realized it. Thatsthejoke, and all that.
seems the most rubes that fall for crypto are MAGAts
You spelled Jarod Kushner wrong.
No, the irony is saying that *and then doing it anyway*
Im mocking him because he mocked others. I wouldnt mock someone who didnt
I know wtf how are people so blind to this it‚Äôs crazy, still a shame for the guy imagine seeing this
Exactly... Just imagine one of them make a post tomorrow and be like "help I just lost 100k to a phishing link"
The circle never ends lol
\*hypocrisy
First thing I thought to.
I don't use crypto. No matter. Lol. I shall mock him openly.
Dude caught his own stray
The Gangsta, the Killer, and the Dope Dealer...
It‚Äôs total fucking bullshit is what it is.
Reddit brings all participants together. How cute
Fking insane. Rubbing salt in the wound
The scamming thief is getting upvoted‚Ä¶ this community is as dumb as everyone says.
Bingo
You tryin‚Äô to out ‚Äúbrother‚Äù me, brother?
The irony of your statement is mind boggling. You talk about moral compass, but just scammed someone out of 30k. It‚Äôll catch up with you 2 someday.

Two wrongs don't make a right.  A bit of compassion goes a long way.
Do we know each other from another post I finessed?
Or it‚Äôs a troll, and all of you are taking the bait.

You mean ultrasound money?
Just paid $13 to send USDT. The grind is real.

Low to mildly funny, I would say.
That would be a trademark violation.  Might I suggest "CryptoClean"??
I am not your friend, buddy.
I won‚Äôt mock you because you‚Äôre only mocking someone who mocked someone else.
He made a pun, he didn't even insult or act condescending towards the guy.

He's getting absolutely ripped to shreds over making a pun about the wallet name and being told he deserved it.

I do not think those things have the same level of malicious intent.
I'm mocking him because i will never get got! I'm impossible to get.
Apples and fucking oranges. Good grief.
First thing you thought to what?
The thief, the cook, his wife and her lover.
Hoohoooooo
I know its bs man. How can we all miss that OP's post is just a comedy
I‚Äôm not your brother, guy.
No one calls me brother, brother
Have you maybe seen it was a comedy post?
r/woooosh
Its a joke referencing another post about a guy who lost 30k, after making fun of someone else for losing money.
USDT on tron costs $1
I like to travel.
Oh yeah cause crypto is notoriously good with IP protection *cough NFT cough*. No one has ever stolen trademarks or infringed on copyright in the crypto space. Not to mention money laundering a notoriously clean industry with no crimes committed. It‚Äôs so clean cause of how often they wash it.
I am not your buddy, my guy.
Please my friend. As God is my witness I speak truthfully. :)
How much mock could a mocker mock if a mocker could mock mock?
:)
We need to keep a close eye on him, if he gets his wallet drained in the future, we can mock.
But you‚Äôll creampie Jesus though
Everyone is really beating this dude down at what's probably one of the lowest moments of his life. 

I might be a bit autistic, but the "insult" he made about an "Exodus" doesn't seem like it was intended as an insult to me. I feel bad for this guy.
Oh. I hadnt read that many comments. If its as you say then I agree thats too far. Hes only deserving of a few pums back
Because you have no money to get scammed?
Is it? OP made a fucking pun, so now we get to revel in him losing his life savings? 

Morality goes out the door when the comments perceive themselves as being morally superior.
Honestly yes, and the way this subreddit is acting is *far* worse. It's the difference between one person making a single small joke, and an entire subreddit mocking someone for at least a day.
Great movie
In a week the guy you replied to will be making a similar post to OP and you‚Äôre the one who will fall for it. Just you watch.


I'm not your guy, dude

Still too much, I like my tx fees measured in cents
I am not your guy, pal.
fother mocker
You keep a close eye on him, and I‚Äôll keep a close eye on you so I‚Äôll notice when you notice if he does anything.
The group reaction is so disproportionate to that which they are self-righteously condemning that those contributing clearly are not coming from a place of sincerity.
People with self esteem issues elevate themselves by putting people down, and there's no easier way to do it than via some good old fashioned mobbing. 
The particulars of the crime don't matter when you're driven only by an opportunity to belittle someone under the guise of punishment.
I'm not your dude, buddy.

Follow up to the "AICPA is illegally hiding salary info on job postings". After several emails, I convinced them to comply with the law
As you might recall, [three weeks ago I posted about how the AICPA is illegally hiding salary info on their job postings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1fk2ipk/the_aicpa_is_so_committed_to_keeping_its_salaries/). I noticed that the bottom of each job posting included an email for AICPA Human Resources. After HR ignored the first few emails, I sent a followup reminding them that Colorado has fined noncompliant employers and [sent them a link to the list of employers that have been fined](https://cdle.colorado.gov/dlss/equal-pay-for-equal-work-act). That finally got a response, but they only updated a single job posting. 

After more followups, AICPA HR then stated that they wanted to have a Teams call to discuss my request. I declined to have a call, and [asked them to contact state regulators if they found it too difficult and confusing to add a salary range to a job posting](https://imgur.com/a/oKUJCYL). Finally, after several more days of radio silence, they emailed yesterday to confirm they had updated all postings with salary info.

Now that pay is public, let's have a look! Here's a [Lead Manager role requiring a CPA and six years of public accounting experience, but paying only $90k](https://aicpa.referrals.selectminds.com/jobs/remote-lead-manager-peer-review-3085). Fair market rate for this type of role in a MCOL market like North Carolina is ~$140k, which might explain why the AICPA wanted to keep pay info a secret.
I am both shocked and not at all surprised that their response to this was "let's hop on a quick teams call".
>After more followups, AICPA HR then stated that they wanted to have a Teams call to discuss my request.

Finally, after several more days of radio silence, they emailed yesterday to confirm they had updated all postings with salary info.

  
Chef's kiss. This is so perfect. Is it condescending? Not at all, just helpful advice. I just love it so much. All the kudos to you today.
I've never understood why organizations waste time/resources with interviews, etc. when they know they are offering below market rate. And then there's an unspoken rule that a candidate discussing salary expectations before the offer is uncouth and selfish. News flash, salary is one of the most important factors when accepting a new role; my loan servicer won't accept "culture" and "fit" for mortgage payments, so quit honey-dicking us and reveal the paltry salary up front. I mean, what's the strategy? Are they hoping people will be guilted into taking the position? This shit really grinds my gears.
Doing the lords work. Thanks, giga chad.
I love that their director of talent acquisition for jobs in the US is based in the UK.
They can‚Äôt pay market rate, they need that money to pay Barry Melancon millions of dollars in compensation to screw over the people who‚Äôs supposed to represent. I bet they give lots of pizza parties though!
You are a legend man.

Surprise, surprise their salary is shit even though their CEO gets $2M. Such a  mystery that nobody wants to do accounting?!?! What a garbage professional organization
Absolute chad move. Bravo.
>After more followups, AICPA HR then stated that they wanted to have a Teams call to discuss my request. I declined to have a call, and asked them to contact state regulators if they found it too difficult and confusing to add a salary range to a job posting.¬†


Lol...kinda a baller move honestly. "I don't want to talk to you guys, just follow the damn law."¬†
As of January 1st, 2024 job postings are required to have a date when the application window is expected to close listed on the description, which the description still doesn't have. 

It always amazes me how these recruiting teams get a complaint and then can't even bother to Google search how to fix their issue. 

A search for Colorado INFO #9A gives you a dumb simple guide to follow to stay compliant.
Mad respect bro!
AICPA leadership tongues my anus.
You‚Äôre my hero. That pay is insulting
Nice.  I‚Äôm looking to internally transfer and they‚Äôre only putting pay rates on states that legally require it, and mine doesn‚Äôt.
I honestly only keep the aicpa membership for the engagement letters and cheap life insurance. Can anyone suggest some alternatives? I get 2 million life insurance for around $800 a year.
AICPA is a dogshit organization
I also loved how the one thing people care about when applying for a job is literally at the very bottom and in fine print. I knew those assholes would do that and just highlighted everything right away to see it better, had I not highlighted, I probably wouldn't have noticed the salary range. Why does the AICPA refuse to not be douchebags?
OP you are a scholar and a saint. Thank you for doing this.
Baller!
Need to get rid of the AICPA
Lol what a G. Well done.
Thank you for telling them off in a professional manner, we need heroes like you
maybe the mods should pin an announcement saying to boycott the aicpa? we can vote on it or something?
The AICPA needs to be thanos snapped. Completely useless bunch of goons.
You are doing the lord‚Äôs work
That pays not too bad! Same pay as first year public accounting associate!
Thank you for your service
Well done!
Spectacular work OP.
this accounting shit gets serious
Take more upvote from me.

I had to give you an update because I want this to be more visible.

Would you consider making a YouTube video or short covering the same topic?

I do not know about the legal implications when you go do that, but it could help with reaching more audience.
This is excellent. Well done!
You are a hero u/DoritosDewItRight
Hero!
king shit
"While this role can work remotely in the US, please note that we are currently unable to employ individuals in the state of California."

Ummm... why?
King
thank you for doing this big dawg
Doing the work of the lord
You are doing God‚Äôs work.
Thank you so much for your hard work, this is so important for the industry
The AICPA is definition of corruption...
Worked at AICPA for 6 years.  It was terrible.  I needed a break from public.  Awful doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe it.  Run!!
I am proud to not be an AICPA member.
So basically it‚Äôs not worth me sitting down to pursue my CPA anymore?
Not all heroes wear capes ü¶æ
So this is what Batman does in his time off. Amazing.
You should post this on other social media websites too!
You are a legend for seeing an injustice and fighting against it. And telling them to contact state regulators to discuss it is so genius. Kudos to you for fighting the good fight.
This is wild. Thank you so much for bringing this to the surface, being persistent, and sharing your knowledge with us.
How did you assess the fair market rate for Durham NC? Source?
Great Post. Thanks for sharing and keeping up the good work. :D
The AICPA is straight garbage. They‚Äôre out here pretending to be the authority on ethics while breaking the law and screwing over their own people with laughably low pay. Hiding salaries like slimy cowards. It‚Äôs embarrassing they even represent the profession. Absolute clowns.
The way you treated them is kinda how pain in the assy and formal they are when we‚Äôre testing so good job


Also this just shows they are not our advocates as they should be

We should have reform‚Ä¶.
Is the AICPA accountable to CPAs?
If so how do we voice complains
Also this dude is based out of theUK? wtf what‚Äôs the A in AICPA for? How is this good for the people he‚Äôs supposed to be representing
Trying to avoid a paper trail
They wanted to ID you so they could blacklist you.
I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt try and put OP on a PIP for wanting to comply with the law.
"Part of your compensation is putting AICPA on your resume"
Cause they are hoping to sucker someone in.¬†

They are willing to do thousands of interviews to find some idiot to finally take the role.¬†

I always remembered HR bragging about they hired X person at a lower rate to prove their value to the company.¬†
I hired someone recently. The salary was in the title of the job listing.  

[Company Type] hiring [Role] for [$XX,XXX]

Inbox full of resumes. That easy.
Because HR has to justify their existence and having 300 useless interviews is a great way to have a full calendar and ask for more resources
As much as recruiters suck, I had a lot better luck this last time I was job searching and mainly used recruiters. Pay was the first thing they would bring up before even getting permission to send my resume to the firms. There was one that was a little pushy on positions that didn‚Äôt pay enough, but for the most part, they were more than willing to prioritize positions that would pay them and me more lol
They hope that by making it through the interview process, you will be desperate to leave your current role and just accept the salary. Or negotiate and still accept lower amounts.
Because it works, that‚Äôs the only realistic answer there is unfortunately
[You should read the story of Barry Melancon, it's the most Boomer shit ever.](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2024/may/ceo-melancon-passionate-advocate-for-the-profession-to-retire.html) Just lucking in to things that would never happen today, then pulling up the ladder to make sure no one else could get what he had. A few highlights:

>After being named, in 1995, as the youngest CEO of the AICPA ‚Äî appointed at age 36, officially starting at 37 ‚Äî he guided the profession through a time of transformative changes.

Getting a $2 million a year job in your 30s, then sitting there for 30 years to collect a paycheck and prevent any younger talent from advancing.

>He prophetically told the JofA in 1998: "Businesses everywhere are going to be interacting much more internationally."

Wow SO INSIGHTFUL

>Melancon, who rose from a Louisiana firm partner at age 25 to CEO of the Society of Louisiana CPAs

The folks who got promoted to partner at age 25 in the 1970s think you need 150 credits so you can't even start working as a first year staff until age 23-24.

>Upon receiving his undergraduate diploma, Melancon was inducted into the Nicholls State Hall of Fame

Inducted into the Hall of Fame immediately upon graduation? And they say kids these days are getting too many participation trophies...

>On the day Melancon learned he had passed the CPA Exam, a Bergeron partner removed himself from a Society of Louisiana CPAs committee and had Melancon inserted as his replacement.

Could you imagine a Baby Boomer like Melancon giving a young person a chance like what he got? LOL
The AICPA is supposed to advocate on behalf of CPAs. What does it say about the value of the CPA credential when even the AICPA thinks that a CPA with 6+ years of public accounting experience only deserves 90k?
A 4 year (or depending on state Masters) in Accounting, CPA that by the end will be another 20k and thats if you pass the first time, 6+ years of experience, and you pay 82-105k? Whoever is hiring for that role definitely does not deserve to be in business if they can't afford minimum salaries.
Agreed. It‚Äôs petty, but in all the right ways‚Äîas we all stand to benefit from said pettiness. Transparency is good.
Why do a Google search when you can have a Teams call?
Don‚Äôt underestimate how dumb someone can be at their work, especially in HR. I can see how someone lowish level screwed up and just didn‚Äôt want to own up to it, so they tried to delay the issue as much as possible.
Do you have a formal engagement letter with the AICPA for this service?
Say what?
Defund the AICPA!
California has a lot of complex HR laws more so than some other states and that could be the reason. I don't agree with it as it's the cost of doing business but could be why.
I was also going to make a joke and say minimum wage in California is like $16/hr and the AICPA doesn‚Äôt want to pay that üòÖ
Can you share more about what it was like working at AICPA?
Ooh spill the tea, I want to hear more! What was your role and what was awful about working there? Was it worse than public?
You can still get your license without being an AICPA member, which is what I did. Never once has anyone asked if I was a member or vice versa
Feel free to share it elsewhere
100%, good job on telling them to suck it (professionally) by email üòé
Good on you for seeing through their bullshit
I saw it as them wanting to secretly disclose it to whoever complained while leaving everyone else (illegally) blind to it.
I'm not trying to hide here, they have my full name from my email. Besides, I was already blacklisted due to the fact that I live in New York City, [and they excluded all NYC candidates because HR thought that would mean they could avoid complying with all salary transparency laws](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fj8oigs5vlmpd1.png).

Yep. I‚Äôm quite sure there‚Äôs a lot of overlap in companies with bloated HR teams and companies that always experience turnover (especially for skilled labor). If you want someone to stick around, make it worth their time. If you want someone to leave as soon as possible, maybe don‚Äôt make it so easy to find a better offer.
‚ÄúListen, I know it‚Äôs taken six months already, but if we stay focused and interview a few hundred more people, we might finally be able to find an idiot.‚Äù
Every day I learn something new and shitty about accounting. Unreal honestly.
This man must have some really good connections. What does he even do in his job to justify this salary anyways? It seems like hobnob with the elite and sell out the rest of us, but even assuming he actually wasn‚Äôt trying to screw us all I can‚Äôt think of any duties he might have to justify that much pay for a nonprofit. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs actually fundraising or anything since they get fees from multiple sources.
I actually feel bad now for any Nicholls State alumni in our ranks (aside from this douche turd). Knowing that they immediately install a new grad into their alumni hall of fame doesn‚Äôt say much for the school, its grads, or their hall of fame.¬†

And an honorary doctorate! üòé
Nepotism and corruption, plain and simple.
> On the day Melancon learned he had passed the CPA Exam, a Bergeron partner removed himself from a Society of Louisiana CPAs committee and had Melancon inserted as his replacement.

Billy passed the third grade... oh what a glorious dayyyyy.
Which US Senator is Barry‚Äôs dad? Has to be one of them.
> On the day Melancon learned he had passed the CPA Exam, a Bergeron partner removed himself from a Society of Louisiana CPAs committee and had Melancon inserted as his replacement.

let me guess, it was previously a volunteer position, but barry decided he ought to be paid for his work, it's only fair
Where can you find that he makes 2 million a year?
Very true, writing things down is for suckers!

Also Washington law requires statements of benefits to include a specific amount of PTO (days or hours) so they're just not doing a great job. 

Probably shouldn't try to skirt compliance issues with your audience being a bunch of accountants, but what do I know?
Interesting, I didn't know their HR laws were that different. Thanks!
Got it. Thanks for the information. Currently in my first entry level accounting job heavily considering sitting for my CPA but a lot of what I read on here makes me skeptical
Yeah, good on you OP!
Lol don't worry, they couldn't afford anyone there anyways.¬†
ur doing gods work homie and we appreciate it.
Right?! I wouldn‚Äôt mind working for the AICPA (even at a bit of a pay cut) if they were actually working to improve pay and working conditions for their CPA members, but instead, they‚Äôre only working for the benefit of the the Big 4 (and other massive corporations) by fucking us little people over. üôÑ
Want some more? Read about [Barry's failed XYZ credential](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2001/oct/thexyzcredential.html) and [his fake CGMA credential](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/membership/landing/chartered-global-management-accountant-cgma-designation).

Where‚Äôs The Accountant when you need him?
https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/130432265

Scroll down to Compensation, click "more people". I was mistaken, he actually made 3 million last year
Pennsylvania was a thorn in a former job‚Äôs HR person‚Äôs side. They apparently always sided with the employee in unemployment claims.

Another reason could potentially be sales tax nexus. With just Cali, I‚Äôd say HR but that‚Äôs another reason for companies.
If you can take and pass the exam, the certification opens a lot of doors professionally. 

But fair warning, it is an enormous pain in the ass to pass and your free time will suffer. I would say having done it that the benefits have outweighed the costs for me
They have trouble finding people in NC too. I‚Äôve known enough people who have worked there that said it‚Äôs a toxic work environment. Lots of egos.
Don't forget all the little people fucking each other over with the mindset of "I got mine so I'm yanking the ladder up behind me" or "get gud". They're why the AICPA exists as it does instead of a union.
Thank you so much for this information!
PA is AWFUL for payroll compliance reasons. I do not know about unemployment claims but that does not surprise me! 

I'm not sure about professional services being taxing in Cali but you are definitely onto something too mentioning sales tax nexus! Could also be income tax nexus as well. Great point
IIRC, professional services are not taxed in Cali but that is not across the board for all states. Sales tax is ridiculous.

I haven‚Äôt looked at many tax returns but I don‚Äôt think it impacts income tax.
I am schizophrenic. Someone filmed me having a bad episode and shared it on TikTok.
[ Removed by Reddit in response to a copyright notice. ]
You mention that the video was edited to make it seem as if you were harassing someone. That is materially different than simply recording you experiencing an auditory hallucination. (Which, I agree is both highly disrespectful and not tortious.)

The thing is slander/libel are huge hurdles to jump when it comes to liability. As such, I find it unlikely you will be able to find an attorney to take this on a commission basis.

It also very much depends on how the media was altered, the context it was presented in, etc. 

My suggestion is to find a disability/mental health rights legal organization. They may be able to help you find some sort of representation. Your first step would be to figure out a way to get a John Doe subpoena to get the information from TikTok about the poster.

Finally, I want you to know this: while the video is highly upsetting to you, the fact that it is upsetting means it is not a reflection of your true character. Your loved ones and friends will feel no differently about you because of this video. Strangers are also highly unlikely to recognize you. These videos are, unfortunately, a dime-a-dozen. It might also surprise you how many people will feel genuine compassion.

Take care, internet stanger. This is a bad thing for sure, but it doesn't have to define you.
Filming and posting the film from a public place is perfectly legal in California.   

Lying what was happening could be defamation (slander/libel).  The problem is you need to articulate damages caused by the defamation.   What monetary losses have you suffered as a result of the defamation?   Have you lost a job?    

If so you may have real damages to sue over.  To be clear the damages can't be related to the protected video of you talking crazy, but to the defamation accompanying the video.   

NAL
It was, unfortunately, legal for them to film you and post it due to you being in public with no reasonable expectation of privacy. However, editing the video to misrepresent your actions as harassing people is grounds for a slander suit. You mention your brother confirmed this on CCTV so it shouldn‚Äôt be hard to prove. You should see a local attorney who can fully assess how feasible it is to get it taken down and the best way to do so. They‚Äôll also help determine if it‚Äôs worth seeking damages for harm to your reputation.
It was legal for them to film you as there is no expectation of privacy in the US. And TikTok isn't obligated to remove the video if it does not violate any of rules relevant to posting on their platform.
Thank you.

Yes, it was edited with a robotic sounding ominous female voice and white text.

It basically turned the conversation that I was having with an empty car into sounding like I was threatening someone.

The video has been rearranged, and it has also been snipped so you can't see that I am talking to an empty car.

There is also a comment under the video from who I presume is it's creator that says they cut the victim out of the video to protect her identity. They have also edited in silences to make it sound like they were censoring the "victim"'s voice.
It caused me to have a mental health crisis and I lost 3 days of work so far.

People I know shared the TikTok with me because they knew it wasn't in my character to harass a random person.
Thank you.
Even if I was suffering from a medical emergency?

What about the fact the video has been edited to make it look like I am harassing an innocent woman?

(There was nobody else in the vicinity of where I was talking. My brother confirmed this on CCTV)
My brother is trying to speak to someone from TikTok's management, but he has asked me to try and see if I can figure out a legal angle.

He takes care of me while I'm having bad episodes and manages my finances etc.

We're both in our late fifties and I'm honestly scared how I'd cope if anything ever happened to him someday. He's a godsend.
>It caused me to have a mental health crisis and I lost 3 days of work so far.

Why did you lose the three days of work?

Did your employer suspend you because of the false impression conveyed by the video?
NAL, but as i understand it. This could qualify the edited video as a slanderous/defamation work, harming your public image and therefore making it difficult to find jobs, etc.
doesn‚Äôt matter what was happening. in public it is legal to film. this is how all the ‚Äúfirst amendment auditors‚Äù on youtube are able to do what they do. there is no expectation of privacy when in public in the US. 

you mention CCTV‚Äîthe same concept applies. whether the camera was mounted on the wall or in someone‚Äôs hands makes no difference.
I‚Äôm so glad you have him.  
What happened to you is awful. Legal doesn‚Äôt equal moral, so it‚Äôs a shame that it would have been legal if they didn‚Äôt edit it‚Ä¶but they did, so it‚Äôs now illegal.  
I would screen record it (or have your brother do it if it‚Äôs too troubling to watch) so in case TikTok does take it down & you still want to sue, you have it.  
In the meantime, you‚Äôre not in acute distress, which is an improvement & you have a lot of support via your brother & Reddit. I hope everything works out for you.
I wasn't mentally stable. The video threw me off balance and it took me a while under my brother's care to get myself back in a position where I knew I wasn't going to hallucinate mid-shift.
Thank you.

Does it matter that the video was edited with a robotic voice and text to add false context?

E.g. pretending I was harassing someone when I was speaking to myself.
Megathread: Binance CEO CZ Steps Down As Part Of $4 Billion Settlement With DOJ

Binance Coin pros & cons with related info are in the collapsed comments below.
[deleted]
I wonder if this will allow Binance to *properly* operate in the US eventually, now that the case against them is closed and they're going to (presumably) clean up their act.
Suspended sentence. You don't pay 4.3 billion to be put at the mercy of the US courts.
Brian Armstrong is laughing.


It‚Äôs not sexy but there is value in playing by the rules, even if they are dumb. Lobby for change but still follow the law.
Bro still won at life. Steps down as CEO but probably swimming in shares. Still probably a billionaire. That they're settling probably opens up a path to re-charge their US operations
The amount of people in this thread who don't realize this is confirmation that Binance will live on is frustrating.
US Gov slowly seizing all the crypto for ultimate 51% attack üòÇ
This sub is saying Binance is doomed, is what makes me think nothing at all will happen tbh.
So‚Ä¶is Ramen on or off the menu again?
It‚Äôs some timing that Tether announced they have ‚Äúonboarded‚Äù the US Secret Service and FBI onto their platform almost at the exact minute the CZ in Seattle story broke. Bury your bad news alongside worse bad news.
Wow, almost exactly one year since FTX collapsed.
Lol looks like Coinbase won after all
Zhao - "Better to ask for forgiveness than permission" LMFAO
Does this change anything for binance as an exchange and particulary staking? I have a small amount staked, should i move them or is binance continue as usual?
Last thing out of the way for Government approval of the Blackrock ETF. Anyone with a brain knew it would NEVER be approved while Binance held the position it does.
![img](avatar_exp|118044027|starstruck)

Coinbase be like:
I don't want to live interesting times anymore.
I don't have much skin in the game with Binance but I'm concerned what might happen with Kraken and SEC in the coming year.
I think this will mark a before and after in the crypto market. CZ was the last cowboy from the old wild west crypto. Now we will embrace the future where crypto will go mainstream and we will be at mercy of the big ones like Blackrock
They‚Äôre going after Kraken next. Does that basically just leave Coinbase and Robinhood?
[deleted]
OpenAI board just said they are going so put CZ as new CEO
WSJ article: https://archive.is/G8utD
In the WSJ video, they had a quote from a Binance employee filed with the SEC: ‚ÄúWe're operating an unlicensed broker in the US, bro‚Äù
Edit: this was wrong the SEC order to stay in business is still in place as they didn't reach a resolution with the SEC.
This basically just proves the ETF is coming. US doing its best to takeout any competition (Binance, Kraken) before telling you it's safe to buy from Blackrock.
4b to buy some DOJ
So many fucking microwave brain takes in here it‚Äôs no wonder this subreddit is irrelevant

Probably will be a dump now and for the next weeks ahead, but in the long-term it'll be better. Will be a good time to pick up some bags perhaps. Crypto needs to get rid of people like this for it to actually mature and become legit.
This is why satoshi chose to remain anonymous.
He is in Seattle today, to meet with DOJ reps and get arraigned. I am half tempted to head downtown and see if there is any buzz associated with this. Probably not.
I think this announcement will be that they have fined binance and kraken and that they will be introducing strict regulations to avoid exchanges co-mingling funds

They will wanna desperately avoid another ftx, it was embarrassing for them
C Za later
Can‚Äôt keep FUDDING it now. Market already responding that we will be fine
So should i retire all my USDT from Binance? i only use it for the P2P feature.
1) What.
Shouldn't the press conference have started by now?
Anyone got link for press?
Get them coins of the exchange people.
Make no mistake, this is a directly result of SBF falling down. He hired people in regulatory institutions and journalists to wrote hit pieces on CZ long before the FTX drama went down.
The end of an era. Hope he always remains safu.
it's amazing that the price hasn't been more volatile on this news
at this rate CDC will be the last man standing in 5-10 years honestly. Everyone else has skeletons in the closet
As always, take your money off the exchange unless you want to help CZ pay the fine with your money.
I hope this ends well cos I can't fathom another FTX like drama happening again this time from the biggest of them all, so I think we should wish for a good ending to this. If CZ stepping down means that all will end well for crypto, then so be it.
News didn't seem to hit the bitcoin price that much. Very strange.
"BIN NANCE" LMAOO why Yellen pronouncing it like that
The article should read ‚Äúplead guilty to money laundering charges‚Äù. SleeZee finally getting his due.
>Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao is stepping down as CEO of Binance as part of a **major $4 billion settlement** between the Department of Justice and the cryptocurrency exchange he founded, according to sources close to the discussions with the agency.

>>As part of the settlement, **Zhao will also plead guilty to anti-money laundering charges brought by the Department of Justice**. He is scheduled to enter the plea in federal court in Seattle on Tuesday afternoon, the Wall Street Journal reported.
So no 4 this time?
tldr; are funds safu?

Any ideas where this 4B is going to come from...?

BINANZZZZZZZZZ hahahahaha god what a loser boomer yellen is
Did this dude just say CFTC markets? üëÄ
The fuck is wrong with all these assholes??
how much more corruption exists in crypto? FTX, Binance, Kraken. Whats next
Just want to say for any newbies with maybe a couple grand in binance nervously reading this thread to get opinions on whether they should be worried right now, I wouldnt be. (Unless you're in binance US then probably get your crypto off of there)

Best practice to get a hardware wallet and maybe use this as your push to finally get one? But I doubt this will start an actual bank run, as other people are pointing out it should be the end of a lot of troubles in house at Binance.  Calm down but maybe look at some ways to safely store your crypto so you dont have to worry.
can we update this megathread with additional ongoing links to new information? for example, the CZ tweet itself stepping down, the charges and potential jail time, as well as the amount of money he will have to post in the settlement
Markets are slightly down because one person might have to step down from his exec position. But the exchange stays open, and nothing structurally changes? Seems like an overreaction. This is a massive buy signal.
I don't know why people don't use CoinbBase. They are a public company. The CEO isn't backing down from the SEC and they have a huge institution portfolio trading on their platform. Fees might be higher but it's a whole lot safer.
three biggest exchanges in the US at the peak of the bull run:

* FTX - dead due to criminal activity 
* Binance - CEO/founder stepping down due to criminal activity 
* Coinbase - being sued by the SEC for operating as an unregistered securities exchange 

oops
This was the final washing crypto needed‚Ä¶all set for a neat bullrun now
Bullish on $COIN stock lol
Sam Bankman-Fried / FTX ‚úÖ

Changpeng Zhao / Binance ‚úÖ

Brian Armstrong / Coinbase‚ùì
Head of the world's largest exchange pleads guilty to money laundering today, the media all over it. Most crypto traders: "Just another Tuesday.ü•±"
is this the end of Funds are Safu
wonder what's going to happen with binance
4 billion dollars doesn‚Äôt seem like enough of a reason to step down, he‚Äôs definitely entangled in criminal activity as the rest of the crypto exchange leaders are. Can we just have one decent person running a company?
I don't think you people understand how bullish this is for crypto.  Also, I don't think you realize that this means the ETF is approved.

Today crypto officially entered the US capital markets, which are the biggest in the world.

But in hindsight, you will...
The first bad news is the best bad news. Anyone with money on Binance would do well to move it to self custody.

People that think this will be bad for bitcoin price need to put this in context. A major market maker who is known for hedging against customer positions is now going to have a more scrutinous eye over them. This is bullish
CoinbBase is goingto be stronger now.
Do you think they will accept BNB?

Anyone who didnt see Coinbase being on the right side of this hasnt been paying attention.
funds are not safu
Now fine banks for 2008 and send some bankers to jail.
This is great news for most of us. Flush out the powerful scumbags and criminals in the crypto space. CZ's time was coming. He reaped what he sowed. Great opportunity to buy when the dip happens because it should be the last major dip before a bull run.
And this is why people see crypto as a scam
CZ the sacrificial lamb. Bull run is upon us üôèüèº
Bullish on bnb
CZ still owns majority stake in Binance. They letting him keep it so he‚Äôs not really going anywhere. Assuming Binance has the money and survives the inevitable run, it could be good long term as it clears the regulatory cloud hanging over them. 

Having said that, you should still get your stuff off Binance asap. To easy to move crypto to take the risk and leave it
Oof. Do Justin Sun next!
The fact that all of the people happy about this don't see the jaws of legacy finance closing around them is concerning.
Perfect fud for the government to leverage to try and load up on the cheap ahead of the imminent bull run‚Ä¶always some shady shit to get their control in order‚Ä¶shitty ass people controlling the world
Damn
Damn. This is a big day for the future of crypto.
We can‚Äôt do a week without some kinda drama! Here comes the volatility

So would this be a net positive? Couldn't this be construed as an admission of guilt?

EDIT: can't type.
CZ is SAFU!
Well, shiiiiit.
Get ready for a massive dump gents.
Great. More uncertainty in the market ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Wow.  Not a slow news day!
I'm glad this news broke before the next halving, hopefully it won't ruin our bull run.

So Kraken next?

Anyone noticed SEC has never come after Crypto.com?

$4b would contribute a nice compensation payout to XRP sufferers :)
Ponzi
DoJ will have a fucking awesome christmas party this year
so the only competitive exchanges left will only be located in the USA?

also why is he paying more in fines than Deutsche bank, that bank is literally like #1 when it comes to money laundering
End of an era...
AML and sanctions violations. No issues with the product, no implosion or anything. This reeks of some statist bullshit
Maybe it won't remain the largest exchange, but without doubts it has been the major contributor to bring the market where it is today.  
  
CZ executed perfectly for years and kept running an exchange super efficient and reliable for users in the critical years, when everyone and each politician and regulator was shitting on crypto and the whole space was constantly on the verge of imploding (remember BCH, Tether, Chinese and Indian bans, the mining crisis, the devastating crypto crash of 2018, the fall of CoinCheck, BitGrail, QuadrigaCX...).  
While all this was happening, Binance brought futures, staking, lending, yield farming, tokenized stocks, a DEX, and thousands of trading pairs, with no major withdrawal issues, even in the most critical moments.  
  
BlackRock and the others will just come now that the critical part is done, to reap the benefits with their incomparable firepower.

Anyone can talk without doing anything, and sure they were not perfect, but without the CZs and the Bukeles to be the first to try, we wouldn't be were we are today.
FTX wont happen again. Relax.
Took time, but finally he's out. He was a scammer through and through and was almost as shady as SBF if you ask me.
CDC will take over thank you.
This shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone with even half a brain. We all knew CZ was doing some shady shit.
This is proof, that self custody is king(don‚Äôt keep large amounts on any exchange), and not to buy an exchange token such as BNB, FTX
Bye binance
Black swan event coming in 3 2 1. Hope yall got your money out of Binance already.
So one question, should i get my money out of binance as soon as i can or not? Been saving a few hundred dollars can't really afford to lose them?

If so what's the safest stable coin and what the best place to save them?
With this plea deal, Binance is gonna be under so much oversight that it‚Äôll be unable to operate normally. If you still have any assets sitting on the exchange, it‚Äôs time to start considering self-custody.

Edit: while I‚Äôm not implying that Binance isn‚Äôt solvent, holding your assets on Binance‚Äôs BSC blockchain is practically the same as holding it in Binance. This is because almost all major assets on BSC are backed by Binance (or ‚ÄúBinance-pegged‚Äù as labelled on bscscan).
Holy! End of an era, CZ literally won in life
Good riddance! I‚Äôm glad we are clearing the scammers out of high power positions.
Just rip off the bandaid and get it over with!
I feel like this is bullish‚Ä¶
Well the market is down not to bad at this point but I‚Äôve just had to set a bunch of price alerts ‚ÄºÔ∏è down.   Hopefully, some bargains to be had, probably also be some redistribution to other CEX‚Äôs, which is actually good in a way.   

It‚Äôs so much better than going belly up, I remember something about him/them not stopping selling to Russians for quite a while.  Always thought that was putting a target on your back at a time, where there was a lot angst going on.
 *1)* what
Sad to see Binance and CZ down this road, however, it is not new. Now more than ever, the need for more simplified [DEX](https://np.reddit.com/r/zetablockchain/comments/1376kop/defi_amm_platform_towerdefi_now_supports_twstzeta/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)/DeFi platforms is a priority.
Must be some shit going down with binance. Or does this link work for anyone else? 

https://www.coinglass.com/Balance

I watch exchange balances regularly and it seems like something wrong lol
So the government has $4 billion to fight the rest of the exchanges
Awesome fkin news if true!
BNB is only down 6% this is a dip for ants.
So they pay the fine and they are good?
Prices tanked quickly on FTX news. This may be bullish for the market‚Ä¶
Bullish tbh
He‚Äôs stepping down and turning himself in. Binance is toast.
This a good for bitcorn
My bet is that Binance will be fine. 

This is the classic movement when banks fuck things up. You pay a fine < profit and someone steps down so they can move on. At much [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) dies.
Nothingburger confirmed. Buy BNB
I‚Äôm sure this doesn‚Äôt need to be said, as history has had to make us all smarter by now, but get your coins off of Binance ASAP. There will be a bank run, they have to payout $4.3 bil and we have no clue how much they have.
Wait, y'all think someone not corrupt is going to take his place!? üòÑ üòÑ üòÑ üòÑ
Big discounts on bnb ahead?
So does this make cdc the next one to be investigated? Lol
It is an honour and with the deepest humility that I step into the role of Binance‚Äôs new CEO.

We operate the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. The trust placed on us by our 150m users and thousands of employees is a responsibility that I take seriously and hold dear.

With CZ, and our leadership team‚Äôs support, I have accepted this role so that we can continue to meet and exceed the expectations of stakeholders while achieving our core mission, the freedom of money.

The foundation on which Binance stands today is stronger than ever.

To ensure a bright future, I intend to use everything I‚Äôve learned over the past three decades of financial services and regulatory experience to guide our remarkable, innovative, and committed team.

My focus will be on:

1) reassuring users that they can remain confident in the financial strength, security and safety of the company
2) collaborating with regulators to uphold high standards globally that foster innovation while providing important consumer protections
3) working with partners to drive growth and adoption of Web3

We are here to stay.  Please lend me your support. Excited for the days ahead!

Richard Teng
I don't understand why this caused a dump
Once upon a time there was a man named CZ. He started a big place like Binance where people could trade special coins called crypto. CZ worked hard to make Binance the most popular and the biggest place for trading crypto.

CZ had to talk to many important people and sometimes they didn't get along but he always tried to make things better and help everyone use Binance safely.

One day, some people thought that CZ and Binance weren't doing things right. They wanted CZ to pay a lot of money and promise to follow the rules better.

CZ agreed to pay the money and promised to do things right.

And so, CZ and Binance kept helping people trade crypto, and everyone was happy.

The end. Happy ending. BTC to 1M by EOY.
If your respective crypto exchange is not publicly traded...RIP said exchange.
It was all a ponzi
4 billion is a ass wipe for him. crypto exchanges make so much money its not even fun y
Oh crap, I can't withdraw my funds from Binance now, it's asking me to configure an additional verification method
nice some Black Friday crypto rebates‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüôèüëç

Good riddance!
Are we fucked?
What should i invest in for this dump?
Why did he do that? Why didn't he fight? I don't understand.
4
So much people trying to cause panic and the only thing this means is that Binance belongs to the ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù group.
I expected this to drop markets more tbh
Is there anyone in crypto who is not 100% a scam artist at this point
And ..... Tether just so happened to print $4 Billion in Tether in the last 30 days. ü§î Hmmm.
simple protip: by the dip on BNB. youre welcome
Copy-pasting my comment from EthTrader:

Banks and centralized exchanges shouldn't be forced to act as nodes of a global financial surveillance system, as the financial crimes enforcement agencies advocate.

The idea that as long as bad people exist in the world, we should have to all give up our privacy and be subject to mandates that require our private transactions to be reported to centralized surveillance clearing houses like FinCEN, is deeply illiberal.

The financial mass-surveillance system, euphemized as anti-money laundering controls, started really being built in 1989, with the G7 summit agreement to create the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) which coordinates financial surveillance ("AML") laws between states. Since then, it has imposed massive costs on the law-abiding majority, while not having any demonstrable impact on reducing terrorism, nuclear proliferation or drug trafficking.

There are other ways to deal with radical anti-social groups and drug traffickers than putting the entire world under surveillance, under pain of imprisonment.
How do you get $4B in cryptocurrency?  
Invest $8B!

CZ on the way down...
I knew something was up when I wasn't able to withdraw $4.67 in BNB last night for gas fees on some shitcoins I was clearing out of a hotwallet!
Bank run?
BTC is going to bleed slowly then recover
Don't drop the soap CZ.
I thought Binance was untouchable. Terrible news for the space, as Binance was one of, if not, the biggest crypto exchange.

CZ was a big part of that.
Seems Bitcoin doesn't care.   Onward to ATH folks, sorry to all the shitcoiners.
Goddamnit. Can the crypto bad news please stop already! I need to cash out soon to buy some non-crypto goods and these swings are freaking annoying,
2024 = w/ Binance (potentially) gone, the rise of DEXs has to happen for altcoin trading to continue to exist

Otherwise 95% of altcoins will just die due to low liquidity
This is good for Bitcoin.  The U.S. is regulating.  

Bitcoin isn't FTX.  Bitcoin isn't Binance.  Bitcoin isn't Coinbase.  

What this means is the U.S. is not going after Bitcoin, they're going after bad actors.  

This will pave the way for legitimate institutions to move in to the space, which ultimately will help with adoption.
Bubu Drama Bears shitting the bed while CZ looks at it as the way forward?
Market barely moved down with this news. If this news broke just 9 months ago, everything would've been nuked 30% today.
Lol been here since early 17 , this is the time to BUY!!
Boy SBF wishes that was him, hahaha
Pure fraud‚Ä¶ should put him in jail !
all in OG pepecoin from 2016 lol

i've been calling cz shit for 4-5YEARS now..finally caught up with him.  about damn time!!!

justin sun too, he's worse.

anyhow, btc will dip a bit now but overall this SHOULD BE BULLISH.  btc and alts should run up thru dec and beyond!!!!!!
If Binance goes down crypto is fucked for many many years
The truth is nobody cares.
Back to safemoon
What are you buying on this dip?
We are used to this. Those who want to sell can do so. Our role now is to buy.
That‚Äôs an absolutely absurd fine. Fucking WST scammers gets a tiny slap on the wrist for working with drug cartels, almost crushing the global economy - twice, and overall fucking us all into the ground. 

But when it‚Äôs done in crypto, it warrants record breaking fines? Lol.
Extremely bullish tbh
crypto is such a joke.
Good riddance CZ. For the long-term, shaking out shady CEX practices and shady CEOs is good for crypto.
People do not realize how good this is for the crypto space. This guy has been a plague on us for a decade. He single handedly has been propping up billions of dollars of value of absolute shitcoins. Created a cut and paste copy of ETH and centralized it and it‚Äôs been pumping out scam after scam. He‚Äôs bought the biggest price tracker and done some super shady manipulations with it.

It‚Äôs also hard for people to understand. If Binance fails and users find out they thought they had BITCOIN or another coin but in turns out they actually didn‚Äôt. That is deflationary on the supply. Binance told a person they owned bitcoin and that person had it accounted for on their portfolio and Binance was using it somewhere else and had it on a different portfolio.
Cash is king, prepare for a potential Crypto winter.
But bye CZ
Should we be worried holding on Binance ?
Shitcoins dumping
I guess i'll be back being poor.
BNB coin in the dumps
hey cz, say hi to ur buddy sbf from me
Do Tether next!
Would it be smart to short Bnb??
Look at those ears
So Bloomberg at least is saying that CZ still potentially faces jail time of up to 18 months.
Is anyone experiencing delays with withdrawals? I have had a 'waiting for approval' on my withdrawal for about an hour. It's XNO so is usually very fast.
Binance has been shady for a long time. I can't understand that anyone still holds any of their assets there.
Thank you! This is an awesome summary.
Great summary. Thanks for taking the time to repost!
If you have ever watched the movie "American Gangster" with Denzel Washington you would know it is mostly about paying off the cops.

This whole Binance ordeal is same thing.  Government just wants their share.
As part of the settlement, Binance must also "completely exit" operations in the US
Sounds like bad news but it's actually great news. After all is done Binance will have free range to compete against Coinbase in the US.
Thank you for the explanation.
I too can use ChatGPT.
Good bot
That would be great. More competition and oversight.
You gotta think that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs doing this to begin with
You gotta think that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs doing this to begin with
sec doesnt seem to participate at the moment and they have some investigations as well, might just be the beginning and he might still go to jail in the end
> It‚Äôs not sexy but there is value in playing by the rules, even if they are dumb.

Is it though? How do you know Binance hasn't profited far more from their crimes than their fine amounts to?
He still remains to be sentenced, and has a continuing issue with the SEC.
People are too scared from FTX collapse
Binance has gone too far, to much effort, built too much, worth too much. It‚Äôd be pointless and stupid, just like FTX, to destroy itself to scam everyone. 

Why not live as a Billionaire, free. Rather than piss off everyone and governments‚Äô worldwide. Then you‚Äôll have to deal with a bunch of bs for years and fight to avoid jail. 

Only SBF would choose the jail option instead of a billionaire life.
Yup. This basically means that Binance is to big to fall but we still have the guys interested on the panic
They just said that binance will exit US market asap
Time to buy some BNB then. Jk
- fined for 4 billion dollar for money laundering and a litany of other crimes

- CEO has to step down

- dozens of key personal left during the last weeks

- US branch forcibly shut down by the government

- CEO pleaded guilty for violations of a litany of crimes

- independent monitor team will audit Binance for next years to assure compliance

- SEC lawsuit still ongoing


Yep, totally bullish on Binance.
This sub also had a hard on for Sam and moons

Cz was honestly the goat. Provided a great exchange during the heart of the bull market. The redditors here thinking he was running some underground liquidation mafia or shady dealings they were never able to actually expand upon when called out -  just lol

A salute to cz for his farewell unlike sam
Yeah, this seems to me like one of the best scenarios CZ/Binance could have hoped for. He avoids jail, still retains ownership, company pays a relatively small fine and 2/3rds of the cases against them are done.
People using this logic is so stupid.

This sub is dumb, but this logic is even dumber.
Bullish
I don't understand your Tether comment.

What does that mean for Tether?
Remember remember the crypto movember.
For the curious of the FTX timeline, [A timeline of cryptocurrency exchange FTX's historic collapse](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/timeline-cryptocurrency-exchange-ftxs-historic-collapse/story?id=93337035)
Admitted COIN bag holder and I have agree with every ounce of bias I have üòÇ
is he wrong
Safest course is not to keep it on binance - no one has a crystal ball but there's clearly risk there
[deleted]
Who knows? Better to move it and be safe
Funds are safu! I called CZ and he just told me
If Binance goes down the crypto market will go down so I dont see any difference
RemindMe! 2 months
Why though?
Gonna remember this.
I'm glad someone finally mentioned this. I can't believe so many people have missed this, this is mainly BlackRock pulling the strings. ETF has been fast tracked now CZ has stepped down. 

This is crazy lol.
I use CDC, feel like I‚Äôm the only one though, LOL
Didnt they already charge them with something?  or was that the SEC?
This is hysterical, holy crap ü§£
Fuck, I hope not. üò¢
Crypto.com?
Next on the list. You will only be able to buy with the ETF or a DEX like bisq
I‚Äôm happily using Gemini
The SEC has already gone after coinbase
Plenty of other places sell just bitcoin which in my opinion is all you need :)
But if you are worried new exchanges will form eventually who learn from the mistakes of all of these past exchanges.
He has been liquidating traders left and right since beginning of futures, still will tough to cough up 4billi in cash, doj surely won't take 4billi usdt
Ooh, maybe Microsoft will hire him!
That quote was from months ago, yet people still defended CZ. I‚Äôm surprised this all didn‚Äôt happen years ago. It‚Äôs been painfully obvious for a long time.
[deleted]
Wasnt wall street gonna buy ftx or something
DOJcoin
Thats for CZ personally - 1.8bil in fines and 2.5bil in money judgment for binance
Jail time is unlikely strong enough as no users have lost money.
Nice car though
>Probably will be a dump now and for the next weeks ahead

Why? It's one less impediment to ETF acceptance.
And also didn‚Äôt break international law which was pretty big
Better safe than sorry. Ftx was also deemed to big to fail at one point
A bankrun is incoming, so you better do it fast.
Few minutes I think
Trying,  but the majority of my coins are bags of shit coins that are way too low to transfer,  and id be losing hundreds of dollars converting them
Guess it takes a sleazeball to know one.  They didn't like each other because they were reflections of themselves
None of that would've mattered if the allegations were false.
And didn't CZ back out of a merger with FTX?
BNB down 7% in the last hour alone. Could likely plunge 10-20%
Coinbase and CDC but I feel like coinbase has an edge
Can't see this killing binance.  But if I had any funds there I'd certainly be removing them immediately nonetheless
Not really, Binance is going to keep operating. CZ was always shady, so him being out as CEO is good. Having to pay a massive fine for being shady might actually stop them from being so shady in future. The Binance DOJ case is finished. All in all, great for the crypto market.
1% down, far sight from the doomsayers preaching ‚ÄúBitcoin will die if anything happens to CZ‚Äù
I also plead guilty to anti-money laundering charges. That's good, right?
Wonder what happen to his waifu/co-founder/baby mama.
Tether issuance!
Users.
They'll pay off the fine owed the gov. for the crime of fraud by selling user funds (committing even more fraud) resulting in additional fines which they'll pay by selling more user funds. 

It's the circle of crypto life.
Just a different type of \*fine\*.
Drama this year has been pretty epic. üòé
Bank run
üíØ 

Weeding out the scammers and regulating centralized exchanges/shitcoins is exactly what this industry needs.
>This is a massive buy signal.

Should be. One less impediment to ETF acceptance.
I don't think people understand how bullish this news is. When the market realizes it, you're gonna see one of the biggest green dildos of all time.

Binance continues to operate, DOJ case is over, shady CZ is out of the picture. So bullish.
Even FTX after it's massive scandal could make a comeback according to gensler.  Binance will be fine.  One exec is gone.  No big deal. 

 People get too caught up in cults of personality around big fortune names like CZ and SBF.  Partially because of media frenzies.  Crypto is bigger than any one dude.
Not everyone lives in the US. In most asian and 3rd world countries binance is a lifesaver if you want to use crypto because of the low fees.
I think some people used Binance specifically because they were shady. They'd add shady coins quickly, it was a degen paradise.
CDC looking better and better
Not sure how accurately ‚ÄúPeak of the bull run‚Äù currently defines the state of the market if I‚Äôm being honest.
I wholeheartedly agree. I can't think of too many other people that need to get flushed out of crypto. CZ was the last in my opinion.
*laughs in usdt*
Thats a no brainer if you think that a bullrun will happen and dont know what projects to put money into. Coin will go up no matter which one does
I like cone
Coin has paid of so well for me
Justin Sun / Poloniex would be preferable
Highly unlikely Coinbase is as dirty as the others while being publicly traded in NYS.  Regulations there are incredibly strict.
Unlike the others listed Armstrong has been very transparent about his holdings and been working with regulators more closely than any of the other big crypto names to bring regulation to the wild west that was crypto.  

If they try and take him down next they better have a rock solid reason or be ready for a *hard* fight.
>Sam Bankman-Fried / FTX ‚úÖ

>Changpeng Zhao / Binance ‚úÖ

Tit for tat, probably
At this point i wouldve been suprised if we DIDNT see another black swan this year
Binance will survive
You do, Brian Armstrong. The problem is shitcoin trading isn‚Äôt a sustainable business model so you‚Äôre forced to resort to scamming to make money.
Can you please expound rather than being cryptic?
I‚Äôm supposed to be hanging xmas lights but this is crazy
That is a naive view on crypto price action. There‚Äôs always the suspicion that past price action was only possible because of lacking oversight and shady business.
More like funds are stfu
Funds are not only SAFU, now they have the stamp of approval from the US Justice Department.
He violated AML procedures - meaning steps to ensure sanctioned countries/groups don‚Äôt use it for unlawful payments. It‚Äôs literally a paperwork issue. Funds are perfectly SAFU.
You do realise big finance scumbags are just positioning to take over?
Yeah my thoughts exactly.  We've had a good early pre bull run up but it's all been so fast.   I'll welcome a pullback if this sparks one and fill my bags up more.  

In the end this'll be good for crypto,  bad actors have to go,  even if they've helped build up crypto like cz or sbf.   Doubt this'll take down binance though.
I took want to defend a crypto billionaire...because we all know they're the most honest of the bunch...they care about us!
Binance is not superior to legacy finance. Goodbye likely fractional reserve trading on XMR! Wonder if we'll see its price go up
IDK that panicking is a good response either.  Maybe we don't see jaws because they're not really there.  

This has been a long time coming and if you're surprised by this you probably weren't watching binance's/CZ's issues very closely.
That's what everyone wanted right?! Now the Blackrock ETF will be approved. Blackrock is essentially the US government nowadays
Funny how these exchanges are getting knocked off before blackrock swoops in.
A guilty plea is an admission of guilt.

Thats what people said about FTX üò≠
He is keeping majority ownership
ehh. SBF on a whole different level
If you can't really afford to lose the money then they shouldn't be in the crypto market at all, let alone on a sketchy exchange.
You still kept in there after voyager, Celcius, gemini, Luna, FTX etc.  There was a big fall out 6-18 months ago, you should have gotten it out a long time ago
It was time to start considering self custody when FTX went under lol.
[deleted]
Just a small thing happening to binance.
May be?  This means Binance is as safe as the Department of Justice itself.  This is more than just bullish, this is irrational moonboy bullish.
Why's that?
My bet is that binance will be fined :D
Maybe it will mean it will open up main binance to US customers.
They will be just fine, they make a fuck ton of money, 4.3b is no issue for them
Personally I'll not be touching it with a 12 foot pole, exchange coins have crappy use cases imo.  But we'll see.   Apparently FTX might come back though so perhaps I'm way off the mark here too.  It's a crazy industry
Big discounts on everything ahead.
Justin Sun's probably getting scared
Not only is CDC already working with SEC and other US lawmakers, CZ tried to bank run them about a year ago and failed.

Anyone HODLing CRO ‚Äúmay‚Äù see some nice price action, due to this news.
honestly id be shocked, they've got a squeaky clean record when it comes to following government regulation across every country they operate.

...yet another reason why I firmly believe they'll be the last man standing
You don‚Äôt understand why the biggest exchange and one of the most influential and recognizable faces in crytpo pleading guilty, paying $4.3 billion and said CEO having to step down, caused a dump?
Paper hands.
A dump is 5% now?
Damn it lol you had me until the 1m too
Dex is the way to go
[deleted]
If you know you did way shadier shit than doj said they knew, you take a deal
Probably because he just has to pay a fine and they won‚Äôt prosecute him
You mean why he came to talk to the DOJ like Caroline instead of hiding like Do-hyung or fighting like Sam? I have no idea...
Because you don‚Äôt fight the DoJ
4.3

...

billion
I mean Binance itself is fine, CZ might have a few problems to solve but Binance is ok
Funds are not safu
Mf is in his own resort island. You don't go to jail if u can pay a $4B fine.
Binance was never untouchable. Nobody with any power cared, until now. Why? Because the big players want in.

And they don't like competition.

The old exchanges have to be replaced by the legacy financial exchanges.

After the ETF, then they'll tackle Defi and private self-custody.

Where's that grim reaper meme?
Pretty good news actually. Binance concerns are past us.
Yeah, now it‚Äôs in vogue to call anyone speculating on other projects ‚Äúshitcoiners‚Äù. Terrible. Been 65% BTC for 7+ years, btw.
100k end of year!!!!!

Think I heard this before üòÄ
Why do you have money you "need" in crypto?
If you need the money now, best thing to do is sell right away. Just saying.. don‚Äôt hold out for a better price if you do not have time, that is just gambling
Lmao you‚Äôre cashing out NOW? Ngmi
This is actually great news long term as its a massive plus for etf approval
No way.
[deleted]
Binance isn't shutting down. Even if they slowly fade away over time, the liquidity will just slosh around to different exchanges. It's not like crypto traders are going to stop trading crypto.
Binance will remain with a new CEO
Binance is too big to fall I don't see that happening
Highly doubt that.

This is bad for crypto.

Maybe the crypto echo chamber doesn‚Äôt care.
Binance settling instead of getting destroyed isn't a bad outcome at all. Furthermore, the fact that CZ will lose a lot of influence in the industry also isn't a bad thing.
Comments like this make me want to buy more tbh.
We just had that. Halving does not care about politics
????????
I wonder the same
If you're still holding on any exchange by now it's no one else's fault by your own if you get locked out of your funds
[deleted]
SEC can't send people to jail. They can only issue fines.
SEC is civil.
He‚Äôs talking long-term because you‚Äôre still allowed to play the game. It‚Äôs clear Binance being #1 and running very shady practices made more. At peak 2021 CZ was thought to be one of the richest people in the world. 

No doubt this is a massive blow to him and Binance, and like the comment you‚Äôre referring to, this is great for COIN in every way.
SEC is civil, they can throw fines but jail would require justice department.   


Not to mention he probably flee to China to avoid extradition. China only extradite if US offer something to exchange, and it is politically tough swallow for US to agree for any swap now.
He lives in UAE, hell be all right
Case still isn‚Äôt strong enough as no users have lost money, unlike FTX.
Can explain? Im paranoid now since I am 100% on binance...
That fine was priced in from the very beginning. CZ isn't stupid.
Like FTX?? FTX was around 3 years total... they were trash that managed to get the right hype at the right time
Inverse r/cc.
This still makes CZ and genius compared to SBF.  The three years cooling off will mean he can distance himself from any scams if there are any waiting to blow up in the next few years at Binance (maybe divest some stock if they is expected).

And if the company is straight ish he can rejoin it later on.

And likely no prison time, or at worst he has to be in a low security federal camp for a few months.  Instead of doing a few decades.
It absolutely and unironically is bullish, you just don‚Äôt understand it
Nothing much, except that criminals should avoid transferring over Tether.
it's binance us paying the fine and not binance as an org?
Any recommendation to other platforms who offer staking/wallets?
Imagine millions of Americans investing in a Bitcoin ETF but some shady Chinese exchange continues to disregard anti-money laundering laws, wash trade, manipulate the price, etc
You are not alone on CDC! :) I use both coinbase (since 2017) and CDC (since around 2021 mostly for coins that coinbase does not support) and I've been using their visa debit card for nearly 2 years now. I am still a very satisfied customer despite their changes in cashback and spotify/netflix. I don't know why I should use binance or kraken when I have those 2 and when everything is smooth and also withdraws to my bank account are always successful within 2 days.
[deleted]
Which options would you recommend? I only saved my money on Binance for the p2p just like I said before, besides that I have no idea which exchange or wallet would be better and safer. 

I hate when these news happen.
How's it feel to live in the future
IMO SBF is the shittier person. But I'm not making excuses for CZ. any bad actor in that kind of position in crypto should go to jail
Glad I sold mine last week then!
Why anyone would trust a foreign exchange with zero regulation is beyond me. At least with Coinbase you get audited statements.
I've used both, but stick with CDC mainly for the Visa card. I've got the Icy White one, in which it generates me a good 6k (worth of CRO) in interest each year, plus an additional 5-10k in bonus CRO which I use to turn into BTC. Thing is practically a money printer lol
Hefty fine draining alot of liquidity + a bank run can ruin anyone TBH just a heads up, don‚Äôt be fooled
Any other ideas? :D
But could it be a bank run into Bitcoin?
Interesting take. Fully agree but let's see how it pans out.
I agree. But first the weak hands need to be flushed out.
>it was a degen paradise.

MEXC: *am I a joke to you?*
This.
So you're saying there's a chance... that CRO might recover?
i‚Äôm talking about 2021
Justin Sun is still active.
Same here,  nice.  I'm very glad I've been stacking it for diversification reasons.  Def safer than most alts,  and still very rewarding
I'm finally up after holding thru the downturn and averaging lower.  i'm too chicken to play with options.

But i'm curious, why is this good for $COIN?  Binance as an entity is still going to be around and a huge player.  i think being a public traded company on a US exchange is the real alpha in this equation.  Not sure if the markets overlap too much anyway.

I'd love a few more reasons to hold this puppy to my moon target.
üòÖ
It really doesnt deserve to tho
No I understand that price action isn‚Äôt just market makers and Hedgies against ‚Äúus little guys.‚Äù But more oversight into binance is good for the customer and for markets
I wouldn't call it panic, I would call it disgust.

The SEC is there to protect the revolving door of banksters that move back and forth between the regulatory agencies and the institutions they are supposed to regulate.  

Anyone that thinks Bitcoin is better for having the same old racketeering empire insert itself as "the protectors" should go back to feeding those greedy assholes with their 401ks and index funds.
I only use binance as a third party banking option and my way to acess international finance, i really don't use trade markets and all, because where i live the banking system is closed off and with limited accessibility so basically USDT is my only option to pay internationally.
But what's happening with binance has me on my toes fearing that we might have a second FTX collapse XD
Yup, but every time you go into a binance thread you‚Äôll see its defenders yelling FUD.
WINNING
Bank run into cash and partially bitcoin I feel is about to occur
Heard the same things about FTX. Protect yourselves. It‚Äôs so easy to move crypto, just move it and don‚Äôt worry
FOMC minutes in 25 mins
Sweet! Only exchange I have used‚Ä¶ and big supporter of CRO‚Ä¶

In 30 minutes? Sorta yeah
Yeah because it's OBVIOUSLY going to 100 million...
SEC is an old security dude at the mall who carries a walkie talkie.

DOJ is Robocop.
Indeed. This will make the market more stable in the long run
I've dipped my toe into the shit pool a few time as well and every time I do I'm reminded why there's only 1 BTC.
Shit!  It‚Äôs almost EOY 2021 again?
Need the moneyz. Inflation and interest are a bitch.
Few understand
So was FTX and look what happened there
As easy as CZ agreed to pay indulgence leads me to the fact they must have found some pretty shitty secrets.

Hope at least Kraken is clean...
We are expecting Jail time, correct?

$4.3 billion in fines and literal money laundering charges HAS to result in jail time for the officers of the company. 

How much time is he looking at? Do you think they will just slap him with a measly one year or will it be on a much larger scale? I‚Äôd assume 20 years based on the size of the fine?
The DOJ was the one to file criminal charges against CZ and that‚Äôs what is in the news today.

https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution
yeah but what they uncover can end him up in jail, they alleged some pretty serious stuff
Something I feel is missing on these Reddit post are the DOJ links, the US treasurey link, and the link from FinCEN

>He‚Äôs talking long-term because you‚Äôre still allowed to play the game.

The plea deal still allows Binance to continue operating, and for CZ to maintain majority ownership. If that's "not being allowed to play the game" then I want to be kicked out, too.

This dude isn't "out of the game" until he's in a prison cell. And we all know that'll never happen.
According to their financials, coinbase is still losing money on a quarterly basis
> Zhao resides in the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), which lacks a mutual extradition treaty with the U.S.

He doesn't need to flee to China.  Also, I believe he originally moved his operations away from China because of anti-crypto policies there.
> Not to mention he probably flee to China to avoid extradition. 

People say that, but in practice it doesn't happen very much. You definitely get sentenced guilty if you flee an indictment and will spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder.
Lol if I were him I wouldn‚Äôt even bother thinking of flee to China. China has bad reputation for rich people.
He's following the standard crypto playbook.

Many joke the only way to become a Millionaire is to start out as a Billionaire.

CZ probably going from Trillionaire to Billionaire xD
*trades BNB for Safemoon*
Mfer should see life in jail. If you don‚Äôt pay the IRS $5K you are fucked, he commits a LOT of financial crimes, and he just pay a fine (which is huge, but he most likely made more from the crimes he committed). 

The system is fucked up.
Never stake with any platform. Only do it the decentralized way if you want to be sure.
Staking usually ends up bad. But if you really want to then go defi route. Always going to recommend cold wallet and hold.
4b in lunc and then they will talk lol
Like shit
You'll get no argument from me there haha.  SBF was/is many shades darker than CZ.   But that doesn't make CZ any cleaner. 

One at a time I guess..
That‚Äôs a good reason to use CDC. For Americans cdc absolutely sucks to use the spread is insane. Coinbase is the most trustworthy in my opinion so I‚Äôm willing to pay the fees on advanced trade even if kraken or cdc is cheaper
Small time retail users. He isn't gonna touch Cartel/Big players/mob/terrorists etc.
It's hated here now, so it will definitely recover
It‚Äôs still up from where it was for most of the year‚Ä¶ but ya?
Because many think coin is undervalued because a) crypto b) competition and this is good for the competitor side of things, bad for cryptospace.

Coins publicly traded so this type of news will have an effect.
Hey man, im on the same boat, I'm gonna go atm with exodus wallet before investing on a hardware wallet. If anything I'll move my money from exodus to Binance as needed. Hope this helps.
yup same, I've been bullish on them the whole time and I've got the Icy White Metal VISA card.  Even after the reduced rates, it still nets me a shit ton of value. Absolutely nuts to me how many people seem to be sleeping on it.
Cool story. I have about 50% more BTC than I had 7 years ago because of ‚Äúdipping my toe‚Äù into shitcoins such as ETH, ATOM, ADA, LINK, etc, etc‚Ä¶
Well it was also ran by complete idiots so it's a different story.
Very different scenario tho
It‚Äôs really easy. Because crypto is not controlled by banks individuals can trade monetary value despite sanctions.
Maybe by the time I want to sell some of my crypto again, there'll be a crypto exchange that isn't dodgy as fuck, but after everything that's gone on in the last two years, I don't even know.
Seems like **nobody** is clean tbh.
[deleted]
He pretty much paid the "troll tax" to cross the bridge which is The American Market.
Coinbase has higher fees because they aren't making tons of extra cash by doing shady ass shit every day.
This. They have their place in the market. Short/mid term gains on alts, flip into BTC for the long term.
You know what they say:

" do not ask me how did I earned my first 10 million. all the others I can gladly show you how. 

need to adjust figures to inflation though :)

Makes sense to me
You get it, Wolf‚Ä¶
McDonald's Instagram Hacked, Leading to $700k Rugpull
30 mins ago, the McDonald's Instagram was hacked, with a Solana contract for a token named $GRIMACE posted. The post stated that this was "A McDonald's experiment on Solana".

[A McDonald's Experiement lol](https://preview.redd.it/ud6zd2vus1kd1.jpg?width=2554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f1bb9b2e06e294f4fd82149454ab94d54cc0f9f)

It's mind-boggling how account takeover hacks continue to be as successful as they are, particularly with accounts that have no connection to crypto. The scammers made off with $700k, but not before repping the Indian flag and thanking everyone for the $700k in the account's bio. Lol.

[Lol.](https://preview.redd.it/hvok9akkp1kd1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cb5f0ec1c65cc44724b7293672bff7ee2b33516)

Unfortunately, the degenerates who spent money on this token will now have to go work for the same company that rugpulled them. Another sad day for crypto.

[McDonald's is always hiring](https://i.redd.it/07d3c6deq1kd1.gif)

[A quick $700k in 15 mins](https://preview.redd.it/1l2zyq3is1kd1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26c87a299f976257d646771f35cfd3a8f596e1c3)

Be careful out there folks.
It‚Äôs back for a limited time only. 

The ~~McRib~~ McRug
Yes scammers are bad but how tf does any social media account get you to invest in something you know fksht about and then you cry when you get rugpulled , I just dont get it.
Grimace released a statement insisting he has no involvement with this token.  

Another suspect, Hamburglar, was asked about the incident but declined to comment.
Then he said: IM RUGGIN' IT
Anyone who thought this was actually McDonalds randomly deciding to launch a memecoin deserves to get rugged
Didn't realize Wojak worked his way up to the marketing department at corporate.
Any info on how the account was taken over ? I just can't imagine McDonald's not having multi factor authentication enabled.
Does india just not care about all the scammers in the country, I don't get it
Unfortunately the world will never run out of idiots
Instagram/META also makes it impossible to recover your account if it gets hacked. They don‚Äôt give any fucks about the people who use their platform. It happened to so many of the people on my IG. It‚Äôs definitely social engineering, not really hacking, but it‚Äôs messed up.
How is this even possible man...
The message they left is priceless lol
Why McDonald‚Äôs why not Wendy‚Äôs
Grimace.  What an ironic name.  Terrible, terrible, irony.
I'm sorry but anyone falling for that deserves to lose their money.

McDonald's, one of the biggest companies in the world, suddenly, out of the blue releases a meme coin and announces it on Instagram...

Some people will believe anything
Lost a trick here. If that was called the McToken they'd have stolen millions.
North Korea hackers trying to divert attention waving India flag.
I‚Äôm speechless
Who the fuck was dumb enough to fall for this?
I'm amazed McDonald's insta can be hacked more than how stupid people are to believe this
Not Grimace, is nothing sacred lol
Ethereum
And BTC are the standard everything else is a gamble
Rug For The Win
Yo hear me out what if this was an inside job by a mcdonalds employee who was a crypto degen before - Then he pulled this off now hes a crypto degen again but also a criminal. It was a cycle all along
mc what?
lol normies ain't ever coming back
Everyone who bought this knew it was gonna rug, they just weren‚Äôt quick enough to sell
Guys, please just stay the fuck away from Solana Shitcoins...for your own good.
Are people this stupid or do you think it perhaps autobuy bots got wrecked?
Moons
People who buy alts, lol
I've been rugpulled because I thought time limit was 1 week while it was 2 days
Anyone who bought this deserves to lose their money imo. 

No sympathy.
So people within 30 minutes of seeing this post have thrown money at this?

I mean...
Nano doesn't have this problem.
people are plain dumb, they will invest in the cockroach meme coin if they can
Sad day for McDonald's more like.... Secure your corporate accounts
It blows my mind that in 2024, there are $700k worth of people dumb enough to fall for this.

Like, it **must** have been a single guy that just happens to be rich because inheritance or something...

How do so many people are at the same time SO¬†dumb, but also capable of making this much money...

Doesn't compute.
Why does anybody follow McDonald's on Instagram?  Like who logs in and says you know what I want to see when I launch this app, fucking ads for unhealthy and disgusting food that's thousands of cows ground up and compressed into a single hamburger patty.

Whoever fell for this fucking deserves it, first for being dumb enough to follow a shitty corporation on social media, and second for being a memecoin moron.
shit like this is why normies think crypto is used only for scams. thats what the normies think! not me.
Solana will still moon lol
Stay classy Indians
Those damn jeets always taking everyone‚Äôs solami
Its to easy it seems all because of the greed
Lmao.. All the grimaces on their faces after that.
If you lose you money to a token banned grimace on mcd insta, that‚Äôs just natural selection
you'd think anyone who can actually go through the process of 1) owning or buying Solana and 2) using it to buy $GRIMACE, would be start enough not to fall for that
its easy! They send very realistic emails and dms to these managers they fall for it every day
Ah, Solana, what a cesspool.
Lol
Pajeeds being pajeeds
i fucking love this space so much
This is crazy but not surprising at all
Lil sympathy for those who buy meme coins or wait for airdrops to farm and get rugged.

Such scams continue to work only because of the greed in users waiting for free money. In the end, they are the free money.
Bro post mc not price
Nigerians for sure , putting Name of India to save themselves
Motherfuckers spending their whole inheritance on McCrypto
[removed]
Solana sounds like the place where all the mess is.... millions of tokens created that just go to zero? Whats the deal
Lmao, this story is wild.

But this doesn't bode well for the space, I can see the articles now :(
Does this mean Puts on McDonalds tomorrow?
HODL ba ba baaaa
But aren't some victims not worthy of sympathy when they do something stupid?
This is a win for Crypto!
If you fell for this you‚Äôre a fucking dumbass lmao
Okay, I have a question: if I went in, but shorted it, because it is an obvious scam, would I be able to withdraw my profit? I have no idea how this works.
Mcscammed  have it your way
What else to expect from a company that is led by a clown.
Lol. I thought crypto was supposed to bank the unbanked. It's looking more like it is a way to unbank the banked. 

Another day, another crypto scam.
Honestly, a mayor firm like McDonald‚Äôs going straight to Solana is a big ass red flag on itself.
Getting rugged on Solana is like getting hit by a car when dancing in the motorway, you deserve what you get. It‚Äôs these idiots that I truly hope miss the where the money is moving and get left with bags because in all honestly, if they made money out of this, you know they would only make society worse off.
Only (crypto) fools rush in? ü§°
India is scammers Haven. I believe it's IT industry is because of scammers¬†
1 McRugpull for takeout and 2 McPoverty for dine-in pls
sad
I don‚Äôt feel bad for those who lost money tbh, they gambled and lost
McDonald's don't give good nutritional or financial advice
LOL ü§£
InstaScam and McDonald's should be held responsible. Both failed the security Hackathon.
Idiots like this set crypto progress back tenfold. This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things.
India...
I smell a huge lawsuit.
lol üòÇ
Lmao.
Yea totally normal healthy industry things.  Just a fuckin rotating gang of losers scamming everyone they possibly can.
Lol amazing
The word "based" needs to be brought out back and shot already
Looks like dirty dishwater
DD is for rookies, grimace to the moon
Sue McDonald‚Äôs lol
Crypto , enabling criminals since 2009, just after the 2008 market crash.
The people that bought are dumb af they deserve it .. how did you not perceive it was a hack
Who is hanging around scrolling tweets ready to buy into a new token surprise listing. 

Like who got fleeced here?  

The pump lasted all of 15 min
'smart contracts' ladies and gentlemen
They gotta refund the loser with Loser Big MAC
News like these are the reasons why crypto has not been adopted in the past 14 15 years in the real
And it might just never
The McRug never is a limited time offer in crypto.
Ronald McDonald made a joke and retired
2024 is wild i can't lie
Anyone who thinks Indians were behind this is extremely stupid.
Isn‚Äôt it extremely easy to track them down because crypto is a literal ledger?
Shitcoin and scams nothing new
[deleted]
I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt go with the Hamburgler. C‚Äômon!!!
Convinced you orchestrated this entire scheme just to post this golden comment
I see what you did there lol
If you're eating there you're already gambling with your health, why not double down?
Simple, people tried gambling and it didn't work
It's gambling, you get into a coin as soon as you hear from it and hope some people are as dumb as you but hear from it later. If you follow the right accounts it can work but it's still more or less gambling
It's called general societal incompetence / group think / lack of critical thinking skills.
Same way when people invest in what paid celebrities advertise. Some people who threw money at cryptozoo said "this will do well, it's Logan Paul",
Literally asking to get scammed. 

These people who connect their wallets to anything they see on internet are some of the dumbest people alive.
People rushing to be first so they get that 1000x they dream of
Same reason people buy random coins: they'll just buy 100$, just in case.

If it pumps, they'll be happy, if not, it's only 100$

In this case, probably fomo and greed, to be the first ones that buy the token, before it pumps
People buying shitcoins know it‚Äôs a rugpull and just think they can get out before the crash

Everyone is scamming everyone else thinking they‚Äôre the smartest until they‚Äôre broke
Most victims of crypto/nft scams know they're scams at this point. They still delude themselves into thinking they'll be able to buy in, let the price rise, and sell out for a profit all before the rug pull happens.


It doesn't matter how shady they look, people will still fall for the sales pitch of "you're getting in on the ground floor and you're gonna be rich".
It would also take 3 seconds with google to determine. That this BS. A major brand doing something like this would have plenty of press to promote it.
you've clearly never bought a memecoin

the absolutely degeneracy on chain is something special
Investing in something you know nothing about is how degen trading works. It only exists on that premise
Yeah, odd. Anyone who knows what Solana is you'd think would be more skeptical. And anyone who doesn't know (most people) wouldn't have time to learn and set everything up before McDs got the account back. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
After seeing Americans wear dictator apparel I‚Äôm convinced people will die on any hill. McDonald‚Äôs is a big hill to them in many ways
However, "Robble-Robble..." could be heard as he walked away
Scooby Doobie Dooo
Let's hope the people who were scammed aren't seeing this post lol
Actually, it's:  "I'm McRuggin' It!"
Who follows fast food Instagram accounts anyway? Or was this a sponsored ad?
I think it's likely that a lot of people know this is a scam but think they can get out with a profit.
Play stupid games...
I have to imagine some people that got rugged probably knew it was a hack and just wanted to get in quick for a scalp and get out, and got caught too early.

Does anyone know if this token was sellable?
Dare I say, McScammed? Double scam with cheese?
Greed and degeneracy - name a dumber duo
I bet most of them knew it was a hack but thought "People will see this post and throw money at this crypto so better hurry up" and buy some.

The only thing they forgot is that someone had the tokens before them and was ready to rug.
That could've happend to me ngl. I Sometimes throw 100$ at something dumb in hopes it 10x. made 3k on Turbo that way.  idk how much on Floki but... if I woud've seen a post on official MC'd insta.... I'd be down 100$ for Sure.
[deleted]
Do yourself a favor and google "mcdonalds grimace nft." It looks pretty legit.
and a smarter guy deserves to get rich...
TO BE HONEST - you‚Äôre (almost) dead wrong.

The token they would do, but it definitely wouldn‚Äôt be done like THIS.
Nice mash
Is there anything that Wojak can‚Äôt do?
Maybe McDonald‚Äôs social manager outsourced their job to India.¬†
The sec didn‚Äôt either‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ who knows
They were. I use grabify to ID every scammer who starts a convo with me, the overwhelming majority of them are from Nigeria.
Maybe they weren't Indian....

![gif](giphy|bihnwWzmlYHN6)
maybe they are not even indian just a diversion
There‚Äôs a billion people there. Imagine all the crime that would go unsolved if the USA had 3x the population it does right now.
It‚Äôs doubtful it was people in India that did it. If you hack something you wouldn‚Äôt say where you were actually from and make it easier to find you and possibly make it harder to pull off scams in the future, you‚Äôd point people to the wrong location.

This is also what governments try to do, they make it look like it was a different country that did it.
As an Indian I'm amazed at the audacity to drop their x handle on the Instagram bio. Lazarus Tryhards, cannot wait for the coldfusion documentary.
Maybe that was just a ploy.  It's probably some white dude named Tom from Oklahoma - he just posted the flag to throw people off his tracks.  Lol
Only a little. It keeps their unemployment low lol
They poop in the street, their standards are far lower.
I think they'll make an exception for McDonalds
They sim swapped McDonald's??
You think they won‚Äôt sort McDonald‚Äôs? Lol
Greed messes with your logical thinking

Although most of these people are probably degenerate gamblers

I doubt avarage joe, who follows McDonald's on Instagram, knows how to use defi
5x more followers. And probably hacking ain‚Äôt you pick a random account. It‚Äôs a complicated scheme I assume I don‚Äôt know, other wise I would have done it and rug pulled you by now haha
or russian hackers
Google "mcdonalds grimace nft." I'm guessing quite a few people are falling for this.
Bots
These large accounts are also just controlled with a guy on his phone like the rest of us. If you can get the guy's details through LinkedIn, you can find out initimate details about him and start the social engineering

Shorting means you borrow 100 tokens or whatever and youll pay back 110 or 120 later or 130 later coins back. then you sell the 100, hope it goes down, and that you can buy back 130 cheap later and use it to pay back the loan.

Whether you get screwed depends on how the rugpull worked (is it just worthless now but still tradable? or is it defunct and broken and not even tradable? If you can't physically get the cheap coins anymore that's bad for you... since you can't repay the loan), and the terms of the loan (what does the contract say happens if you never pay back? Maximum fines might be huge. Or not)

The odds of anyone setting that loan up and having time to do all the steps and come out ahead in 15 minutes and have double checked everything to make sure you didn't do something that majorly screws you in the fine print seem very unlikely.
This India_X_Cr3w has hacked accounts before and ran this same scam. It‚Äôs no secret that Indians are heavily involved in the crypto scam world. 

This is also pennies for a crypto scam, why would it be someone else claiming that they‚Äôre Indian? It‚Äôs a group of 19-22 yr old Indian kids who don‚Äôt give a fuck. These account takeover scams are all primarily done by young script kiddies from all over the world.

Solana is INFESTED with rugpull meme tokens. It sucks that McDonald's Instagram got hacked by scammers but these people would lose their money one way or another.
Right. The people who bought it knew it was a scam but they also know others will be fooled and they buy it early expecting to sell it to fools at a higher price.
Oh, it worked!
Yeah looking at that screenshot I am seeing that they had a chance to cash out huge if they hadn't held for  more than 15 minutes lol. I think honestly I would panic sell if I jumped into a new coin that rose that fast.
Follow the wallets
Pretty crazy that we are getting dumber as technology gets smarter. I never saw that coming.
Logan is anti-sociopathic at the very least. (Sociopath). But if ur a fan of something and you can‚Äôt see that, well you tend to only see the good in a person you admire. This is why it‚Äôs mostly abuse on Logan his side and just na√Øevity on the children being scammed.
Dumb x dumb.
Why are dictator apparel?

It's not just the followers though, you hit 5.1m people with news, 30minutes later 100m know.

Case and point
Bro why would McDonald‚Äôs release a fucking memecoin though? You can‚Äôt be serious. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
People who bought this token probably thought crypto casuals would see it and buy. They only forgot that crypto casuals only buy tokens on Coinbase or Binance and don't know how to set up a network on Metamask and buy tokens on a Solana DEX.

One of those cases of people thinking they were about to become predators and end up being the prey.
Secure profit.

$10 says he loses the laptop with the $700 hot wallet, then realizes he never wrote down the seed phrase.

Ofc, this will happen after he quits his McD's corporate gig.  
So, once again, he will be back to flipping burgers at the bottom of the food chain.
Oh they announced themselves alright
They were they even made sure to add the username ROFL

Cause no one smart enough to do such a major scam is going to point to their own country. It‚Äôs a simple misdirectional technique.
Other ethnicities have been shitting on our characterless people for ages.

Locking withdrawals exist. That strategy is extremely dumb if you know a little crypto.
I mean most of the internet, like these scams, is new to people. Most people think the internet is Instagram and tiktok and can not imagine being scammed so easily.
Of course tech makes us dumber, humans are hones but struggle and tech lets us offload and specialize.
I never understood this either. Like why? It‚Äôs not like they post coupons or some shit.
Damn that‚Äôs a lot of greedy people

Trust me, when fomo hits I'm not asking that question. I'm well aware of the risk that's why I only ever gamble 100$ on memecoins, but if you use logic, you would never buy memecoins.

Corruption is a thing. Donut-feasting fat cops is a thing. And you don‚Äôt want to triple the number of people who hold a gun probably. So all in all I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúlet‚Äôs add more cops‚Äù will solve the problem. There are a lot of scammers in India because it‚Äôs a shithole, not the other way around. They need a stronger economy and population control, and this problem would naturally go away.
Def agree on that one
First of all, this isn‚Äôt a major scam. These account takeover scams happen every single day from $100k to a couple million. 

2nd of all, this is a very known group and they‚Äôre based out of India. I‚Äôm not about to argue with u about it, but a lot of times these script kiddie groups are recklessly brazen becuz they‚Äôre young and believe they‚Äôre never going to be caught.
Yes, it definitely is. You barely speak english and you‚Äôre using AI to generate post summaries so you can reply to as many posts as possible and collect moons.

Edit: And you‚Äôre from India. That couldn‚Äôt be a more fitting coincidence.
Someone needed to follow BNB into the space.
Cause it‚Äôs got electrolytes.
People follow accounts a lot easier than they unfollow accounts.

So unless they're being bombarded with their posts they probably never bother/care to unfollow.
Probably 5.1M Karen's that followed them to complain
When all us people that were 10 when the internet was coming up get to 60 this will be the equivalent of our grandmas scouring for coupons.
Well now I understand how people buy this shit. They‚Äôre just idiots. Thanks.

At this point, Solana already obliterated BSC in terms of scam tokens. If you open DEX Screener today (it doesn't matter when you ready this because it's an everyday thing), the first 15/20 tokens with highest % of gains are Solana meme tokens and they change everyday.

It's worse than gambling because at least you can make money in the casino. It's more like burning money.
BNB is the king of shitcoins
I can't believe you like money to! We should hang out sometime!
Checks out
They're trying to make money off of the scam without putting the effort into running it or dirtying their conscious. Oh surely I can time it better than everyone else and be 20% better off!

I made a minor miscalculation.
I held some 1370/1420 MSTR call debit spreads through close yesterday. RH exercised my long call and assigned the short. The short call assignment got voided and now if things go south, I'll be seeing y'all at Wendy's.

Holy shit. I lost $200 at the casino last night and was devastated .

Didnt some poor kid axe himself years ago over the weekend for seeing a message like this? Then by Monday the spreads were resolved and he really didnt owe any money at all? RIP poor soul

‚Äú In fact, a screenshot from Kearns‚Äô mobile phone reveals that while his account had a negative $730,165 cash balance displayed in red, it may not have represented uncollateralized indebtedness at all, but rather his temporary balance until the stocks underlying his assigned options actually settled into his account. ‚Äú
Couple of years ago, i thought this sub was full of pro traders.
For the regards, OP sold the 1420 calls and bought the 1370 calls.    MSTR closed at 1425 so his expectation was he would exercise his long calls (buy MSTR for $1370/share) and the owner of his 1420 short calls would exercise so the shares he bought at $1370 would be sold for $1420.  


Unfortunately for OP the short calls didn't get exercised and the stock went down AH to $1405 AND it is possible it will open even lower Monday morning.  So OP is sitting on something like $550k worth of MSTR stock without having had the funds to pay for the stock and RH might force sell his shares at the open.  


So not a $535k loss but sitting at high risk depending on the market at the open Monday morning of losing a lot of money... or making a lot of money.

Thanks for posting this. Stressful situation, I'm sure. Strong evidence that spreads should absolutely not remain open through expiration.

I hope you can sell the shares at market open above 1370 and get out of your situation. Good luck.
I hope Bitcoin hits 75,000 for the OP and he is awash in lambos hookers and blow by Monday when mstr opens at 1500

Every time I start to think about gambling on options I see this kind of thing and realize it truly is just a casino and I‚Äôm better off putting everything in index funds and being patient.
I thought the most you can lose on options is the amount you paid? Eg option expires worthless
I think this will resolve when all trades settle, right?
All that‚Äôs left is to pray that a sell-off doesn‚Äôt happen at PM on Monday. Otherwise you‚Äôre boned HARD ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
I'm not a US lawyer but what stupid bank or trading plattform allowed you to make trades that end like this without having any collateral? 

If you don't have money, which is very likely, they will just have to pay out of their own pocket. Seems like terrible business to me.

So your options are now moving to Russia, North Korea, Turkmenistan, or Iran. Pyongyang is lovely this time of year.
Good odds you actually make a ton of money when Robinhood sells your position Monday. You found the cheat code to getting god tier margin.

Why do people even gamble on options? All the actual success stories were from people buying early, and then the herd randomly rotates into that exact stock and pumps it. It's the flash bubble phenomena enabled by the internet. Back in the day it was the time to sell when your maid tells that she read about that stock in the morning newspaper, now it's time to buy instead, because every normie will also read about it and stampede into the stock, and then hedgies will also buy it. Perma-bubble.

I haven't seen anyone succeed by gambling on options, yet every regard on this sub tries to do so.

Iirc the trade even ended up being positive for him, so he'd actually gained money but he died before seeing it.
Even worse the poor kid called RH multiple times to figure out there error and they NEVER ANSWERED
This. I had the same thing happen to me when my spread expire ITM. It was super stressful but it resolved post the weekend. It sucks that they still didn't fix it. Crony capitalism y'know
That was such a tragic story. I have a feeling this is a similar situation. RH just seems to be a dogshit broker.
Also just going to point this out but OP hasn't posted anything since posting this screenshot.

It was once full of good traders who LARP'd as circlejerk regards, then the meme stock frenzy hit, and a new generation of people came and appropriated the old culture, having no clue the idea was that you acted like an idiot, but weren't actually one.

Of course, their were people who actually were, but you used to be able to track this place for good tickers and make money on plays.

The gamification of the stock market was the greatest thing that ever happened to Wall St.
This is exactly why you absolutely have to close these spreads before expiry. The risk reward of having the unassigned leg screw you on Monday market open is not worth it.

Welcome to the regarded.
That‚Äôs just called being a gambling addict
Transaction time was 3:59pm?

Wow! What a coincidence‚Ä¶ I lost my phone last night at approximately 3:58pm.
He was long 1370 calls and short 1420 calls. MSTR went below 1420 after hours, so the short calls were voided.¬†

So now he has all the shares at a purchase price of 1370 and MSTR is trading at 1403.

If it moves sharply down on Monday, OP is getting it right in the ass cause even a -.01% decrease below 1370 will blow through all his money.
You say weird shit.
Happy cake day!
Funny thing is ... Many of the people here have knowledge...
Just don't risk monies you don't have.
If you only buy calls/puts without leverage. You can only lose the price of the contract
I was down around ~$300 yesterday and was kinda feeling down since it was my first major loss, but I guess others also suffered some losses as well.
He was long 1370 and short 1420. MSTR went below 1420 after hours.¬†

Travel to Mexico and then renter US as an illegal migrant, acquire a new ID and you can start a new life with 0 debts.
He's still up, as of right now... He's holding, I'm guessing, about 500 shares of MSTR stock, so it's worth about 700k. As long as MSTR doesn't crash at open on Monday, he's ahead.
When the snow/ ice melts, you find a floater, pull out all of their teeth, pull out all of your teeth & transplant them in their mouth. That body is then involved in a serious incident. You essentially take their identity, they take yours along with the associated debts. Then start working at Wendy's as an ex homeless person.
The broker-dealer will get a judgment in court in their favor since you are in violation of the margin agreement. In most cases it won't be dischargeable in bankruptcy. The judgment will allow them to put a lien on your home if you own one and garnish your wages. In some instances, the SEC can have you prosecuted, but that is rare.
The platform didn't shaft him. The after-hours movement of the underlying security of his options positions shafted him.
That's options for you. Even a 1.58% stock movement can leave you overexposed and overleveraged.¬†
Blow in bottom of phone, will be all good
As it stands, he‚Äôs down about $8,500 if he sells at current price of 1403, assuming 500 shares. Any further dip in PM and that could get bad fast.
I learned not to be regarded.
They send you to space camp and give you an automatic job at NASA and the NSA for being a genius and figuring out how to solve all the global debt crises.


Or they sue you and seize all your shit they are legally able to then you start life over as a hobo with a fentanyl addiction sucking dicks behind a Wendy's and taking it up the poopshoot until that shit-pussy gets all baggy and your market value plummets as fast as your margin account did then you die of AIDS¬†
I had to look too long for this. OG WSBer.
I think the trades just need to settle. Didn‚Äôt a guy make this same mistake thinking he lost hundreds of thousand and killed himself not knowing everything just needed to update?
Yea but this guy bought and sold calls. Selling calls don't expire worthless. You get a premium for selling them but if it doesn't work in your favor you end up being in debt ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)
That's only true for single leg long options. Furthermore, his long options did NOT expire worthless, but his short options did. Robinhood automatically assigned his long calls when he didn't have anywhere close to the capital needed to actually buy the associated shares.  That's why he got this message.  Its an obscure risk factor of trading spreads called pin risk.  Its why you should close all spreads before they expire.

The debt doubles and the next person downloading the app gets it.
All the regards that keep answering with jokes when it says "genuine question" clearly belong on here because they can barely read a sentence let alone a TA.

The debt will follow you. RH will file suit to garnish wages or collect on their assets, OP will probably have to file BK (bankruptcy, not Burger King) or spend his last few dollars on kneepads and mouthwash and set up shop behind the Wendy's dumpster.
If my mother's second bankruptcy has taught me anything it's that ignoring your problems makes them go away
Simple answer: there is no real debt here. It‚Äôs a big scary message involved with early assignment that will go away when RH closes the position Monday morning. With minimal affect to the account.¬†

More complex: the 1420C‚Äôs he sold as part of the spread were assigned. Meaning he had to short sell 100 shares per contract. I believe what‚Äôs shown here is the cost of being short those shares of MSTR after the assignment. But he does receive a credit for shorting those shares that isn‚Äôt mentioned by RH because that credit will be used by RH to exercise the long calls he owns as part of the spread. So on Monday they‚Äôll auto-exercise the 1370C‚Äôs he owns to close the position. The only affect to the account is that he‚Äôll be carrying negative deltas over the weekend and may lose a bit if it gaps up, but nothing substantial.¬†
You don‚Äôt have to pay it if you‚Äôre in jail. I learned this from Monopoly.
Robinhood app is just a game lol. You can't get into trouble because it's just numbers on a screen
It goes to debt heaven
It disappears because the money was never realü´°
Gets deleted with the app
The debt is in the app, so poof
When you owe the bank 100 dollars *you* have a problem. If you owe a six hundred thousand and change, *they* do.
It disappears when you delete the app
When they call, just Hwang up.
Robinhood would still hold it and hound your ass
its a tax write off
Written off as a bad debt and it'll be on their credit report for up to 7 years
Real answer: Well, they go after you and take anything they can get of course. You‚Äôd probably have to file bankruptcy if you can‚Äôt pay and it‚Äôll ruin your credit etc.
I want his blood.
It's hard to type with my dick in my hand, but OP made it possible.
I got lucky on PSNY, I bought at $3 thinking it was a good deal, held for like 3 months, then sold at the first pump for like 3.50 lol.

If we get back to 1.50 I'll probably buy again, I missed that 1.30 to 2.20 pump last week.
Same bought 2000 shares averaging at 14 dollars. I'm holding onto my shares until I'm dead so I can pass the debt to my grandchildren.
This is the gay.
60 cents? youre good man
Yeah the CEO said he was gonna fix this too and here we are 4 years later with the same shit. Fuckin Vlad
That dude prolly has super ripped shoulders from all the careless shrugging
To be fair it wouldn‚Äôt have been a programmer that came up with the UI, especially for a company like RH. That‚Äôs what the UI/UX designers do, who would typically take their directives from a product team. The front end dev would just implement the designs given to them. So in essence there would be way more people involved in the approval of this kind of messaging, which I think makes it even worse
I know we all love to shit on Robinhood, and I know I am posting this in /r/wallstreetbets, but people really should not be engaging in this type of trading if they don't have a complete understanding of what they are doing.
How stupid do you have to be to enter that position without realizing what could happen.
Most of this sub can relate and will pass away before being positive.
[removed]
Hmm I'm still a little confused, so you were assigned shares but that amount just shows up as a debt on your account until it's settled? What if you don't have the funds to buy those shares? I guess that would be a naked put then, right?
Lmao he will be back here on Monday
Probably had some other underlying mental health problems too
Turn it upside down and you will see the gains you had
Yo I‚Äôm going through these comments cryin üòÇüòÇ
Same.  I found this sub during the whole GameStop thing and I just hang around for the entertainment of reading the comments.  I don‚Äôt even play the stock market.
I'm just a humble investor, not a trader and certainly not anyone who messes with options. I'm just here for the lulz and loss porn. It reminds me that I didn't ruin my life losing $500 on NIO.
When this sub started there were actual a lot of real traders who knew their shit, and the sub was just circle jerk fun. Then it got attention on the news and whatnot and the sub population became more like the actual human population bell curve.
Pros don't comment that much
Y‚Äôall remember the fake paper trading competitions lmao
It was a glorious con.
Agreed. This is no longer OPs problem. It‚Äôs now RH‚Äôs problem.
It's a good thing I don't trade options cause I don't have a fucking clue what you guys are talking about
But then you don't have that sweet screenshot for karma.
Now the only thing OP will spread is his buttcheeks when his wife's boyfriend comes home
Most brokers will close the position 15-30 minutes before market closes if your options positions will expose you to a margin call once they‚Äôre exercised/assigned.

Well decent brokers.
OP learned about pin risk the hard way: 

> Pin risk occurs when the market price of the underlier of an option contract at the time of the contract's expiration is close to the option's strike price. In this situation, the underlier is said to have pinned. The risk to the writer of the option is that they cannot predict with certainty whether the option will be exercised or not.

But maybe OP will miraculously make some money too on Monday if MSTR goes up. u/FizzyKilla how big is your account?
Isn‚Äôt that what I said?  Long MSTR at $1370 and at risk depending on how it opens Monday? But I agree on your math and likely number of shares
OP has made about $5,000 per contract (minus what the options cost but it was debit spread so my WILD ASS GUESS would be $2,500). I would guess 5 contracts based on his screen shot.

So if everything resolves ok or even it doesn't and the stock opens unchanged then OP is going to be positive $25,000 on Monday.

Edited: because i am a regard my math was off by an order of magnitude
MSTR closed at $1425 so his $1370 long calls were exercised.  He assumed his short call position would be assigned because MSTR was above $1420 but it wasn‚Äôt to his regret because that would have been a max win for OP

Instead he is down $17/share after hours on 500 shares and his ass is hanging out at probably 10x levered
The price was above 370 but below 420.
Can't even take care of your wife's BF, smh.

Better! They don't even actively do anything. Fools voluntarily part themselves from their money! Nextlvlshit
But if MSTR can stay at the 1403 level, then OP can immediately sell at open, clearing the margin call and earning a profit...?
That math is a bit off. 

He's got 2.35% breathing room not 0.01%.

1403-1370=33

33/1403√ó100%=2.35%

Also he has the shares now. So his profit/loss at this point is:

(Sell price-1370)√ó# of shares
Why does a decrease below $1370 blow through all his money? If it went to, say, $1300 at the open and RH sells all the shares, wouldn‚Äôt he just lose ~5% (1 - 1300/1370)?

lol, but really RH will not do such thing, no way they can garnish wage or touch his personal property unless he owns a rental property or something. They can't even touch his primary residence if he owns one.

This will be sent to collections and sold for pennies on the dollar, eventually it will go away after a number of years.

Reminds of the guy who was short SPY puts and they settled just ITM after the market closed on Friday a few years ago and got exercised. They were long ~$20M of SPY over the weekend. Talk about not being able sleep. On Monday morning SPY was up and they made six figures by dumb luck.
OK this is what I was thinking as well.  Makes sense now.  Does this kinda shit only happen with RH?  I would shit my pants if I opened this up and saw that message.  They need to fix this shit.

Except UI was lying to him, as there was no real loss
I got assigned once and I had to wait to exercise my long call. Unfortunately, the price moved against me in the meantime. I got assigned before the ex-dividend date, which I guess is pretty common. After assignment, the app read that I sold short 100 shares (-100 shares). When I exercised my long call, it balanced out. 

Also, leveraged etfs tend to decline, and USO doesn‚Äôt track the front month contract of oil. That is round 1 of things I learned the hard way.

Some of them do, just not the trades they actually intend to make.
Sometimes it‚Äôs good to stay clueless about options. Sometimes it‚Äôs best to not open yourself to a world of pain and heartache.
Options is THE DEVIL!
If you are not a complete dumbass you will jump into options with $50-$100 buys to understand what all the greeks and how assignments work. Most are complete dumbass‚Äôs and will put thousands into their account, activate margin, buy these idiotic spreads and let them ‚Äúexpire itm‚Äù instead of selling for a profit (all smart traders close their positions and never let it expire for this very reason). Tldr options are easy people are stupid
That means you know about as much as everyone else here
It took me maybe 2 hours to just understand the concept of options, that a few more to understand wtf the Greeks are then a few more to understand strategies that utilise FD trading and now know just enough about o know I don‚Äôt fucking understand what‚Äôs going on and that I don‚Äôt wanna get involved
Me either and I been here 5 years
RH is such a joke, I cannot fathom how people still use it.

This exact shit made a guy go short on $ROPE a while back. CEO said he‚Äòll fix it. FUCK YOU VLAD
Tasty sends you email reminder + you need to physically click a button agreeing that you are in fact aware and are monitoring otherwise they close the position.
I had options that were in the money.  Like barely in the money.  We are talking I made something like $10 profit.  They expired unsold and unexercised.  Just gone.  Meanwhile RH usually sells them automatically against my will at a loss a hour or so before closing.
Robinhood has done this for me multiple times before
$50 spread times 100 shares per contract is $5k not $50k and he paid for the spread probably $2k to $3k per contract
Bitcoin is mini pumping tonight and could be at new ATH's by market open on Monday.  It'll be hilarious if this trade ends up massively in his favor.
If the OP did not have enough funds, why wouldn't RH leave the calls unexercised?

More like 3 to be for real about it.
Yes, he's not completely fucked yet. But he's probably sweating bullets like crazy.
Let's all buy mstr at 1403.. and help a regard out.
Profit, assuming he had some profit from the original spread. From what we know he could‚Äôve been negative on the spread.
The math wasn‚Äôt wrong since there wasn‚Äôt math. They stated ‚Äú a -.01% drop BELOW 1370‚Äù not that it was a .01% drop from 1403 to 1370.
I forgot what I wrote and I wasnt wrong. You're wrong. Anything above 1370 is OPS money. Anything below 1370 is the brokers money. So if the price goes to 1369.99. The broke lost .01 cent per share and OPs money is gone.
Am I understanding correctly that this guy put 700k USD worth of margin on the line for the potential to earn 15-25k USD (minus fees?).

If so, that is the dumbest thing I've heard in a while.
A decrease from the price at close will blow through all the money in his account. A 5% drop of $710,000 (purchase at 1370 plus premium of calls at close) is about $35,000, which would be his loss if it sells at 1349.

Right now, assuming 500 shares, at 1403 he‚Äôs down about $8,500.
And a free bus ride to the big apple

Have it your way
Collection agencies can sue to have your wages garnished. Any debt wiped out by a collector gets heavily taxed now, so you will be paying no matter what.
like legit, all this means is its going to take 7 years before he can do it again.
Once they sue and get a judgment they'll file a lien on *all* properties and can garnish wages. You have to be truly regarded to think half a mill+ will just "go away"
If he has a primary home, they will file suit and attach a judgment lien against it. Wont mean anything until he goes to refinance or sell, and then he‚Äôll be forced to pay. Even in homestead states, this still applies. For second homes, if there is no superior lien, then can move to foreclose it and seize the property. They absolutely can garnish his wages as long as state law allows for it. Some people get their wages garnished from simple credit card debt. I guarantee you a firm like RH has law firm and debt collector arrangements for this purpose as part of their covenants with regulators.
As a lawyer, I think you're very mistaken about what they "can" do. Whether they will is another story, but I also promise courts are not typically concerned with protecting poor people from their mistakes.
Receiving end? AND getting paid $100 for it? Do you by chance have this guy's phone number? Asking for my friend

Robinhood gives me a shiny pop up every week reminding me I can start trading options right now lol.

Yet they still remind me, every week.  Like clockwork.
"Why yes I'm an 18 year old with 20+ years of options trading experience and 500k+ in networth"
The thing people don‚Äôt understand is that a margin isn‚Äôt for risking on securities. It‚Äôs to cover you while your positions close, as they typically take 3-7 days. It‚Äôs not free play money. If you use it that way you will get burned.
Man, back in the day any essay on here with decent grammar was worth throwing money after. Too many literate idiots around for that to work now

Wendy‚Äôs? Costco? Back in my day, you started at the real bottom, Arby‚Äôs
theoretically they can, but in practice it's extremely difficult to get the court to agree to go after your wages/personal property (unless you are actually loaded and can afford to pay them back easy), you have to done something very bad for that to happen. Usually this only happens for alimoney/child support payments.
\*taking notes*
Also most likely not be able to get any kind of credit.
He might even be able to get it absolved if he goes to court with the debt collector. A lot of the time they just gave a name and a dollar amount and can't really prove that you actually owe the money.
Right? I'm straight but 100$ for a guy to suck me off? 100$ is 100$.
Jokes aside, I knew this friend of a friend who actually did this and for $100 on a regular basis. He was convinced he wasn't gay because he was on the receiving end. The idiot was bragging about the gold chain he had bought and how easy it was to get the money for it. We just burst out laughing and had to explain to him that what he did was actually gay. He was insisting he wasn't because he was on the receiving end and we just let it go.

Edit: I just remembered that the guy giving the BJ's actually died of AIDS about 10 years ago. He was the most flamboyant gay guy in town who owned a salon.  This actually happened back in 1995 when we were about 17.

What dont you understand about options?
‚ÄúFunnily enough‚Äù‚Ä¶ because what happened was pretty funny, right?
r/dundermifflin
Had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
Pretty sure his future of new cars and a home disappeared the moment they exercised his calls
And with VR porn you don't even know the difference!!
100% just the cost of doing business. They run the calcs to see what the worst case scenario is for them in terms of negative outcomes for legal breaches, then analyze the overall gains by breaking said laws. When the good outweighs the bad, they do it for the $$$ 1000% of the time
I think I get confused on the actual transactions. 

Like you buy an option to buy or sell at a certain price. So, that cost a set amount, then if you use your option to buy you spend additional money to buy the stock? And they expire? So I can buy an option to buy like Nvidia if it hits a certain point but if it doesn't hit that I'm good? If it does hit that i buy it and when it increases I sell it?
Really, Really short version.

Options are actually Option Contracts. They come with an expiration and a strike price. What that means is that you have the Option to exercise your Contract at any time before the expiration at that strike price. There are two (main) types of options, Calls and Puts. Essentially a Call bets that the Stock is going to go up, a Put bets that it will go down. So just as an example if you buy NVDA 3/15 900C, that means you're purchasing the option to buy 100 shares of Nvidia at $900 a share, anytime before end of day 3/15. So if on Monday Nvidia hits $1,000 you could execute your contract, buy 100 shares for $90,000 and immediately sell your 100 shares, and make $10,000. However, you could also simply sell your contract, which might net you more or less money, but also wouldn't require you to lay out $90,000.

There's so much, much more to it than that, but that's what I would call the absolute basics.
Road to $6MM #1
I'm starting a weekly series documenting my journey to $6MM. Why that amount? Because then I can put the money into an index fund and live off a 4% withdrawal rate indefinitely. Maybe I'll stop trading. Maybe I'll go back to school. Maybe I'll start a business. I won't know until I get there.

I use algorithms to manually trade on Thinkorswim (TOS), based on software I've written in Python, using the ThetaData API for historical data. My approach is basically to model price behavior based on the event(s) occurring on that day. I exclusively trade options on QQQ. My favorite strategy so far is the short iron condor (SIC), but I also sell covered calls (CC) on 500 shares I have set aside for a down payment on an apartment just to generate some additional income while I wait. My goal is to achieve a 6.8% daily ROI from 0DTE options. For the record, I calculate my defined-risk short ROI based on gross buying power (i.e. not including premium collected). Maybe I should calculate it based on value at risk?

So this week was a week of learning. I've been spending a few hours a day working on my software. This week's major development was the creation of an expected movement report that also calculates the profitability of entering various types of SIC at times throughout the day. I also have a program that optimizes the trade parameters of several strategies, such as long put, long call, and strangle. In this program, I've been selecting strategies based on risk-adjusted return on capital, which I document [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1bwtrlu/best_metric_for_comparing_strategies/). I'm in the process of testing how the software does with selecting based on Sharpe ratio.

Here's my trading for the week:

Monday: PCE was released the Friday before, but the ISM Manufacturing PMI came out on this day. I bought a ATM put as a test and took a $71 (66%) loss. I wasn't confident in the results of my program for this event, so I wasn't too surprised.

Tuesday: M3 survey full report and Non-FOMC fed speeches (which I don't have enough historical data for). I was going to test a straddle but completely forgot. I sold 5 CC and took a $71 (67%) loss.

Wednesday: ISM Services PMI. I don't have historical data for this event yet, so I sold 5 CC and made $157 (95%) profit.

Thursday: More non-FOMC fed speeches. I sold 5 CC and made $117 (94%) profit. I wish I had done a strangle though. There was a  $9 drop starting at 2 PM. Later this month, I will acquire more historical data, so I'll be prepared.

Friday: Employment Situation Summary. I tested my program today. I opened with a strangle and closed when I hit my profit goal, determined by my program. I made $72 (27%) profit. About 30 minutes before market close, I sold 5 CC for $47 (86%) profit and sold a SIC for $51 (13%) profit.

Starting cash: $4,163.63

Ending cash: $4,480.22

P/L: $316.59

Daily ROI: 1.5%

Conclusion: I didn't hit my profit goals this week, because I was limiting my trading while testing out my software. If I had invested my full portfolio, I would have had a great week. I will continue testing my software for another week before scaling up. I will still do full portfolio SIC on slow days, however, as I'm already comfortable with that strategy. Thanks for listening.
Do you understand that if you made an average of 6.8% per day on your $4k that you would reach your $6MM goal in less than six months? Does that sound reasonable?

As someone who's been at this for awhile, I can tell you that you must learn to manage your expectations. You will make mistakes, your system will face drawdowns, the market will change from its past behavior. You must expect all of this, or your disappointment will lead to poor decisions. 

I'm glad you're documenting this. I think you should spend more time working with historical data and finding a well-defined strategy that gives you an excellent backtest. That would be an interesting process to document and for us to read about. I would actually look forward to it. But in the meantime, nobody cares about your daily P/L. It doesn't mean anything until you actually have a strategy and a larger sample size than one week.

Your confidence is excellent. You will need that. Good luck.
Once I read my goal is to reach x percent daily, I know this person does not understand trading. 

The market some days will give you a lot of opportunities and some days none. Some times you‚Äôll have 0% ROI for weeks and then one day you‚Äôll hit 20%.

6.8% daily on a consistent basis has never been done and will never be done.
You need $240k/yr to live off of, but you can only afford to put $4k into a trading portfolio?
Hahaha. I‚Äôm sitting here with close to $6m (mostly in broad indices) trying to learn how to algotrade so I am not subject to the whim of the market.  If you had a system that worked up to $6m, why would you shut it down?

if I had a system that gave me a steady 1% per month I would be set.
Good luck. A dollar and a dream. We‚Äôre all chasing our pot of gold
This is clearly a troll. Fun to read though
If your algo makes you $6M you‚Äôre not going to put it indo an index fund that makes you 4%
Options on QQQ = path to ruin on so many levels it isn't even funny. Commissions + spreads on options are so wide you can drive a truck thru them + inevitable downturns in the market will wipe out this account. The title of this post should be changed to "Fast Track to Zero". This "strategy" should be taken out back and shot before it does any real harm to its owner's financial well-being.
Good luck. In a bull market even a coin toss can pick good trades. In a bull market implied volatility is low, so whenever it goes up it is bound to come down, and this is why picking pennies in front of steam rollers works in a bull market. The hard trick to master is to pick enough pennies in front of the steam roller to cover all your losses when the bear market starts. I think you will find that you can never pick enough pennies to cover those losses when the bear market starts. 0DTE is also very high gamma which adds to this problem. You cannot rollover like you can with 21 DTE.

Everyone agrees you said enough, and is wishing you the best of luck in your future endeavors.

Cheers!

This isn‚Äôt your blog‚Ä¶. maybe make your own sub for this
Nice
Sounds like you are an optimist which works well in this kind of market. Be careful when geopolitics and vol events shows up "unexpectedly" like yesterday (and hence your loss).

Good luck.

You are starting with $4k and want to trade your way to $6m? Okay:

* If you make 10% per year, which on average is market beating, you will have $72k in 30 years.
* At the very, very improbable Medallion Fund rate of 66% you will reach $6m in 28 years.
* I assume by your lofty goals you want to reach your goals within a decade. At 100% consistent yearly return you will reach $6m just a bit over 10 years.
* With your conservative 6.8% daily return, you will reach $6m before 4 months. Wow! Plus you are using safe investments like 0DTE options! Wow! Wen Moon?!
Definitely will keep one eye on your progress. As a suggestion, you can maybe start some YouTube work.exiting.good luck bro!!!
That's a pipe dream, to be honest, but never say never. You're are better bulding an algo that makes a steady return and make money for helping others make 10-20% a year. But with that said, best of luck. Let us know how it goes.
What is your risk tolerance?
Why don‚Äôt you model sports. The betting markets are much less efficient.
We need positive people like you who can dream. If you can dream big you can achieve it as well. Good luck.
Looks like its going great so far. $12k lost and you‚Äôre only looking to make $6 million. I do have a question though. Looks like your strat is based off of ‚Äúevents‚Äù. How are handling the eclipse tomorrow?
Well, bro, that's a big dream. I've been struggling to gain 2% a week in leveraged trading, and I barely made it for a month. It's good to dream big as long as you don't let failure get you.
Backtesting ain't gonna work if you want profit like that. Any strategy was made already ain't work cuz marginal revenue diminishes. You got to make new strategy based on indicators and unique observations. Or you maybe need to even create indicators yourself. Before the market gets used to it, earn the * out of it.
Otherwise you got to play news trading but not like news classifieds trading. More like you get news minutes or hours before the others. And that's illegal in a lot of countries.
If you want 6.8% a day, you got to play unusual. Cuz with that expectation,  genuinely speaking that's not investing anymore. You will need to beat other traders' ass, and rob their money not long after. Then you need to know who you are trying to mess up with.
I sincerely wish you the best luck, run fast and don't let frustration catch you.
One last word if I am not too talkative. Play now when it's still good, storm is coming.
Good luck OP. Looking forward to your #2 #3 and so on!
I like the fact that you‚Äôre looking at things that MOVE the markets such as scheduled economic releases, rather than just price action.
Goodluck dude!
Interesting‚Ä¶ I want to track your progress as you report it.
Pretty cool
Very nice. Following your progress.
Thank you for sharing, good luck on your journey, keep us updated
Nice
You'll have better luck hitting your goal with 0dte options, good luck...
I'm not sure I totally understand everything. How much do you plan risking per trade?
I can share you this , with 4K (even 1k)  you should set up your portfolio in trades, also in property (partially reit for example), gov bond / fund (joint), cash flow that can generate interest/value , extremely good discipline of watching your spending and keep moving aka even lost (use your intelligent to get it back) aka don‚Äôt hold with general people‚Äôs sentimental

Forget historical data ( you need to know pro investor still loose even they have a TEAM to analyst ‚Ä¶) my 2 cents
I hope you lose all your money fucker
Look forward to the follow up post when the account is blown up
when did this sub turn into a hub for blogs?
I really, really needed this laugh!  thanks, you should be a comedian!
I think many comments are unnecessarily harsh (pointing fun without justifying their skepticism), but I would strongly recommend reading the folks who explain their reasoning and experience for why your expectations are likely wayyyy too high. Not saying you can't get amazing returns, but what you're aiming for has the problem of \*sounding\* somewhat reasonable while actually being absolutely insanely high expectations.
I love it! I‚Äôm following to stay updated. Good luck and God speed!
Will u ever share this ALGO/ strategy for others to use. Ik the comments are salty but I had the same idea in my mind just don‚Äôt know how to execute and I can‚Äôt code, unfortunately. I‚Äôm interested in this definitely gonna follow the journey
4K to 6MM is impossible to do by skill, it‚Äôs just pure luck at this point
Uff! There‚Äôs a lot of negativity in these comments!

It seems like you are just getting exposed to exponential growth! I remember when I looked at an excel spreadsheet with like 25% a week‚Ä¶ what can happen in a year is mind blowing!

Don‚Äôt let that high go! But as you continue trading you‚Äôll likely find how sometimes reality doesn‚Äôt match pure math ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

From the little you showed it seems like you have the possibility of having high returns but your losses offsets them. Have you considered putting stop losses on your trades? If you are wrong, just be wrong and take a 15% or 20% loss and call it. And if you are right take that 95%.

With a proper profit/loss ratio you can be correct only 50% of the time and still be profitable. Don‚Äôt hold losers! Don‚Äôt let them get to -67% for goodness sake!

If you have a way to trade and make a profit the second and most important part is to find a way to not return that money to the market!

Good luck!
Are you going to post your trades here before you actually do them so we can do them together?
Interesing!

3 years ago I pass through the learning curve of authenticating via Oath 2 in TDA and coded a bot which was trading also exclusively options. In my case it was a very simple approach buying CALLS or PUTS depending on some criteria I establish expecting certain stocks to go up or down... never really manage to make some money with that but the learning to fully automate was very valuable.

Now I am not in TDA anymore but moved to Charles Schwab who recently granted me access as developer. I just finished the code to pass through the Oauth 2 successfully.

I only like doing options for trading... the philosophy I want to follow is very simple: only invest long-term in ETFs, save in Bitcoin and trade in options.  
  
The problem I have is that I am still quite new to options trading and do not really have a strategy to implement.

Can see you indicate you exclusively trade options on QQQ... but you also said something about other 500 shares, so QQQ is not exclusive then?... could you give me any advice on what strategy to follow?
Hi how does python work as is it code or a easier method? I have tradestation. With so called easy language. Thanks
What is keeping you from transitioning from manual trading to fully autonomous trading? Good luck!
[deleted]
Don‚Äôt listen to people that say it‚Äôs impossible. You can do it as long as you protect your capital and learn from your mistakes.
[removed]
if I made 6.8% daily ROI, 2 days in a row, I would take the remaining 250 days off (roughly 252 trading days per year) üòÇ
that
I agree with you entirely, but just to beat the other pedantic nerds, your final sentence depends heavily on the definition of consistent.
I should clarify that I'm trying to reach that number as a long term average. I don't expect every day will be a win, as I didn't win every day this week either. I didn't have a good opportunity every day this week either. I know that 6.8% daily average is ambitious but I think I can pull it off. I'll document my progress so if I'm wrong or blow up my account, you can say I told you so.
Furthermore, you won't believe how insufficient $240k/year will seem in the future -- IF you get used to what it can buy you today.
And that‚Äôs before tax imagine that

There are some hedge funds kind of like that*

Are you withdrawing form that to live or continuing to add ?
I wish I could buy options on this strategy going to 0, then I'd be the one ratcheting my account up to 6MM.
I might. Trading involves a lot of risk. A single IC going wrong could mean a loss of 85%.
You sound like Mr Wonderful from Shark Tank!
Through TOS, commissions and fees are about $0.56 per leg. Bid ask spreads are usually $0.01. I'm not sure what you mean.
I appreciate what you're saying. I'm going to be doing research into the pandemic bear market to see what events caused the market to move or whether there was just a significant downward trend regardless of events. I'm aware that the market will shift eventually, so I will reassess the situation as soon as I start to notice significant movements without events or movements that are higher than historical averages. Thanks for the reminder.
I'm currently re-reading Trading for a living by Elder and it's funny because he specifically talks about people with systems that work in particular market cycles but as soon as the market goes sideways or in circles the 'system' flaws are exposed and the losses flow in ...
What black swan if the risk in IC is limited?
There will be historical patterns to market movements based on fed speeches. Even if that means that no usual trade would be profitable, that's more information to inform decision making.
What is NY session? I don't trade futures, just options on QQQ directly.

I've been live trading with this approach since January 17, 2024. I took some big losses early on, because I didn't know what events to look out for when doing SIC. My cumulative P/L is -$12,738.77. If I can hit my daily ROI goal, I should be back to break even within 21 trading days. However, I'm now confident that I will be able to identify all events and react accordingly. There are 24 events I look out for now, and I optimize my strategies separately for each event.
>With your conservative 6.8% daily return, you will reach $6m after 2.5 years.

At 6.8% daily, he should hit it in under 4 months.
You miscounted your zeroes for Medallion Fund (I think you did $6B, not $6M). At 66% per year, it'll take around 14-15 years to hit $6M from $4K. Overall though I totally agree with your point!
Pretty high. I'm prepared that I could lose 80% in one day if a trade goes very wrong.
Damn, that sounds like a s smash and grab more than it does trading. Get in, get your shit, and get out before they find you.

Edit: with homeboy being an ‚Äúevent‚Äù trader, do you think he priced in the eclipse happening in a few hours?
My more recent posts got downvoted a lot, so I'm not sure where to report. However, my account is now at $10.5K.
And you started with $4,163.63?
I think you meant to say "regress" instead of progress.
For short trades, I will use gross option buying power (i.e. not including premium collected) equivalent to my cash balance. For long trades, depending on what level of losses my simulations predict, I'll do 25-100% of my cash.
I'm not familiar with TradeStation, but I am skilled at Python. I have to write all of the code for getting data and back testing, but I also have complete control over how the trades are structured and what I can optimize in my back tests.
I just really don't want to go through all of the effort to learn a broker's API. I don't have a high enough frequency where I would need to automate, and I have time to enter and monitor the trades. If either of those conditions changed, I would consider automating. I'm also still in the phase of live trading with small amounts to test the system, so I wouldn't want to automate anyway until I had more confidence in the system.
My account is up to $10.5K.
No, 6.8% per day is completely impossible.
So what you're saying is that as long as I protect my capital and learn from my mistakes, I too can achieve 17,000% returns?
Positive affirmations have no place in trading.  6.8%/day avg is not technically impossible, but over a long period of time the probability of achieving it without busting the account is infinitesimally small.  This is largely due to the position sizes that you would need to trade with in order to achieve such a result.  Learn about risk of ruin and kelly criterion.  Even if you have a positive EV, if you size your positions too high you can *still* bust your account. 

Interestingly, your advice to "protect your capital" is precisely why 6.8% per day is fantastical.  Protecting capital means, among other things, sizing positions in a way that mitigates risk of ruin.  This necessarily reduces your return.  

You can't have your cake (keep your capital) and eat it too (get crazy high returns).
its just impossible, its the nature of trading.

6.8% daily isn‚Äôt ambitious. .68% daily is ambitious!!
> I know that 6.8% daily average is ambitious but I think I can pull it off

If you think you can pull it off, why stop at $6M? You'd get to $6M in 111 days, $50M a month after that, and $500M a month after that.
6.8% daily on average isn't ambitious, it's ridiculous. That's over 1700% CAGR assuming a constant book size. Even our most capacity constrained, HFT books don't achieve those kinds of numbers. 

I don't want to be a wet blanket, but you should really set more realistic expectations for yourself or you're doomed to failure. Just my two cents. Good luck.
If you can pull 6.8% daily, it will take you 467 days to have $1 billion.
Correct, that's why i am aiming for the same goal as OP although i actually need $50k/year to live now. With calculated avg inflation of 2.5%, it would take 65 years for $240k to have the purchasing power of $50k today.
Yeah that cracks me up. I‚Äôm looking for table scraps. He wants the house. 1% a month get some 12+% a year.  Taxes take a third, inflation takes a third, the fam takes the last third.
What are some examples?
I have a regular job that pays the bills.
Why do you think that particular risk only applies once the account reaches $6M?  Is that risk any different when your account is at $1M? What about $100k? or perhaps $4k?

Or are you going for a lotto play to hit $6M and then you'll lock it away if you're lucky?
Wow, I didn't realize that the spreads were that tight on those options, and that is indeed a very fair commission. That won't be as much of a drag on your potential earnings, which means that you'll simply lose money slower than I originally thought.
Exactly.
really good book, like Steenbarger's and Tensile Trading.
NY session normally means the regular trading hours (not "premarket" or "post market"). Monday through Friday 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
> I'm now confident that I will be able to identify all events and react accordingly

yeah. I'm glad you have better algos than everyone else on this site
Curious on what the 24 events are?
>under 4 months.

Thanks, edited
Ever thought it possible for a trade to go very wrong 2 days in a row?
Honestly I think the  information gap of earning 6.8% a day is so huge that it's not anything other than hit and run. Because market will adopt whatever your magic strategy is really fast.
And if it's not some secrets few people know, why other traders can't earn that money? They are stupid? Definitely not.
In all, I think trading is all about information. 
I do hope op understands even he classified 101 kinds of news, the next one may not fit in his model since our world is changing dynamically.
What's important is the principle of fear and greedy index and how to explain it. If anyone has such an unique understanding, one could earn some real money.
But if op doesn't have exit line and stop loss line according to the correction of events, well... Event is happening really fast, so does your profit and loss :)
In case you're not being facetious, I did not do anything different based on the eclipse.
You're risk looks really high. You're not suppose to risk over like 2% per trade. As long as you know the risk and are ok with it.
didn't you see? he's going back to school. Or starting a business (more profitable than trading and making 10M a year). And while he's making 1000% a year, once he gets to 6M, he'll put it all in an index fund and make 4% a year thereafter. Totally reasonable, totally well thought-out plans
Hey, maybe this guy is just leagues better than RenTech, Two Sigma, Citadel, HRT, and every other hegdefund that employs hundreds of the smartest PhDs and ends up making like 1% of what this guys goal is.
1700% CAGR would be 0.68% daily (which is already ridiculous).

6.8% daily, the number that OP stated, would get you from $1 to $26B (= $1.068\^365) in a year. After two years, your wealth would be 100000x higher than the current total global wealth.

It's already be amazing if you can generate 10% CAGR in uncorrelated returns (compared to an index fund) as an individual retail trader. Converted to an average daily return, that'd be 0.026%. OP's expectation is off by two orders of magnitude.

(And it's just not useful to think in terms of daily returns for directional investments into stocks, as your actual daily returns will differ widely from your long term average, just because daily vol is much greater than daily avg return.)
BTW, I'm not trying to be mean, I just don't want to see you lose money using a strategy that has already been proven to be a losing endeavor. Better to paper trade a strategy first if you really have a lot of conviction in it before deploying real dollars.
"Well though out" (i.e school of Tiktok)
It's tough to make a higher percentage than RenTech, but it's certainly not impossible with retail amounts. The Medallion Fund is capped at 10B, at a certain point, trades become so large that they distort the market too much. They could easily earn a higher percentage, just nobody will beat them in absolute amounts.

For example, in crypto, a lot of smart money only bothers with the largest coins because why run infrastructure for a market that only allows you to trade 10k before slippage eats you? At those amounts, you see inefficiencies that have been well documented long before computers became involved.
Oh do shut up, you don't have a clue about trading. If you did, you would understand the difference between institutional and retail trading. You really think a fund having to get a return on billions of dollars of investment is competing for the same alpha somebody trying to grow a 5k account is? Stop peddling this tired about line about Rentech and others, having legions of people with phds as if that is the differentiator. I can tell you have never traded in your life.
It's possible to do a bit better than them at lower volumes, but it is not possible to consistently do 100 times better than them.

‚ÄúThey allegedly manipulated the victim into providing them their sensitive private information, including their private keys to their Bitcoin wallet, so they could reset the victim‚Äôs two-factor authentication and transfer their funds. ‚Äú

This part is not the way Bitcoin works. Once you have the private keys, that‚Äôs it, there is no 2FA.
Who was the victim? Who just has a quarter billy lying around?!!?!?!?
Anybody with $243

Literally?
Didn‚Äôt that (awful) beekeeper movie show how these scammers should be dealt with? 

Lol the only people defending these people are those who are secretly jealous or envious of them - who would do the same in a second
Is this confirmed to be fully real? I don't do anything in crypto or follow anything about it, so I don't know who zachXBT is, but I saw this headline in a friends discord server and genuinely couldn't believe it, cause we know all 3 of the people involved lmao

I figured yall would know better than me, and no major news outlet has said anything about it other than crypto websites.
Fucking legend
Phew ... I thought they got me but then I remembered I only have $243,709,068.02
Golden age of fraud, baby! Have you gotten yours? It's off the hook!!!$$$. Law enforcement is weak, understaffed and not that smart. Tongue in cheek, sort of.
I actually know these guys through the game Minecraft of all things.... No I'm not joking. Greavys used to post Minecraft pvp videos on YouTube and if you look up his name, his original channel is gone but other people knew of his name and made videos about him. Him, chetal and box/ iamboxtops used to sim swapping peoples Minecraft accounts to sell them later,
Yeah.. Never scamm so much that its not only worth to give you to LES but also to kidnapp you and lock down a cellar for 20 years and be tortured all that time.... These scammers will have it hard.
If someone did this to me and that was 100% of my money... I would become a villain
lived down the road from me in LA. they were dropping 500k on a Monday. they were bragging about fraud
I'm gonna be real: those guys really screwed up recording a video to celebrate afterwards. I could not in a million years imagine having the gall to steal that much money. I'd be shocked if the victim didn't have a heart attack.
Dude was a Nigerian prince?
How can you fall for that with that much money is freaking wild
[removed]
how many years are they realistically looking at if found guilty?
How does one person have that in net worth?
>They allegedly manipulated the victim into providing them their sensitive private information, including their private keys to their Bitcoin wallet, so they could reset the victim‚Äôs two-factor authentication and transfer their funds.

What?  
This is not how it works. There is no 2FA.  
If you have the private keys, you have access to the wallet.
damn, they sound freaking excited like they haven‚Äôt had sex in 10 years
Thanks for telling me it was literally, sometimes I think one guy means many
"Investigators were able to freeze $9M and returned $500,000 to the victim"

  
Insult to injury
Imagine having a quarter billion dollars and still being stupid enough to fall for a fake tech support scam
GTA space weapons irl last 4 years.
And I thought I was having a bad day
Here comes the thing with centralized holding of crypto. Imagine someome would be capable to get the btc/etc holdings from the top wallets.
WHY YOU REDEEM
Beekeeper enters the chat
Please enter your seed phrase, we need that to ensure your funds are SAFU
Why is it ‚ÄúCrypto Scammers‚Äù? They‚Äôre just scammers period
never seen pinocchio
I live in the same town as Veer. A group of guys from Florida came out here and attempted to kidnap his parents for ransom. They were immediately caught and the whole investigation found all the info on the crypto scam.
Had to get the 3 cents
member when 'one guy' was unambiguous and did not have to be qualified by the descriptor 'literally'
Evil bxstards! Some people deserve to rot inhell
So they caught them I imagine he's going to get a lot of that back. You can't spend a quarter billion that fast
lol so far they have returned 500k to the victim‚Ä¶ so .002% of what was stolen
I still think it‚Äôs way safer than a bank and insurance‚Ä¶
Imagine being smart enough to hack that and then also leak your ID. Imagine also being smart enough to have had that many btc and then give away your private keys‚Ä¶WTF
Hey, send your crypto here, and we can double it with this one trick....
I would hire a contractor or whoever can help me even if I pay 50% of the funds. It would be also perfect if sending those scammers to hell would be included too. Damn, such a lot of money.
I wish someone would do this to Elmo skuM, but with a few more "0's".
That‚Äôs pretty badass ngl. I wish I could see the scammers reaction when they realized their plan succeeded
Dude starting from square one
Surly they can‚Äôt get away with this crime
Crazy stuff
I heard freakout guy say ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù
Hooooly shit. Will they be able to track down everything that wasn‚Äôt spent and return it? So far only $500k with $9 mil frozen hurts lol.
I gotta check my wallet /s
‚ÄúCurrency of the future‚Äù hahahaha
[deleted]
Hmm to have so much money in one address üôà
Who is Literally One Guy?
Who is answering their phone anymore!?
Did they steal crypto?
So they stole exactly 0$ unless they can spend what they stole in something real E.G. cars, houses, groceries...
their own fault if you get phished lmao
Stuff like this really makes me upset that I can‚Äôt just find THE ONE crypto whale who is nice enough to change my life for no other reason than being a nice guy. All I need is that 1 million. 

Here‚Äôs to hoping the scammers are robinhoods?
there are very few occasions where i'm more or less ok with people scamming/robbing and scamming/robbing someone worth hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto alone is one of them.
Please be Elon please be Elon..... fuck

Moby dick
I think the term is called butchering a pig.
This comment section didn‚Äôt disappoint¬†
Yes
That's enough to hire a private military contractor to "recover" the funds.
Yup. They weren't even slick about it... Seems they basically bragged about it online, and got immediately identified. 2 were already caught, the third just got his brand new mansion raided by the FBI yesterday üòÖ. Seriously how stupid can you be...
They will never see the daylight again...
They‚Äôd confiscate the money and never give it back. Bigger crooks than the crooks.
It's taking a very long time for people to realise that the most valuable thing they own is intangible - their data.  Personal data has to be the most stolen property of all the things stolen.  Once your data is available to criminals, they can keep on robbing you. Even after you're dead. You can never get it back off the internet. It always exists somewhere and the tools used to piece together and discover even more information about you are quite frightening. They don't need much data to get started.

Until we respect and understand that, scammers will always win.
Are those their actual doxxed identities? (pardon possible redundancy)
Hold up I read the article and unless I'm not reading this correctly , he provided his private keys. That should have been a red giant flag.
I would get banned for saying the things I hope happen to those hackers. Glad they're getting caught.
"Instagram posts showed them spending the money on luxury goods like watches, jewelry, and cars. In a particularly tragic screenshot of some DMs, a young man offers a girl a pink car as an ‚Äúearly birthday gift.‚Äù She responds, ‚ÄúI am taken once again.‚Äù

Livin' la Vida Loca (short term version)
If the scammer was smarter than the whale they would have moved the money to wallets that are unable to be retrieved with only them having the seed phrases + withdrawning some cash and storing it in a hidden location.
Why are the authorities putting their nose in this? Let them be scammed
It's unfortunate a man smart enough to amass such wealth and then fell for the customer support scam.
And he deserves a chunk of the recovered funds.
Coffeezilla of blockchain.
One of the few good ones of Crypto. 

Next to Coffeezilla.
One would think when you have over 4k bitcoin that you'd at least learn to never give your keys to anyone.
Who knows ... this whale might have just gotten lucky with crypto.  
I think there are quite a few people, who are not smart in any way, but got lucky with bitcoin.

Losing that much BTC to an obvious scam is infuriatingly stupid.
I just heard about this guy from this post. That‚Äôs awesome he‚Äôs doing this. Especially for this case. Having a bunch of dirt bags have access to a quarter billion dollars is not good.
i like to think coffeezilla is the zachxbt of youtube
He‚Äôs going to *fuckin* them well?
And done so quite safely with the ability to sleep at night.
Not saying it's a bad idea, but the FDIC only covers up to $250,000. Personally I'd want most of it in gold, silver and ammo.
They leaked it themselves
They bragged about the heist and published a recording of them getting the 250 mil.

Doing so they doxxed their own names
It‚Äôs poorly written. 74 BTC came from a Gemini account that had 2FA protection and an additional 4,064 BTC came from a wallet they got the keys to.
An OG, first tx's in that wallet were 2500 btc from 2010.
Sam lessin was the victim
Epic if he is diversified and has multiple 4k wallets üòÇ

Bought 2500 BTC in 2010
Government and lawyers will take half or more. And that's assuming he doesn't owe a ton of tax to the IRS. And that's also assuming he bought the BTC in a "legal" manner.
Says they froze $9M and returned $500,000 to the victim :(
There is literally a video of it on the twitter thread.
I think that was a Homer Simpson "DOH!"
How do you think, "Dude's a legend"  is the top comment.
Yeah hes cryptos private investigator.  

Youll only see him on twitter though.  Like most crypto culture stuff.
Look at the thread. The hackers were spending $250k a night in nightclubs, buying drinks and buying onlyfans creators birkin bags.
Victim blame harder.
Dumbass
Rent free in your head
Moby Dick said that? I thought Moby Dick was a whale.
Lol
That's the romance scam, which SIMP would give up 243m even to the most beautiful girl?
No no pigs get fat hogs get slaughtered
Any movies with this kind of theme in mind?  
I think this is highly probable though
Something‚Ä¶that kind of money can tip scales.  Move a lot of drugs or arms.
Would you look at that? ¬†More organs were donated! Wow!¬†
Get the pinkertons
Oh but don't worry, the victim got 0.2% of the total amount back /s

Government will take the majority of it
well yeah, but he didn't have that anymore.
Unfortunately, the funds to hire them are unavailable.
Hope they spend quality time in a crossbar hotel
Lol I've heard so many people who brag about stealing larges amount of money and getting caught...some could have got away with it if they kept their mouth shutüòÇ
Link to article?
In a case like this, it will be given back.
Like when Microsoft auto-sync your desktop to cloud on new Dell products.
I mean, you only need to do on to "have I been pwned" to see that most of us have had data stolen many many times 

I'm in a number of hacks.

Yet....  Life goes on.

There's data and then there's data.  Like, getting hold of my key words is very different to getting hold of my phone number which is different to....

I feel like you're scaremongering a little there.

Operating in modern society will always involve you sharing data.  And that's ok for the vast majority of us.
That's insane. The most valuable thing you have is your time.  Not some magic beans.  Data security is right up there though!

  
Cheers

Off topic, does anyone have a link to the video of Kiss frontman, Paul Stanley, telling his son not to wash his car because that's a job for the goyim?
which is why having a bank dealing with your money insured and protected against shit like this is preferably for pretty much everyone, and ESPECIALLY if you have fuckin $250m. you're just a massive target for every unhinged hacker on the planet at that point, just a matter of time.
DYOR about Jasmy Coin PDL (private data locker)
One of the best crypto projects in years to come.
Yep, Veer chatel in particular doxxed himself in a screen recording where his windows menu showed his full name momentarily when he used the search function. 

I'm not sure if someone had gained access to one of the threat actors computers, someone leaked it or if they actually bragged about it and shared clips themselves but whatever the case Veer Chetal's name was leaked due to incredibly bad opsec on his part.

The others probably got leaked one way or another but atleast one of them had mixed dirty funds with laundered funds at one point and made luxury purchases and probably exchange withdrawals so that guy was probably identified due to that.
From the twitter thread I think they got the priv keys via screensharing, so I don't think they just outright asked
> Instagram posts showed them spending the money on luxury goods like watches, jewelry, and cars.

Wasting serious money on TraxNYC-like bullshit to brag on Instagram is so insanely lame and basic.
Yeah it seems obvious that before you go Lambo shopping with your stolen millions you'd hide a few encrypted thumb drives in places no one could find and with trusted friends. Open up a bank account in a country that won't give info to the FBI. Make one wallet with a couple mil in it and erase it but only after searing the seed phrase into your memory. It's kind of a fun thought experiment.
What is this the Wild West?
üëÜ We found the kind of scumbag that ends up like these scammers.
Happens to the best of us. Scammers are getting more convincing these days
you don't necessarily have to be smart to amass wealth. Hence "a fool and his money".

Considering how little 4000 btcs used to be worth it's extremely likely this guy just bought Bitcoins early on and that's the sole reason for his wealth. This does not make a genius and giving away a quarter billion dollars to random obvious scammers almost guarantees this guy is an absolute moron.
They fall for that scam because they are VVIP and think the exchange is just giving them top tier customer support and they are kind of spoiled when it comes to customer service interaction in every business.
He gets paid *a lot* for his work sometimes. I‚Äôve seen him get several 6 figure bounties somewhat casually
Zach was coffeezilla before coffeezilla - coffeezilla was quoting Zach for his breakout pieces
Personally i'd want most of it in crypto
Omg go away weirdo
Wait...So 74 Bitcoin was in a hot wallet?!?  
And he gave the keys to 4,064 Bitcoin in cold storage?!?
2500 btc from 2010 and he falls for the oldest trick in the book?? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è thought maybe this guys was some billionaires kid or something buying crypto for the lol‚Äôs

Some guy stole a bunch of BTC from the Silk Road way back when, and the police caught him years later when the bitcoin was worth $3.5 BILLION.

He had it all on thumb drives in an old popcorn tin in his closet.
Yep! They were screen sharing he didn't realize it. They told him to take a photo of the last four of the key while covering the rest with their finger and text it back for verification. The mark didn't realize that they could see the whole thing on screen.
doesnt surprise me that theyre very shallow since they essentially took someones life away
No wonder Miami wanted crypto degens in their community, the dumbasses just go and spend it on useless stuff.
Yeah it is fun thinking about how would you get away with it. Your ideas are good. But I couldn't remember the seed phrases, I'd still need to write it somewhere and hide it. üòÖ

I'd probably withdraw cash and also buy gold bars and bury them somewhere isolated. Would make multiple bury spot locations.
"trusted friends" LOL....

The point of crypto was to not have government meddling in it. If you get scammed, it‚Äôs on you not to be fucking stupid

Temu Overalls‚Ä¶
The biggest hackers are corporations like Google/Facebook, these stories only further the myth that the majority of hacking is done by teens in mom's basement.
Is that not why they tell you to never have your keys on a file in your computer and to use paper?  Basically any time I need my keys I am going to lock myself in a fucking closet with a torch and check them.
Yeah, it's downright psychopathic to drain someone's $243M wallet completely. The guilt would eat me up. If they were smart they would've left $20M in it and offered to give him something like $2M back every year for 20 years in exchange for not contacting the authorities.
Memory palace. Enjoy the rabbit hole.
So you hate tech illiterate old people with early symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs? 

The scams and call centers prey on old people most of the time, and old folks are not very equipped from an education perspective to deal with these risks. 

People like you who lack empathy are more objectively annoying
Because a gambling addict that wins $100,000,000 isn't any more of a genius than the schmucks beside him that lose thousands daily to their addiction.

If he bought bitcoin during it's infancy, he got lucky his small bet paid off in a big way. For every one of this dude, there's millions of others who bought other forms of crypto that did not pay off.
No, top of the class generally. I'm guessing reading comprehension isn't a strong suit for you?
We have no idea how much, or the percentage of that money with regards to his total net worth.

Easily a brazilianaire
Making gains? They literally have the biggest scam industry in the world. There‚Äôs a reason why almost all scam calls have an Indian accent.
Sure, but the likelihood of getting anything back after a crypto theft tends to be pretty close to zero.
thing is...20 million is still a lot of money, plus 2 million a year vs the risk of getting none of that?  Its not a unreasonable offer-it would work on a lot of people.
Tik tok girl spent $200k on an accounting degree‚Ä¶
All this to make 60k a year. Clearly not a good accountant
How much were the balloons?¬†


All in she's probably at $200,015 with the balloons.¬†
$150k for undergrad not including room and board is devious work
$15k for an Associate‚Äôs Degree - took gens and prereqs at community college to save money? Something not adding up.
I came out with 25k debt for my masters and felt that was too much. 

How do people sleep with this debt hanging over them.
$150k for 2yrs post transfer ‚ò†Ô∏è
That's ridiculous. Thank god for CUNY.
Way to take one of the best bang for buck degrees and overspend on it. One of the draws for accounting degree is that school don't matter and it is generally taught the same everywhere. 

10k total debt here between both BA and Masters.
I remember looking at Lehigh in PA and thinking the campus was overly groomed and beautiful. She probably had some heft landscaping fees
Well this is awkward, wasn't expecting to see my alma mater on this sub today...
I spent nothing. Got a job as an admin at a state university with employee tuition benefits and did evening classes. Did accounting during the day, learned it after work. I guess she had no way of knowing whether 200k was a reasonable cost for that degree as she had not yet learned how to count.¬†
You could go to a community college then a state school & pay half the cost‚Ä¶?  What am I missing here?
Jesus Christ. I'd have made sure to break into goddamn private equity if I spent THAT much. Not even investment banking; just go into private equity. My uni debt is around $50k; it was a double degree in accounting and finance at a top uni here in Australia. Good luck even thinking about a mortgage lmao
Mommy and Daddy paid for her school and subsidize her entire life and will continue to do so. Us plebs don‚Äôt have that safety net.

I feel like I lucked out. I got full rides for my bachelors and masters so I have no student loan debt üò≠
How many times did she change her major to rack up that much debt?
Lehigh is one of the most expensive schools in Pennsylvania
I came out with $25k after 5 years. This is fucked, good luck fam
Are people really only making 60K a year with their masters?
I'll never understand people who go into accounting but don't account for the costs of education and their pay to determine ROI.

If you wanna be an accountant then act like it.

Her parents should‚Äôve taught her better. Private tuition + not living at home is just unjustifiably expensive.

First 2 years of undergrad at community college = 10K~~. 3K paid by parents, paid the rest myself working when in school.

Last 2 years - 22K~~. Paid out of pocket for half and the other half I got from a private scholarship (didn‚Äôt work at all the first semester to focus on grades. Got top 10 in the program which landed me the scholarship).

Lived with parents so no room & board. Got the 150 with CLEP, AP credits, and taking extra credits (additional classes were free after reaching full time credits). Graduated with no debt.
Hey, shit happens, dude. When I first got to college, I had a terrible combination of massive social anxiety and ADHD (obviously I still have ADHD, as it never goes away, lol).

First went to a private university to play football my freshman year. Didn't really understand the concept of student loans, and was immediately hit with $40k in private loans with high interest.

Went a couple years for exercise sciencebat a different university, then got massive anxiety about having to touch other students and be touched by them in clinicals, so I stopped going (but still enrolled in classes because I had every intention to go). Racked up a ton of debt there.

Switched majors a few times because I didn't know what I wanted to do (I'd been convinced for years I wanted to be a personal trainer), and because of ADHD, so that racked up some more debt.

A decade later, finally decided on accounting, and went through with it. Got my Bachelor's and masters, and with it, a huge amount of debt (~$120k total).

Just saying, sometimes people are going through shit and it makes them make bad financial decisions that they otherwise wouldn't have made.

Edit: For what it's worth, I don't even really like accounting, I just needed a better career to pay off my debt. I'd so much rather be a screenwriter or novelist.
$75k/yr to finish your bachelor's??????
The amount of cope in this thread is insane. She‚Äôs on the high end of tuition but she isn‚Äôt the only person to get their CPA credits from a private school.   There‚Äôs a reason the Ivy Leagues don‚Äôt offer Accounting as a major, it‚Äôs basically just an elaborate CPA Prep Course and job training for Big 4 firms.
Don‚Äôt forget the $2k+ for CPA exam prep and $200+ fee PER EXAM if college tuition wasn‚Äôt enough.
What about money to Peter Olinto to pass the CPA exams?
Lehigh is an extremely overpriced university.
There are so many other ways to reduce the cost (i.e.,state schools, additional cc courses). The masters is pointless once you get your CPA, imo. 

This is outrageous spending. ‚ò†Ô∏è
I think if I calculate how much I spent on my degree, it'd be like 20k Canadian which is about three fiddy US
Bitch got her CPA. She‚Äôll be fine. Definitely smart enough to know a CPA makes more than 60k. Love this for her. üíï
Becoming a plumber seems more fiscally responsible
I‚Äôve known two people whose parents literally spent over $300k for them to get a undergrad accounting degree, all for them to just slum it with the state school kids at B4 making the exact same money
How the hell did she spend 15k at CC. My local one lets high school students go for free for their last two years of HS and you have your assoc at 18 years old lol
My student loans will probably be around 30k when I graduate with 150 credits. And that's including $10,000 in previous loans from before covid. (Ironically the deferment on payments during covid actually is the only reason I still qualify for aid to go back) I don't understand how people get this much debt. And I borrow every penny of my tuition, but I also work so I'm paying my rent and bills with income not loans. 

There's a chance it'll be higher if for some reason I don't qualify for the pell grant for the rest of my undergrad but based on what my income has been I should get it all through my undergrad.
Geez my total was 14k
And I thought I was a dummy for going to an out of state school for my accounting degree. Thankfully it still wasn't a particularly pricey college, and I came in with an ass ton of AP credits so no master's needed for 150.
I am an accounting major who has almost a full ride üíÄ. I say I have a full ride because in reality I pay like 1K per year but that‚Äôs covered by outside scholarships. I might have to take loans for summer classes tho which sucks but let‚Äôs say ~9K-12K in loans if I take summer classes every summer (probably not). And then I‚Äôd do a masters, which would require about ~50K. And that‚Äôs it for me üíÄ. I‚Äôll probably have ~3K in loans because this summer‚Äôs classes, but compared to ~200K is crazy
I‚Äôm sick holy shit, can‚Äôt imagine spending that much on any degree. Accounting is a good degree but idk how you ever pay that back.
This is way too high, I don‚Äôt know what she was spending that amount on in college, but I graduated 3 years ago with a master and it only cost 17k. Undergraduate cost 40k
Expensive? Yes.

Not every accountant is going to be spending this BUUUT it‚Äôs not unheard of to think the smartest people go to the more expensive universities due to the opportunities they offer.

Why would anyone (other than this dumbass) spend $250k to become *an accountant*?

So what? We just continue to bolster our talent with people from poorer schools.  They may include people who didn‚Äôt have opportunity due to a plethora of things.  They also might include the generations that can‚Äôt fucking read.
I graduated in 2011; went to a 4 year private college and got an MBA after; no aid and cost me $170K. I was the first in my family to go to college and we had no idea what the fuck we were doing. It took me 12 years to pay it off and I sacrificed a lot to do that, including working 2 jobs at some points. I am really grateful I started my career in Big 4 cause it helped me land good lucrative jobs in the future that allowed me to pay off my loans "early". 

I knew shortly after graduation that I made a huge mistake and the road to pay off would be hard. This Tik Tok is not a flex; it's fucking dumb. 

My priority now is being able to save for my daughter to have help for college and make sure she also doesn't do dumb shit like this.
Ppl go to those school to party and escape home.
I just wanna know how/why she spent 150k on two years of bachelor vs just 55k for both associates and masters

I paid $0 throughout my university years, graduated with $30k of student debt (which included all my expenses - room, food, supplies for 4 years).  CPA study and exams were covered by my first firm.
long story short, don't trust her with your money.
When that 529 plan be looking like a fully funded 401k plan
I got money for taking my accounting degree lmao
She didn‚Äôt go in wanting an accounting degree, because under no circumstance does it make any sense whatsoever that she would have gotten an associates then gone to a university that wouldn‚Äôt accept the credits.¬† What likely happened is she got her associates in something else, tried to complete that degree, couldn‚Äôt do it, and then defaulted into accounting like a lot of the accounting people we interact with on the real world that have a degree but have no idea what the fuck credit and debits are unless they have an example in front of them.¬†
Yeah if you hire an accountant that spent $150k on their Bachelor‚Äôs after getting their associates with gen eds and prereqs  to make things cheaper then just know, you hired the wrong accountant. 

Can someone explain prereqs for me? I‚Äôm Canadian but that sounds like something you should do in High School.
Holy fuck. How the fuck do you spend 150,000 on two years of school? She wasn‚Äôt even rooming? Lady I hope you fucking milked Lehigh University for every drop of influence and connections you could fucking get
I spent so far $4500 at WGU I‚Äôm almost halfway done with my bachelors degree so my bachelors degree will be $9,000. So grateful I didn‚Äôt go to standard college route everyday
That‚Äôs out of state tuition in the US for you. Obviously seems ridiculous but when you‚Äôre making that decision as an 18 year old, you might not be considering all the consequences.
I shopped around for the absolute cheapest, I think the associates was around $4k living at home, and crammed the bachelors in with 3 semesters against several recommendations, all tuition and materials needed for that was a little under 10k, outside of food/housing
I ended up turning down a better masters program that accepted me because of the cost.
And we can sit for the exam with our undergrad BSA. Ouch
I was sweating with my 15K debt from college fk me. 200K ‚ò†Ô∏è
Wow no scholarships?
I finished my bachelors degree online and after CPE funds (work benefit), tuition reimbursement (work benefit), and pell grants I actually came out ahead \~$1,500.
Well Lehigh university is a private university
Lehigh is terribly over priced. Almost all secondary education is but they are up there with the most expensive schools in the country. I was getting recruited for a football scholarship outta high school and had multiple full ride offers to d1 schools. Lehigh coaches contacted me 6 months before singing day saying that I was a ‚Äútop priority‚Äù. If teams are actually interested they usually contact the player wayyyyy before that. They were only offering a partial scholarship so I‚Äôd have to pay 40-60k over 4-5 years. I spoke to one of the coaches out of respect but was never truly interested. During this call I straight up told the guy I wasn‚Äôt interested because of the tuition. He kept talking about how ‚Äúgreat‚Äù the education is and all the money I‚Äôd make with a Lehigh degree. The faculty is obviously so out of touch and they are fine with destroying futures and selling a failing process. 

I went with the full ride and am currently 6 years into a career that isn‚Äôt in my field of study. Also had similar conversations with Ivy League schools but their athletic scholarships work a bit differently and they are at least somewhat aware that the education they provide is basically an over priced luxury product. Staying away from those ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù schools was one of my best decisions in my adult life.
In the Netherlands it would cost only 8k euros for bachelor and masters in accounting (or any degree for that matter)... US education is so messed up
Crazy. I spent 20k in total to make $56k first year. Solid decision. I commuted to local university and worked 30 hours per week for the duration, so no wild college experiences, with the exception of a few weekend visits to friends at various New England universities.
I looked at more of her Tik Toks and she‚Äôs flexing her expensive watches and cars. Also complaining about ‚Äúbusy season hours‚Äù yet she worked from 8am to 4pm‚Ä¶
Becker‚Ä¶$50k
I got my cpa almost free.
Oh she‚Äôs Le high alright.
Not surprising. A bachelor's at a midtier state school with out of state tuition can easily be 120+, not much of a jump to 200k if you end up on either of the coasts.
Why the fuck did she go to community college then?
The trashy arm tats scream Pennsylvania.
Damn all of that money spent.. wish I could see her reaction to her hearing her salary from hr or whoever.
I wonder if she ever looked up starting salaries a single time.
And I am getting my paid for while being paid by the military. People don't seems to be aware of the time value of money.

I'll never understand why and how people go so deep into debt for a degree.

It she a was a doctor or lawyer, maybe. But for a BComm, it is way too much.
Funny seeing my hometown college here lol
The math on this is absolutely ludicrous...it easily should have cost her half if not less.¬†
I think I paid a total of 15,000 from all my 150 credits. And another 3k for my CPA with exams and study materials.
$150k for an accounting bachelors.

And I thought I was spending too much on my $50k Economics bachelors degree.
That‚Äôs absolutely absurd. Why does anyone go to a private school? The sticker price for undergrad tuition at my state school was $10-12K per year, and my one year Masters‚Äô program at the same school cost like $26K total. That‚Äôs before scholarships and aid, my total debt at graduation was only $19K.

Like, clearly paying double or more for the same degree (from a school that likely has no better a reputation than a cheaper state school) is dumb. Like so many other students her career choice and major were fine. It‚Äôs the poor college planning that screwed her.
I graduated with about 140k in debt, biggest mistake of my life. Thankfully 4 years later it‚Äôs almost paid off.
Oh man, she‚Äôs in for a big surprise when she finds out accounting doesn‚Äôt pay shit these days.
When did Trevor Lawrence go back to school?
15k at what community college lmao? Like are there Ivy League CC because that‚Äôs just obscene.
The more I think about this post the more sad I become
So, I got a scholarship for my undergrad, worked while I was in school, lived with my parents, and went to community college. I graduated my undergrad with 0 debt. However, when I went to graduate school, I had too low of a gpa to get into the one I wanted and the only one that would take me was this online school that charged me a solid $33k (which I wasn‚Äôt happy about), but after seeing this poor sap, I honestly don‚Äôt feel as bad.
I paid a whopping $7500 for 9 semesters, 150 hours, and two separate degrees from a B4 pipeline state school. And no, mommy & daddy didn‚Äôt pay either. Only 5 years ago too. 

Why, on God‚Äôs green earth, would anyone willingly pay that much for a liberal arts college that nobody knows outside a small region of the country? To go into accounting!? 

This reminds me of college when all of us that went to public grade school would absolutely roast the private school kids for their parents paying $150k+ in tuition just for them to end up in the same college as we did ü§£
Did she at least get into Big4?
An accounting degree, including masters, is worth $40k at most. It may not cost that much, but the average pay simply isn‚Äôt worth more. 

A CPA without a masters is worth the cost of the masters. Separately priced it‚Äôs worth about $20k. 

Fire out how to pay less than that or get someone else to pay.
And people wonder why there‚Äôs a shortage of qualified accountants. I sincerely hope she had some scholarships and grants to knock this down and it wasn‚Äôt all straight up borrowed.
I feel like a proper accountant now for getting my charter for ¬£3k all in üòÇ
Why do so many people think degrees are worth this much? ‚ÄúMay be cheaper or more expensive‚Äù bro I would flip my shit if it was half that cost.
Damn I am spending less than that. UCLA cost me 12,000 dollars.
Becker Review is going to be expensive. Thinking of using Gleim. Btw a smart person would have taken advantage of community college to get their accounting units out of the way, you only need university for like one or two upper division. Shit, I never pay for community college in California. Just say you make 0 or say you're an illegal, you get BOG Fee Waiver. It's a shame I have to say I am an illegal to get free community college.
Are Indian degrees valid for the US ? You can get a bachelor's and master's degree in India for 1/5 the cost. Then do your CPA in the US. Good way for Americans to save student loans.
I‚Äôm also paying out the ass for my degree. It‚Äôs ended up taking me 5 years to do my double major in accting/finance because I failed one entire semester plus probably some extra classes earlier on. I‚Äôm not the best student and honestly suck at accounting compared to my finance classes in which I have straight As. On top of that, I lost ALL federal funding my junior year because my parents make too much money. No pell grant, no subsidized loans etc etc. trying to figure out how I‚Äôm going to go about getting my masters
I only owed $17k in student loans. Already paid them off. I'm not sure what my total cost was. I got a lot of scholarship money. I think $10k a year for tuition. Community college was free for me. I paid for my books and gas to get there. If I had to guess school cost $45k total. My parents paid for my rent during university and I lived with them during community college. So all in all after scholarships I probably spent $25k-$30k myself.
Spent 25k on undergrad including room and board and never went to community college wtf is this.
And she will be accounting for other people money? üò¨
Man I spent under 65k total doing cc for Gen Ed, plus remaining rando credits to round out 150, and went to a school that most people outside of my area have never heard of that cost like 20000/year for 2 years to do my accounting bachelor's, and I still probably landed essentially the same role as miss Lehigh over here
Geez 150k for a Bachelors degree, mine was less than 10k and I didn't even have the AD to skip part of it.
CPA not even accounting degree
$150k for a bachelors degree in almost anything is crazy. I paid less than that for the combination of my bachelors in accounting and for law school.
Is Lehigh 75k per year or something?
South Carolina has free or very cheap tuition to state schools if you get decent grades in high school. B‚Äôs end up being a few thousand a year, A‚Äôs was free and maybe a bit extra.
She is going to be GREAT at padding her charge hour a in public based on how well she‚Äôs padding her tuition costs. 

No way she spent $150K on finishing her undergrad, especially after already getting an associates. Unless she took multiple victory lap years, I call bullshit. 

Like, college is stupid expensive, I get it‚Ä¶ but why do we have to lie and pretend that it‚Äôs even worse than it is?
I have 2 degrees and have zero loans. Took 8 years and slowed down college.  Don't understand why ppl rush it so they can graduate with their friends
5k for associates through JC

10k for undergrads through WGU
I cheated.

I married a professor.  Can you say "free tuition"?  (I had to pay taxes on my graduate school tuition.)
I actually made ~$15,000 from my accounting degree. Lived at home, 2yr community college and 3yr state school. All paid by CA state grants and FAFSA.
$205k** 

I am sorry.
I used this great government program where they pay you to go to school. Paid $0 for my associates, $0 for my bachelor's, and working on my MBA at a discounted $280 per class at a state university. They even covered half of the cost for my EA and I'm working on getting half of the CPA costs covered. I did trade in ten years of my life for that though.
I work with a manager at my big4 who spent like 80k for her 1 year MAcc at University of Southern California (we are in Atlanta and USC has no cache here) 

I paid less than that for undergrad and MAcc at my state college. I have 0 sympathy for these 300k student debt private school people
Lehigh is that expensive for undergrad? 

It‚Äôs mba costs a barely anything. Hmm.

Another option is: any in-state school + post bacc coursework. If your state offers online option for hours: UCLA or UC Berkeley extension is pretty cheap $7-9K for everything to be CPA eligible (post-baccalaureate).
I spent about $5k out of pocket, employer paid for the rest and I got a few scholarships
FOMO is real.  Hope have the loans equivalent to my doc spouse was worth it.
Didnt try to get any scholarships or grants
That was a mistake. 

Is community college even that expensive? It was $43 a unit for me. So like 6k with books for 3 years. No masters. And my 2 years at a state school that‚Äôs highly recruited from was another 19k I‚Äôm assuming with books. This was 2016, so not that long ago. 

The time commitment was bad and I‚Äôm not including room and board- that‚Äôs what $25k.
I was born in Poland and I find that disappointing that in the Netherlands people even need to pay for higher education.. ‚Ç¨2314 per year.
I pretty sure I paid around $50-60k all in for my undergraduate and masters program. I paid as I went and rather would have not tracked costs obsessively. 

Thanks for some veteran pricing and also taking 90 credits at community colleges and transferring them to a 4 year college. Saved a pretty penny and not progressing too bad salary wise.
For the most part, I have been paying my way through school out of pocket. I have around $6k in small student loans because school got too expensive, and that‚Äôs for my associates degree. Whatever debt she has for an accounting degree is horrendous
Lehigh!!!! 83k/yr and only going up üôÉ
The sticker price for my undergrad was $80k for 4 years including room and board and I thought that was expensive! Luckily I received many scholarships and didn‚Äôt have to take out any loans. People need to shop around for undergrad degrees more, especially in accounting where the school doesn‚Äôt really matter
Lehigh or Shehigh?
Community College and the 4-year should cost you about 30-40k. I was able to do that and get a masters but needed to run XC just to get there lol. $150k is wild.
lol I spent $30k and got the same degree and license.
This is why you go to an IN STATE school
I spent about ¬£600 on my certificate self studying..

Then got on an apprenticeship, and got my masters/charter all paid for by the courtesy of his majesty... Aka tax monies! 

And as I wait for my results, the same levy will pay for my next degree while I earn sweet ¬£¬£¬£

Bet you never threw all that tea in the harbour now üòÇüòÇ
My degree cost about 20,000
After I graduate, my loans will be roughly, 40k. I couldn't imagine spending 200K on a degree, let alone for accounting.
Damn, America sucks.

Here in the UK I got qualified via an apprenticeship so I earned 25-30k while studying.
You got ripped the fuck off. Medical debt for a fucking accounting degree. Terrible accountant
majored in accounting , took extra classes. Skipped CPA worked public service. Student loans forgiven.  

Come on they teach you cost, budgeting and finance in school.
The government is paying me to go to school right now... pretty dumb..
How tf are you going to go to community College to save money, and then go to a private school anyways?

Just go to a state school.
She's thinking the government would forgive her school loans
Are you sure you want to hire an accountant who does that with her own money?
Yeah seeing this makes me feel grateful I was on scholarship

But to put yourself through the all that to make 60k and doesn't even factor in the cost of the CPA 

Just seems insane to me I hope she got a position working f500 or big 4 atleast to where maybe going to the university she chose was worth it
Im currently an accounting student, i paid for my first year 2,635.60usd, now on my second year paying 2,472.27usd for the whole year, next two years are about 3,500usd together. The military pays for part of my tuition, 2,926.59usd a year, so in total im not even paying for most of my education!
i spent $40k in tuition for my double major accounting and MIS degrees. Decided to abandon PA senior year and pursue IT instead.

Now I make $220k in tech after 3 years of experience, working <30 hours/wk remote.
Wow this is actually embarrassing
My friend goes to Lehigh, it‚Äôs crazy expensive. Beautiful campus but anyone willing to pay 62k for a school in Pennsylvania that isn‚Äôt UPenn or Carnegie is out of their mind
$15,000?! For community college‚Ä¶ she got scammed because I went to community college debt free and I got about 30k from the govt at the end of 2 1/2yrs, then I went to a 4yr college almost debt free (2500$)
Anytime I think im miserable, ppl are out there with situations like this. I have no debt, tons of money in the bank that I don‚Äôt know what to do with, and live in peace/security. Life is good
I gotta say this is probably cap
I spent a similar amount for my accounting degree, MST and CPA. Loans were paid off in 5 years and making over $200k/year 12 years in. Results may vary, idk what she's doing making $60k as a CPA
I probably was outta pocket $25k all in including exam prep (Roger), CC, CSU, Extra CC units, 7 total exams, CBA bs, etc...

The magic was $5250 annual tuition reimbursement from BofA while I worked FT during CSU years.

You just have to get creative and agree to pace it out an extra year or two so you can still work. Never just blindly accept that $200k in debt is just the way it has to be.

Same CPA.
1st Gen:  I wish someone told me to not go to a $60k university for an Accounting degree that can easily be completed at a much much cheaper university that may not have a flashy name/reputation/whatnot.  Like srsly, get yo degree from online Arizona University.  

It really doesn‚Äôt matter as long as you have ur license, good at Excel, and can do the job using reasonable critical thinking skills.
She went to Lehigh ‚Ä¶ not exactly a budget uni
Holy crap, that's crazy. I went to a local school and paid maybe 20% for my Bachelors and Masters total. Tack on like $5K for study materials currently and exam fees.
I spent $40k on an undergrad engineering, while also having work as an intern during college year to ear some money, I cannot understand how you can spend anything more than 50k for a degree, I spent less and I already feel like it was a waste of money, luckily I recouped it with a good paying job after graduating. Seriously, stop spending too much money on a degree, it's nothing more than an entrance fee to white collar jobs, paying too much for it is just stupid
Must have gone to an expensive private school.¬†
And here i got my bachelors and masters for $7k in total by going to an online school.
I got my associates degree in accounting for less than $8k lol
My mom got her cpa for way less than that
Man, and I was grumbling about paying like 10k for my MPhys
In SF community college is free. I am getting ‚Äúpaid‚Äù to go to community college right now. Regardless 15,000 seems really steep for community college.
My CPA was $18k‚Ä¶ state university cost. All CPA fees reimbursed by firm
In Virginia if you go to a community college and make good enough grades you can transfer to a public school and through an agreement still pay community college tuition.
Dumb
150K on a BS?! üòÇ
I spent about $50k for my 164 credits. 200k is the price of not having a CPA personality before you go get the license.
This must be an American thing. We just go to the CPA School of Business.

Your degree at any major Canadian University is partially funded by the government.
Do people think?
How much of your mental health was destroyed?
10k in debt with the government and 5k in debt with my aunt (our business school required study abroad). I did CC my senior years and continued 2 more years for my AA.
This is insane I‚Äôm graduating with my 150 and i‚Äôm at 50k.
The university she went to is literally almosy 10x more expensive than the one I'm going to. I can't imagine spending that much when in the end they just care if you have your CPA or not
No one should overpay on an undergrad
Could have easily gone to a state school and halved the cost.
I did the community college to state university route and commuted to campus all 4 years while living at home, total cost of my degree was well under $50k and I make just as much in salary now as everyone I know that did accounting at a private university. Unless you're a nepo baby and have rich parents bankrolling your education going to a private university for an undergrad accounting degree is absurd. Save that money for an MBA if you decide to get one later on and go to a cheap school for undergrad.
Wild. Never understood the masters in accounting. I finished 4 years + CPA eligible for 60000 total and don‚Äôt feel any way behind my coworkers that took 5-6 years and way more money for a masters
So, am I wrong? Or you do not have to the the cpa exam in the USA? Did she just skip it or did I miss it?
$200k?!?! That is a crazy price tag. My husband went to an Ivy league and walked away with less in student loans than that. He did live off campus though so not sure if it is because of that. 

Personally I went to a state school and my student loan was a fraction of the cost. I also was paying on it while studying and had only $10k left to pay off once I did graduate.

Guess what though it doesn‚Äôt really matter where you went to school because you end up in the same roles for the same pay. It is a bit harder coming from a state school so you have to have good grades. Ivy League only gets you in the door everything else is up to you.
$150K for a bachelors degree? $40K for masters? Do you even need a master degree to get a CPA in the States? Canada CPA here.

The only way this makes sense is if she was an international student and don't have access to lower tuition rates and subsidies.
She's excluding the costs to purchase CPA study materials and exam fees
She went to a school with pretty high tuition for a field where most people just care if you‚Äôre a CPA, and/or spent time in the Big Four.  I‚Äôm still not sure why she‚Äôd need an associate‚Äôs then four years in undergrad, followed by a masters(plenty of people do a dual program for the master‚Äôs).

Smells like a trust fund baby to me
Up in Alaska accountants without a cpa can make 100k right out of college with a bachelora
I like to squeeze the balloons. Lol. Why get a degree? I became a millionaire this year without any degree or any student loans at the age of 43. It‚Äôs becoming tooooo expensive and it‚Äôs ridiculous.
60k as a CPA? She is terrible at salary negotiations. You can break 100k at a big 4 after a few years
Anyone want to buy mine for ¬£200k? üòÇ
I did 3 years of automotive trade school about 4 years of community college, and 1.5 years of one of the top 10 public universities in the country and it all only cost me $7,000. You just have to know how to take the opportunities that you can.
$150k for undergrad and it wasn‚Äôt even Ivey League üò≥ My Bachelor in Accounting at my local state university was $48k for 4 years before scholarships and $24k after scholarships.
It's fine, it's a *writeoff*
This girl looked at the FAFSA application and said nope, too many pages! üíÄ
Holy shit. I will have paid roughly $20k out of pocket including school and review and the exams. Albeit I live in the state of Georgia where the HOPE scholarship exists, but still‚Ä¶ without the scholarship, I‚Äôd have paid about $33k. Way to make something unnecessarily expensive
LOL, LMAO EVEN.

My entire undergrad degree cost $12k in tuition & fees.   Pell grants & scholarships paid for it.

I didn't even bother with a master's, CPA is good enough.  

This girl is a clown.
Going to a CC to get your gen eds knocked out is a smart decision and can save significant money. Why would you immediately negate that (and then some) by taking out loans to go to a private university? Just go to your state university.
I think I spent about $25k total toward mine. 2 years at community college was about $8k, 1.5 years at local state university was about $17k. My employer reimbursed me for my masters, to help me get to 150 credit hours, also reimbursed the cost of the CPA exams. I also got Becker for free because I worked for them during college.
That‚Äôs wild there are way better ways to do this. I had no financial aid but made sure to go to a company after my bachelor‚Äôs that would sponsor the rest of the program to get CPA and will finish with only ~35k in debt. Also this is all me no parental money or anything. People gotta do their research before just going to college with an end game in mind. Out here wasting money.
People: leave the woman alone. It's not your loans and it's not your life. You think she wasted her money she clearly couldn't care less about what you think. Let people live their lives. I'm sure she will have a successful career and make more than you in a month than you will in a whole year...! If you know what I mean! (jk but still leave her alone lol. Let people. Enjoy their life)
60k undergrad. Masters paid thru by work. CPA program thru work. Now I work in finance because accounting is frankly way too boring and doesn‚Äôt pay as much. In the same state as OP did her education
Lehigh 75K/year, and a BS masters degree lmaooo.  *assuming 2 years at CC. I wonder if she‚Äôs not including financial aid, grants, and probably a lot of parents money. Such a joke I wouldn‚Äôt hire her
Yassssss let‚Äôs celebrate debt!!!
Private school comes with a price.  
-The Dark One 

(If you get the reference, you get it)
It‚Äôs okay, she‚Äôs probably well off üòé
The real kick in the pants is when you realize how much it will cost her to pay it all off in the end. You only get a $2,500 student loan interest deduction per year and I'm sure she is way beyond that amount of interest accruing. Then on top of that, all the principal and interest has to be paid back with after-tax money. So how much wages does she need to earn to pay it back? Probably need to earn 300-400k in total wages to pay it back. 

Accounting doesn't pay enough to justify spending that much.
Clearly didn‚Äôt do any accounting for that debt. 

$8,200 community college, $8,000 undergrad, $11,000 MBA-Finance and I‚Äôm looking at about $1,100 for the CPA next year. Public schools for all of it and even I‚Äôm hurting with $18k in student loans.
Not worth it
I‚Äôm sure her Big 4 internship LinkedIn post wasn‚Äôt insufferable at all
Lmao. CC was 7500 out of pocket & 15k out of pocket for undergrad. No need for masters because I took out 25k my freshman year for a comp sci degree and jumped ship realizing I‚Äôd spend 200k like this dummy & said hell to the nah. Graduated 150 credits & 25k in debt from first uniüíÄ
Damn even going to a UC is cheaper
Her parents prob paid for it and she paid $0, def a good accountant.
I went to community college and then state school, I think I spent maybe $25k? Cpa cost me nothing and then I was paid $5k for passing. Also making almost 10 times what she makes now, she‚Äôs definitely doing it wrong üòÇ
What the heck school is this that cost $150k without room and board for undergrad???? Private universities in California like USC and Pepperdine cost almost $100k including room and board these days
Unless that cc was private , that‚Äôs insane
Brutal
This makes me feel better about my 50k in student loans
Everyone is making fun of her but private school is not cheap. My only comment is she clearly has money, why bother going to CC and just get the true 4 year experience at Lehigh lol.
What having rich parents gets you
Not worth it. She should be a medical doctor with that kind of student loan.
Throw in the cost of a private university or any substantial living expenses and it could be around $300k in California. You could check [this article](https://cpaexamguy.com/cost-of-becoming-a-cpa/).
Bruh you went to an expensive af school for accounting and grad school. That‚Äôs on you
I live by lehigh University and it is SUPER expensive but i don't believe that's the cost without room/board AND that she had an associates already so that should have transferred in.
I paid $10-12k in cash for B.S. First job paid 5x that, now make 13x. Great investment.
This is absolutely bananas. I spent $15k on my four year degree in Canada, maybe another $7k on the Canadian CPA program and exam prep.
Well I studied same state as her‚Ä¶ only owe $10K she clearly did not look into grants or employer tuition reimbursement üò¨
Honestly, I would just take someone who is naturally smart and I would teach them everything they need to know on the job while they follow PY workpapers for the first year over some of the 5 year master students that get recruited
For reference, I have the same degrees and make $180k a year 10 years in. It really depends on the field you pursue.
If i'm spending that much on a degree I would rather pursue Law, or an MBA from a top 10 (or a JD/MBA)
I spent like <15k on the whole process lmao. Get shit on.
Spent 200K to maybe make 80K gross per year and work 80 hours per week üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
In CA your Associates is free at CC. An B.A./B.S is ~16k at a CSU, and MA/MBA is ~28k. Wtf is this horse shit
Do people still not realize you can take FEMA courses for the extra 30 hours? I feel like I never see that mentioned
Probably still puts her debits on the right
Lmao
Idk how much it usually is from your country, but my studies only cost 15k‚Ç¨ (not by year lol)
On God, had never really heard of Lehigh U. before seeing this. Enrollment of 5k undergrads and not really known for its B-school equals poor career network.

Probably would've cut her costs in half and had a better network if she had just gone to a state school ü§î
lmao at the cheeky "took gen eds and prereq courses @ community college to save $$"
Good job tick tak girl
Me: $8k a year for 4 years and took extra classes for 150 units. Spending $32k ain‚Äôt so bad.
I took prerequisites from a community college, CUNY Kingsborough, for $5K. And I'll be starting my Masters in Accounting at Brooklyn College. That'll cost me $11K. 


..but I'm in NYC, and our city universities are cheap. I advise anyone in NYC to use the CUNY system.
Getting an accounting degree is so overrated and such a shit way to get chartered these days. Apprenticeships will do it and you'll barely pay anything.
$200k is insane. I expect to be done with $800 in debt lol. But I took the boring and hard route of working full time and going to CC.
CPA is an accomplishment but bragging like this tacky
205?!
All that just to get replaced by AI software in 5ish year‚Äôs
Yep sounds like an accountant! I cannot tell you how much money the accountants at my work have squandered because they thought in the long run, they‚Äôll save more money. Only to spend more money because they really didn‚Äôt think about what was needed.
Fuck me I go to that school.
Lmao. I think I spent like 10k max for 150 credits. People really do be stupid.
Ha! We had Lehigh professors also teach where I went. 
Cost of that uni was a lot cheaper.
Laughs in european - you will probably have made 200-500k before becoming an CPA where i live. Maybe even more if you study part time.
I spent 4 dabaloons and was INCREDIBLY poor
Lehigh is not that even a great school! lol
Mommy and daddy paid for it more than likely.
Well, community college didn‚Äôt save her any money if she went to a 2 year college that was over $150k
My guess is daddy big bucks paid for her degree.  Lehigh is an awesome school though but yeah you could have went to Penn State for a fraction of the cost and ended up in the same spot.  

If you have the money to spend on your kids college then I guess why not go to the private school.  You get smaller class sizes and usually better resources than the degree factory state schools.  

If Lehigh has a decent alumni which I think it does it could help her in a few years get better jobs too.
I love people in this field.
She gonna be a-countin the money going to bills forever. The irony.¬†
Hello, let me share my story. 

Out of hs, i went straight into my local community college, SRJC. I was able to go there for relatively cheap amount of money (don‚Äôt remember, but about a few hundred bucks). I then transferred to a state school and was able to get my BA after 4 semesters for about 3.5k for each. I admit that was pricey for me, but I worked all through college and my parents didn‚Äôt make me pay rent so I could afford to not have any debtAlso I managed to be cpa eligible! 150 creds. 1.5 years later, I‚Äôm a tax senior making 100k, with no debt, upward career trajectory and a good work life balance. I say this for the people that aren‚Äôt sure of what to do. If you want that out of state experience and have fun, go for it! Just be aware of what that entails if you don‚Äôt have rich parents. Plz look into your CC! Go to a school you can afford. You don‚Äôt need a masters if you get a CPA. Most firms expect you to know very little. Be ready to do public. DMs open to anyone new or worried about the field!
I mean social workers or theatre majors graduating from private 4year all have the same debt coming out. I‚Äôd say she‚Äôll be fine
lol community college to save money then proceeds to go big private school. If she really wanted to save money wouldn‚Äôt she remain at a public school ü§î
I think she must be bad at accounting. Why on earth would you spend 150k on undergrad?
Nah college prices are ridiculous but she played this in the worst way possible. Never heard of a community college that expensive, and that snotty little college gave her the worst bang for buck.
We are seeing a lot of inflation
Also need to include her hourly rate for time spent studying for the CPA when she could have been doing other things. So that‚Äôs like another 60k
You can get those at the dollar store for like $3

Clearly she isn‚Äôt spending wisely if she‚Äôs at $200,015 when she could be at $200,003.17
$15 for the balloons?

FRAUD
who's your balloon guy??
Those are her everyday balloons...
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Shiiiit someone hasn‚Äôt bought balloons lately‚Ä¶
Also wouldn't the associate degree have made the undergrad shorter? I just looked up that university and it said average cost after aid was 33k a year. How she paid 150k for 2-4 years is wild.
definitely some *accounting magic* was involved
I went to Lehigh's website.  Looks like annual tuition is about $68,000.  Ooof.
How she paid $15k for an associates degree is insane.
Seriously, never understood why people go to such expensive schools for accounting when firms literally don‚Äôt care about what school you go to. At least if you go to an expensive but very recognizable school you‚Äôll have a good network, but not in this case.
Jesus, my whole 4 year degree isn't even that much at WVU.
Yeah she didn‚Äôt have to attend a private school though. I got a finance degree (2 years in community college & 3 in bachelors program) for $60,000
For TWO YEARS of undergrad.
It's genuinely difficult for me to wrap my head around. As someone that just did some hiring in the state of Florida, I would take a degree from Lehigh as seriously as I would an accounting degree from University of South Florida, UCF, FIU, FAU, or UNF. Probably less seriously than UF or FSU. All of those, even for out of state students are more affordable.
Sounds like OU üíÄ
Maybe she‚Äôs out of state?
I wanted to go to Lehigh. My parents sat me down and showed how much it was going to cost in loans. I did not go to Lehigh.
College was less expensive when it cost out-of-pocket money. It was also less expensive before the government guaranteed loans for everyone. Harvard could charge $250k per year and would still have a full class as long as students got their loans.
Room and board **and** food! She isn't the brightest bulb.
Christ I can‚Äôt even imagine. I graduated at $30k due to the fact I lived on campus
smhhh I better be going to Harvard for that money.
Right I was thinking the same thing....
When I went to community college, 5 classes a semester were only about $1200. For four semesters that‚Äôs basically 5k.

Out of curiosity I just looked at what it would cost per credit hour and for an out of state student it‚Äôs $4400/ semester which totals to a little less than $18,000 for four semesters. Kinda defeating the purpose of choosing community college to save money if you‚Äôre still an out of state student.
Hiii. I‚Äôm from the state where she‚Äôs from actually. The cost of community college in Lehigh, and PA in general, is quite high (PA in this scenario is Pennsylvania, not public accounting guys but either way whatever the acronym implies we still hate it).

Lehigh community college can range from about 7-16k depending on your income. Lehigh university and Lehigh Community college were also universities I applied to, was accepted and received financial aid for. It‚Äôs true
My two (2) classes this semester at a CC cost over $2,600. I‚Äôd be paying over $20k for 2-full-time years of CC.
Lol right? My community college had a program where if you graduated high school with a 3.5 in their district you got free tuition for 2 years, only paid the fees and books. 1 year cost me like $1-1.5K maybe while living at home.
lol I took my Finance degree AA for $7000, and that incudes changing majors twice and wasting money on classes I didn‚Äôt need
She doesn't say how many years it took to complete any of that.
Did she say that she had the debt, or that was the cost? She could come from a rich family.
That‚Äôs about what my undergrad degree cost me. $1500 per term x 8 was about $12k, but the military paid it all for me thankfully. 

No idea why she thought this was a good idea unless she got it paid for by scholarships or parents. If not it‚Äôs gonna take her a very long time to pay it off.
Something tells me she didn't actually pay for any of it. No sane person that's financially independent would rack up a bill like that
I think I paid for one half one semester of graduate school.
Yeah same I have a little under $30k in student loans. Can‚Äôt imagine having $200k for this job lol
It can vary.  I came out of my master's with about $50k in debt from the Master's alone...but I also kept about $25k in cash from overpayments to the school (stuck it investments rather than giving it back, why eliminate 3-5% debt when it earns 15%+ on the market?)

That said, my undergrad cost quite a bit more (and came out with similar levels of debt to my master's, but without the cash. I could eliminate that debt as well at this point, but again, it's 3-5% debt, why would I get rid of that sooner when I can have that money earn more money instead?)

Lastly, that's all before them raising tuition rates in the past few years, so...yeah, I can see six figure debt being a thing pretty easily.
All in, $60k for MS and Bachelors. Some of that was my fault, though. A company was paying for my MS and I left them to double my pay. Still net positive but did leave me with a loan for a bit.
$150k for undergrad/masters. My payment is \~$300 a month with IBR. It's all funny money.
How long ago did you go to school? I‚Äôm currently in Canada and one semester for my accounting degree is $3750 CAD. $1500 sounds amazing!
My masters was $35K but my company paid all but $3K. Worth it.
And that‚Äôs not including living costs ‚Ä¶..

Either she retook a lot of classes, or her school robbed her. Likely both.
https://catalog.lehigh.edu/informationofgeneralinterest/costofattendance/

Doable. Tuition alone is $61k, call it $62k with all fees. Plus another $10k-ish for housing and another $5k-ish for dining. So $77k per year give or take a few k depending on actual choices. $150k for 2 years is spot on.
This makes no sense my degree was 35k across 4 years at a private college. I assume she just had 0 scholarships or anything because my college is about the same tuition as hers. I also didn't live on campus this just baffles me
Yea Baruch is insanely good. I paid nothing at all and almost all of my college friends eventually secured a job at big4 or big10.
so true
Honestly very grateful I didn‚Äôt have to spend so much on my bachelors thanks to CUNY. 150K for 2 years would‚Äôve driven me insane.
Wonder if there‚Äôs any degree from Lehigh that would make the tuition worth it
I am thrilled for you. Thats awesome!
I completely disagree on quality of education because I started accounting at two very different colleges a few years apart. The well known university was incredibly difficult and I struggled through the 101 course. Everything had to be done by hand. The second time was at a much lower rated university. It was the easiest class ever, I got a 98, and all the tests and work was multiple choice.¬†¬†

¬†The graduate work was probably a lot more closely aligned, but bachelors degrees at 2nd and 3rd tier colleges are a joke in terms of quality of education.¬†
Except the hills..
Don‚Äôt let folks guilt trip you, the reality is the private schools make sense if someone else is footing the bill.
Did you also pay $150k for your undergrad?
That‚Äôs a sweet deal. My school had a similar program where they‚Äôd give employees a 6 credit waiver every semester. Couple of my professors said they used it to get their MBA‚Äôs.
Lehigh is a "Hidden Ivy League". You are paying for the network
Not missing anything, thats exactly what I did. Commuted to university as well, so no additional room and board expenses on campus.

I graduated debt free and got a job at a mid tier firm right out of school.
[deleted]
In reality while she says she paid for a CPA it‚Äôs really an MRS degree.
This. Also, never heard of Lehigh university. Seems like a pretty poor financial decision.
The parents probably paid for it.

She's a first or second year staff.  She's flexing the benz and the nice home on Tiktok with a fiancee who is a teacher.  

I feel pretty comfortable assuming she's got rich parents paying her bills.
I feel you.  Basically my thoughts are "why bash this person?"  I have slightly less debt (racked up about $100k between the bachelor's and my master's) due partially to a similar case of changing career paths (changed from comp. sci. to philosophy to accounting \[yay ADHD brains, right?\]).

...and, unlike the person in this video, none of mine was at a fancy school, either...just a public state school.

Shit happens, and all.  Fortunately I'm in a position that I can manage that debt, but even looking back: had I had the option of not taking on that debt ever in the first place...I'd be way worse off than that debt amount, so I wouldn't change it.
God, I just went through the ‚Äúenrolling in classes because I have every intention of going and then getting too anxious because I haven‚Äôt been there and not going‚Äù phase of my ADHD. I switched majors 3 times and looking back I‚Äôm so annoyed at myself for some of the choices I made because my brain doesn‚Äôt want to work sometimes. I‚Äôm almost through my bachelor‚Äôs degree (I have about a semester left) but I had to finally call it and withdraw for a while (lost out on that money, greatttttt) until I can get my ADHD sorted with my psychiatrist. It‚Äôs so embarrassing when people ask me how long I‚Äôve been in school, but as you said, shit happens.
Thanks for this comment.
ADHD girlie here. Over $100k spent on 200 credits. Two degrees, three minors. I would‚Äôve enjoyed being an electrician just as much. ü§°
At this point after 150K+ in debt, whats another 2-4K üòÜ
Your company doesn't give you a CPA bonus?
If you spent 200k you better get an offer where they‚Äôll pay for your CPA review course.
nonsensical comment
Hi, are you still in a big 4? If so what‚Äôs your salary
170k for an mba is much different than 150k just for an undergrad.

While mba‚Äôs have generally bad roi, the expensive/ranked ones are usually good in terms of opening doors and havjng decent roi. So its not bad.

150k for undergrad is just ridiculous and a bad investment especially for accounting.
Yup And even in finance, public state schools have decent finance outcomes. Its not lo
Ime its ivy or bust for normal analyst riles. 

Most will have selective clubs that also make high finance achievable from there too. Ut austin has a club with 100% ib rate that is in agreement with morgan stanley.
Prerecs are your college level basics that srent major specific (english, history, math, intro to business etc)
Nope. That's private school tuition.
For only 2 years? Because she has her associates so she should only need 2 years. If she had to take some additional classes why go for the masters at all since you should've been able to hit the 150 without it.
It‚Äôs a private school, they don‚Äôt have out of state tuition
F‚Äô it I want my college experience!
Same. And then the firm I was working for with my community college credits started hiring kids from the expensive masters program lol.
I think she‚Äôs implying she was going to a university, but maybe took some community college classes on the side (summer/winter breaks). I don‚Äôt know of any community colleges that would charge 15,000
Is this the GI bill?
Sounds like a sweet program you got into, but I‚Äôd rather pay $200k than have to eat what your country calls food.
Wish we had that structure in America lol
Maybe grade inflation. ü§™
Well the balloons do need inflating
If she's a CPA why is she only making $60k a year? My wife is a non-CPA accountant making $90k a year with an associates degree from a community college and B.S. from a state school? She's taking the CPA exam because she wants to get to six figures ASAP.  I don't think we miscalculated here because even a mildly-experienced CPA in our area easily makes that kind of money.  Her company is paying for it and also promised to give her a big raise when she completes it.
Those are Mylar style balloons..they‚Äôll cost more than $15 for 4 of them.
It does not mean that Lehigh transferred/accepted all or many of the community college credits. Some institutions may accept only a fraction, only wanting you to have the "full experience"...
Wait a minute that didn‚Äôt click at first. Most associates degrees are 2 years and I think almost free paid by the gov. She would‚Äôve only needed 2-3 years max undergrad. 2 if she does the masters for 150 credits.
Her parents may be rich and she may not be eligible for aid.
Obviously it‚Äôs the NPV of her loans and interest with her estimated repayment schedule (she‚Äôs a CPA of course).
Also, the costs for an associate's degree seems ridiculously high. Last time I took classes (which was a decade ago to be fair) a full load of credits cost ~$1,500 a quarter in tuition.
That‚Äôs average, one of the ways to spend so much on college is if you have somewhat wealthy parents who don‚Äôt help at all

You get no need based scholarships (even though your parents are contributing just as much as the broke persons)

Now you could make better decisions (such as not go to a 60k a year college) if you know you are in this situation
33k *per semester* not [per year](https://www2.lehigh.edu/news/lehigh-announces-tuition-for-upcoming-2023-24-academic-year#:~:text=Undergraduate%20tuition%20will%20be%20%2461%2C180,%2C%20an%20increase%20of%203.75%25). I looked it up too and assumed Google‚Äôs answer was per year, but it‚Äôs not.
But about 75k a year without aid, which would match
Could have took her longer.
She paid $15K for an AA, she might not be the brightest....
For Lehigh? Why? Why is anyone paying that tuition¬†
I‚Äôm really just stuck between 15k for an associates being ridiculous, and then the 150k for two years of a bachelors is even wilder. Makes the 40k masters seem like a bargain.
Nah the CC degree makes sense - she probably double majored as a transfer degree/accounting degree, or like bookkeeping. 

I spent around 10k (paid by employer) like 15 years ago, inflation kind of tracks. For the Bachelor though? That's crazy - I spent like 20k after my transfer. I don't have a masters degree - I've looked into it and that seems about right, I think it was like an extra 30k if I did it.
Im paying 0 at my local state 4 year school üíÄüò≠

But most graduate with their bachelors with like 20k in debt which is nothing. 

15k for a associates is crazy
Facts. I'm getting my degree at a far less prestigious university because they're about half the cost of other options, and offer online degrees so I can do it without quitting my job and leaving my family.
It's almost like you don't know what you want to do for the rest of your life when you're 17
Four years at UBC was about $36,000 USD.  Not including rent in Vancouver. 

How can one justify paying more than that for an education?
Most people don‚Äôt put any thought into it, hence the student loan crisis. I knew people that went to expensive private schools to be elementary school teachers
[deleted]
>Seriously, never understood why people go to such expensive schools for accounting when firms literally don‚Äôt care about what school you go to. At least if you go to an expensive but very recognizable school you‚Äôll have a good network, but not in this case.

Yep. Went to a CC and State school.
Had offers from Big4, State and Fed.
Learning how to build a great resume and interview well makes more of a difference IMO. Best of all, build rapport with a few of accounting your professors and you can use them as a reference.
Lehigh is a very good, recognizable school. Not saying it's worth it, but just countering the idea that it's "not in this case." It's a very well regarded, challenging school with good networking.
Exactly!!! Gotta love when you start a new job and people talk about graduating  from big name colleges to end up same place as me who went to community college to make the same $ üòÇ and are lost and have no idea how to do their jobs.
They definitely definitely care what school you went to. Even 30 years later.
I‚Äôve got $120k for two associates, two bachelor‚Äôs, and one MBA. It‚Äôs still a lot but compared to her, I got a great deal.
Maybe that was her only choice for some reason (grades,  visa, parents)
I did my undergrad at Miami. If I wasn't on scholarship it would have been a terrible ROI. But Miami gives out money like candy.
Its definitely held less seriously than all those schools.

Name recognition goes a long way, and not many people know lehigh, even if its an ok school
Bro I go to UMiami (from Tampa) and I know Lehigh. It‚Äôs a far better school than any FL public university academically that u named besides maybe UFlorida. I personally think it‚Äôs better than UF since the network out of it is tight knit and very prestigious in tri-state area.
Private schools oos tuition is same as instate
I forgot about the out of county/state tuition for community college. Now I‚Äôm curious to where she attended for her associates - assuming it‚Äôs the same county as Lehigh University then it would be between $5490 (out-of-county) and $7365 (out-of-state) for 12-18 registered credit hours a semester. As you mentioned, defeating the purpose of saving money.
I mean for community college, why would you possibly go out of state?
Yeah, I went to LCCC, and it cost me roughly 5k per semester (7 years ago). I'm sure it's even more expensive now.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I paid a similar amount for my degree almost 15 years ago. I went to an expensive private school thinking it would give me a great chance to make good money when leaving. As a 17 year-old kid, I assumed $50k/year, get a job that pays $50k+ when I graduate, I'll pay that off in 4-5 years. Obviously that's not how that works. I regret the debt but I'm in a great place now and who knows where I would be had I gone to a less prestigious school.
[removed]
Can‚Äôt believe people do this when others get paid to attend grad school lol
Graduated 11 years ago. My 25k was cumulative from start to finish, not just masters. 

I worked with people that had 200k in debt from prestigious NY schools. Wonder if that‚Äôs paid off üòÇ
Yeah or she is just reporting sticker cost with no form of aid or grants involved to get tik tok views‚Ä¶

My school was expensive on paper but pretty much everyone except international students got a pretty hefty amount of scholarships, in addition to need based grants/scholarships.

That being said, if they did pay 50k a year tuition for an accounting degree, they are just dumb. Plenty of great state schools for 1/3 of that.

The MACC seems realistic though, the 1 year programs generally are around 30-50k, which is high but not too crazy in my opinion.
Probably partied too much
Lehigh is a private school, which makes it 3x as expensive as it should be, for no reason
The post states the $150K did not include room and board.

I am guessing she did 2.5 years at full cost, perhaps 3 years with some financial aid.
That's crazy. Good research mate
Oh 100% Baruch is amazing and so is the cuny system. I work at a PwC and I learned that PwC hires more students from Baruch than any other university. And Baruch is so cheap
Amen to Baruch! Changed a lot of peoples economic class üíØ
They‚Äôre an engineering school.
I‚Äôm currently majoring in accounting there lol. I got decent aid so while I‚Äôll have a bit of debt it‚Äôs nothing close to 150k lol. It‚Äôs a good school and I‚Äôd say the alumni network is an advantage, but you‚Äôd be crazy to go for anywhere close to full price.
They do great in engineering and the sciences. It's not quite Ivy League, but it's a great school nonetheless
I didn't know it was a school until today.
I agree with you about quality but the hiring managers don't usually care.
I bet she saved money that would have went to a gym membership though lol.
Do they though? What did this person gain that a state school student wouldn‚Äôt?
It better not be my fucking tax money paying for that shit. I think student loans should be forgivable as long as it was a public school and not over 50k.
LOL no way, I paid half (which is still a lot, I know) and went there for pre-med originally before switching. Like a few other people have said, if I knew from the start I'd be going the accounting route I would have gone somewhere cheaper
State school student getting job at Big 4 ü§ù ‚ÄúIvy League‚Äù student getting a job at Big 4 with additional networking connections
I looked at their linkedin recent grads and I saw about 10 that are incoming ib analysts. Then there were plenty of deals/tas associates as well. I see why she went there.
just message a few lonely men and you got it made
I really hate having ADHD sometimes.
Yeah, it's tough. That said, I've been exposed to many different fields, and having tried a bunch of stuff, I have a lot more to pull from with my writing -- which I hold in *way* higher regard than my career.
Nope üòÖ I know a lot of public accounting firms reimburse you and give you a bonus but I didn‚Äôt go that route.
No, I spent 4 years in PA then moved on to industry. I have 13 YOE and I'm now in big tech with a total comp of $220K.
My MBA cost me around $50K at a school nobody heard of. So I still paid $120k in 2011 for just an undergrad, which is equivalent to about $165K today with inflation. 

So yeah, I made the same stupid investment.
A quick Google told me Lehigh out-of-state tuition is about $60k/year. 

Honestly just bad decisions all around, unless someone else was paying for it, then whatever. I‚Äôm a little baffled by the effort to save money at community college and then blow $60k/year at‚Ä¶Lehigh.
Yup, and VA VR&E (formerly known as vocrehab)
Just a standard apprenticeship literally anyone can do it lol... 

But you do have a point, that's why I made sure to be born in South Africa, and learn good food before landing here in the land of greyish green
Have you had Nandos?!? or a good Meat and Gravy Pie? c'mon!!!!!
Out of school cpa start at like 60k which is pretty sad
But they‚Äôll never deflate
They love denying transfer credits at private universities. You‚Äôre better off going to a state school in the same state that you went to CC
If the universities are under the same accreditation body then the credits have to transfer, right?
Then either don‚Äôt go to a university that won‚Äôt take your community college credit (that you explicitly took to save money) or don‚Äôt complain about the tuition that you voluntarily took on after knowing the above.
Associates degrees are definitely not almost free, unless something has changed in the last few years or you're talking about scholarships.

I paid out of pocket for my accounting degree and went back to a community college for the first leg of it.  It was roughly $650 a class/~$2500 a semester.  Much *cheaper* than state schools, sure, but a far cry from a handout.
So 150k for two years at Lehigh‚Ä¶.. fail
You are right in my case associates was free. I paid about 20/year for BS.
17 year old kids make dumb decisions. I went to a private school based purely on vibes and it put me in so much more debt than necessary.
Yes but even 17 year olds should know that 150k of debt is worse than 40-50k of debt. Because 150k is a bigger number than 50k.¬†
Right? It‚Äôs almost like young people are bad at being adults.
To be fair a one bedroom 600sqft appartment in Vancouver now rents for 3k.  So rent for 4 years would now be an extra $144,000 Cad.

Sure you can go cheaper than the average 3k, but even cutting it in half is still $72k.
I agree with you, but the standard cost of university in the States is way, way more than that. It's nuts.
Yep. They‚Äôre kids being told to go directly to college. We‚Äôre all talking about it now, but in the 00s and 10s most people were not. Especially not anyone around 17 year olds. Tbh, it reminds me of the credit card crisis of the 90s. Companies targeted young consumers with high interest rates and fees. Those people ended up in bankruptcy, with an all time high of personal bankruptcy filings in 2005. It‚Äôs almost like young people are bad at being adults. ü§î
It still saved money compared to where she went for the other 2 years.  15k vs 150k.  Both appear to be dumb decisions though.
My theory is that she desperately wanted to go to an out of state school, but federal loans wouldn‚Äôt be enough on their own and at 18 years old she didn‚Äôt have enough credit history to qualify for private loans so community college was the only option for out of state.
She very well could be or she's a trust fund kid 


But there are plenty of people that go into this much debt  that come from regular upper middle class families 

Not like it's not common especially if you live at states with high cost of living like California
There's a lot of money in international tax, mergers, acquisitions, etc. that a university like Lehigh could connect you to.

  
Notre Dame, Penn, Lehigh, Fordham, University of Illinois all have programs in accounting that prep you for the CPA, but offer you investment banking & M&A opportunities as your first job.

How do I know this? I've met graduates from those universities who come from wealthy families and value work.
Thats awesome to hear you've gotten yourself into a good spot. The perspective I've had in my short career is that a prestigious university only matters in a big way for the first job in most instances. Obviously it can help out in specific circumstances where your interviewer is also an alumni of the same university, but thats random chance that can apply to any university.
My accounting firm was like your in grad school, here let us pay that for you. They were so nice‚Ä¶at first.
Or she‚Äôs just lying. Wait people can‚Äôt do that online, never mind
I‚Äôm literally wearing a Lehigh engineering shirt rn üíÄ. It‚Äôs not even mine it‚Äôs my sister‚Äôs from when she was applying for colleges. But she didn‚Äôt go there
The median Lehigh graduate has a better chance of landing a job at the Big 4 than the median Penn State (or other state school) graduate, who, in turn, has a better chance of landing a job at the Big 4 as a West Chester graduate.
Hopefully they married up/found a rich husband/wife and will get it through inheritance/job connections/lack of student loans/home down payment gift/free vacations/etc. the job connections/on campus recruiting also helps out a bunch. 

Dad‚Äôs daughters who I dated had net worths of ~$2-600M at my private school, that‚Äôs not normal.
I too was pre-med prior to switching to accounting (not at Lehigh, I went to UMaine). I couldn't handle the disgusting dissections even though I really liked science and biology. Accounting was a much better fit.
I would say she comes from money but then she went community which people who come from money usually avoid. 
If they were wealthy but are frugal that also doesnt make sense bc of the fact they spend so much on Lehigh university after that.
Private schools dont have oos tuition, but thats beside the point, your bad decisions point still syands
How is it possible to be an 'out of school' CPA? Don't you need one to two years of experience working under a CPA, alongside education requirements and passing the tests? That's how it is in my state. I guess if you worked throughout college at an accounting firm it would be possible, but I don't know of any that hire before you have a degree or equivalent experience.
That is very sad.  I made more than that out of college with a Business Admin degree.
I signed up for a shitty account just to respond.¬†

¬†Look into your schools before you apply.¬†I went to the community college in my hometown, when I applied most in state schools (even those who partnered with my CC) had lists of what they‚Äôd accept. I chose to matriculate to a private out of state university and they took more credits, offered more scholarship funding and better financial aid terms than I could get at ANY of the public schools I applied to in MI.¬†

Assume nothing, read the websites, send emails, ask clarifying questions. I had to run through some paperwork outlining courses I took at CC when I transferred and opted to take 2 exams to get credit for other courses. ¬†

But if you‚Äôre paying $150k for your undergrad (less gen eds), and your last name isn‚Äôt on a campus building, you‚Äôre doing it wrong.
Not really, my state school denied a lot of credits from my associates. Would not recommend getting an associates if you plan on getting a bachelors, at all.
Nope. Accreditation mostly means that the *end result of the course of study* is considered equivalent, but does not say anything about the specific credit equivalency therein.

What governs that are "articulation agreements" between specific colleges or universities. Those specify a 1:1 mapping between credits across the different catalogues, guaranteeing transfer credit for students moving across.

Without an articulation agreement, credit for prior study is entirely at the inbound university's discretion, and that varies widely. Private universities like Lehigh are disincentivized to accept *any* incoming credits, since that is less revenue for the school.

I went to a private university myself, and they were more stringent about AP credits and took almost no transfer credits save for one specific Community College they had an articulation agreement with, and even then they only took the most basic GenEds.

On the other hand, my local community college has a very strong articulation program with my state's flagship public university, so it's basically 1:1 for saved years outside of strongly managed programs like Engineering, and even then they have a program for that which shaves off some time.
My university had something called course articulation which specified which classes from other schools provided equivalent credit for specific classes at the university. So I guess she didn‚Äôt bother looking any of that up when she went to community college if she still spent $150k at a university. Also, I‚Äôm suspicious that an associates degree at a community college would cost $15k. Just looking at my local community college it‚Äôs less than $2500 for two years at full time. More like $25000 for out of state tuition, but who is traveling out of state to go to community college??
You are responding to the wrong person. I was explaining what happened to u/asmodean97.
Damn when I went to community college they charged $20 / course credit.  So a full load cost $300.

Still had to buy the books though.
In my state, the first two years of CC are free if you graduated from a high school in my state.  Also, with a lot if the textbooks are digital.  Lots cheaper.  My accounting books were in the $150 range.  Digital textbooks are in the $50-80 range.
Fafsa covered my wife‚Äôs associates and 2 year RN program. I was a brand new apprentice making dog water at the time though. Maybe that helped.
Some cities have paired up with the local CCs to give graduates of certain high schools in the city to get free tuition. There‚Äôs one here in MI I think it‚Äôs Muskegon. Big Gretch is also talking about getting all high school graduates free CC tuition but we all know that‚Äôs a really long way to go.
Typically as an independent or even most middle class families as a dependent, pell grant + state grant will cover at least 80-90% of CC costs. It‚Äôs more typical to actually get aid in excess of tuition
Me too. And besides vibes my choice was based on ‚Äúmoving as far away from home as physically possible‚Äù lol
Yeah I‚Äôm forever grateful 17 year old me was only interested in drinking and hitting on girls (poorly). State school was the obvious choice. Only cost 50k for undergrad/masters and happened to be a target school, who knew? 

At the end of the day as long as you enjoy college I don‚Äôt knock anyone‚Äôs choice. I miss it.
Most have no frame of reference for debt that large. They all seem like big numbers that you‚Äôll pay off in the future. 150k is way more, but a lot of kids don‚Äôt realize how different 50k of student loans is from 80k.
Most likely has family money paying for college.  Doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre trust fund kid.  Some kids their parents make enough to pay for their kid to go to the best school.
I think my market makes it a little better than random. I'd say over half of accounting professionals in my area went to one of three schools.

Edit: I would also never suggest someone go down the path I did. It was an objectively poor decision made by a literal child.
Most won't hire you until you're CPA eligible
You can pass the test before you finish all your internship and usually after you pass the test theres barely 6 months of experience left to get the title, but you still already passed the test.

Some people dont take internships during busy season and just do the entire thing (bachelor/cpa exam) b4 starting to actually work as an accountant.
Yeah well the main issue with cpa is that out of college you are pretty much an expense for the company training you bc the job vs what you learn in school are world apart
I‚Äôm sorry you signed up for Reddit to say this. It sucks here
May I ask how old you are? 

Was this college online or in person (in other words, did you have to move to go to this college?

I am 38 and want to pursue a degree in accounting. I have an associates in health sciences, therefore many of my classes do not transfer. 

The scholarship options do not seem to be much of a thing for grown adults wanting to go back to school.
Funny. My private university accepted 64 credits from my CC. It was the main point in choosing that university.
Lots of CC's have partnered with their local 4 years to guarantee admittance and credit acceptance.  Those programs are worth looking into.
I had a different experience in CA going from juco to UC
> On the other hand, my local community college has a very strong articulation program with my state's flagship public university

This is becoming more and more common. Gen ed requirements are effectively the same everywhere. Just do them at a community college that has this type of program that ensure the credits transfer.
20 bucks a credit?! Fuck you! Lmao jk
Ironically, I did save money by pirating the shit out of every textbook.

By the time I was in my last semester every book had those stupid codes you needed to do the assignments so they definitely caught on and closed that loophole, but I used to keep tally of how much money I saved by getting the pirated versions and by the time I had to start buying books again the number was well above $5k.  Zero regrets, fuck those vultures.
Really? That‚Äôs crazy. This was 10,000 years ago.
I did the undergrad and master‚Äôs programs at WGU.  It‚Äôs 100% online and I believe all state CPA boards accept their accreditation and credits. VA did.  Check yours if that‚Äôs your goal to confirm.

It is possible to accelerate the hell out of the program. If you think you‚Äôll need more support in learning new topics or you prefer in person lectures, though, it may not be a good fit. It isn‚Äôt for everyone. It‚Äôs just very affordable.

I know a lot of people feel some kind of way about online school and accelerating through WGU especially.  But I have $8k in student loans, my employer paid for my master‚Äôs ($5k), and I‚Äôm currently studying for the CPA exams.

I think $13k is pretty reasonable.  And I know of a lot of people who did it faster than I did and spent less money.
Fuck literally any accrediated university is all you need. The CPA is what differentiates you
Yep, I was told that too when I started at my CC. I'm just saying it's not a guarantee.
Lmao - I just checked and that same school is now $46 per course credit.  Not terrible considering inflation.  I was there from 2005-2006.
When I was in college we had to purchase a code to do homework online for most of our accounting classes. Codes were usable for a single semester and were $150-200 if I recall correctly. This was just so our professors didn‚Äôt have to make their own assignments I guess?
Before I left public in 2010, the regional firm I was with tended to hire when you had your 150 credit hours and gave a sign on bonus then your start date was three months later.  It was expected that in that three months you pass the CPA since you were not working.  I was so jealous because that was not what they did when I was hired so the people hired at the same time I was had to work and study at the same time.
Same! Less than $8k here after pell grant for bachelors and masters and it came with Wiley cpa prep.
I went back to school in 2019, my credits ranged from 130-230 dollars.

46 is still insanely cheap
May I ask what school that is?
> This was just so our professors didn‚Äôt have to make their own assignments I guess?

It was literally just to prevent students from hopping on libgen or elsewhere and downloading the book for free.
Same. My community college classes in 2019 were about $130 an hour, then when I had my associates and went to a state university, they went up to $270. I don't have my masters, and I already had some college credits from my first attempt 15 years ago, but in total I spent about $20k between my associates and bachelor's.
Backtest results for Larry Connors ‚ÄúDouble 7‚Äù Strategy
I tested the ‚ÄúDouble 7‚Äù strategy popularised by Larry Connors in the book ‚ÄúShort Term Trading Strategies That Work‚Äù. It‚Äôs a pretty simple strategy with very few rules.



**Setup steps are:**

Entry conditions:

* Price closes above 200 day moving average
* Price closes at a 7 day low

If the conditions are met, the strategy enters on the close. However for my backtest, I am entering at the open of the next day.

* Exit if the price closes at a 7 day high



**Backtest**

To test this out I ran a backtest in python over 34 years of S&P500 data, from 1990 to 2024. The equity curve is quite smooth and steadily increases over the duration of the backtest.

https://preview.redd.it/xe3yo23uijud1.png?width=2079&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d9a9f928470ab89f0edf477f2ab677116ce4006

**Negatives**

To check for robustness, I tested a range of different look back periods from 2 to 10 and found that the annual return is relatively consistent but the drawdown varies a lot.

I believe this was because it doesn‚Äôt have a stop loss and when I tested it with 8 day periods instead of 7 days for entry and exit, it had a similar return but the drawdown was 2.5x as big. So it can get stuck in a losing trade for too long.

**Variations**

To overcome this, I tested a few different exit strategies to see how they affect the results:

* Add stop loss to exit trade if close is below 200 MA - This performed poorly compared to the original strategy
* Exit at the end of the same day - This also performed poorly
* Close above 5 day MA - This performed well and what‚Äôs more, it was consistent across different lookback periods, unlike the original strategy rules.
* Trailing stop - This was also good and performed similarly to the 5 MA close above.

Based on the above. I selected the ‚Äúclose above 5 day MA‚Äù as my exit strategy and this is the equity chart:

https://preview.redd.it/zftwwf0ijjud1.png?width=2079&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd8a6bd0090fdddf5e42937336bca3b293fe7318

**Results**

I used the modified strategy with the 5 MA close for the exit, while keeping the entry rules standard and this is the result compared to buy and hold. The annualised return wasn‚Äôt as good as buy and hold, but the time in the market was only \~18% so it‚Äôs understandable that it can‚Äôt generate as much. The drawdown was also pretty good.

It also has a decent winrate (74%) and relatively good R:R of 0.66.

https://preview.redd.it/db36u7iwijud1.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=1680e9dc6205c7fd725da246baa3034f5b3245ac

**Conclusion:**

It‚Äôs an interesting strategy, which should be quite easy to trade/automate and even though the book was published many years ago, it seems to continue producing good results. It doesn‚Äôt take a lot of trades though and as a result the annualised return isn‚Äôt great and doesn‚Äôt even beat buy and hold. But used in a basket of strategies, it may have potential. I didn‚Äôt test on lower time frames, but that could be another way of generating more trading opportunities.

**Caveats:**

There are some things I didn‚Äôt consider with my backtest:

1. The test was done on the S&P 500 index, which can‚Äôt be traded directly. There are many ways to trade it (ETF, Futures, CFD, etc.) each with their own pros/cons, therefore I did the test on the underlying index.
2. Trading fees - these will vary depending on how the trader chooses to trade the S&P500 index (as mentioned in point 1). So i didn‚Äôt model these and it‚Äôs up to each trader to account for their own expected fees.
3. Tax implications - These vary from country to country. Not considered in the backtest.

**Code**

The code for this backtest can be found on my github: [https://github.com/russs123/double7](https://github.com/russs123/double7)

**Video:**

I go into a lot more detail and explain the strategy, code and backtest in the video here: [https://youtu.be/g\_hnIIWOtZo](https://youtu.be/g_hnIIWOtZo)



What are your thoughts on this one?

Has anyone traded or tested this strategy before?
Very nice! Clean and easy to understand analysis. Likee you mentioned, this does seem like one of those strategies that can't be relied on itself to produce great returns, but can augment a whole trading system with a basket of strategies. There are many such strategies it seems, and this is another one, so nice!

But in your notebook, the results seem to be that the regular strat is better than the 5MA exit strategy, right? It has higher return, higher sharpe, lower max drawdown, higher winrate, and higher avg return?
One of the better posts I‚Äôve seen on here. I had that book for years and finally donated it to my local library. Hopefully an aspiring trader will buy it for cheap and make good use of it.
From what I see..... It looks to identify bull markets fairly decent. It exits during the early 2000's bubble burst and the 2008 housing crisis. If it shorted during those times it would of done ok. But the sideways market areas didnt allow it to do that well during those times.
Going to try this on crypto backtests see how it does üòÖ thanks for the write up!
1.Did you account for slippage?  You can't assume that you will always get the exact price of the open (you won't), so for every trade, you should artificially add $x.xx to your entry price (i.e. reduce the profit/increase the loss of every trade by a margin for slippage).


2.Did you choose your exit strategy based on in-sample or out-of-sample data?   If you're just picking the one that performed best across the entire data set, you're just curve fitting.
Nice
Good deal!!!
Very nice work
Where do you backtest these strategies?
[deleted]
This strategy also looks to work pretty nice on the nifty50 too, nice one!
Guys where do I learn simple strategies like these that work. Do they exist? 
I am good at programming but don't really know how to make up a strategy that can give good backtest results.
Would love to see more content like this
Try with trailing stop loss to break even only.

Use optimised parameters, so basically, the emas you use, set them in a loop, and run all possible options. Maybe you will find a better ema duration. Also, you may try different timeframes. Maybe you get more trade opportunities. 

S&p500 goes up most of the time, I think if you do every day, it goes down by x% then DCA. You will make more money in an account without margin. You don't have to worry much about drawdown.
I don't understand why you are comparing metrics over 34 years. Is that your target time horizon for implementing this strategy? 

Is there something interesting here that I'm missing...any decent index fund probably smokes this over any holding period of a couple random years. Seems like a better starting point to shake this one out is a lower time frame.
Following
i wish you could have compared it to buy and hold during that same timeframe for the ^GSPC numbers.
Very interesting, thank you! I'll check this book from Larry Connors and backtest this strategy myself.

Just one note. I think that by buying at the open of the next day you are doing a great disservice to your backtesting results, as most of SPY's (and I guess the index you picked) gains come not from the trading hours, but from outside the regular hours. That is, if you were to buy at 4pm, instead of 930am next morning, you could largely improve your results.

https://www.isabelnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SP-500-Gains-Outside-Regular-Trading-Hours.jpg

In any case, I took a quick look at AAPL graph in the last weeks and it looks interesting. I will write some code to test it further.
How are you sizing your trades?

Good post with link to code
Double 7 strategy seems chill, but adding a stop loss could spice things up. Maybe Pineify could help tweak those exit strategies to boost the winrate even more with some custom scripts. 5 MA close exit looks solid, but curious how it‚Äôd do on lower timeframes. Anyone tried that yet?
Isn't that just a quantified way of saying "buy the dip"
QuantMage adaption where I used close at a 10 day low / close above 8 day MA instead of 7 / 5:

[https://quantmage.app/grimoire/3169ea78111f4c595ccfcc7751d9c639](https://quantmage.app/grimoire/3169ea78111f4c595ccfcc7751d9c639)
Why do you think the returns were not evenly distributed? For example, 2000-2004 seem relatively flat.   The slope of the later lines seems steeper in a ‚Äúbuy anything‚Äù bull market.
I'm back again and I'm trying to reproduce your results. I don't get the exact same results, probably due to me looking at SPY and calculating fills to include slippage, but it does show profitability, especially with your adjustment of closing when the close price is > 5 MA. But what I found is that the metrics look better or neutral when removing the > 200 MA requirement. Can you please test for the same and post your results? The amount of trades seem to double, with the max drawdown decreasing and winrate staying neutral. In the end, it seems total profit is doubled with seemingly not much of a downside.
I've never heard of this one but there really are a lot of this type of strategy, which is obviously going to do well in a regime where companies that have done well in the past 200 days do well in the future, which has been true in the US for a very long time but is not guaranteed.

Instead of stop-losses, why not use call options?

Instead of using the stock's return, you might try the return compared to the market average (and/or beta-adjusted, if you can get hold of betas at the time of the trade)
An issue I have with this strategy, is that the return is low and the drawdown is proportionally high. While it's in the market for only 20% of the time, this may not be suitable for good returns. Imagine you found 5 of these strategies and were able to get 100% in-the-market. The compounding effects of 5x max -10% drawdowns may out-weigh the benefits of 5x 4% returns.
[deleted]
Thank you! Yes the default strategy performed better than my modified 5MA one, but I noticed that in the original strategy when I changed the number of days in the entry and exit rules from 7 to 8, the drawdown increased a lot. So I felt that the default exit method was optimised and wasn‚Äôt robust since a small tweak to the rules resulted in big changes to the results.
When I tested the variants I saw the 5MA seemed to be quite consistent across different look back periods. For example if the strategy was changed to double 8, the 5MA performs better.
What did you think of the strategies in the book? Apart from this one I also tested his RSI 2 method which also produced decent results but trade frequency was low again.
Yea that‚Äôs the 200MA filter, it keeps the strategy out of the market when the price is below the MA which worked well during those big bearish periods. 
I didn‚Äôt actually test short entries but could be a useful check
Good luck! Hope it holds up. I tested on ftse as well and it worked there too but didn‚Äôt do well on Nikkei, which makes sense since that moves sideways. Would be interesting if it works on crypto. Where do you get data for that? I‚Äôve only tested indices from yahoo finance
Did you had nice results? :)
Thanks!
I use python as it allows me to write my own code. So I download the data from yahoo finance and then generate the trades and work out the returns and other metrics from that all within the code.
Yea it‚Äôs tricky with some of these backtests, they can be sideways for long periods. I think if I was to trade this, it would need to be part of a bigger basket of strategies so that the overall p&l is kinda averaged across multiple systems. But I‚Äôve not got that far in my testing so it‚Äôs just a thought at the moment.
Good to know! Gives more confidence if it works on other indices too. I tested on FTSE and it was good.
look up youtube videos there are tons of strategies some will work and some dont you just have to see which ones peak your interest and try them out. Use chatgpt to make things way way easier and not code manually. 

  
I did some pine script strategies this way it was super easy.
Sure you can just data-mine the best parameter combinations to overfit it, but it would be better to view a heatmap of performance to make sure you're not just hitting a local minima/maxima and getting lucky with one.
There‚Äôs no sizing, it‚Äôs 100% of capital on each trade, unleveraged
I dont get any errors. Try to run notebook in google collab
The calmar ratio (annual return / max drawdown) is significantly better for this strategy than buy and hold. Also I dont think OP accounted for holding short term bonds in the downtime, which will only make that more attractive.
I did wonder that as well and whether the drawdown would scale linearly like that or not. As in, if the system generates more trades but the win/loss and r:r stay steady then the drawdown might not get that much bigger. I don‚Äôt know for sure, but thinking that might be the case. One way I thought of testing that out is that once I have built up a basket of strategies then I can combine them into one backtest and see how they perform together. I would end up with more time in the market so would be interesting to see what happens to the other metrics. But I‚Äôm not there yet, still want to get a few more good backtest results.
Maybe I misunderstand but the max DD is -56.78 which as percentage of the starting balance is only 0.57%, this doesn‚Äôt seem excessively large to me over such a timescale and the fact the balance actually increases quite a lot so could be much less than this.
That link calculates returns with reinvested dividends, that's why it gives a higher value. My backtest is based on the index price so it doesn't include dividends, but if you were to choose a fund that re-invests dividends then yes, the buy and hold returns would be higher.
Are you looking at dividend reinvestment or just price increases though? I'm not sure if OP's backtest is on non-dividend-adjusted SPY
As you said the frequency of the strategies are low. I trade at least 10 strategies systematically. All using options and diff DTE and spreads. So as a whole the strategies offer a good amount of trades over the span of a month. 
But I did enjoy the book as it was the genesis of my path towards back testing and systematic trading. Linda Rashke is another author that provided strong influence early on. The price point for the books were quite an investment for me back then. üòÑ
Interested in the results if you tested it short. I‚Äôm going to overlay this logic over my current system out of curiosity to see what happens
I‚Äôm pretty sure the last time I checked yfinance had at least eth and btc. 

Although last time I checked coinbase, coinmarketcap and coingecko APIs also included a full history, but looks like the free tiers are limited to last 12 months now

Edit: also thanks for sharing your results/research!
let us know what you find.
[deleted]
He's just trying to keep things standardized and simple. I think it's fine as long as you know it doesn't include dividends. If you're worried about the dividends, you can try back-testing with QQQ instead as the dividends are considerably lower.
UPDATE: 20k to 1.2 million in one day. thanks jpow and solar
for fslr yesturday for fomc gambol (see previous post) jpow delivers
Okay. Am i the only one who picked up on this?

Why are they Dec 23rd‚Ä¶ not Dec 22nd‚Ä¶

Ban hammer for paper trading/photoshop is about to drop.

E: its year, leaving this comment up cause im a fucking moron. His proof is below (it checks out with time and sales on fidelity)

Not my finest moment
You show me a screenshot that you went from 20k to 1.2 million in one day, I quit my job right now and work for you.
You must have shit your pants when you opened that up and saw it lol.
I think they gotta kick you outta this sub now regards only
Congratulations and fuck you
OP makes multiple $15-20k bets per day. This screenshot doesn't capture the daily massive losses he's taking while trying to hit the jackpot.

It's just gambling on a degenerate scale. This isn't some genius prediction. OP is just burning money rolling the dice and hoping to come out on top. He's so far in the hole that even this jackpot, which would be life-changing to a normal person, leaves him significantly in the red.

OP, I'm happy for ya, this is a cool screenshot, I hope you cashed out. But it's VERY important for people to realize what's going on here so they don't get FOMO and think they can throw their life savings on a single play and get similar results.

People: unless you can support big gambles like this multiple times per day, you can't afford to do this. If you just do it once, you'll just lose your money.
Prove to the people its not a paper trade
Unfuckingreal
Seeing posts like this always get me daydreaming about fucking with options in my Roth IRA. Win big once, put it all into VOO or some shit, and just kick back knowing I have a couple milly in my pocket for later. But‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen too many worst case scenarios to dive in.
Regard meant to buy fsr but mistyped, congrats and fuck your wife
I'm confused, were we not supposed to loose money in here?
Hey IRS this is your guy

Hey SEC, this one right here.
You had me at the AVGO trade yesterday. Obviously you are a phony. All your trade amounts end in zeros, you cannot spell, obviously this is fake bullshit.

Wow, I've seen these types of trades coming. I don't have the cahoneys to put the money on them. I wish I did. I've seen it happen too many times congratulations to you my friend, please don't blow the money
1) sell right now, dont be stupid
2) tell no one except a wife/husband and make sure they tell no one. Fuck it dont even tell them

Is it possible to learn this power?
If it were me, I'd say earmark another 20k to play with and the rest does not go back into the meat grinder.
How do yall know he's down 30%? I don't see YTD anywhere.

I have 20K to burn, how do I do this?
Step 1: Have $20k to blow

Still working on that
were you able to close it out?
Wait I'm confused.. how does he make 6000% on 20k when it only went up 10%. Don't you pay premiums on calls and that small increase in stock price just made mind boggling returns. Can anyone explain? Seriously?
I make this in 1 trade I am done for life. Watch him blow it all in a couple weeks
I was excited I made 11 grand in a week until now.

Man made all the money I'll probably never make in my whole life.
Getting a 20k - 1.2mil trade and still been down 30% in a year might make you the lowest IQ person on the planet. Scientists need to study you as clearly your head is filled with nothing but e.coli bacteria smashing into each other.

Who‚Äôs buying MSFT dip? I need some words of encouragement
Can someone explain what I'm seeing? FSLR went from 138 yesterday to 162 today. How does this make the value go from 20k to 1.2 million? I'm a noob.

Wolf Of Wall Street üòÜüòÜ
Loved that scene in the wolf of wallstreet. Who know Jonah Hill is a fugging great actor.
I‚Äôd shit my pants if I made that on a trade and was still down 30%‚Ä¶. Seems like he‚Äôs more autistic than it looks.
I‚Äôd immediately sell and buy a house no mortgage lol
Bros gonna chase this high for the rest of his life
He's still down all time, dw

And Merry Christmas, you filthy animal! And a Happy New Year too!!! üòâ
Just for that, I'm taking out a 8% interest rate loan on my house and putting that plus my life savings into calls.
I needed this comment like I need my morning caffeine. Was seriously having mid life crisis and wondering if I was doing it all wrong lol
don't help them. if r/all wants to be morons let them. it fuels my Christmas spirit.

‚ÄúIt's just gambling on a degenerate scale. This isn't some genius prediction‚Äù

What the hell do you think this sub is about? 

This aint r/investing or r/swingtrading, its motherfucking wallstreetBETS.
Sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs,  near the casino.
Wtf do some ppl do to just burn $15k-$20k daily on crap shoot gambles?
This comment is interesting, I don‚Äôt know the truth, his account only shows winners. However, I think The_AverageCanadian might be right. 

It was a long gap between posts, I‚Äôm not sure that is a long gap between wins. Just don‚Äôt risk what you can‚Äôt because of this dudes post, I hope this guy and all of you are up. Chasing with negative money doesn‚Äôt ever work.
That comment should be on top of all the others!
Op take a 10k gamble and buy me and you snowmobiles to have fun
I remember hearing a story in the 80s (or 90s?) where a guy liquidated ALL his assets. His home, car, life savings, everything he had, and bought lottery tickets for some mega big prize. 

He was sure that the reason why people didn't win, was because they just didn't invest enough, and he figured, throw everything in, and it was a sure fire bet. (he may have had some sort of "plan" not sure). 

At any rate, he lost everything in that gamble. Bankrupt from trying to win the lottery. 

I also read somewhere that someone came up with a number pattern to play the lottery, but in order for it to be successful, you had to spend a few hundred for each draw, and statistically you'd come out on top. The guy that developed it did it, but he had to play for over a year, and nearly blew all his money in doing so, but eventually won a jackpot.

Of course if that story is true (and I honestly have nothing to back it up), 1 win doesn't prove a system, and not many people are in a position to test that theory.
I took a stats course in high school and got kicked out for drawing dicks on my friend's homework (true story), I'm thinking I'd be pretty good at this day trading thing. Agree?
It's fine really if they fall for it. We need that exit liquidity
and with people like this we always have it.
Hater
Regarded scale*
What a judicious and firm mod. I expect nothing less from someone who grew up trading the Grand Exchange. SEND HIM TO BACK TO LUMBY
[deleted]
[deleted]
He posted no proof of a trade, so it very well might be un real lol
The only time you should ever F around like this is from 18-22 (you get one big gamble in your life before the age of 30 - beyond that, it's hard to dig out of and makes your life miserable) or when you are obscenely loaded (>$4-5M NW and making silly gamble once a year).
Lots of fake posts
Bro options have ruined my trading, I now just pick a few stocks and keep majority in indexes. This year was great overall for the market and I fucked it up somehow.
Options works on the way up and on the way down. If can get a lucky bet... But it is impossible to always win. 
The problem is when you are over confident for your wins and you keep putting everything in..
The thing is, you don't see the vast majority of worst case scenarios. Because those guys don't post nearly as often as the lucky ones.
Don't do that with your Roth IRA or any retirement account. You need to max those out in safe investments. Use a brokerage account to gamble if you feel inclined to do so, but only after maxing your actual retirement accounts. People on this sub are degenerate gamblers. This guy will probably lose this 1.2 million within 6 months.
Only thing loose here is our wives.
Dudes still down 30% YTD LOL
If you can't spell "lose" you should not be aloud to handle money.
Lose

I think we have a lost redditor posting here

Def not, I use power etrade. Just checked and the top banner is highlighted yellow. Super bright to indicate paper trading. This is accurate.
Wait this is same dude as AVGO??? No way I believe it then. You don‚Äôt hit the lottery twice in a week.
What‚Äôs his YoY?
who said i closed them?
i‚Äôm down to 500 after trimming throughout the day.  a nice volume spike tmw i‚Äôll close out the rest
Hell na
Lmfao
and that's just yoy. 

where's the all time OP??
Is this sub full of people that won the lottery/inherited a lot of money and now want to farm karma with stupid investments? I keep getting posts recommended lol
And now that its falling, he's down even more if he hasnt sold lol
4 real?
Good. Nobody else can win if I'm losing
Lmao no need to envy OP when I'm still green yoy in pennies ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
  ü§£üíÄüò≠thanks was depressed. still depressed but laughing rn
I am screaming at this comment it should be pinned to the sub with this whole post
That was a very good movie. That scene made me laugh my ass off.
Well all these guys were trying to fuck my cousin so I was like nah I‚Äôm not gunna let that happen.
No no no it‚Äôs not what you think.
*On new issue day? On cock sucking, motherfucking new issue day?*
GUH
Could it be possible they bought an option call for $160 3 months ago when FSLR was at $130?
Unfortunately no brokerage anymore in the US will allow that to happen. The days of really stupid losses are over. There was a guy who opened box spreads which is probably the closest you could come to losing as much as you‚Äôre describing. Kamikazecash has a good video on it.
60x in one day. I‚Äôd be head over heels with 50% in one day
I peet my shants
The guy who said he's -30% said he made it up as a joke
I was like ‚Äúoh wow this guy won really huge he‚Äôs doing great in life.‚Äù Really puts shit in perspective.
lol yep I‚Äôd do the same.  Pour it into real estate.  Assuming you don‚Äôt own a house already.
You'd eat cap gains, so justify doing another spin :)
How tf do you make $1.2M on a trade and still be down? What!!
One of us
Yall really took that guys joke as an absolute fact with no proof and ran with it.
That was a joke. OP isnt down yoy

Shown he is down 30% for the year.

Throwing spaghetti at the wall and one stuck for a loss still.
I am 23. Broke af. Time to gamble?
Had my one, put 4k into a penny stock right before I was put under for wisdom teeth removal and that went to 40k. gambled 15k of the profit away on another too good to be true stock and stopped doing that, then 7k for taxes‚Ä¶ still a big win after that and treated myself to a well earned vacation and paying off some expenses

Nothing crazy but yup happened right after college, 2021 was insane
Can confirm
I'm pissed my big gamble was only making about $50k on game stonk calls. In this economy, that ain't shit!
Some of the most sage advice I‚Äôve seen here, and I‚Äôve been here too long. If people knew that saving 30k by 25 would make them a 2 million dollar tax free pay day, they would yolo at 18 with the solid money you get from part-time jobs now-a-days. I fucking used to be happy about $7 an hour, I saved up 5k. If someone had explained how if I‚Äôd invested it all, instead of spending it on a semester of law school I‚Äôd be in better shape, I‚Äôd almost never have believed it. Although I did save 6.5% a year in accruing interest, so not a total wash in terms of spending.
Nah bro. If you don‚Äôt have the money by late 30 you need to gamble or you‚Äôll never have enough money. You should not do this in early 20s because no matter a small amount of money will grow into a large amount of money. But if you‚Äôre damn near 40 you can‚Äôt make a small amount of money a large amount without yoloing.
especially because most people get scared after a 30% loss on their life savings, sell, and then dont bother posting a small 30% loss.

for every big win theres probably 1000 small losses that arent worth posting, but make up way more money lost than the win makes.
I‚Äôm doing my part!
Can confirm, this guy‚Äôs wife is very loose. 
Mom‚Äôs tight though.
You forgot our assholes
but it just goes to show you, you can make it all back if you just keep gambling
Source? I don‚Äôt see that posted anywhere other than another guys comment
Wtf he made 1.2m and still down ytd? Where's the screenshot?
I can't tell if your incorrect use of aloud/allowed is intentional or not.  But either way it's funny as fuck.
Well if he sells the IRS gonna get some fat change. Or we can watch him lose it diamond handsing like an idiot and all collectively cry and laugh
nah he bet that FSLR would go to $150 by this friday. Each option contract was worth 20 cents x 100 = $20, he bought 20k worth, so he had 1000 contracts (20k/$20), due to the Fed meeting FSLR went over $150 today and 
each contract increase in value to $1225 as seen in the screenshot 

so 1 contract ($20) increase to $1225, 

1000 contracts x 1225 = $1,225,000

$1,225,000 - $20000 (the amount he bought) = ~$1,205,000 (Profit)
The trade the with him!!
Ever heard of photoshop? It‚Äôs easy to color swap.

How did you learn to trade? You seem pretty consistent.
scores a 60 bagger and 7 figures in gains

still down YTD

that's some peak WSB shit
He keeps that info locked in the dungeon!
u tell us. 

well after thinking about it, yea. yea it is.

nobody in there right minds would put 20k into a random shit option expiring this close for no reason. and even winning that much, he still down soo much.

which means he doesnt give a fk about his monies coz daddys trustfund account will transfer it to him every month.
Sir, this is a Casino
This is a sub to provide validation to degenerate gamblers who cosplay as Warren Buffett.
You forgot the secret third option, they pulled a student loan and fucked the money off on the market instead of the classes.
Most of us work at Wendy‚Äôs and this is what we do on break.  I used to have a real job as a software engineer, but spent all my time trading instead of doing real work.  Now I gamble on stonks with what‚Äôs left of my 401K.  I‚Äôm going to make it all back‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt tell my wife.
It's 4fun. After learning basic financial services and systems instead of making the common sense long term play of investing people come here to make fun of regards and be regards who do high risk - high reward (or low reward - because again they are regarded) financial moves. 

It is basically just degenerate gambling with some financial thesis (or none - refer to the regards for proof) to play the market.

There's nothing here that matters except degenerate gambling. No politics, morals or whatever brain damage that you may have heard about during GameStop era it's just gambling and memes.
lmao this cat is still down YoY, most wsb shit ever
Good enough for a screenshot? Good enough to take some profit.

Learned that the hard way.

Hope OP took some profits.
No its just a joke lol
He will lose everything again btw
I especially liked the protagonist. I try to be just like him whenever possible

Everyone is jealous and doesn‚Äôt wanna believe. üòù
1000 upvotes for the delicious lie, 29 for the boring truth lol.  Welcome to the information age.
that was some random dude joking hes not down
Did you happen to forget what sub we're on
Be a dumb gambling Addict
You make a shit ton of those types of trades and post only the hits! Accuracy by volume.
Nah G I‚Äôll send you the 1k from my 10k bruv. They say: **sharing is caring** ;) hahahaha
Split the $1k and send me $500 and I‚Äôll gamble it on 0dte options‚Ä¶ $shnoobydoo
#NOBALLS
tomorrow? he better prepare a comfy cardboard if he does that
My new pinned comment has negative swag, it balances out

Im a moron
What kind of low liquidity comment is this
I probably should unsub from this place before I start thinking this is a good idea
When you say it's shown that he's -30% on the year, do you mean the random redditor's comment who said he was joking?
Yes. But also... No. But kind of yes? Not financial advice
Make sure you are aware of the consequences of your actions and ok to deal with them. 
It sounds you do not have much to loose, you can gamble for a little bit but you if you are lucky, do not keep doing it. 
Get a plan that works.
Depends, college educated/degree? 

Are you OK with declaring bankruptcy and having no credit for 6 years? lol

Are you entrepreneurial and have business idea to take out loans?
The problem is it's never like OP's gamble lolol. And it's a pretty good indication that's it's super rare, OP is still down 30% YTD, so even with this money win he had dumped $1.5m in January all the way down to $20k. 

Absolute ape shit lolol.
Every dollar you invest in something reliable, like the S&P is going to be worth $50-100 by the time you retire. Whereas people my age only get maybe $25-35 for each dollar invested, and it only gets worse deeper into your 30s and 40s, so I'd highly advise to NOT do that with anymore than 5-10% of your total investments. Even this guy who won insanely big would've still been better off investing wisely from the start.
>If you don‚Äôt have the money by late 30 you need to gamble or you‚Äôll never have enough money

Famous last words of every addict ever.

>You should not do this in early 20s because no matter a small amount of money will grow into a large amount of money.

2-3 years isn't going to kill you. If you don't want to make the 1-time gamble to start a business or invest in something you really believe in, then of course you can dump it all in SPY ETF of your choice and try going to retire early route.
I salute you ü´°
People are saying he‚Äôs down but I haven‚Äôt seen any screenshots of that
Does it help if you know I'm completely regarded?
He is down overall for the year.
some people are way too lucky to predict it, or inside trading.
I can do high school math, unlike the avg WSB user. I'm just doubting the frequency with which this dude is hitting what are 1:60 and 1:50 odds. That's college math for ya.
I have tons to learn and know nothing. How did OP or anyone else here even know to be following FSLR and that it could potentially hit $150 by Friday?
Hope he sold it‚Äôs down to 850k now
What about him!!! The!!
I also wanna know
OP right now probably

You really think we would know him if he wasnt down overall? üòÇ
No taxes on those gains!
HOW DO YOU MFs HAVE THIS MUCH MONEY TO BEGIN WITH
You have to lose 20K many times to hit this.
And I love it.
epic
we all aspire for this shit
On WSB even a good day is loss porn‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm here for it!
WSB-sama I kneel to your diamond hands autism.
Peak autism
don't discount the possibility of insider trading lmao
i was thinking people alot of the people here are either well-off or rich already. and the other group taking out loans or thier house as collateral.
This is a pump sub to make you think you too can make these yolo gains. Desk traders and social media pumping investing groups mostly.
I bought a motorcycle with my NCCPA scholarship.
Easy killer. I bought TSLA at $13.29 in 2016 with student loan money and it‚Äôs up 1753% andddd for a second I thought papa Biden was gonna forgive the rest of the debt lol
Literally everyone in this thread is now saying he's -30% as if it's a fact lol, that's how fast fake news spreads
It was a delicious joke
Lmfao, the whole of WSB has hitched a ride on your -30% comment. Made me spend 10 minutes trying to find where he said it before running into you saying it was a joke. Ffs this tracks for the sub.
truly an inspiration for us. My second favorite after Bernie madoff
I also try to be on quaaludes whenever I can
No, I get it, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you're not afraid of like the whole kid thing, right? Like the whole...
Just the 20k he started with would do me, thanks.
No, but I looked at OP's post history and didn't see it.
Sounds like a better idea we all win
I bet you and OP are too pussy to send me 1k üòÇ
Morons never self-identify and admit it. Give yourself a break my guy
A moron with integrity! So a double moron
If you don't then hit me up.

I'll give anyone here -30% returns on their money and toss in spit for their face with no additional cost.
PUT YOUR HANDS UP ryman9000!!! POLICE ARE ENROUTE! PREPARE TO BE BOOKED FOR PROVIDING ILLEGAL FINANCIAL ADVICE!

Lmao. I am high school educated working for my family company. I am in a very stable sort of job. Just got divorced and lost a lot. Hate having to reset and losing 5 years of progress
The guy who said it original admitted he was just joking. Everyone jumped on board cause, well, jealousy.
I'll aloud it.
thats fucking hilarious, i wonder if it has to do with his trade strategy of going for 60 baggers
With this much  success with that many tickers. His insider might be Jpow
Check his post history, he says he does basically 3 15-20k bets a day. Occasionally has a big win and then just uses the profits from those to keep trading. We're only seeing the one's he's getting right, not all the others where he's losing
I appreciate your math; someone else pointed out yoy he is still down 20%.
well thats why this sub is called wallstreetBETS, it's just a high risk bet, he could lose all of his 20k if it didn't went to $150, no one really knows
Dollar was way down and after Powell gave the green light for 3x rate cuts in 2024 there was a lot of green across the board;  check out IWM, TLT, GLD, S&P... basically everything.  Anyone who played got paid, and OP apparently plays in larger increments than us poor-ass plebs.
I can answer this
I swear I cry every single time I see this meme ü§£
So down because he bet his chromosomes and lost
Silver linings baby... Oh shiy, that reminds me, I gotta call my metals guy
In America. The majority of wealth is Inherited. Most wealthy families lose their wealth in 3 generations. OP seems to be a prime example. Having a liquid income that high isn‚Äôt natural. But what‚Äôs natural is changing at a fevered pace‚Ä¶ so who knows. All I know is all the people who afforded new houses, cars and graphics cards throughout Covid are very likely contributing to the bubble that‚Äôs about to burst.
I was gonna say the same‚Ä¶.. it generational wealth. Inherited, old money passed down. Not a struggle in their bloodline
Link to the insider trading discord, please.
A few times a year there's some **serious** loss porn where someone admits they've been betting their life savings and lost it all.  


Shit like that is why I keep coming back here.  The gain porn and meme losses are boring it's just rich people playing games.  I'm here to watch people destroy their fucking lives.
HOG up 7% today is this YOU?!!!!
Win some lose some, this is a casino after all.
ya. no kidding, everyone messaging me how i‚Äôm still down 30% rn . the fuck lol.  it‚Äôs literally gonna take hundreds of plays for me to lose 1m, i don‚Äôt trade every single day or trade so much a day, and my bet sizing is even smaller (like 5k) if it‚Äôs a non event chop day
Hey I hear YOUR portfolio is -30% buddy
*Chef's kiss*
No we have two kids.
You're free now. Run free.
[deleted]
\- 30% on their money, seems kinda legit for this subreddit
You can spit on my face as long as its in my mouth daddy
Arrest him
>working for family company 


It‚Äôs time to gamble
This guy is basically the same as a gambling addict hitting the slot machine every day.
A guy I know does the same with contracts on certain setups that are rare to find. He says, it works because he *strongly believes* that he can't have \~30 fails in a row since he doesn't need to act. He was right the last 8 years. Most people wouldn't have his god like patience.
Well if that's true at least that makes some sense.
Where did he say this?
>Only 21% of millionaires received any inheritance at all.
>Just 16% inherited more than $100,000.
>Only 3% received an inheritance at or above $1 million

[source](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/retirement/the-national-study-of-millionaires-research)

>43% of children born into the bottom quintile (bottom 20%) remain in that bottom quintile as adults. Similarly, 40% of children raised in the top quintile (top 20%) will remain there as adults. Looking at larger moves, only 4% of those raised in the bottom quintile moved up to the top quintile as adults. Around twice as many (8%) of children born into the top quintile fell to the bottom. 37% of children born into the top quintile will fall below the middle.

Americans are great at creating wealth. I won't say inheritance is insignificant, but it's not the primary driving force behind wealth in our country. Similarly the income brackets are mobile - - less than they should be, but not insignificantly so.

Edit: Lmao he blocked me for debunking his internal victim narrative
It's called "having friends in the real world who work in different industries".

Seems lame and overrated, tbh.

i remember the guy that bet his inherited house+ loans and he lost a ton, what happened to him.
Yeah but you're down 30%, why would I listen to you?
I remember you from the discord group with the crazy AMZN options. Still holding d millions I see
No way, I'm down way more than that!
That's solid then, kids are a handful but worth it. Hats off to making it work!
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Shoot him- or something
Welcome to /r/wallstreetbets. It‚Äôs kind of the point.
What setups is he executing?
sub-comment in a sub-thread, sorry, not scouring through the 700 comments to find it. Couldve been BS but not sure why the would downplay earnings.
Where does it say he‚Äôs down 30%?
Why would you listen to anyone on WSB.
If it's actually useful, they aren't going to tell you üòâ
Somebody claimed he is down 30%, didn't make it clear it was a joke. Now it's being repeated as fact everywhere
BTC hit $50K USD
We hit 50K!
Bitcoin [pros](/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ap3p7a/btc_hit_50k_usd/kq4zwl8/) & [cons](/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ap3p7a/btc_hit_50k_usd/kq4zxh6/) with related info are in the collapsed comments below.
100k end of year 2021, the dream is back.
Why didn‚Äôt I stack more?!? Oh. Because of Bills,‚Ä¶? Fuck bills.
Kinda glad that i kept consistent with my contributions. i dont put alot into bitcoin but having great returns on throwaway money feels amazing
From the 49 to 50 in 30 mins!
50k probably have huge wall of sell, it will be small scale of war to beat that
100k by Q16 2021? Right?
BTC hits 50k and seemingly noone cares, lol. Where is the public hype?
Lunch break and checked my phone.. holy hell that‚Äôs a green candle. Thank you everyone for being here, see you even higher next month.
Aaaaaand its gone
And retail still doesn‚Äôt care lol
Whenever I see the charts do something ridiculous like today, I just shake my head in disbelief and think: BTC sure is crazy.
I'm just playing devils advocate here... but I don't like this movement pre-halving... I think we're going to get absolute dumped on after the halving. I don't know my ass from my elbow but I'm just saying... maybe hold off on fomoing in right now
I sold, that's why it's pumping. you are welcome.
Forgot I had set a limit order to sell some when it hit 50k. Was pleasantly surprised this morning. Gotta take profits when you can.
tldr; Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching new two-year highs, with prices surpassing $49,000. Optimism is growing due to institutional buying and the potential for tackling all-time highs. Traders are cautiously optimistic about BTC reaching $50,000, but also recognize the need for a possible retest of support levels. Interest in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is increasing, with significant inflows noted in the past week. Some believe that ETFs could help drive BTC prices higher, possibly challenging all-time highs in the months ahead.

Barely had real correction.
we are SO back.
Poor XRP holders ,, I‚Äôm the only one who feels for you (I don‚Äôt have any XRP).
Keep calm and DCA
all youtubers flipped bullish, you know what that means :D
How reliable does the source need to be to report bitcoin hit 50k lol
Holy fuckkkkk
It touched 50,000.00 exactly on Coinbase. I took a picture haha
50k now
BTC is dominating
Again?
Everything is pumping in my account right now even shib got a little love
This is an unstoppable bull atm. The whole market is on fire!
It actually feels so good to be back and I am happy to see the greens
This is good news.
We are getting there already. I love it Green‚úÖ
*again
Mortimer...
Last time I bought Bitcoin was Jan 26 of 2024. BTC was at 42k . Not going to fomo and hold off. I can‚Äôt predict anything but I‚Äôm guessing there will be a cliff fall once ppl start dumping their profits
We're so back!
Again
And it slippped on the bananna peel again under 50k.
50k and still counting
>Unreliable source

Well that's it, I guess it's over bros. No way we can fact check this news.
Unreliable source, BTC is in fact $25K


# ü•¥
This was directly caused by Jack Dorsey being shown wearing a Satoshi shirt at the Super Bowl.
Holy moley, Pepe lambos coming soon.
100k end of year 2024, the dream is possible. I believe
Big milestone the second time around
We are so back!!
Catching all them falling knives have paid off
this is a good price before the halving. wonder how's the price after that moment
![img](avatar_exp|165051192|bravo)

Pump pump pump it up
What happened to the guy that's looking for his old HDD in a landfill? Is he still looking for it?
I think 55k will come soon
Lets goo
Ironic that the image shows bitcoin running sleighs when there won't be any snow left if it continues growing in value.
If you are someone that held during the sbf+do kwon  crash like me,  well done but dont be greedy and take some profits
Big if true
13k next
We hit 48!
![img](avatar_exp|78116934|heart)

52! How y‚Äôall feeling??
Can we have another crash please? I wasn't done accumulating, and I'll buy a lot less at these prices going forward.
This subreddit is so cringe. In a bull market, every poster and their mom says that their üí© coin will go to the moon and will overtake BTC. Now when üí© coins are fizzling out everybody cheers for BTC as if they never said such blasphemy to begin with lol.
Btc will show overall growth . It's potential is really high .
And we‚Äôre still early
:)
![img](avatar_exp|78116934|bravo)
Called it!
The key will be where it gets by August.  That is the big effect, buy now because it will never be cheap again.
Thanks for the info Fried Dick Man!
Thanks for the info Fried Dick Man
I just want my alts to catch up not fall back. XLM/VET
Useless if the alts are not growing...
When BTC it's going down, alts are following this trend, and now, when btc it's pumping like hell, alts are stagnant.   

I really hate this space.
Waiting for ETH ETF so I can see more gains!
It did not break $50k from what I‚Äôve seen so far‚Ä¶$49,940 and change, noon EST. 

$50k will be a sell off.
It doesn't matter if it hits $100K.

It does matter if someone you knew got a million out of this rise
Is this stil a good time to get into bitcoin?
Except it's gonna fall back below, where it belongs, within 24 hours.
Maybe unrelated, but I can't help but notice the recent pump follows the launch of ZetaChain Mainnet, an interoperability blockchain that makes bitcoin accessible for DeFi/DEX use cases without bridging or wrapping.¬†
[deleted]
in a few minutes,,,yes
how high will this bull go?
Okay get ready to sell if your mom talks about it.
Bitcoin will be 51K in less than 20 days.
Hey, looks like I might actually break even! I just need it to double, and then double again!
I'd say 110.000$ EOY
#50K

**Congratulations**
Touched and burned it's claws
Yes sir, continuing to hodl a watch BTC rally to a new ATH every 4y.
Be careful, someone will loose their shirt and pants due to this 50k wall.  Talking about the margin traders.
Woohoo üéâ
ETH is lagging like a bitch tho.. damn
Did anybody see an animation on bitcoinity?
I hope u/comboy has one ready for 100k!
Very cool!!!
Yes
I wish my friends were also along for the ride. I was PREACHING at 20k (then it dropped to 16k but that's kind of irrelevant now).
But why
Your first time?
Remember to take profits!

Let the one's who care about the tech buy and hold.

Let the ones who are here to invest take profit!
Lambo soon
So i think is possible
Nice. What is the next target, mate?
March dip to 35 before ATH?
Yup finally sold whatever little BTC I had left lol now ETH needs to pump
Wasn't expecting it tbh
I sold at 47 bought back 46,7. In hindsight, should‚Äôve bought more during that retrieval to $38k ü•≤
Bears get rekt
1.   .
How do you best gain from this?
Now bleed into alts thanks btc... ur job is done
conditions are great for shitcoining right now. looking at social fi atm
Q16 ü§û
It never left!!
Been a long 2y but if it‚Äôs your saving account and you were able to hodl today is a good day.
It will be over 100k
Only a 2x and we can finally enter 2022
This joke wasn't funny even in 2021.
https://giphy.com/gifs/dollars-amount-sEULHciNa7tUQ/fullscreen
[sad bill](https://images.app.goo.gl/iQrMzszbSTVxPZLt8)
When it was at 16k I was gonna buy a decent chunk until an unexpected expense came up. I‚Äôm so pissed but at least I got some at around 20k
Same bro üëä hopefully see you in the lambo shop
congratulations
BTC, is doing wonders
We‚Äôre winning the battle sir ü´°
69k will be the sell wall...
Yes and no.  There will be a sell wall.  But it wont hold long.  Halving is just around the corner combined with these ETFs ramoing up...


..I'll see you on the moon
I hope it halves so I can buy.  Can‚Äôt believe I missed it when it was in the teens ü§¶üèª
100k by Q20*‚Äô21
Usually takes a new ATH for the general public to start taking notice so it won't be until we hit 70k
In reality the "crypto" space is still synonymous with Bitcoin to the general public and "crypto" is full of shit
They will come running back at 69k
Don‚Äôt forget that the stock market and crypto are currently completely decoupled from market sentiment.

While people are crushed by inflation, lay offs, tightening belts‚Ä¶ stocks and crypto are flying high‚Ä¶
Its been rolling uphill for a year without hype. Let it cook.
Just last week I read a comment that casually said "now that crypto is worthless..."
It‚Äôs been 2 hours, lol.
If you have no BTC, the price doesn't matter to you.
We are waiting for 69k Bitcoin fomo to buy
As an "outsider," Reddit showed me this as a trending topic and I mildly care. The internet isn't going bananas, but I'm sure there are some lurkers that are mildly enthused.
Personally I‚Äôm not feeling much hype either. Didn‚Äôt buy Bitcoin for 50k
and we're back!
Well it was nice while it lasted ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
$50.145, she‚Äôs back baby !
Aaand it‚Äôs back
Too early to say
If you aren‚Äôt ready for single day double digit gains or losses you‚Äôre in the wrong market pal
Same. I got a bad feeling about this. Too many whales pumping right now.
Anybody who fomos in because the price went up is an idiot who is chasing money without knowing shit and will end up chasing the same thing for shit crypto projects 

Go back and learn Bitcoin. DCA and chill. 

Been buying every single day for years. The highs and lows don't mean anything anymore. Just accumulate what you can risk
Look at past cycles, this isn‚Äôt abnormal, it‚Äôs the norm
I don't think the halving matters that much anymore.
Not according to Credible Crypto.  We will see though.
Tell me more about it. Two of my friends said that BTC should've gone down months pre-halving
Just keep dca'ing each time you get paid. It's heading for millions long term.
Same same. Moneeeeey
> Gotta take profits when you can.¬†


I take my profits in bitcoin form
wen the tldr is longer than the original
Its true tho, I am a swingtrader
We aren‚Äôt getting real corrections anymore it looks like.
Went over 50 on kucoin
But‚Ä¶. It could get eaten up by all the big buys that are occurring. I‚Äôm not holding my breath but this could well be the ETFs taking effect where there‚Äôs just like twice the buying pressure of old, in which case Bitcoin could see 2-3% gains a day/ week for some time now.
Did someone mention Banano?!
It‚Äôs me

I‚Äôm the unreliable source
Averaging down**
Slow clap! Everyone get in huurrr
should i wait for 2x? im still like $900 away
I‚Äôd buy it then too
Back to 49!
U had plenty of time if you didn‚Äôt just join 2-3 Months ago
Sameee
sure, but then it will dip after the crash and then crash some more and dip for a few years...
Agreed. This sub is more tolerable in bear when most of the degens leave.
It keeps going up up
![img](avatar_exp|78116934|winner)
why august?
Fellow bag holder checking in !
look at the satoshi price of alts.. they get destroyed.
> I really hate this space.

you will hate a lot less once you understand why only Bitcoin is truly OG.

submit to reality for peace.
Coinbase and Robinhood are both saying 50k and then 50.1k just now soooo
Its $50,900 on crypto.com
Point to me on the doll where bitcoin hurt you lmao
No one knows or cares what this is.
We‚Äôre not even at the halving yet!
Why so bearish?
Just wait a week
Dipping the toes in
69,420.69
Doubt it
Gotta wait until after the halving!
Q20 is the new Q16
Oh‚Ä¶I woke up a couple times.
This is an underrated response
$100k BTC, $10k ETH, $10 Moons always has been üë®‚ÄçüöÄüî´
Fiscal 2022, I don't wanna redo actual calendar year 2022.
Lambo in 2033 by my predictions
You couldn't handle one
$69420*
It *was* the sell well. It hit 69,420 on one platform (Idk, but I have a feeling it was Binance?)and some communities popped their corks. I remember getting a *lot* of messages about 2pm GMT. Actually it may have been just after 5pm, but IIRC it was 2pm.

100k and beyond only will get their attention.
Yeah currently it‚Äôs pretty much still just seen as down 20% from its ATH
There‚Äôs going to be a sell off at $69,420 for the dumbest of reasons too.
That‚Äôs how I‚Äôm feeling. It tells us the bullrun is going to be insane.
‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs gone!
Yes? What did you do? I missed it.
No.
Double digit PERCENT you mean?
Exactly I remember when crypto fell from 69,000 down to like 35,000 in 24 hours, then 2-4 days later it went back up and that‚Äôs when I sold all of my crypto at like 58,000, knowing that that was the knife in the chest for crypto, and nobody wanted to believe me. Crypto can literally lose $500 billion in market cap in one day.
u/2ManyAccounts24 for what time horizon are you accumulating? are u just hodling? whats ur strategy
ü§£
TSWR: Too short will read
What‚Äôs true!?
No historical pre halving dump you think?
Are we in the bull run now
I just find it bizarre that how are people able to make these big buys with all the layoffs and ath credit card debt present. Also with SEC hinting they are not cutting rates for now.
Depends for who
don't get greedy, we are 17% away from the ATH, take some profits so you are only playing with the house's money
Go 49ers üèâ
I have been buying before the crash, during the crash, and afterwards.

Yes, there was plenty of time but not plenty of money.
Posts become incredibly desperate in a bear market though
The Bitcoin Halving should be done by then.  Honestly a key marker for all crypto at that point.
Only in the last couple minutes. The article was preemptive.

And I wouldn‚Äôt trust data from RH if my life depended on it.
My comment was prior to that, and the article was before it hit.
Seriously? You need to stop making all these personal attacks. The FACT is, bitcoin is a scam. Bottom line. Above everything else, it's a giant scam. Once the sheeple wake up to it, it will crash to zero. Not one cent, not a tenth of a cent -- ZERO, with a capital Z. Anyone who tries to fluff it up is participating in the scam. I'd give it a solid month. Get out while you can.

Edit: Forgot the "this is what buttcoiners actually believe".
Bitcoin 51k, Zeta 2.38.
I just want to get it right.
QQ is the new Q
That's your fault. The dream was still in progress. Not the dream's fault you set your alarm for an inconvenient time.
Fuck moons!
Let's go bitcoin!
I'd even take a very modest $9 per Moon
Too bad. Round 2 of 2022 is gonna be rough üëÄ
You paying with $$ or BTC?!?!
None of us could
Tbf I probably wouldn‚Äôt buy a lambo, any expensive car is just a depreciating asset. I‚Äôd much rather have a Mustang.
What are you talking about it‚Äôs one of the easier to handle.
This is the way.
And at 100k+ people will fomo like crazy and mortgage their house for some shitcoins.
Like last time it hit that lol ftx
I mean, I‚Äôm for sure BUYING at 69,420.  lol
and we're back!
And we are back! And its Gone, And we are back again!
I did what any self-respecting investor would do in this situation...scrambled to get funds from savings account to fomo buy on the pump
LOL
I‚Äôm making or losing like 10$ bro chill
You remember incorrectly. Bitcoin never went from 69k to 35k in 24 hours and then went back to 58k.


No one believed you because you're making shit up
I first bought mid 2017, didn't sell at top cuz I was noob and thought it would go higher. 

Sat on it all through 2018 with no buys. 2019 decided to start buying every once in a while. When COVID hit and it dropped to 3k I did a couple big buys and rode the wave up to 60k again not selling. 

Only then did I realize I was an idiot for not buying during the bear market. I was always thinking well it could go lower. 

But the point was that it is so relative and that price was a freaking steal in the grand scheme. I started buying everyday since 2021

The goal is to just accumulate as much as I can without impacting my current way of living. I have no timeline to sell, I don't need to sell. 

I'm certain that the current price will be nothing compared to what it will be in 10 years time. Could it be less in 5 months? 2 years? Probably, but I'll be buying then too.

I will say it's easy to have that mindset when I've been in the green for a long time. My average price/Bitcoin is still around $10,000. But even so I have no plans to stop buying through this cycle
Did some profit taking, so yeah, I think there's gonna be a dip, but if not - I am still happy because it's BTC and I believe in it
good ass point
I pity the fool who hasn‚Äôt been DCAing
52!
Feel this astronomically
Yea people asking like "is new ATH possible in 2022" like no why would it be
I see üòéüëçüèª
Are the zeros in the room right now?
Quick someone do the remind me 1 month thingy
Jesus how can you be so deluded? You lot have been claiming a crash to zero within a month for 13 years. 

Couple of points... 
1. It's not possible for BTC to go to zero. It's literally impossible due to the lost supply. 
2. Writing FACT doesn't make it a fact. Actually quite the opposite as it's pretty well correlated with uneducated morons.

Even a broken clock is right twice a day but you can't even manage that success rate. You have been correct on officially 0% of occasions. FACT.
even sarcastically, the use of "sheeple" will result in downvotes
O, is the new Q
Fuck moons, srsly
Rug pulling mf's.
I mean, it's really not.
I hate how right you are
Joke's on you! I mortgaged my house for shitcoins a year ago!
it already hit that? in that case, i dont think it will be that much of an barrier this time
Aaaand its gone
Quick! What shall we do? Beers?
The irony is on its account's name
Flash crash on a shitty exchange maybe?
Damn good shit. Wish I was a bit older so I could have started buying bitcoin earlier lol. I'm 17 tho and got like 5% tho so I'm still happy.
I‚Äôm expecting to see a sell off by evening and it drop down back to $48k. My drool cup analysis.
OUQT
Be happy. They are our exit liquidity.
And we're back!
It's gonna be an interesting couple of days. I'm thinking we stay above 50k and go higher. But I've been wrong before üòÖ
What are we tracking again?
Hehe yeah my spidey-sense hasn‚Äôt been tingling so I‚Äôm not sold on it going over $55k for a bit but when it does I think it‚Äôll ride to $75k-80k and hold for a while. And I know nothing. Just muh-feels.
You üåù
Red & green candles.
deez nuts
Can't under estimate the Spidey sense üòé when we get to $75-80k it's gonna be surreal AF
And you... Happy cake day
Into the spider hole I go! 

Also share some of that cake you fuck =p
Why does color matter? Are they scented differently? Sage and cinnamon candles?
My bad, I mean red & green dildos.
Shoutout to Deloitte for laying me off in March and then going after me for $0.23 on an expense report from January
During busy season we were allowed a $20 meal. I was forced to work MLK day but the policy was $15 on Holidays. I spent $15.23 on lunch. 
 
The India credit card team probably spent 3 hours going back and forth with me and had to reopen a closed corporate card to charge me $0.23. Absolute joke of firm policy from the big D
Pay them 32 cents and then start sending them bills for the difference.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm still trying to find a job. I‚Äôll pay you back when I can.‚Äù
It‚Äôs funny because I learned ‚Äúmateriality‚Äù while I was at Deloitte‚Ä¶
"Send it to collections."
 Classic Deloitte move - penny pinchers to the extreme!
I can‚Äôt tell yall how much wholesale level waste happened on engagement teams by my managers and senior managers. I had a senior manager order full bottles to take home at a client expensed dinner. To lay me off despite good performance reviews and 80 hours weeks and then do this is such a spit in the face by a company with awful corporate spend culture
When I quit PwC, they kept sending me paychecks despite me repeatedly telling them to stop and that I didn't work there anymore.

After four months, they sent me a letter asking for $10,000. I responded saying, "I'm happy to pay you back what I owe, but this number seems incorrect." Send me a detailed accounting and I will pay immediately.

  
They never got back to me.

Write them a check.  It will cost them far more than 23 cents to process it.

IBM studied the costs to process a single check in the 1980s and it was $100.  It's probably $200 now.
That's insane! Is big 4 laying off a lot lately?
Bro don't pay that shit
Have you considered a payment plan?
Use a strip of packing tape.  Put 23 pennies on it in random spacing (so it can't easily be cut away), then stick another layer of tape over it.

Mail it back to them COD.

I saw this done from a civil servant who was billed 78 cents for a travel overage.  The clerk who had to unstick the coins will never get into heaven, based on the language she used trying to get it all apart.
Deloitte only allows $20/meal? I knew they were cheap but that‚Äôs crazy
No way!!!! I can‚Äôt believe anything under $5 would be pushed through
Take them small claims. Dispute it wasn‚Äôt yours
Pay them a penny every couple of months.  They will get hit with credit card fees.
as someone who manages a team reconciling this shit, it‚Äôs not deloitte. it‚Äôs the processor being a damn idiot. i had someone on my team email a partner for $12. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The minute they thought of the 32cents they spent more than 32cents.
Don‚Äôt pay. Why would you? After I quit my B4 I would get texts asking me for client info and engagement docs. Never responded to any of them.¬†
I WAS FIRED FROM EY GOT $$25k IN SEVERENCE
Drop them some pennies at the doorstep of their overpriced office and post the video
r/mildlyinfuriating
The needful has to be done whether you like it or not. I hope you kindly did it.
This makes me happy I‚Äôm not going the firm route üòÇ
Is that really how this industry is? I'm still in college so maybe I can still üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Mail them a quarter and tell them to keep the change.
Btw those cards actually impact your credit since they‚Äôre in your name. I remember a former employee taking a credit hit because they had been laid off and never submitted the expense through the system but had a balance left on the card from a charge. Since it was never submitted they didn‚Äôt get reimbursed and assumed the card would be closed and the company would repay the remaining balance‚Ä¶ but nope.
Trivial.  No forward payment needed.
Pay by mail with exact change. It‚Äôll cost them $10-15 to process it.
Fucking lmao
I wouldn‚Äôt pay them a cent
They did this to me too, they stuck me with my last months phone bill
This is why I never worked for the big 4
Yuck
You sure it‚Äôs not $x,xxx?

This is unreal
Those pennies add up to dollars
Just mail them a stamp
This just confirms my decision to stay away from PA.
*Immaterial
I love this comment section, made my day
Deminimis?!!
Not surprised they are such low lives and notorious for fucking over their own employees. I‚Äôm really sorry you have to deal with this petty BS and I hope you land a better paying role you love. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Give them $100 and wait for the change
Well, what was your job description? I mean job role when you are working there.
Sheesh
Send them an invoice for severance and a statement that shows it as a credit to that invoice.
Salt in the wound‚Ä¶ on a separate note, wishing you the best moving forward
Write it off. What a bunch of bs
One cent per month
Not surprised. Typical.
just ignore it and let it cost them even more. 

Not like its going to collections for $0.23. 

Deloitte will just be more out of pocket in this fruitless endeavour.
B4 "expense cards" being credit cards in your own name and affecting your own credit score is a hilarious cucking. Remember that next time you think of B4 as prestigious or respectable.
That‚Äôs Amex not Deloitte. The credit card is in your name. You should be entitled to reimbursement from Deloitte assuming it was a business expense, but they are not chasing you down for it, Amex is.
[deleted]
I‚Äôm a medicine boy but had a ton of business bros in college. Can someone explain the stereotypes of each of the Big 4?
[deleted]
They‚Äôll have to cut a refund which will cost them at least 5 bucks in overhead
Also, charge them interest at 19.99% APY.
Do they expect you to pay 50? cents for a stamp to mail them a check for 23  cents?  

Tell them you will pay up if they send you a business reply envelope.
This is so petty I love it.
This is so petty I love it.
I love this idea! It will drive them nuts!
JERRY ITS A WRITE OFF!
This is peak accounting.
Grounded response. I still prefer the other guy‚Äôs idea to overpay by $.08 to waste their time asking for a refund.
Yea, I thought they wouldn't do anything for that?  Costed way more in "time" to even send out the request for the 23 cents.  What the fuck are they doing over there?  I've worked for a large County that would put around $100 into an unspecified fund if we couldn't track all the rounding from the thousands of (single) dollar differences in transactions each month.
That's an audit concept. Internal control/compliance may use a different number or none at all depending on the control.
This!  I learned mine at E&Y!
Subject to accountants judgment
That‚Äôs what I told them on the $6 they wanted me to ACH them on a similar manual charge. 

I explained how I would happily reopen charge time codes for the old client and rebook any expenses they deem incorrect.
They'd have to move that to "doubtful accounts."
[deleted]
Pigs
*with awful corporate culture
Ftfy!
They never figured out how to send a detailed accounting I guess
This happened to me after a Deloitte internship. It ended in March, but they kept sending me paychecks every 2 weeks until June or so.

I had to go so far out of my way to find someone who would listen to me and make them aware of this, which was very frustrating because I could‚Äôve used that money. I always wonder what would‚Äôve happened if I said nothing‚Ä¶
Sounds like a Nigerian/Indian scam ‚Ä¶ how ironic üòÄ
Pay them in pesos
Send them individually over a one month period. But only send 22.
Even better send them 25 cents so they have to send you back your change
Not anymore. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs shifting to LATAM. Indians and Chinese people figured out their worth and now CEOs are bitching about their cost. 

Just pay people for the work they‚Äôre doing.
Rs 20 isn't big money in India. (0.23*85)
[deleted]
or better yet 23 separate checks each for 1 cent hahaha
yes i like it
Write them checks for 1 cent each.
They laid off so many people in my office. We had a senior manager who had been given a partnership and was mid pipeline who got laid off.
Don‚Äôt forget the superglue
My per diem was $75/day when I worked there like 6 years ago.
It‚Äôs over $100 now, can‚Äôt remember exact $. The $20 I think was daily meals for tax/audit teams during busy season.
Where I live, small claims court won't even let you dispute less than $20.
The "adults in the room" that should catch it are stretched too thin from all the outsourcing and layoffs, so in a way it still goes back to the real decision makers.
Deloitte? Sounds like a coffee brand ‚òïÔ∏è üòÄ ‚òïÔ∏è
You must have known something they thought deserved severence
I would still go the firm route for what ifs worth. As bad blood I have with Deloitte I have endless opportunities with it on my resume
Don‚Äôt work for Deloitte. They will steal your sole and then drive over it in a Mack truck.
Run. Don‚Äôt look back. No joke.
Stick the quarter in dog poop, then send it.
Took a title promotion at a F500 30 minutes closer to my house. I am treated with so much more respect as a CPA that I am now more than a template filer outer like at Deloitte. Getting laid was great for me personally and got me off of a toxic environment. 

Love what Deloitte did for me professionally but happy to be gone in hindsight
Actually, by and large the majority of corporate cards are legally responsible by the firm, not the individual employee. They are business credit cards, meaning they cut a deal with say Amex and are allowed to issue x amount of cards based on the agreement, each of those cards are the responsibility of the Firm. So they legally can't do anything if this was to occur. They cannot legally take you to collections, because the debt is not legally yours, it's the businesses.
Deloitte is reversing this not Amex. This card was closed out 4 months ago as far as Amex is concerned. Deloitte told Amex to send them 0.23 and put me on the hook for it.
They shouldnt have approved it when I still worked there then. Doing a further review 6 months later is insane for $0.23
I did.
Maybe they can negotiate a venmo payment.
Tape the envelope to a brick and mail it back for bonus style points
>What the fuck are they doing over there?

They're hiring uneducated non-English speakers who can't think critically and who just follow script in the best cast scenario.
This, it's a mind-your-pennies philosophy.
That's wild! The middle market firm I was at generally didn't go after former employees for anything. I know a guy that was supposed to pay back costs the firm paid for his MST degree but never did. It was over $6k but they probably recognize the bad blood isn't worth it.
> I explained how I would happily reopen charge time codes for the old client and rebook any expenses they deem incorrect.

Bill your old company 1000/hour, 4h min, to do it.
I will not be pedantic. I will not be pedantic. I will not be pedantic.
Wow
The Auditor of PWC be like 

  
Dayum those processes are whack
I'm convinced that's the case. They have no idea when I actually quit because HR really screwed that up.
They would eventually come after you it‚Äôs better this way
Pay them in Stanley Nickels
How much is that in pesos? $30 and 2 daughters? üòÄ
And skip a day in the middle too, so they think they missed one.
I worked with a team from Argentina and they were miles beyond any of the Indian teams I worked with.
It‚Äôs got little to do with cost. The quality of work is simply superior and timelines align better from near-shoring vs off-shoring.
I think Indians were found out. Fake credentials, fake degrees, team of idiots with one capable performer group call.
Parking ticket for 1 hour.
For an ant
In the memo of each write "check 1 of 23", but short them one check somewhere in the middle.
r/maliciouscompliance
What?! Wow.
What big ass client(s) did ur office lose?
üíØ
i get that, but in my case, that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm there. to lead my team to make best judgements and not knit pick petty amounts. im the voice of reason who says ‚Äòit‚Äôs ridiculous for you to waste my team‚Äôs resources on this bullshit‚Äô.
hummmmmmmmm.
Woah since im got an offer from deloitte and will be joining i was reading reveiws about the company and came across your account, u really hate deloitte dont u lol
When I worked at EY we had American Express "expense cards" and they made it very clear to us that it would fuck up our credit. Maybe Deloitte does it differently?
Did you claim the expense and get reimbursed?
lol don‚Äôt listen to this guy. Sending a bill to recoup .23 cents while the materiality threshold for audits is in the 10000s is so funny to me.
‚Ä¶And then request the official D Venmo a years severance!
Deloitte loves immigration. They love the 3rd world, and the 4th world, and the 5th world, and the 6th world üòÄ
Can‚Äôt think or ‚Äúgiven no authority and shit pay‚Äù?
Isnt it racist?
John Smith Dayum III is a highly valued member of our firm üòÄ
Or 2,300 Schrute Bucks
I dealt with the Mexico office when I worked in industry at my previous job and they were so much easier to deal with than the India or UAE office. Time zones are a lot closer and most of them speak pretty decent English too.
I heard EY is setting up a GDS in Argentina for same reasons. It‚Äôs just better in LATAM than India and Philippines
I‚Äôm Pro-India > Argentina because I like how the time zones don‚Äôt match up to the point where I would have to answer pings consistently during my normal working hours. I like having the update meetings in the morning then I can work on the issues alone.
Why wouldn't they be? Some of you folks really need to meet people outside your culture for real man...smdh.
It has absolutely to do with cost most of these east asian countries are paid peanuts and no proper training is even given unlike other's 
If you are getting paid $500 a month you won't even consider to look at your work
Thank you come again üòÄ
Better yet, just write one check for $0.01 and write in the memo "check 12 of 23". Never mail them anything else and when they ask say they need to reach out to USPS to resolve.
This is the kind of evil we need.
Oh man this is so diabolical I love it
Make sure you watch the check #s tho lol
Mine. F500 audit hence why I got cut. Half my team got wiped
Vought rewards all those they‚Äôve served üòÄ
Detest it with my entire soul. I came from Stanford with a 4.5 and that was easy compared to working at Deloitte. I got out after a year, and it‚Äôs the best choice I ever made.
I'm not sure how they could be, unless when you open them they take a hard credit score, meaning your card is legally yours because it's been opened with your credit score/SSN. This happened to a friend of a friend and when he called AmEx to understand why he was being billed after his quit date, the employee for AmEx said more or less "this is not your debt, this it the companies, they can't go after you via credit/collections, they can threaten you, but it means nothing". I would assume they could bring you to civil claims court over it, but the cost of the lawyers and work to retrieve less than $1000 i doubt the cost-benefit would be worth it. Suffice to say, teller told the FOAF that he can ignore everything moving forward.
I can sense the sarcasm here but i truly wanna understand their point of view.
The commenter is racist yes. The people who are hired are not uneducated, nor non-English speaking. They just are not allowed to use ANY judgement. Even if they have their own judgement. They have to go off what they're allowed to do only.¬†
To everyone downvoting my comment, just wanna know why are you hating my comment so much? I deserve to know if i am wrong.
He may be, but he is also right
So is your English..
I worked with them at EY. They were so much better technically than the Indian teams. I get what everyone is saying by time zones and what not, but the quality of work was way more important to me.
I worked with a Buenos Aires based team at a different Big4 and can confirm they were very competent AND had the added bonus of being in the same time zone.
Please do the needful ü§£
howd u end up in deloitte after standford lmao anyways where u working now
LOW cost of labor. It‚Äôs always about money. 

If you had to do somebody‚Äôs FORM 1040 and schedule C for a whole year of business WITHOUT ProSeries or any other software, you would hate your life. 

Your labor alone would cost $60,000-70,000 (I mean for a whole year of taxes). HOWEVER, with a tax software, your labor is CUT DOWN. So maybe you only get paid $50,000-60,000 ISH üòÄ
So‚Ä¶ not thinking critically and following the script. Many of the people I interacted with while in B4 absolutely came across as uneducated as they routinely messed up the simplest of non-judgment tasks. 

Nothing ‚Äúracist‚Äù about calling any of this out as it is. Stop it.
>The commenter is racist yes.

Nice argument/rule 1) violation there. Personal attacks aren't arguments or polite disagreements. They're just personal attacks.
Yes and as a society we need to get over it. Theres a reason why leaders of any domain chose to decide the outsourcing way and perhaps the reason we have our jobs and world is functioning the way it is.
i can‚Äôt find any errors
I get what you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm an Indian working at an Indian back end, the issue is the people themselves holding back at various levels. Im trying my best to not do the mistakes my managers do to my team. Sometimes it‚Äôs the culture of the company.

1) it‚Äôs the management who don‚Äôt want ‚Äúany risk‚Äù so that they can always hide behind ‚Äúyou said it and I did it‚Äù attitude and throw the confirmation email on the clients face. I mean, that should be the last resort. Clients come to us for solutions and we‚Äôre hiding behind that is absolute cowardly. 

2) the management doesn‚Äôt plan knowledge transfer effectively. Some fellows just are petty and will never share the process knowledge with their juniors and leave in a short time after the transition and they‚Äôre stuck and the management is too pussy to ask for a refresher. 

3) innovative ideas, there‚Äôs tons being given out here. The problem with outsourcing to a third party company is that when they bring up that idea, the work hours reduce and the billing reduces and it‚Äôs a direct hit on their income. So they don‚Äôt encourage innovation in the processes. 
Clients love innovation and they‚Äôre delighted when that happens and actually get us more work, the management doesn‚Äôt see that. 


4) to be honest, it‚Äôs a fucking rat race here. Everyone wants to get ahead in life. A lot of folks just learn the accounting by heart and not truly understand the concept. The education system is absolutely broken here. It‚Äôs focussed on learning things by heart and not focusing on the concepts. 75 years of independence and the government refuses to fix that dump.

5) the management at US wants to give the contract to the lowest bidder to show maximum savings to the shareholders. The lowest bidder keeps lower head count and pay lower than the market rates and keep longer work hours here so nobody sticks to a company here. Cost of living is rising and 2-3K USD per annum (yep US $3K per annum) isn‚Äôt sufficient to survive where these jobs are located. Wherever they are, the costs rises sharply. Especially the rents.
NVIDIA. Who‚Äôs laughing now?
That is correct. And you explained it so well and hit the right nail. 

People do not appreciate outsourcing and do not consider what their life would be like without it.
Generalising to this extent that calling everyone in a country uneducated is to my opinion racist.

I think it stems from the insecurity that people are afraid of losing their job because of Outsourcing+AI and they have little to no skill beyond pointing small errors.

Talking about following the script. I believe people performing these tasks are freshly graduate and they need to be trained. If someone is dealing with staff/Associate isn‚Äôt it senior‚Äôs responsibility to train them first?
Let‚Äôs be honest, most of these ‚Äúaccounting jobs‚Äù will be pruned from the timeline with A.I. and technology in the next 20-30 years. 

The ‚Äústaff jobs‚Äù will be for ‚Äúhighly intelligent‚Äù AKA the sons and daughters of said partners who have been primed to already have an education and be studying for said CPA exam. 

I want to be hopeful, so I want mention the ‚Äúoutsourcing of remaining jobs.‚Äù I want to be, but these facts here are certainly not helping üòÄ
Well that went far too far past what I said...
Because it‚Äôs cheaper and these people have zero leverage to change that.
I see two missing commas.  Might as well have just made grunting noises.
Of course that is ONLY technology. There is also the pipeline of CPA educated kids from Indian that are taught to study just to take exams and come to USA looking for cheaper wages than what Tyrone or Julio or Smith would get paid if they had the same education‚Ä¶
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
But I believe the invisible hand would take care of them. 

Not performing? Lose their job and go back to home country. Performing well? You are important and let me promote you and increase your pay. 

At the end of it all boils down to benefit provided for cost. If Tyrone/Julio/Smith can provide better value for cost, they are welcome. Isn‚Äôt it?
That‚Äôs a great question. Performance is irrelevant when you can work ‚Äúaverage‚Äù and not require the wages that Tyrone/Smith/Julio would want. 

Average work performance and LESS wages VS average work performance and MORE wages?  What would it mean to do more than ‚Äúaverage‚Äù anyways? 2 tax returns in 1 hour? Or finishing preliminary work paper corroboration in a few hours? 

Of course, looking for foreign talent almost ALWAYS is something that the BIG FOUR would do. A mid sized company in an above average city? Maybe not.

This got to be insider trading
Withdraw, have a nice holiday. Come back, do it again.
Giant nuts well played!

 MESA, Ariz., Feb. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nxu, Inc. (NASDAQ: NXU) (‚ÄúNxu‚Äù, ‚Äúthe Company‚Äù), a domestic technology company developing and manufacturing innovative EV charging and energy storage solutions, successfully charged a Tesla Cybertruck (‚ÄúCybertruck‚Äù) on Feb. 26, 2024; possibly the first-ever successful Cybertruck NACS (North American Charging Standard) charging session performed on a non-Tesla DC fast charging station.
I see post like this and then think to myself, I would manage to fuck it up anyway
What app is this?
Tell me BEFORE hand next time! God damn !
Next one is $MRVL
I don‚Äôt really understand options yet but seeing things like this makes me want to.
This is the way. Notice the SELL order completed to sell the option back to the market and secure the gains, everyone? THATS how you avoid the rug pull. Secure your gains. When your option hits the moon, that‚Äôs it: time to sell. I don‚Äôt care if you have a year of time left on it, it‚Äôs time. I don‚Äôt care if ‚Äúit could go even higher; maybe to a million or half a million‚Äù I DON‚ÄôT CARE‚Ä¶when it hits it‚Äôs time to sell. Secure your gains. Cash in hand ‚úã. 

Also: notice the $16 interest payment? They‚Äôre trading on borrowed money, pay all of that money back as soon as the trade is done I don‚Äôt care how much: if you owe 290k to your brokerage and it says you have a 300k gain, that‚Äôs a lie: you have a 10k gain. If it‚Äôs not ‚Ä¢all‚Ä¢ your money, free and clear, it‚Äôs not your money. Know that in your mind at all times even as you trade. Good luck and OP: NOICE! üëç
All time down $120,000
This guy fucks
Next month:

‚ÄúGuys, I went from 300k to negative 30k. Help!
What leverage did you buy the call option with ?
OK I admit the feet. I‚Äôm tired of trying to short this stupid market. Nothing makes sense, so fuck it I might as well just join the bulls and just go hyper long on everything no matter what.

Dude, you‚Äôre getting a Dell!
what do calls and puts mean?
What time do I start on Monday?
God Iv seen what you‚Äôve done for others . I would like the same treatment üôèüèª
Bro you won, now put that shit in a blue chip and let it grow safely
Bro if you did $30k you‚Äôd be a multimillionaire
I'm more impressed that your phone is fully charged. You seem like you have it together.
Now full port NVDA puts
Congrats and fuck you
That line straighter than my phone screen
How tell me please  I need this
Do it 12 months in a row now.
Can someone ELI5 how options worked in this case?
Where can I find a credible source for learning? I want to know what options are and be confident when I try it for the first time.
Always numbers, never dates ‚òπÔ∏è
What are SQ calls?
What app are you using
Stop, leave, sell it all, frick you, I love you regard
fuck u imao
You just buy calls expiring in a month way out the money before a  big event? Let me know. I can see the future.
Withdraw 50% of that fund right now
Guys, can we please share these bets when they are made, so we can share knowledge and success?
We should take the Shiba for a run it maybe fun
Genuinely how
Come on man don‚Äôt post things like that it makes us more stressed because all of us are losing money none is making any good money I believe
Bro you absolutely work for Dell or have friends family that do and got you info.  I know insider trading is an open practice among our ruling class but YOU ARE NOT THEM even if you make a good trade and get a little rich.  

Delete all evidence that may trace this back to you, you regard
But you spent $56k on DELL calls so how is it $3k to $300k
Yo what the hell
Give me the next play, and I'll suck you up behind the dumpster ü§£
Congraaaaats buddy !! And fk you
I‚Äôm here to learn master
 Good for you. I had to sell 5k worth of crypto last week cos of bills n shit üòë
Genuinely how does one accomplish this. 10k would be huge for me and my family, let alone 100k or more. I could finally accomplish so much üòÖ

Stop pretending you made that profit, you just deposit that amount of money without making any trade, Robinhood displays that way.
Where are you getting the inside scoop?
And here I am stressed the entire day about a random 200 dollar expense
The next move is $300k to $3k
‚ÄòYou show me a payslip of $300K and I quit my job and work for you‚Äô
First SMCI then DELL

Almost like the distributors selling systems with NVDA hardware are making good money

If he was smart, he'll do an 80/20 split, dumping 80% of it into long term index funds and taking a portion of that 80% to go on a vacation, and of the 20% set aside the amount necessary for the 20% capital gains tax he has to pay for this 297k gain, and then what's left, to roll back into the market.

But he's regarded, cause he posts here. So, he's destined to work the lines behind Wendy's.

Yeah what kind of insider trading shit is this lol
His profile hints at him being in Austin, where Dell has offices.

 So it‚Äôs entirely plausible
Or wife's boyfriend
Just run for office, you‚Äôll be fine.
Does insider trading apply if you're below the director level?
Her name is Michael, and she not only works there, she's the founder.
Or anyone in his social circle...Guarantee the SEC would pull up this guy's linked in and see connections that work at Dell considering he lives in Austin.
Or a family member because they‚Äôd be fucked either way
I'm looking forward to your visit to Wendy's.

*I'll intentionally use the wrong name on his order to tease him.*
Lol I always wonder about the kid in this meme. Where is he now? I hope he‚Äôs ok
It will be $1500+ next month if he leaves it uninvested
Have your money make money.
For real, what in the inside trading is this? Crazy stuff
OP's mistake. Came here to point out the lack of regardness, too
0.0003 Billion
Yeah took me a second to understand what OP was saying lol
That would make sense.
Dad fuck the milk, I need you here now
Step 1: have balls

Step 2: get lucky twice


For every success like this there's probably 1000 people who lost their first $3K.
Degeneracy and luck.
[deleted]
That‚Äôs like asking someone ‚Äúhow did you know it was gonna land on red‚Äù
Highly skeptical when people are like "I rolled all my profits into Dell call options". I mean who puts all their winnings from a lotto investment into ... Dell calls? Color me skeptical.
All you need to understand is that for every person who made this play, ten thousand lost a shit ton of money trying to do similar plays with other options.¬†
Luck is the biggest factor.  A co-worker of mine was showing me how currency trading works.  The software has a "pseudo" mode that isn't actually trading but tracks your positions and gains losses.  So he was explaining how to take positions and was just randomly selecting points as part of the explanation.

So this was a friday.  He went on vacation the next 2 weeks.  Gets back and has me come check out the absurdity.  His random positions IF he had actually taken those positions would have made over a million bucks in 2 weeks off like 10k base.

So yeah.. luck.
Insider trading
Pure gambling
I dont understand, who is buying these calls back when he sells them?
Get out of here with that common sense
This is a casino sir, we need op to yolo the 300k
Boo!¬†


We want to see him blow it up. And either own 10 Ferrari or be unable to kill himself because rope is out of his price range.¬†


Sound investment advice is boring
60% invest safely, 20-25% saved for taxes, 15-20% for fun
Gtfo with that! OP should put it all in on red! Imagine the Lamborghinis op could buy!
AFUERA!
Who do you think you are coming at us with that nonsense?
Forgot about taxes
And also remember taxes
I‚Äôll bring the crack
OP was down like 700k from a previous post. 

You might want to keep that job.
Just curious. How and when did you start options? Youtube? Books?
You wouldn't have done anything if he had¬†

If that stock didn't hit that price by that date you just lost all your money.¬†


Do some trial runs first or don't and post your losses for us to laugh at
Check out ‚Äú In the money ‚Äú on YouTube. He has excellent videos on options. The videos are in the lengthy side but if you take them step by step, it‚Äôll be a piece of cake to understand the other ones because they are connected. First check out his ‚Äú how to trade options on Robinhood for beginners ‚Äú. It applies to all brokerages; they just have different interfaces. Once you get a good idea of calls and puts there, move on to ‚Äú covered calls ‚Äú and ‚Äú cash secured puts ‚Äú. Then you can move on to the wheel strategy which uses both of these and then PMCC or poor man‚Äôs covered call. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at right now. You can also throw in credit spreads anytime once you understand calls, puts, covered calls and cash secured puts. Then I‚Äôm planning to move on to ameritrade‚Äôs think or swim or MarketWatch or some other apps that allow you to paper trade options. Once I test it there, I‚Äôll probably apply it to my real brokerage but with a very small amount.
You'd have just as much success learning lotto strategies.¬†
Be an insider
First, start out with a small loan of a million dollars. Once that is done, come back for part 2
I go about it a little different way, personally. I take a small percent of my income and my employer matches it and we give it to Vanguard to hold onto for like 30 years and they invest it for me and also if I take any of it out of this account early I get penalized
Just gamble your life savings with a 1% chance of success. It's very easy.
Pick an option trading book, or go business and finance major. You gonna need a margin account and emergency funds. Good luck because I do not trade options. Be prepared to get an accountant too, the paperwork is not easy to comply with and you certainly don't need IRS coming after you!

But I started that from $600.. and you best believe I yelled fuck you GameStop this morning. Lightning can sometimes strike twice.
Seriously. Dell? Lmao
That was money paid to me‚Ä¶ not borrowed.
Admit defeat?
You take your balls, dip them in molten steel, and then dump tens of thousands of dollars into the casino and pray it prints
Ladies and gents our communities finest.
Can you not read 8186% up in the last month that equals 300k up ?
On Feb 26, he made that from spy options. Then used the proceeds to buy Dell options. I hated that chapter in accounting tho, the process to report it on books sucked ass.
You should wear a helmet 24/7
What the Dell
At least you won't pay 100k to the fed that why. I'm an optimist
Rookie. I could get it to $0k
You forgot margin: 300k to -$3M
The next move is $300k to ~~$3k~~ federal prison
$300k to .$03 there, I fixed it for you.. we loose big here
I'm an overachiever. I can go to negatives faster than anyone.

He might get lucky again but he is gambler and gamblers always lose in the end.

It's like they play double or lose everything and never stop, they might get lucky sometimes but then they try again an lose it all. Repeat
Stock market: let me just Ctrl + Z for ya üòé
I can help with that.
The circle of life
The wall street bets classic
My rule of thumb is pull out your initial investment so you are not at a zero sum, but in this case I would put a large amount to the side and continue to play with house money.
This is the way!

Apologies I am a regard need specifics or a crystal ball
My HPE calls say "not *all* the distributors"

Look at how HP has been tanking‚Ä¶ Dell‚Äôs main data centre competitor
Would HP be next?
Go one level deeper into the rack integrators that do the work for Dell. TSSI is a good one, very undervalued in my opinion
still being above 0? that's weak
I always say that if I ever yolo options and win I am immediately transferring my profits out and starting back at what I started with to see if I am just lucky or regarded. If I won like that again then I'd gamble with that...but we all know I'd probably just get caught up like everyone else and be right back at sucking dirt off the floor at wendys for a few pennies to gamble.
exactly rich people playing with money and sometimes bragging and lying should never influence you to lose your life with this shit
Thank you for curing my ‚Äúshit I should trade options again‚Äù impulsiveness with one link lol. Already lost like 5k a few years back (not a huge deal, went in knowing I was gambling and I could afford to lose) but every once in a while I see a post like the OP and get the itch to try again. Some good loss porn to counterbalance that is just what the doctor ordered.
Lol it was a pure guess
This dude‚Äôs portfolio history is a fucking roller coaster ride
So he previously lost 800k on GameStop (looks like in one day). What does this guy do for a living?
Ouch
Keep that in mind when you get FOMO from all this gain porn. These guys are making risky plays, so while they‚Äôve gained a lot, they‚Äôve also probably lost a lot at some point
No because that 950k came from 200.
[Just like how a "Wendy's is calling" type post is usually near the top of any loss post](https://youtu.be/UZT28O9-wZ8?t=1379).
To avoid suspicions OP bought April calls yet posts it in WSB ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Would his wife‚Äôs boyfriend be considered inside-her trading?
Thought that same thing
They had a massive jump today of 30% but even then they still have tripled in price over the last 365 days.

That's crazy
If my friends worked at a public company they better give me insider information ü•∞
OP looked out the window and saw the pizza delivery guy roll up with 35 boxes outside the Dell HQ
Plausible, but incorrect. I work in a startup unaffiliated with Dell.
Well Barron‚Äôs released an article last week on Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani‚Äôs predictions and assessment of Dells earnings announcements and was highly and confidently bullish. I think anyone who read that article would‚Äôve done the same as OP
Yup. Infinity money mode.
Toss me whatever info you got and let's find out.
He ain't trifling, we know that.
OP is one trade away from 1 million, don't quit now ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)
this feels like a personal attack
he went from 30 million pennies, to .0003 billion dollars
I‚Äôve never seen a billion broken down like this it just changed my perspective
0.0000003 Trillion
Me. I'm people.
Isn‚Äôt it zero sum? So for this person‚Äôs gain from $3K to $300k there‚Äôs 100 people that lost $3K
(or some other factor?)
Yes I am those people, went from $250 to $5200 on 1 option play, then tried what op did (3k - 50k ) and lost it all, then some more on other options, down to $75 ...
F*#@& inggg options, still trade them trying to go for "safer" longer expiry.
I had Step 2, but not Step 1, so I made like $500 yesterday between DELL, NTAP, and CC.

DELL also tends to do this on earnings, so a reasonable gamble with money you well and truly don‚Äôt need.
Weren't you at 50k last week? Now you're at 300k? Are you just all ining on every play?
Cash out bro, take 250k and invest in a long term portfolio. You could use 50k to gamble on options
But you turned $200 - $600k.. not luck, SKILL because it happened twice
And‚Ä¶ wait for it‚Ä¶ inside info
What would your downside have been?

Edit: I don't really understand options. Since this is a call, my understanding is that the most he stood to lose was $3,000.

But in order to know how good this decision was, I'm wondering is this it? He just made that 1 bet and it paid off? There aren't other losing bets? 

Does the screenshot show the P&L for the whole portfolio or just that one trade?
What is your next move?
[deleted]
More like green. Red and black in my opinion is lose some or lose all.
You know dell had earnings yesterday?

Earnings plays are kind of a big thing around here.
I mean there was a talk about dell selling server racks for nvidia cards, same reason super microcomputer was up, im just too stupid to have missed that they had earnings this week
A true regard
*Google*
You don‚Äôt know what a call option is do you? :3
YOLO the 300k and leverage it 100x
Imagine YOLOing that 300K into COST Calls for next week.... OP could retire.
No he didn‚Äôt, the 20% is so he gonna lose it all and deduct it from his capital gains ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I've been into stocks for a while, learning on YT. Been seeing all the gains on here for years, but because of being in the UK I never thought I could trade options, but there's a few brokers that offer it now. 

I made 5.2k off my first Nvidia paper trade on their earnings last week, that worked so thought fuck it.

First ones free I've seen, tho lol. Pure luck.
Shut up your fat pig üêñ

>Do some trial runs first or don't and post your losses for us to laugh at

I don't want to see a bunch of $500 losses cluttering up my feed.
But isn‚Äôt it that the longer out the date is the less it‚Äôs worth?
Better outcome than the lotto.
As a business major, don't trust a business major lmao
you went from $600 to $300k? just playing options? how much time is that?
Honestly, it is luck but I wanna say your intuition really carried you as well. Solid read.
Dell is incorporating AI, that‚Äôs why
Lmao I didn‚Äôt even notice that. I used text to voice, raging cause I blew up my account yesterday going short right before one of the the best days to go long of the year
Glad to be the poster boy.
How do you know I'm not already wearing one?
Keep those losses rolling forward for a lifetime lol
Op will probably wash sale it and end up needing to pay 100k in taxes while only having 3k in the account
Nah‚Ä¶ that move will happen Jan 1, 2025. Owe all the money for 2024 but have none of it. This is the way.
Imagine if this was a Roth lmao
This guy maths
Over 200k$ single or 400k$ married and you will have to pay the fiddler for your dance!
Much funnier if OP loses it next tax year.
You can lose bigger still, go negative
If that's all it takes

I get the impression that HPE spends a lot of money on stupid shit hoping it becomes the next big thing while mostly coasting on their intel server hardware business. Meanwhile Dell just kind of rolls on being Dell and doesn‚Äôt try to innovate the next big thing, but instead says ‚Äúpeople seem to really like this shit here, so we‚Äôll do that‚Äù.
No kidding. My dumb shares are bouncing around $15.
Go negative and remove the sign that's how you win
With them naked short calls he should count himself lucky that he's not under there already lol

Like sure you can post how you went from 3k to 300k just like that. But in reality you've lost a shit load of money when you could've just sat on your ass and be up 50-100% with safe investments.
But that 200 came from 20,000

Way to ruin the fun OP
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
Curious how you made this call? Do you follow certain stock news or was ER a big play?
Ya we know üòè
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
You are correct. That used to be someone else's money.
onerous hungry illegal close stocking toy jobless hard-to-find one observation
Basically that‚Äôs what OP did.  Turned the 3k into 50k.  Most would walk away but he YOLO it into more options.  Got lucky as the wheel hit black again and now he walks away with $300k.  Once again he got very lucky.  But he‚Äôs also going to pay a bunch of tax on it since it‚Äôs tax at regular income tax rates.
Yes. But I‚Äôm done now. Takes too much focus. Maybe I‚Äôll be back later in the year
It's like betting $10,000 on black at a roulette table. If you win, great. If you don't, try again but bet $20,000, if you win, great. If you don't, try again but bet $40,000, etc.

You'll end up broke or ahead but either way there'll be a massive swing
Now let's see if he turns 300k back to 3k
Lol bout on par to hear in this sub
Ty üôè¬†
It was lucky for him to have that insider info!
People love to act live options are some super complex instrument you can never understand. It‚Äôs really fucking simple.

I have 100 shares of Apple, worth $100 each. In total, I have $10,000 of stock.

You think Apple will go up up. You‚Äôd like to make as much money as you can off this move, but you only have $100.

You can buy 1 share of Apple, and wait a day, then sell at $101 and make $1 profit.

Or, you can buy a option contract to make a more leveraged bet to try to make more profit.

In this scenario, instead of you purchasing the shares, I agree I will loan them to you for the day. For this service, I will charge you all of your $100, but for this day, you temporarily hold 100 shares instead of one.

When you make this purchase, you will have to specify a price you think the shares will end the day at. For this example, we‚Äôll just use $100, as you think the stock will go up from here.

If Apple has a great day and goes to $102, I have now made (102-100)*100 = $200.

We have to remember that you paid $100 for this service, so I walk away with $100 in profit.

So instead of buying shares and making $2 on this move, your call option has generated x50 the return.

On the flip side, if Apple doesn‚Äôt reach the price you thought it would, the contract will be voided, and I keep your $100 and you get nothing.

So while your gains can be quite large, let‚Äôs say Apple ends the day down 1 cent at $99.99; your share would have lost you 1 cent, your options contract lost you your entire portfolio.

Congrats, you now understand call options.

This is basically an ELI5 and is leaving out some of the intricacies, but if you understand this, you understand the idea behind options.
If you don't understand options then the only thing you need to understand is to not touch them until you understand them.

OP got extremely lucky. He'll walk away with a tad over $170k.
The whole portfolio.
If you turn 3000 into 50000 and then lose the 50000, is the downside losing the 3000 or the 50000? people think differently here.
>But in order to know how good this decision was, I'm wondering is this it?

This decision wasn't good, it just happened to pay off. A good outcome does not mean the decision that led to it was good.
I think they might be referring to earnings plays
Yeah but Dell? When the fuck has Dell been relevant? Idk.

It‚Äôs the opposite. The longer out the date is, the more it‚Äôs worth because the underlying stock has more time to go up or down.
Same outcome. Even if they win they will blow all their money and end up homeless.¬†
3k for life baby
This is the way
I don‚Äôt think you know how wash sales work. Only way would be for him to maintain gains through 2024, pay taxes accordingly, then lose it all in 2025 and be unable to offset as he‚Äôll never make a dime again.¬†
What does a wash sale mean? Fully regarded
This happened to me a  long time ago. I had big gains being long interest rate future spreads (TBills), and had big gains through Dec. 31, then got smacked in January when the Fed raised interest rates more than expected. I had to pay taxes on the gains to Dec. 31st, even though I had lost much of it in January, so I had to cash in my account to pay the taxes and was unable to trade for a year. Trading is hard enough, but then when you add in the tax issues it can really get tough. 

Same thing with stocks as we all know - you have to pay taxes on your gains, but can only deduct 3k of the losses. So, the idea is to force traders to NOT trade. The government should just tax all trading on a mark to market basis and all gains and losses are tallied up at the end of the year. Your tax return shouldn't look like a phone book. The wash sale rule is another anti trading rule. It just complicates everything for no reason. The income tax code is a huge mess. I run into this every year at tax time along with all other traders. Looking back at my trading if I had just held onto all of my stocks and never sold I would have been better off.
Now that‚Äôs just GOD level trading‚Ä¶

I would say love you but I need my tendies to cash out first
I need someone to ponder my orbs. With $300k, I think I could hook that up.
Aruba probably makes almost as much as HPE's non HPC stuff.
Same. Been a bag holder for HPE and this damn thing is hovering around $14-18.
That's not how that works. Somehow I make shit load of fake money. And for some reason it doesn't translate when using real money.
thats a bad idea, if the bet makes money itll just increase fomo. if it fails, ull be like ok i get a free shot at doing another play, surely it wont lose two in a row. thats just how i think at least

and yes im addicted to gambling, how did you know?
I was about to say [don't read the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sf9159/game_stopd_player_2/huoffp9/) then

Going from $200 to $950k to $10k means you're still up $8800

Get a ~150k system engineer job for a major traded company, then you'll see earnings reports a few days before floating around on sharepoint/fileshares/email servers highly protected before earnings calls. Spend a few years becoming the person responsible for those things and then abuse it
I just keep getting ‚Äúupdated employee policy‚Äù news for the company, and then I see the stock price fall. Great job, company.

The tax argument is so dumb to me. Would you rather not have made the 200k?

Is it possible to Gamble like this in Europe ?
so what youre saying is OP should YOLO one more time to have some extra money to pay taxes
He still has 300 days to lose all that money and pay no taxes
You know he's going to put 300k back in. Otherwise why is he even here?

Also I really need to learn puts and call and ask that shit
walk away? who said hes walking away?
Nah, he will YOLO 300k and join the crew tomorrow morning with a vertical head first dive into the red!
The first almost 20 bagger is insane. This number is bigger, but it's only a 6 bagger, and heck I've lucked into a couple of those (for very modest amounts because I lack testicular fortitude)

Not if he loses it this tax year!  Offset your cap gains with capital losses -- the WSB way!
See you on Monday!
yeah we need a 1k to 100k challenege. We will ride at dawn (or whenever you come back, i have you flaired now lol)
Just be sure to share the next play- before you do it next time ü§£
"This is super simple, you just (an entire essay)"

Tell me what letters to pick idiot
Can you clarify "So while your gains can be quite large, let‚Äôs say Apple ends the day down 1 cent at $99.99; your share would have lost you 1 cent, your options contract lost you your entire portfolio."? Sounded like the $100 was on the line, how the whole portfolio get involved?
Does this mean that others lost 300k to OP?
Dude, you know he's losing it in the next 9 months.
Nice. Yeah I'm not going near them.
How to learn them? Any good YouTube channels?
I'd break it down into two trades:

Trade 1 - downside is $3k

Trade 2 - downside is $50k
Yeah for UK brokers it's Plus500, and regarding YT channels, it's mainly been Pandrea Finance, who breaks things down like the Greeks and other things. Just use his videos to learn about option trading etc.

For my own strategy, it's market sentiment. Like I said in another comment, AI is booming now and they will need servers, data centres etc to make use of it all, and Dell is a market leader in that area and are well known. Also, things in my personal life, like I see all the people around me switching to PCs that use GPUs, and people using AI more and more just makes sense to trade these stocks. I also only really play around earning calls which is high risk high reward so don't play with anything you can't afford or be upset with loosing.
There's also a lot of pigs in the Wendy's dumpster what with all the baconaters so it checks out
Most who do play end up broke again, yes, but there are some who do manage it nicely and are living a great life. These are the ones that we don't get to hear about too much as the shock ( or scorn?) factor isn't there.
That doesn‚Äôt actually happen that often
I was wondering if we‚Äôre still saying that. It‚Äôs been a while and the last time I saw it‚Äî it was downvoted. I like it tho.

This is why I only trade with my Roth.

Well, that and because it's the only money I have.
As long as it is less than 297K, he should be fine
Oh you have to pay taxes on lottery winnings? Fuck that I‚Äôm out, I‚Äôd rather be living below the poverty line.
Poor dude üòî
This sub is dumb as hell. The "you have to pay taxes on it" argument is only valid for winning illiquid assets like cars or whatever. If you win a $50k car on a gameshow, you're now on the hook for ~$15k in taxes, which means you either have to have $15k cash or sell the car.

For options gambling gains it doesn't matter, because the gain is already liquid. Sure, the actual gain is X% less than the nominal amount, but it's still straight gain.

*As long as* you don't immediately tie 100% of your gain up in long term positions. But nobody turning $3k into $300k is holding long term positions anyway
>Also I really need to learn puts and call and ask that shit

Oh. Oh no.

IMO there's no "good" way of learning how to play short term calls. It's 95% luck and 5% not listening to good advice lol. 

Most people would have a better chance of making money by betting their life savings on a coin toss.

"Cover options" and "covered puts" are good things to bone up on if you don't mind going long and not expecting an 8000% return in 30 days.
Yes, and different people have wildly different feelings when involved in such trades. Some might go in perfectly fine burning $3000 but see $50k as life changing and get out, as they couldn‚Äôt bear to lose that. Other degenerates might not see $3000 or $50000 as enough to be happy so they keep going and if they lose it all some might be devastated, others not. So the downside is very relative to individual circumstances.
I would probably just take it somewhere and

To say my body is worth 300k is a very high exaggeration.  You're making me blush.

SMH has been great to me. Plan to hold it for a long while.
step two: federal prison
Also 150k does not buy shit in most big cities that have 150k jobs
Out of five companies I've worked for, three of them did not lock down their HR/Finance share.

I'd like to meet this supreme degen who is gambling in their Roth and shake their hand
You do know it‚Äôs bracketed and not the full 37% on the full 300
He should be paying way less than 37% federal. Only 30% of his 
gains will even be taxed at over 30% and none at 37%
Depends what his salary his. Only a portion of it will get nailed at 37%.
It's still money he didn't have.
Maybe if hes in cali? Bro doesnt even hit the fed rate for 37%
I mean....you didn't have have money to begin with, 

I'd be happy to pay those taxes. Even if it's half I didn't have 150k before That's basically free money.
He will never recover‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs a sad story tbh.
hahaha
I got more than 300k invested in my body in just beer and burgers.
Puts on this guy‚Äôs body
What about your anus?
Not if you're single and no kids. Then you can live pretty comfortably. If you have a family to support and you're in San Francisco, then rip.
Because hospitals have little incentive to give a shit. HIPAA is a toothless joke. You can only sue for released information if you can prove damages, as though the information being out isn't itself damaging. 

I'm pretty sure the credit company was covered the same when all our information got leaked/hacked: you could only go at them if you could prove damages. Like someone having our SSN and all our personal information couldn't damage us in 20 years, or we have any option at all not to use them. But hey, they got 'fined' whatever that means anymore. Pay the government for breaches of citizen information? How is that balanced? 

I think we're living in the comedy timeline.
I took my IRA from 15k to 300k with a certain meme stock a few years ago but now it‚Äôs all vti and chill
Just set up a second Roth for your tax-free degen gambling, and keep the first one for responsible gambling.

I have a Roth that is 100% in BTC.
I gamble with my Roth. It's my 401k I don't fuck with.
I gambled away my entire Roth last year. Only had $20k in it but still. Was a lot to me.
Pretty common tactic considering the tax advantage
hello it is i, the roth gambler
Trust me, they do it, met a truck driver who worked for fed-ex who was allowed to selve direct his 401k, him and his father traded away a million dollar 401k with bad stock choices.
didnt think you could do options in Roth.
I do all my wildest gambling on my Roth account lol.
I mean he only bet 3k in this case.
of course he does. he's just salty he isn't OP and is negging the play to make himself feel better
If your regular income already puts you in the 37% bracket, then additional income from stock casino gains will also be taxed at 37%.
Better to consume the burgers than let them expire worthless.
Similar story here, fuck paying taxes on absurd gains.
That's so annoying. Got proof?
üß¢üß¢üß¢üß¢
I definitely did the same (didn‚Äôt make near what you did though) with my Roth.  Funded part of it and Yolo‚Äôd,
Paid off well.
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre serious or not, but this is dumb as fuck...

Roths have a contribution limit. Putting 7k in one Roth, or 3.5k into two roths, it makes zero difference. Just put it all in one account and allocate 50% of it to BTC.
37% kicks in at 609K for single filers. He ain't paying anything at 37% unless his luck at the wheel continues
Someone single making $578K a year isn‚Äôt starting with $3K, or married and 693K.
Well I'm not rubbing them on my body while throwing glitter in a river
11 hours later and homie didn't show any proof lol.
And he could just photo shop a screen shot like 95% of people online trying to brag
Yeah it took me from ‚Äúyou‚Äôre never going to retire‚Äù to ‚Äúif you still save aggressively you might be ok‚Äù. I‚Äôll take it.
Allow me to introduce you to the [backdoor Roth](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/backdoor-roth-ira) and [mega backdoor Roth](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/mega-backdoor-roth), which let you contribute over $20k. I make too much to contribute directly to a Roth in any amount anyway.

The goal of separate accounts is to put a stronger barrier between different types of investing. It's a lot easier to keep one account in a balanced 3-fund if there isn't also wild crypto swings in that same account.
Starting with $3k is different than "allocating $3k to degenerate gambling"
You all scammed me with this halving nonsense
I bought my bitcoins 2 years ago now because everyone promised me that once this magical date hits in 2024, April 20, the halving would ensue, causing another skyrocket bull run and I would be filthy rich. It's been almost a week now and so far my portfolio is DOWN this week.
I will be collecting the most notable usernames from this subreddit and taking legal action for giving me poor financial advice and wasting 2 years of my life looking at a silly graph. I will be selling ALL of my bitcoins so I won't be scammed any further by the rest of you. The other redditors warned me about evil cryptocurrency and its scams on the front page every single day, I should have listened
Please include me in the lawsuit for no reason, thanks.
WE GOT 'IM BOYS!!

Could I interest you in the merits of a Dog themed token? ;)
Damn, up until now I thought the best place to find sound financial advice was from strangers on the internet.
It only works if you title your post ‚Äòwen moon‚Äô
historically the skyrocket comes about 6 months to a year after the halving.  the price shoots up bc of all the hype of the halving then it happens and nothing really happens so ppl panic and sell.  Then, like 9 months later, the supply of all the bitcoins the miners hoarded starts to dry up.  All of a sudden theres a huge jump in price bc there just aren't as many bitcoins for sale.  This causes the general public and big hedge funs to FOMO and the price goes crazy high.  It's happened pretty much every halving since like 2013
Haha....hahaha....hahahaha...hmmm..hehe...hahahahahahahahahaha....HAHA..HAHAHA......hmmmm üòå
Quality shit post. I approve! Include me in the lawsuit too
I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I haven‚Äôt noticed the flag at first.
You obviously have faulty bitcoin. Just DM me your wallet recovery phase, and I'll fix them for you.   Sorry for the inconvenience.
Sir, I am the sales manager of Bitcoin. Your price is down because you have hackers in your wallet. Kindly send me your wallet informations and seed phrase or password and I will be happy to remove hackers and malware free of charge.
We do not throw away perfectly good crypto in this house. We put it in Tupperware to store it long term, and then when it‚Äôs disgusting and we‚Äôve all been scammed, then we throw it away.

What are we your emotional support animals? Just shut up and hold your coins.¬†
But if you sell now you‚Äôll just buy back in at 120k tomorrow when it pumps
I'll take your bitcoins if u dont want em, I could give you a lollipop in return?
He sold. Pamp it.
You purchased at less than $40k two years ago? Now, it is at $65k.
HA GOT' EM
You bought at 25k ... and this happened. Sorry for your 'loss'
Sensible my good man! Of course, THESE Bitcoin houligans and roustabouts have swindled you with their devilish schemes! Sell immediately and we shall move your hard earned money into a much more promising venture: ShibPepeTrillCoin (SHIT) which is the REAL Billion-dollar crypto!

I've got the next big thing to recommend to you. Ever heard of FTX or Celsius? Well....
Make sure you make special note of u/ligmaballsack.
No it never rockets near the halving. In 2020 the halving was on May 11th 2020. The rocket ship took off September 2020. 
It might be different this time because of the ETF it might be the rocket ship took off before the halving.
OP did you know 99% of gamblers quit just before winning ?!?!?
Dude. Historically a bull run happens months after the halving. Take a schill pill
I'll give you tree fiddy for those useless bitcoins

The halving means nothing. It‚Äôs just something newbies and moonbois get excited about.
Also nobody  will be taking legal action for anything including you . This whole post is ridiculous and you should delete it

ü§£üíÄü§£üíÄü§£ patience padawan
Every  halving is different... hang in there.  sell now, you're making a mistake
Historically speaking. every massive BTC bull run that's happened post halving, has happened several months  after the halving.

So at least historically speaking it doesn't start the moment the halving date arrives. You waited a few months. In fact, every post halving in history since 2008, as soon as the halving occurred, bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market dropped for a few months. Then it skyrocketed later.
Bro Bitcoin never skyrockets immediately following the halving, it is usually months afterwards. Plus Bitcoin is already up over 3x
Are you stupid or is this a joke lol
just remember the only strategy that has worked with bicoin gains to-date without fail,...has been to simply hold and wait. if you find this instruction to complicated to follow than perhaps any investment entry and exit you choose is like to fail.
This is the best thing on the internet.
comedy that illustrates well why/how so many who are in a hurry have a fundamental misunderstanding about Bitcoin and what makes it different than any other coin & token asset.

also why it's important to READ & pay attention to the details in educational articles & videos..and of course, the BTC whitepaper & the halving, tokenomics + healthy crypto safety & security practices. 

and to never rely on information in a forum BECAUSE though many get things right, far too many get it wrong, spreading misinformation or in some cases, deliberate. *MIS-*information.

all should be studied well and  *before* buying into Bitcoin. otherwise anyone not understanding it properly can lose funds due to a lack of knowledge & carelessness. 

Bitcoin is a once in a lifetime opportunity among many opportunities - some that might be good ones but they don't even come close to what Bitcoin offers, long term. and all good & decent human beings deserve a real chance to get out from under the albatross that is the DEBT BASED, centralized government fiat currency system that will never recover from the weight of its own disastrous & deliberate structuring:

Bitcoin CEO isn't gonna be happy about this
Well if you would have listened you should know that the real bullrun only starts about half a year after the halving, like it did the last 3 times. :)
*You‚Äôre* upset? Imagine my surprise upon purchasing several bitcoins in anticipation of this so-called  ‚Äúhalving‚Äù, only to find out that hodlers will not be receiving two for every on bitcoin. 

I am presently drafting a sternly worded letter to one Mr. Satoshi at Bitcoin headquarters, and my references to your nattering lot will be most unflattering. Does anyone know where I should send the letter?

At least I have the security of my several hundred thousand Shiba Inu coins with which I plan to retire.
You should sue the CEO of Bitcoin, too.
So which part of this is satire exactly?
You write this as comedy but it‚Äôs really just sad because no value is being created. Every dollar you ‚Äùmake‚Äù is someone elses loss. It is a scam that a lot of you are in on because you either don‚Äôt care that other people lose their money or because you lack basic knowledge of economics. Or both.
Crypto bros loading up on coins to sell once prices pump after halving. Only to realise there is no one buying because they all loaded up going in!

Lol
1 week into the halving and this guy is bearish ü§£ you ain‚Äôt cut out for crypto bro. Most of us are in this for another 6-12 months
Comedy flair. Yote.
OP, look at every halving cycle‚Äîprice stagnates for 30-90 days and then takes off. Just keep stacking and stop posting nonsense, you‚Äôre better than this.

ThisNameDoesntCheck bought?  Dump it.  Rest in wage slavery.
Remindme! 6 months
It was already priced in dude
I always wondered why Satoshi didn't code in the price when the halving happens. He could easily just code it in, but no, leave it up to retail...
sit
Karen ‚Ä¶ Is that you? Do you also want to speak to Bitcoin‚Äôs manager?
You seem to have forgotten the first rule of cryptocurrency: Nobody knows shit about fuck.
Live and learn.  The entire point of crypto is to take other people money.  If you can convince everybody else that the price is going to rise on a certain date, then you can take all of their money.
Thanks for playing!
Did you miss the promised rapture also? That‚Äôs terrible.
So you were in the game two years and only decided to buy at the tops? Nice, you earned your spot on crypto reddit
Hahaha get rekt
Lol it's never gone up after the halving...always dips because miners stop being profitable as rewards are cut in half and hash rate dips. Supply shock takes months. Also if you bought 2 years ago, you didn't buy for the halving.
It's the months after that matter. You just need to do research and be patient
This is the biggest troll

Its still 17 months left until we actually see the full effect of the halvening, according to my calcs
Sell everything now before you lose more. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Shoulda listened to that guy that set himself on fire recently. He seemed to really have it figured out.
I feel sorry for you but I can't blame you. Trading is emotionally stressful and that contributes to the way youre acting now. I myself scared of trading because I keep on losing money. So I stopped even if the reward is great. Don't trade money that you're afraid to lose. Crypto is a dangerous world but it gives good rewards. I hope you find solemn soon.
LOLZ
I just wanted to see my icon, lol.
Whaaaaaaaambulance. Everyone else's fault except you right? Douche.
Jeez, you took advice from people on the internet, I hope this is satire.
Well it did happen. I just missed it hoping for better. It hit $100k CAD
Don't worry, if you don't want your Bitcoin, you can give it to me üëç
Just sell it take the money and buy some coka cola
I'll buy your coins for $100!¬† My offer only stands 24h, after that, they'll probably hit zero.
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre telling the truth, but if you are‚Ä¶

You are a true idiot.

This post will not age well.

Imagine buying 2 Bitcoin off word of mouth and not understanding how it works.
I know this is a shitpost, but 2 years ago today btc was at $40k and the low around that time was $37k. Anyone who bought then would still be in the green.
Almost all of the bitcoins are alright profuced having don‚Äôt mean much at all who cares not me, you would think the halving would make bitcoin mining stocks tank!!!!‚Äônn  as they produce half what they just did
See you at the Wendys dumpster!!!¬† Hahahahaha!
ü§£ this has a to be a joke
Sir please get checked for Lethargatism
You needed to buy 69 coins for the halving on April 20.
Find a cliff, you‚Äôll know what to do next‚Ä¶.
Wow‚Ä¶just wow
Don't you know pump it up
sell the news event
You misread the earlier posts.  The value gets cut in half after the halvening.
We are about to pump boys, I'm tracking his wallet, then imma buy a billion worth. Let's GGGGOOOOOOO!!!
Is this a joke? Lololol.
Nobody knows nuttin
hookers and coke.

Scam? The whole crypto thing is a scam. The networks are slower than fiat, have higher fees for every transaction than fiat, and offer less protections than banks do for errors and fraud. 

What could POSSIBLY go wrong investing in crypto?

Sir this is Wendy‚Äôs !
Wish I could invest in lawsuits. They‚Äôre so hot right now.
Yes, yes, Let the hate flow through you
I have a question, what's the logic about a pump after the halving? Scarcity?
Now you know why all the whales moved their millions to Coinbase‚Ä¶

Don't worry. You alive and can make millions instantaneously. Do not think you are limited to what they have for you. You will break this matriX.
Oh shit that sucks dude ever try thinking for yourself and knowing the time to buy was 18 months ago?
Where‚Äôs Lambo !?
No onions on my whopper.
So you had great patience for 2 years‚Ä¶. And now within a week of the halving you can‚Äôt take it???

Haha you fool! We're all paid actors! Thanks for your money nerd!
Hah ha
What a bitch.
Bro historically the peak doesn't happen for nearly 2 years after halving. Sure it will start to go up sooner than that but not this soon. Hold your horses do not sell until at least 2x
The years of investing in bitcoin and other crypto teach me to not follow the trends.

Buy when there is few articles about bitcoins and cripto in general and sell when everybody is talking about it, 4 years ago when it hit 60k  I started to get flooded with news and posts about it hitting 100k that year and some saying even more like 200k or 300k and I sold mine, then I kept investing here and there but the big chunk of my investing was 2years ago bitcoin was like 20-30k nobody talked about that so it was time to buy, sold them at like 63 when I started getting flooded with emails trying to convince me that it was time to invest bc of the halving.

The thing with dates is even cooler like when btc it was banned I think it was in china the price drop till the date of the ban after that date it got up. 

People expected to price drop after the ban so they sold them before lowering the price and when the date arrive and didn't afect anything (but was effecting in lowering the price slowly till that date) people started to buy again and the price got up. 


With the halving I think it was the same way but in inverse people were expecting prices to go up on the halving so they bought before making the prices go up but when nothing really happened in the date people that invested because of the halving seeing the prince drop sold them and the price dropped.
Did you do your own research? You need to do your own research. Most of the short term after the previous halving the price has gone down why would this be different?
BTC price is heading to half so what's the problem here?
Wahhh mommie! You ducking wanker!! If you can‚Äôt handle it, go cry in the corner
Bro ü§£
BTC is sitting at 62K, Im sitting great.

Halving just means miners have to work twice as hard to get the same amount of bitcoin rewarded.  It does not change the amount of bitcoin there is.  Halving causing a massive run up in value is nonsense
Just wait until the double halving this fall üëÄ

So you listen to the people telling you about scammers and how crypto is evil and you'll basically lose money, but then you disregard fhat info and think you're going to get filthy rich overnight basically. Maybe how about take some accountability in your life, no one MADE you do anything. It's your own fault. That's like the number 2 rule in crypto, don't listen to anyone, 99 percent of advice about crypto comes from someone whos a bag holder who lost money and is trying to raise the price by saying whatever they can to make that happen. Look at xrp. (Not all their fault cause of lawsuits but still. It's consistently above most other crypo for 24 hour volume yet it's barely the tip of the ice burg.)That or they are scammers. Two years is not a long time, but it is a long time to look at a chart and not learn anything. Maybe you should of learned about that chart and the indicators before you go bashing the chart. Some of us live and die by the chart so watch your mouth.
lol reeeeetaaaaarrrrd
Please hurry up and sell so we can Moon
Can I offer you an egg in these trying times?
I would love to hear a judge read the Reddit handles of those being sued.
Oh knowz it didn‚Äôt moon minutes after halving!!!
That's your fault. All you had to do was look at the prior halving dates to see if that was true or not. Which most of US knew. Don't know why you chose to believe someone without doing research.

You scammed yourself
Don't sell.. you will see that pump later in the year/ early next year. But halving date pump was always a load of bs
Hey I said Caveat Emptor. This is on you
Crypto investing is basically gambling but every once in a while, you get some information, whether it's trustworthy or not is also a gamble.

Right with ya good sir, I bought Bitcoin at about 70, and accidentally threw away my computer in a landfill.  The only computer I properly disposed of, cause it got the blue screen of death.  I am in the process of suing the landfill.  We should be friends.
yes that is tru, and now that you have made the scam public your Bitcoin is worthless but i can help you. Its worth noting that you have already incurred loss on your investment so I will be taking that fake internet currency from you and as a good man i am i will actually give you something in return.

Actually bitcoin sucks, there are better crypto for doing that, bitcoin was the starting point and an inspiration for others to create better crypto.
Bitcoin transactions are slower, the fees are gigantic, the mining system is outdated.

And then ethereum happened and it was better than bitcoin in every way.

And more coins appear that bringed some improvements in the system.

I belive in crypto and belive that somedsy we can all use crypto to buy goods in our everyday life, but that crypto as yet to arrive I think
Only a Bitcoiner could see a comedy post and then get on a soap box and start preaching BS about how Bitcoin is the only way.

It's not, it's an outdated, legacy tech, that has been surpassed by far more advanced and usable options.  It's basically only a shitcoin for fiat speculation at this point.  L1 is too slow and expensive, mining is unsustainable without huge price volatility that will make it impossible to use for anything in our lifetimes, LN is a centralised, custodial nightmare that's worse than regular banks.
In that case, don't add me
Bro, if you bought BTC 2 years ago then you already have your position in profit then why are you crying. And at what date did you buy and how much at what price.
Please sell at 58k, because that‚Äôs where I want it to start growing from.
Ah yes, the bogdanoff pump
Classic bait and switch. I love it! Let's do it.

He don't have it still I bet money. Crybaby crap and don't realize his story got debunked. Yes 2 years ago if he had any amount of a Bitcoin he is in the green period.

A tldr of what‚Äòs been happening on the market.
The sharp rise in the JPY/USD is causing a massive unwind of Yen carry trade positions and contributing to the sharp decline in US stocks. For those who do not understand how this works, a brief explanation

1. Many traders were borrowing Jap Yen (JPY) at low interest rates, converted them to USD and used this to buy US stocks

2. Now that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is raising interest rates, the JPY has strengthened significantly against the USD. 

Now, these traders are in big shit. Not only must they pay higher interest for the JPY they borrowed, they are now facing huge forex losses as well. The USD assets they are holding may not be enough to repay the JPY they have borrowed. 

3. This is causing a huge unwind of these trade positions. Traders facing big losses and margin calls are selling their US stocks to raise USD, converting back to JPY and paying back their loans. 

4. This can lead to more selling pressure on US stocks and even more declines in the short term.  Middle east war escalation, US political uncertainty is also adding to the fear and panic.

I don‚Äôt think this is accurate. What caused the recession was 1. Nana died 2. Grandson invested all her hard work in Intel.

Ohhhh... so this is on top of the "recession news" last week. Dammit all crisis start with multiple bullshit exploding at the same time.
I wish I could read, but nice post üëçüèª
So did these loans have adjustable rates or something?
Im going to japan next month. I need the yen to be weak AF
Conveniently, no one has heard anything about this until it becomes a complete shit show
Man, I graduated high school in 2008 with the recession in full swing and it traumatized the hell out of me. The area I lived in got absolutely decimated and you couldn‚Äôt even get a job at places like Walmart. It took me like 6 months just to get a job as a dishwasher at a fucking Ruby Tuesday back then. I‚Äôm terrified of going through that again with a kid of my own.
This is the information I feel MSM places used to provide. Now you gotta go to WSB to hear it, I make fun of us all but this is unparalleled quality you don't find elsewhere.
I can fix this.  I‚Äôll buy puts and the market will go up.
Warren Buffett is either a savant or was tipped off. I‚Äôm guessing the latter.

I saw this and started a long JPY/USD position of 80% FXY and the remainder OTM FXY calls. Was thinking about doubling that position a few weeks ago but only increased it by 20%.

Either way, it's been quite an effective hedge so far, gonna be up 75% or more today. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)

Edit: Good job on the breakdown btw. People don't understand there are asymmetrical trades like this all over the place. Long yen was kinda a no-brainer with rate cuts on the horizon.

Good post. In other words the rally in the mag7 was a casino bet by foreign investors. Their IOUs are being called in and they are selling to pay back the loans and vig. The whole rally this year was built on bullshit.
Fear? Panic? Sounds like buying signals to me
Really well explained. Also unemployment uptick last week and news of Warren selling half his Apple stake adds a bit more fear too. Though the impact of the carry trade is probably more direct
BANN

Too smart for WSB tbh
So what's the play?
Well said OP. Not selling anything, I actually think it‚Äôs time to buy. FIREEEEESAAAAAALLEEEE
Us catches a cold and the rest of the world get pneumonia
i would like to extend a sincere thanks to OP for breaking down this stuff for a lot of us who can tell that something is going sideways but just do not know exactly what. Thank you again OP.
The Japanese Government gross size of its balance sheet is $20 trillion or 505% of Japanese GDP!

In other words, Japan‚Äôs government is engaged in a GIANT $20 trillion ‚Äûcarry trade‚Äú -  the funding of loans and foreign assets by borrowing low-cost yen.

I‚Äôll wait until the sp500 falls below the 200 day moving average to panic. If it does, then we probably head lower
So tldr for non-tards : Late summer/early autumn holidays in Japan just turned expensive again?
You borrowed shoes from your Japanese friend (they said keep them as long as you like, they never wear them anymore). So you let your other friend borrow those shoes so you could borrow their handbag. You give that handbag to a different friend in return for their dress.

Now your Japanese friend wants their shoes back, and they said you need to pay them every day if you don‚Äôt return them. So now you have to unwind the process of lending and borrowing.
This is literally what JPow has been working for the past few years. Finally, the rate increases have slowed the economy. This is good. Imagine how fucking much the market will pump when rates are lowered
Basically it's a  BIG buying opportunity
Sir another Japanese Kamikaze jet has hit the Wall Street towers.
So did anyone short the Yen heavily, better than puts on QQQ and SPY today?

Reminds me of Liz truss business plan that was donks, and her former financial company had heavily shorted the pound next day and made fuck tons.
Short term panic in a nutshell
New to this, but does the Japanese central bank not signal the possibility of raising rates well ahead of actually doing it like the US Fed? The one article I Googled was from the AP and called the rate hike 'widely expected.' Are traders in deep shit you're describing borrowing Yen and then exchanging it without watching the news from the institution that can singlehandedly sink them?
So it isn't "Brandon's" fault like my neighbor claims?
Why didn't people do that with Turkish Lira?
Green by 10:30 (Tom Lee probably)
"many traders" were not so smart right?
Is there any concrete numbers on how much money has been borrowed that potentially has to unwind now?
"traders" are Japanese house wives aka Ms. Watanabe.  Japan is super fucked.

For me it looks like margin calls.

Look at the gold and bitcoin price. It really looks like someone need cash asap. 

Not because he want to jump on the train again.
Not a stock bro but let me get this straight.

A group of investors tried to game the system to make a larger profit utilizing a weaker currency, causing that currency's issuer to raise exchange rates against their own currency, closing the loophole and subsequently pushing the panicked investors to dump assets in order to recoup losses, ultimately gumming up the works in their own local exchange.

And these people aren't in legal trouble why?
I'm leaving for japan from the US tomorrow....the timing on the yen rising is unfortunate haha
BOJ are jerks for doing this 

Can we send Godzilla over to teach them a lesson??
>Now that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is raising interest rates, the JPY has strengthened significantly against the USD.

Didn't BOJ only raise their interest rate to something like 0.25%? When the market can be completely obliterated to the tune of trillions of dollars in losses because of a 0.25% interest rate, that could be a strong indication that something is rotten under the hood and the interest rate hike didn't cause it but only exposed it...
There have been so many indicators of a crash in the last few weeks, we've been in a massive bubble, this is absolutely not solely on Japan
Could have at least credited the tweet you stole this from ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)

Here it is in video form https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yyTAwkdsT_8
Wow so people working on wall street are true regards if they didn't do a covered carry trade
One more thing to add is the weak US economic and labor data released last week, sparking recession fears and accelerating the sell-off in the US markets. This further weakens the Dollar and strengthens the Yen.
I come to this sub to learn and lose money. Thanks OP.
An interest rate cut will save today and the next couple months but will exacerbate the next crash by a lot. They cut rates, people take on more debt. Makes the whole system even more fragile, 2 weeks from now people with narrative fallacy problems will write articles declaring "the panic was overblown 2 weeks ago" "everything is back to normal" volatility will go down, people will become blind again and then bam. Either take a 10-20% rout now or suffer a 50+% rout in the future.

yall think its better to Market sell at open for -10%  or wait a bit for the price to hit -5% to sell?
There's been plenty of movement of this magnitude in the JPN/USD over the years yet it was never responsible for something like this. The true explanation is the most overpriced bubble in history is finally popping

Right, but two details:

**Yen‚Äôs Minimal Rise:** The recent surge in the Japanese yen (JPY) is indeed quite modest. If you take a long-term view is pretty laughable. Probably for those involved in the carry trade it is huge. 

**Gold‚Äôs Decline:** Second, I‚Äôm puzzled about why gold is also dropping. Did they buy it with those JPY loans? And if that‚Äôs the case, where‚Äôs the money flowing? It doesn‚Äôt seem to be going into gold. Maybe bonds?
Wall Street these days is almost exclusively a bait and switch scheme by the rich to fleece the non-rich, and a Las Vegas style slot machine entity where the house wins more often than not, for everything else.
Time to buy with discounts
Just want to point out a few things
1. JPY/USD just went back to same rate 12 mths ago. 
2. BOJ interest rate is 0.25% vs 5.25% of Fed

OMG, JPY is so expensive, Japan interest rate is so  CRAZY high is just overblown. Market just looking for excuses to cool down.
August and September are historically the worst months in the markets.

It's been the case for a long time, actually. BoJ has held rates at near zero for decades, so big banks and hedge funds borrow in Japan for zero percent and buy up equities in the U.S. and Europe. Free money hack, right up until the exchange rate corrects and everyone gets torched. It's called the carry trade, and "carry trade reverses" is the headline you want to watch for as a leading indicator of real carnage in world financial markets.
Welcome the every economic crisis ever. Large investors/companies figure out they can game the system in some way then they repeatedly exploit it until it blows up in everyone's face.
The carry-trade is no joke; there‚Äôs a ton of money in the market being fueled by that ponzi party‚Ä¶ and the BoJ just announced that the party‚Äôs over.
Swiss national bank was outright buying them with freshly printed currency. Basicly 2008 never ended, it was just kick down the road.
Japan was taking one for the team for decades
Japan is the king of ZIRP. Matter of fact only until very recently in 2022 was their interest rate negative.
Masayoshi Son.
I have a hard time believing this post is correct.

The Yen is still worth less right now than it was at the start of the year, which was already worth less than it was at the start of 2023, which was worth less than it was at the start of 2022. From 2016-2022, the yen held pretty steady at 9/10ths of a penny.¬†

For this post to be correct, the economic downturn OP is claiming had to happen as a result of people taking massive financial gambles on the yen during a 6 month window in 2024.

This isn‚Äôt happening because the yen has strengthened, but because investors are anxious about a coming recession.¬†
What positions? Out of curiosity

You could try freelancing out behind the dumpster
Anyone who has been investing for more than 20 years has already seen worse than this twice, and both times it came back.  As long as you aren't in penny stocks and high risk companies this will pass.
There‚Äôs really no point to even paying attention to daily financial news if you are holding such longterm investments. Just invest in the general health of the US economy, because if that stops growing wealth is meaningless anyway.

Edit: this advice is coming from someone who stopped ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù after turning 7k into 40k into 0 with GME. I am unemployed and financially supported by my mother and the state. Do not listen to me
We‚Äôre all just remora fish, suction cupped to the bottom of whales, fighting for the scraps they can‚Äôt be bothered to chase after
the 401k is fucking tragic. It makes everyone cheer for and be dependent on relentless equity increases while being powerless to actually affect the market.

It creates massive political incentives to point to a big magic market number as a central point of a campaign even though 80 cents of every 100 cents in increase of that number goes to 1% of the population. Yet nonetheless, because "investing is retirement" is the **only** paradigm we have left, our whole economic policy gleefully revolves around making sure stocks only go up, regardless of how healthy that is
‚ÄúTime in the market beats timing the market.‚Äù

-Wayne Gretzky
My analogy is travelling in a row boat next to an oil tanker while holding a bucket to catch any drops of oil that may fall of the tanker.
Sure, I can empathize with that sentiment... But, when the whales start selling off, it's a massive BUY opportunity for us lower on the food chain. Because the market WILL bounce back, and if it doesn't, we have much bigger problems to worry about than investing money. I personally am looking forward to market open today, I've been saving up free cash for months to start buying dips!
No one really understands the market. Experts are wrong all the time. You could devote your life it understanding it and you'd still be left confused. We've experienced this (And worse) more than a few times in the last 20 years. It's a pattern that happens with how our economies function. Just don't be stupid and panic sell. If you're diversified, it always bounces back.
If you just have a 401k/IRA, I would recommend you dont check your portfolio daily/weekly/even monthly.  S&P 500 is still up 10% YTD, 15% 1 year, and 80% over 5 years.  And its only down 5% the past 5 days lol.  A big "meh."

Possible, but more-so it's because JPY has risen about 13% in the past month, while the assets they bought using JPY loans converted to USD didn't grow as much. So now they're in the hole on principal alone, let alone interest rates.
They're margin loans. The rates can change overnight.
It sucks knowing 1 to 160 was the rate last month. By the time I go next year it‚Äôs going to be back to 1 to 120 or some shit.

You should maybe start buying yen now. I just came home from Japan, and had bought most of what I needed for my trip in advance through Revolut. That way I already had a budget and wasn't affected when the yen price started climbing.¬†
Exchange yen when we get the correction later this week. Don't delay because the yen strengthening has just begun.
Luckily I exchanged 5k from USD to Yen a couple of months ago in preparation of a Japan trip. Looks like it was the only good decision Ive made last couple of months.

Relatively speaking the exchange rate is still pretty good - ten years ago it was around 80 yen / 1 dollar, now it‚Äôs 140.  You can still get a great meal there for less than what you would pay for a shit meal in the US.
Excellent A+
This is true but when to start? Could be 20T that needs to unwind. We have a ways to go
shorting the yen definitely would not have provided the same level of return as buying QQQ/SPY puts last week.

I'd even guess buying 30dte QQQ puts when it broke $500 probably is looking like a 20-30x at open since we've moved all the way down to $430 in a single month which is absurd
What part of this makes you think that shorting the Yen is a good idea?

There is another factor a lot are not talking about. Usdjpy get like a 5% interest. So if usd appreciate.. u get both appreciation plus the carry trade interest. Forex give you msrgin of 100x. 1000. Can hold a value of 100k. 1 billion cam hold a value of 1 trillion... x interes plus appreciation... so alot of big player are leveraged and hold billions and trillions of position. Now the currency is losing value. Everyone need to run to keep their winnings, or worse.. lose a lot of money. So all those billions and trillions of position are running for the exit.

You could have said this for the last 15 years
It‚Äôs just the spark
Everyone knew BOJ was doing currency intervention and everyone was 1000% sure the FED would signal rate cuts. End of the carry trade has been telegraphed for many months.
because there is currency risk.. usdjpy went down 12% which means the 100 usd loan you took out in yen is now a liability worth 112 usd
prices have gotten to expensive for the japanese with all the yen devaluating, especially oil prices have soared

I remember looking up capital flows into and out of Australia (my home country) some time back around 2010 to 2011. All the talking heads kept banging on about imports / exports and their impact on exchange rate, but at the time, imports / exports accounted for something like 5% of capital flows into and out of Australia. The other 95% was pretty much all carry traders. (our interest rate was significantly higher than the US at the time)

Pretty much the last haven for low interest money so they ran to it and pumped AI.
This could be true though if leverage slowly started trickling/building in Japan over the last couple of years. For example, most central banks dropped rates during COVID, so you could take your pick where you wanted to borrow. But if Japan was the last one and starts raising (particularly because they were negative or at the zero bound) - 0% to any number above 0% has consequences and becomes a significant cost. 

So even if we haven't actually seen the consequences move through the real economy or markets yet, the point is that everything needs to move now because sentiment has shifted. 

If you either need to shift significant amounts of money to other places OR determine you need to reduce your leverage which reduces funds worldwide - that brings everything down. 

Couple that with recession fears, and traders are moving fast.

True but I also kinda think my grandma was right when she said to not trust banks and put it all in a mattress or hide it in the walls. Maybe gold and land are the things I‚Äôm buying if I survive this latest crash.¬†
Actually I would say there is a point. Pay attention and recalculate your budget. Can you exercise your saving muscle right now? Delay some gratification and put more money into the retirement fund because we are being offered a sale right now. Might be worth it to bump up the contributions temporarily. Your discretionary spending and entertainment can be buying more into low cost index funds üòÖ

Correct. I always say it's the 401K shell game, coupled with insurance being tied to employment for some reason. People stay in soul-sucking jobs just for the insurance. When did this start?

Now imagine you have a 529 and your kid is starting college this year.
My brain will always go back to that Nintendo conference call where people were demanding to know why Nintendo wasn't implementing microtransactions to let Mario jump higher and run faster, and that they should lower Mario's default jump height to incentivize those microtransactions.

And they were doing everything they could to not outright say, "Because that would make for an awful video game and destroy the value of our brand."

I remember having an argument with a coworker years ago where he - as a very vocal libertarian - said that there was no difference between profit and value.  And I was asking him "well what if a choice that provides short term profit destroys long term value in the company because customers don't trust the company anymore?"  And they just refused to admit that's even a thing.  For them, their ability to just sell and buy something else was all that mattered.

Bear in mind I'm about as financially literate as a cantelope.  But it occurs to me that when investors can just dip in and out on a whim, and then they get leverage over decision making at a company, they have... zero incentive to care about the long term health of an investment.  They just want arrow go up.  Even if there's no reason that it should (between major product releases, retaining talent they can't get back because they'll need it soon even if not right now, etc), they just want big number go bigger.

Never been an investor of any significance, but from the outside I just don't see how that's healthy.
Pensions were always the same thing with just extra steps. Steps that proved to be quite vulnerable to risk outside the pensioners control. Like the company going tits up or the mob emptying the fund completely. The pensions also depended on sound investments to stay solvent.  

At least the individual has control over their money within a decent 401K. Including the ability to change jobs.
You do know you can liquidate your positions in your 401k, or at least rebalance them? Not getting rid of your 401k, just moving it into safer options. I did so on Friday, I'm not waiting to find out what the bottom is. I'd rather risk buying in where I was on Friday, than praying it comes back over the next two/three years.¬†


But whatever you do, keep putting money towards it, didn't stop that, the lower the stocks go, the cheaper you're buying them up for.¬†

Pardon my ignorance, but could the recession talk just be us finally realizing we've been in a recession for a little while now? I know we've seen positive GDP these last few quarters but the labor market is feeling a bit like a recession and other major western countries like the UK/Japan/Germany have admitted they were/are in a recession like a year ago iirc
It also cultivates a culture of people planning for, and then subsequently hoping for such a thing to come true.  They then work to convince others, and those others will work to convince others, each hoping with enough people piled on, the prophecy will eventually self-fulfill.
It has been brewing for 2,000 years. Look at the oil price. 

It is not spiking, so no expectation of disruptions to the supply.

It is also not collapsing, so no evidence of collapsing demand.

Wait 80 years for Japan to do it again.
Because I became interested in international, USD based trades back in late 2022 and opened an account to make a mini diversified Japanese portfolio. the thesis was that Nekkei was oversold and JPY/USD was out of balance, so it was an asym trade. I ended up earning 70% on a portfolio of MZDAY, TKGSY, JPAY, NPSCY and NTDOY (nintendo was the worst of the 5, sold it flat.

After that trade, I wanted to get direct exposure on another JPY/USD trade, so I watched it and read about the Japanese economy. It's super interesting, because they've actually been positioning to ENCOURAGE inflation during the economic downturn. Long story short, i entered and exited a few positions as JPY continued tanking, and opened a 5% of portfolio position 3 months ago. It had to bottom, and the BOJ was floating some interest in intervening, which would be the trigger for JPY shorts to unravel. When they did start unraveling in mid July, I had a hunch that this was it, and that's when I added an aditional 20% to the position in FXY OTM options.  

Long short of it all: be curious and explore things you don't understand. Ideas will come to you.
Japan has been handing out huge piles of free Monopoly money to rich gaijin to invest in equities and treasures for many years.  Now they say ‚Äúfuck you gaijin, no more free Monopoly money‚Äù and big hedge funds are big mad.

The uncontrollable, all consuming burn won't really kick off until after the election.
Just like how everyone was 100% certain the Fed would cut rates three times in 2024 right?
I think it was more the BoJ raising rates than the currency intervention.  They did a similar intervention back in April and the market didn‚Äôt care.

Holy smoke... thanks man
You buy puts when you hear that japan is raising rates. You're way too late now
If you're not one of the chosen few that has access to the cheap money hack, it's very difficult to take advantage of it directly. But the carry trade tends to reverse when exchange rates move, so if you see the yen rise against the dollar, that's potentially a leading indicator of trouble in U.S. markets. And if you see the magic words "carry trade unwind" show up in the business news, that's a flashing red light to get out of the way of the markets.
That's the thing, the average Joe can't. Big boys trade only. Have to have either a specialist broker who will give access to Japan or a literal presence there.

Conversely, local Japanese investors actually can do the trade fairly easily by just buying U.S. stocks or bonds on margin; with local margin rates close to zero, it feels like easy money. But they're also the first to get burned when the exchange rate goes against them and they get a call from their broker.
Because you're on this sub

This could get worse. I started investing in 2019 and if we are headed for a recession then I‚Äôd say 30-40% isn‚Äôt off the table. The historical average is 37%

Insurance being tied to employment tethers people to shitty jobs. If they had a public option, I imagine you would have a lot more entrepreneurs, small businesses, and people working essentially the same job, but on a 1099 instead of a W2. Our society doesn't want an empowered workforce, so they chain you to a desk by saying you'll risk financial ruin if you leave.
Literally - imagine trying to survive on just Social Security these days.
> But it occurs to me that when investors can just dip in and out on a whim, and then they get leverage over decision making at a company, they have... zero incentive to care about the long term health of an investment. They just want arrow go up

Yeah pretty much this... its, yes, maybe a little more complicated than *just* liquidity and velocity of equity acquisition and sales, but right now we're very much in a tight spiral of everyone trying to sell to everyone at a higher value, rather than actually "invest" over time.
You underestimate how difficult companies make this for the avg person. They switch providers constantly, new passwords, unfriendly UI, it‚Äôs not as easy as you make it seem. 90% of 401k holders never change the default settings. Even the inventors of the 401k admit that allowing companies to replaces pensions with 401k match was one of the worst things to happen to the working class in history.
you have missed my point by an astoundingly large margin.
When the covid crash took its first turn I debated it and everyone else had an attitude of yeah but itll rise back. I still wish I had done it.
We have nothing to fear, except a margin call from fear itself.
I don‚Äôt see you at the back of the dumpster sir
I‚Äôm going out on a limb here but I‚Äôm starting to think that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs rich and we‚Äôre not.
Now companies see a recession coming and can use it  as justification for yet more job cuts.  'Being mindful' and axing whole departments that aren't generating enough.  Still profitable, just not enough.  Then recession becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.  Keep burning those mountains of AI cash though.
Idk about the rest of yall, but I've been in a recession since covid.
NF payroll came in under expectations and over a year and half of silent revisions downwards. Unemployment went up from 4.1% to 4.3%.
This is obviously not true based on all the gay bears the past 6 years.
> It is not spiking, so no expectation of disruptions to the supply.

Could this be "offset" by the fact that they're also expecting a recession? 

Then, the US is also producing more oil than ever. 

So a disruption in supply, is offset by reduced global demand due to recessions.
I don't know that there's any way to know for sure unless if a hedge fund or some player that was overly exposed to this goes down, and we see the financial damage.

Regardless, it's not your average Joe putting on carry trades. It's institutions doing it, and they move around trillions of dollars on a daily basis. The fact that volatility popped as much as it did is a good indicator that it's no small amount
Yes, borrow USD to buy yen. Smooth brains, full margin, can't lose.
Yes Japanese businesses were definitely struggling with inflated imports, I feel for you. Now the tide is turning back. It's just kind of interesting that all of this was policy-created and not really natural movement of markets. And thanks for the nice words, I might reach out for recommendations!

People have been predicting another financial crisis every day since the last one over a decade ago.

Today we have other  mechanisms of contingency. The laws are different. 2008 rewrote the books. It's nearly impossible for the same to happen again. Of course it doesn't mean recessions are not possible. But full blown crashes like that ain't possible anymore, unless the whole pyramid falls. But then all we can do is try to get hold of a gun, ammo and a bunker.
Appreciate your in-depth response. Awesome to learn from others when they‚Äôre willing to share their knowledge. All the best!
Any thoughts on how to recognize the end of this unwinding?
nice nice thankyou very much for explaining
More than that, it's now more expensive for the gaijin to pay back the loans because the exchange rate shifted in favor of the yen. Big hedge funds don't like when expenses go up. Expenses go up, make line go down, and no one likes it when line go down.

Except, and I‚Äôm not arguing anything you said, the only real destruction would be to the ultra high earners from the current system‚Äîie the people who siphon profit at every level and add no medical value. All the hospitals still need to be paid for their services, all the claims still processed by many of the same individual people who process them today. Would some get cut? Sure, but it wouldn‚Äôt be a wholesale evaporation of an entire industry worth of jobs, they just get absorbed into government or other related sector that we‚Äôd all just pay a slight tax increase for. Easier said than done, but far from scorched earth.  A couple years of shaky ground as we figured it out would be zero worse and a million times better than the absolute trash fire that is what we have now. Unfortunately we have no collective will at all to improve this country.

Which companies make it, and which fail, that depends on a hundred factors. But overall, as a society, at least us privileged to be in the US, you're better off than 80% of the world.¬†


The point of putting your money in funds like SPY is to leverage long term success of the best companies in the group. So when this shit falls, it's not the end of the world, you know what's possible for it to return to, and the lower it goes, the more you buy. For as long as the population is growing, it'll come back.¬†

I don't believe the global financial markets care too much about a war  in the Middle East. As you rightly point out, the US is self-sufficient in oil, and many non-Middle Eastern countries can ramp up production if needed.

It's only a matter of when, although the exchange rate cycles tend to be long-ish (years) while a lot of the individual trades are short (months or less.) So it's a whole swarm of money managers doing the "picking up nickels in front of a steamroller" thing, hoping that they'll be nimble enough to be the first one to get out before the trade inevitably turns against them. Same dynamic as in "Margin Call"; not the same trade, but it's the same mentality.

Okay you're still missing my point, which has nothing to do with the value of my personal investments, or any of the absurd out of context flag waving you did for the US.

I'm talking about the fact that *fundamentally* we are culturally driven to support corporate profit as a national policy because we are told the 401k, a direct investment in the profitability of companies, is all-important to "the economy."  This insanely narrow focus, intensified over the decades since 401k gained prominence, is incredibly imbalanced towards existing wealth owners and is ultimately self-defeating for everyone except a tiny fraction of the population.

Which makes it absurd for people to, for example, vote on the basis of the perceived impact of a politician to the health of their 401k, when literally hundreds of alternatives would actually impact their life in more meaningful ways (even in raw dollar value).
Aww, that sucks. ¬†My wife had 6 months of networking and agitation herself before finally landing a good gig a month ago. ¬†On a positive note, you sent me on a little dive into that company, and now I‚Äôm wondering if there ever was a Dave behind the killer bread.

For the rest of us, it's either spend time on trying to start some revolution, or use your head to play the game to your best ability, and get ahead at least a bit.¬†


Now, whose turn is it to do a line of coke off of this hookers ass? It's gonna be a long day today boys!!
They own Dave‚Äôs Killer Bread. Bought the brand a few years ago. People don‚Äôt realize that 90% of the bread they buy in the US is owned by this single company. There are loads of ‚Äúbrands‚Äù of bread in the US but the vast majority go back to this one company and they own or act as contractors for all of it. Even all Publix-brand bread and Wonder Bread. They also own all of Tasty Cake snacks. They bake and own all of it. It‚Äôs hidden niche business empire.
Laughs in American.

It‚Äôs Finally Over‚Ä¶
Hello My Dearest Regards,

I still can‚Äôt believe it. After countless attempts and failures, blowing up my account with 0DTEs before I even knew what Theta was; it‚Äôs finally over. My journey on WSB has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. But, these past two weeks have been the most unbelievable run of my life.

I know that there are people out there crushing it making millions, and in comparison, my gains might seem like just a drop in the bucket. However, for me, this represents a new beginning - a home, a new car, and most importantly, a way to pull my family out of debt.

With that said, I‚Äôve made the decision to disable options trading forever and take my final bow. This journey has been incredibly emotional, filled with both highs and lows. WallStreetBets, you‚Äôve been more than just a community to me. You‚Äôve provided endless happiness, countless laughs, and yes, even periods of despair.

To all my fellow traders and dreamers out here, I wish you nothing but success. May you all secure the tendies, achieve those multi-baggers, and have only green lines that go up.

Thank you for everything. It‚Äôs been real.

Love,

Tort
You should tell us how.  We want to see positions.
Congrats buddy that‚Äôs amazing, see you in 1 month!
WSB is littered with stories of people who pulled this off, decided they were an invincible money making genius, and then lost it all. Makes me genuinely happy to see someone make a life changing amount of money and have the sense to walk away with it.
Some last Nvidia calls before you go
Fuck you, congrats chief truly
What an achievement, fuck you and fuck you
You can't just post this and not give any advice or details on what your trades were.
Positions? Just one more full port play and you‚Äôre a millionaire.

Congrats. 

This earnings cycle has, to me at least, looked like one for the record books with how drastically so many stocks jumped bigly (many) or dove off cliff (a few). You picked the perfect time to play minesweeper and go calls.
See you Monday!

Mods where are the positions?

How does this happen? Like what are steps someone should take to get to this level? I see so many success stories (the failure stories are 10x no doubt) but it just seems so vague. What causes this extreme amount of growth in two weeks?
Nobody walks away in the green here, get back to the grind, you are 1 digit away from being a millionaire, don't quit now boy
See you tomorrow.
Go all in on 0dte ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224)
You've decided to disable options trading forever? Sounds like you may have a problem and are making the right decision. I hope you take this money and legit start a good life, don't spend it on more options looking to live off of it.
My only question is, HOW??? 

I would be in so much trouble if i was allowed to manage my own investment.  

Here's to hoping we don't see you on this sub ever again!
goodbye sweetheart and f you so much.
Nvda calls?
Goodluck staying clean. It's not easy to stop gambling, but i hope you succeed.

Now on a serious note, congrats! Make a good use of that money

Mods? Positions or ban ??
I going to be homeless soon after losing my job because the facility i worked at got shut down because management did some real fucked up things

I've dedicated my whole life to building a career that has led to me having to sell my stuff and pack my car and live in it and in a desperate attempt to find work I have applied all over the country knowing that I will get a job, because I'm extremely overqualifed with two master degrees, I've worked so hard and have nothing to show for it. 


and then I see this and I cry a little, I'm happy and proud for you. I don't know how any of this works at the end of the day so I know nothing like this will ever happen for me, but i'm proud of you.

I'm genuinely proud of each and every one of you that managed to make this shit work, you got out of the fucking shithole the rest of us are in, smile on for me, because the world is not a nice place
I hate these screenshots of Robinhood. Whenever someone posts one that has money in the buying power section, my brain kicks in and I try to buy something. I always click then I am reminded this is not my account.
Nice. Buy a new home AND car. Make sure both of them are fancy. 

Because you can afford both. And I'm talking about the money you have right now. I'm saying your gonna make millions every hour from now on.

Or not
Dude started with 4m 2 months ago
I have always been a buy and hold investor but I‚Äôm very interested in learning how to do options trading. I‚Äôm ok taking risks with a portion of my capital. But I literally have no clue where and how to start learning how to do this. 

Can anyone here either explain this is 3rd grade language, or direct me to a post that explains it clearly, or to a YouTube video that explains it plainly?

I would really appreciate some guidance here (and not ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do it‚Äù since I have cash on the sidelines for these types of risks and my main portfolio is well-stocked and tended).

Thank you in advance to anyone willing to take the time to help me learn!
See you in a week degen. ¬†

OP broke even
How much did you lose before? You can only blow up 20k accounts 12 times before being down 240k. Were your blown up accounts only for chump change? Did you not blow up that many times before making this run?
After a third of that goes to taxes and you realize it‚Äôs not enough for a house, car, and all your debt, you will step back into the casino ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)

Why would you stop here? Take $10,000 and start again. If you lose, of well. Use the loss to offset your gains.

What‚Äôs the cost basis? This proves nothing.
Why do none of these fools ever post their positions? Great; you want to humble brag to strangers on the internet. This is a waste of time for anyone else unless we know how you did it degen.

Dude just wants some roses
So are we calling eachother regards now? Cause I called someone a regard (but with correct spelling) the other day, and reddit told me I had a warning before I'd be banned if I dropped the R word again.
It's not over until the position is closed.

You're up 249k in the last month with less than 12k buying power, and telling everyone you're done...with open positions.

How much did it drop before you closed?

How much did you lose on Hyliion?

seriously, even if I made such money, I don't think I would leave
Hi,I don‚Äôt know anything about trading and only see posts and comments from this sub when they reach the front page and I have a question. You guys know calling people ‚Äúregard‚Äù makes you look just as cringe and shitty as calling them the r word right? Like seriously how old are you guys?
Too bad no one here actually shares information.  They just post after to Brag. Money doesn't make the man. 0$ or 1 billion no one likes a rotten person.
Unless I am misunderstanding something isn't OP paying nearly 100k in taxes including penalty if its pulled out? 170k isn't getting you a house a car and paying all your debt off in this economy.

Once a degen‚Ä¶.always a DEGEN!!! Fuck you see ya tomorrow!! üòÜüòÜ
He‚Äôll be back. They always come back.
I work in real gambling as this is the most accurate statement ever. What this man does not realize and will be fighting for the rest of his life is that little voice that says ‚Äú‚Ä¶we can do this again‚Ä¶I know when to cut myself off‚Äù.

He will pay off all his debts but life creates new debt - the biggest challenge will be the boredom  ‚ÄúI have disposable income let me just put a grand into the market for old time sake‚Äù. 

His life will never be the same and I do not wish this on anyone that doesn‚Äôt make this kind of money annually through work/ owning their business
After making 100k I thought why don‚Äôt I make this 1 million and then lost everything in a week
Assuming he actually does. If he was smart, he would just empty the tank and start over with 5k.
The only way to win at gambling is to get lucky and then be smart enough to walk away
..... and it's gone.
Oh my gourd! 


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
I give it slim to zero chance he really walks away, but there are some that did and I‚Äôm genuinely happy for them.
i'm curious how much they blew to get to this point. congrats OP. good on you for walking away.
u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT with that $8-10 million dollar just gonna mostly chill energy is rare
No shit. Put 250k in a six month CD and cool off then do your research with a Vanguard account. That money socked away would give you a lifetime of peace of mind that your retirement isn't gonna be spent in a trailer park in Yuma.
Walking away he is the real genius. I was one of those WSB invincible money making geniuses. Watched one of my account go from 5k, to 40k, to 717k, and eventually back to 5k again. LOL. Knowing when to get out is the hardest part. If you have the balls to ride it to 717k, you are gonna have those same balls to ride it down to 0.

Congrats OP, and fuck you.
rip MartyMoho
Best idea is to spend it all immediately (preferably with good stuff like a house) or put in some long expiration bond.
But it‚Äôs not really life changing ‚Ä¶
How is 250k life changing? If so, I feel deeply sorry for anyone who thinks it is.
It's up 31% this month, 1670% in the past 5 years, and 84,828% all time, so seems like a pretty good call

Stocks only go up right? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)

It‚Äôs shocking that I had to go through 8 different comments before getting to the ‚Äúcongrats and fuck you‚Äù one. This new WSB disgusts me.

Why do you want advice from a lottery winner?

Exactly. It is just rude to post gain porn here and not post positions.

OP we are happy for you but you have to tell us your trades.
> Positions or ban

When did we start being polite about it?
It‚Äôs simple: identify what you think it‚Äôs a great call, then do the opposite. Works 50% of the time
Basically casino strategy. There‚Äôs no more to it. You bet on red or black and let the ball rolling.
Spoken like a true regard.   Just one more bump.

Yea if I easily 10x, no way my brain is going to let me walk away from an even easier 4x to 100k tendies!
Naw. If op takes it all out and isn‚Äôt happy about it after tax, it‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôll but the whole 2xx,000 in. Probably 30k or whatever he started out with tho. üòÇ

That's 2 homes and 4 cars and a young mistress.
Isn't it a rule that they have to post trades for any gains? Is that still being implemented?
Happy for you buddy!  Cash out, pay your debt, put down on a house and change your life for the better.
Congratulations regard, now go get some Wendy‚Äôs, buy some ETFs and fuck off. The rest of us are trying to fuck around and find out.

Trolling or forreal ?
> There is no "**fuck you**" in this.

It's right there. I bolded it for you to make it easier to see.
They‚Äôre so cheap and unlikely to make money that when it actually appreciates in value, it goes to andromeda
so it seems like options trading but you get to skip the time decay mostly. You buy an option out of the money and hope within the next 6 hours it goes in the money so you can sell, but otherwise it expires and you lose all of it. Idk I haven't done it before. closest ive done is buy a few days before expiry and sell when it goes in the money
Massive movement on cheap costs basis. They are basically lottery tickets and you lose unless a massive unforeseen movement happens
https://preview.redd.it/6275bvpu7fhc1.jpeg?width=1134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36d364a513f550db608d8897828f4bbeb2404899
Or leveraged ETFs
Either smart or degenerate/lucky short-term options trading and reinvesting profits repeatedly.
Options that usually cost $1 each because they‚Äôre no where near the current strike price.  You buy hundreds or thousands of them.  They expire that day so the odds are very high they expire worthless and you lose the money you spent on them. Also known as losing your premium.  If the stock price spikes to your strike price then you‚Äôre rich.

There‚Äôs a reason why they‚Äôre cheap.  There‚Äôs probably thousands of stocks that have options.  Just go look at the option chain for SPY and you‚Äôll see the .01 call or put contracts.
All depends on how much money he makes on regular enterprises. Anywhere from 10-37%, but you can't get fucked and pumped into a different bracket. His regular income will be taxed at the applicable rate and the capital gains will be in the top tax bracket as he's made 250k. 

&#x200B;

Assuming he makes 100k per year he's taking home (after federal tax, nothing else applied here) 76k in salary (100k taxed at 24%) plus roughly 165k in capital gains (250k taxed at 37%) meaning he gets a net take home of 240k from a possible 350k after the Fed takes its share. 

&#x200B;

State tax will be 5% (assuming he's in NY for argument's sake) on the 100k in income, bringing him down to 71k from a 100k salary. After this, the 250k in income is taxed at 6.85% in that tax bracket, which is roughly 17k.

&#x200B;

So after taxes his income (assuming a base 100k salary) is 71k (post state and fed salaried income)

 \+ 165k in capital gains (post fed tax), which then gets taxed again at state level as income in a difference bracket at 17k...

&#x200B;

Point is, this is complicated as fuck, and if you make a shitload of money trading stocks, you will be paying 40% net in tax.
sounds like the start of one hell of a success story, best wishes to you bud
Fuck you for shorting him. What he do to you?
If you live in Puerto Rico there is no capital gains tax üëÄ just FYI
OPs post history says they are a CPA, so I bet they have the tax angle covered.

Good job, OP!
Take your chances they don't catch everyone!
You don't have to pay if you lose it all back
Yes, very good, that's how society works.
Don't worry, he has 500K of capital loss carryover
To be fair, they‚Äôve earned it
Short-term trading is income... which means this on top of income you're already making, right?

So, if he makes $60k a year, then has $250k of short-term cap gains, he's taxed at 310k income, essentially now getting taxed at highest federal level on his $60k income... Or, am I off?
Homeboy bout to be approximately 40% less excited after hiring a CPA üòÇ congrats on the W tho
If you buy a property with that money then you don‚Äôt need to pay the tax.
This is a underlying hating comment ü§£ü§£
This is the investors "must be nice ". it sounds tasteless and envious to think someone that has 21000 to invest doesn't know about taxes to begin with. 
Why try to crush his dreams. It's better to pay taxes than to be counting how much someone has to pay in taxes.
IRS already has the fuck part covered ü¶ß
Also‚Ä¶ $270k isn‚Äôt even enough for a down payment on a house here‚Ä¶ let alone a car plus the capital gains taxes.

Crazy to think that even this run would be only a step toward that goal lol
If you reinvest it there won't be a capital gains tax
You‚Äôre good looking. You‚Äôll make it back champ
lol went from 3k to 120k in 3mo, lost it all in one day. March 2021, three weeks before closing on a house.

Fun times.
when i check the settings, i cant find the "disable options trading forever" button.
I did something similar. I went from 32k to 104k in almost 2 months. Cashed out 100k and left 4k for future gambl‚Ä¶ I mean investments!
Sell half, start over with half but this time trade with more patience, less risk and aim for lower percentage gains. 

The trick is to be high risk just once, till your capital is large enough that a 1% gain is more money then the 50% gain was before.
You should only be high risk when you have nothing to lose, as soon as you have something to lose you should start playing it as safe and patient as possible. Don't focus on making money, focus on not losing what you already have. This is the secret to getting loaded on the stockmarket.
Yeah but how many times would you need to gamble that 5k to hit millions vs 250k?!?!  ;)
> he would just empty the tank and start over with 5k.

thats called bank roll management and every investor should go watch poker videos talking about the concept
People on here sometimes act like this sub isnt just a bunch of degenerate gamblers. 

This guy is stopping as much as the old lady at the slot machines who goes home to sleep is stopping.
Greed is a bitch we'll see him here next month ü§£
Starting over with 5k can quickly become omg I lost 5k I should put 10k more to make it back
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done multiple times. I get to $50k-$75k, empty everything but $2k-$5k and don‚Äôt deposit another single dollar
Exactly. Just a little taste. He can quit whenever he wants.
Trading is not gambling, buy cheap sell expencive, make money, sometimes price crash unexpected but u just simply dont put all ur money in one trade and u be good its a rare event. Whats cheap whats expencive? Very simple i use 21 period moving average, average is normal price below is cheap above expencive, if u patient and buy only very cheap or far bellow average and sell only high above average, u can make constant money, u can back test this to see that it works perfect, u do get rare events that wioe u out, but again just dont put all money in one trade. Basically calling tradi g gambling is exact same as calling wallmart or amazon a gambling business, cause thats what they do they buy cheap sell expencive.

Exactly. This motherfucker just became so poor rich it hurts.
I made 300k on gamestop and paid 69k in federal tax. Fwiw.
How would it be 100k in federal? I guess it depends how much his regular income is but if he made 105k in W2 for example his short term capital gains tax on this money would be around 58k. Then state just depends where he is for all we know he‚Äôs in a no income tax state.
Right! So he'd owe more like, $57k

Hi Greg!
My name's ~~Leonard~~ Greg. I don't know if there's anything that complicated about me. Which is why I should be happier I guess.

It's good for him, hes interesting. but I've never been interesting to anybody. I work in an office, people walk right by me and I know they don't see me.

Then I go home and I watch my wife and my kids - they don't look up when I sit down.

It's like no one cares that I'm gone.

They should love me, maybe they do, but, I don't even know what it is.

You spend your whole life thinking you're not getting it, people aren't giving it to you. Then you realize they're trying, and you don't even know what IT is.

I had a dream I was on a shelf in the refrigerator. Someone closes the door and the light goes off, and i know everybody's out there eating

And then they open the door, and you see them smiling. They're happy to see you. But maybe they don't look right at you, and maybe they don't pick you.

Then the door closes again. The light goes off.
He has a mangina

That‚Äôs not how tax brackets work.
If you make enough all at once you can go full expat and renounce your citizenship and the irs can't touch you. ...they say
Bite me, dough boy.
I identify as someone living in Puerto Rico from here on out.
For real?
I live at PO Box Puerto Rico.
You have to actually live there tho
Aren't they changing that soon?
It's true, but only for previous non-residents. We OG residents are fucked. We are taxed from head to toe. We don't even receive beneficial treatment for qualified dividends. I think that Puerto Rico is the only "country" that discriminate and provides third class treatment to their people and first class treatment to outsiders.
One more reason to move there old San Juan is my jam
Can I just use a VPN and say I'm in Puerto Rico? They won't know the difference
Eyo no don‚Äôt come here I‚Äôm a resident and I don‚Äôt get theirs tax exceptions and you don‚Äôt help puerto Rico growth either
Are you regarded? If you live in Puerto Rico and still claim your US citizenship you absolutely still pay US capital gains taxes. If you become a full time resident of Puerto Rico and renounce your US citizenship then you won‚Äôt be taxed on capital gains by the US and just get taxed by Puerto Rico instead. Tax man always gets paid.
you're off. That is why we have a marginal tax rate. Each level has its own tax rate, so the entire $310k is not taxed at the highest rate, only that amount over the threshold. He is not in a worse off tax situation. That is a very common misconception about the tax ladder.
Your entire income isn‚Äôt taxed at the highest rate. Each tier of income is taxed at the rate for that tier. This is the biggest misconception about taxes
You are off, that is not how tax brackets work
So fitting for a WSB regard to not understand taxes.

Theres enough fuckable to go around.

How is 270k not enough for a down payment? That's 25% on a 1.08 million dollar home. Many people buy homes with 5 to 20% down.
I could easily buy a house and 20+ acres of land for 270k in northern Michigan, if you need 1M to buy a house we‚Äôve got waaaayyy different living standards. fuk
dude he probably lives in like Alabama or Iowa the homes are $20
The average down payment is 15%. Where do you live that the median home price is close to $2 million. If that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôm really really glad I live in the Midwest because that‚Äôs absurd.
If you can make it once, you can make it again. It‚Äôs just tough losing it the first time. Lol
It‚Äôs right next to the yolo everything into bullshit button. I keep hitting the wrong one damnit.
You can probably email their responsible trading division or whatever and asked to be banned. Guessing here, but plenty of gambling sites do this
Closest I can find is deactivate account
Funniest thing I‚Äôve read in a long while
I turned 3k into like 36k. Took out like 30k for a house down payment
I know right. You can‚Äôt let them take it out because that makes it real. There‚Äôs always a better situation. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|wink)

Dont bet on Jensen, nvidia always go up
Well I just bought nvda shares for the first time so get ready for this motherfucker to tank like its never tanked before.
What technology?
It's all part of their plan for world domination. They're eventually going to buy out every major corporation, government entity, hedge fund, bank, utility company, and military worldwide. So essentially, investing in NVDA now is basically like owning a piece of the whole world's economy in a single stock once their plan is complete in a few years' time. So, really, it's kinda a no-brainer investment.

there's a big difference between

and

> this stock will hit $250 today

risk is higher of losing everything, but since you're buying a contract for really cheap, if you luck out your rewards will be really big.

like if I knew that on January 3rd the stock will jump 20%, I have to pay a huge premium to buy that option a month in advance, but if I buy it the day of I make way more money. But since I don't know if that will happen, I'm shit out of luck if it doesn't.
Wtf is he on about 0dte is very large theta decay.  If you want to skip theta you buy Leaps
I'm sure I've missed something--but the point is fundamentally right. If you make >250k in trading for the year, you're losing 37% to uncle Sam and a bit more on state income tax.
Basically if you win enough where citizenship is worth losing you do this.

How the fuck does moving to Puerto Rico full time have anything to do with renouncing your US citizenship?

Puerto Rico is part of the United States and Puerto Ricans are US citizens.
My dad explained this to me. It's crazy how many people are unaware that's its not just a flat rate
So many people out here saying they don't want to do overtime because it will all be taken away with taxes and I've had to just stop talking to these people because they can't be reasoned with.
And this is why unless you are literally destitute and survive on public assistance programs you should always take the pay raise. You will pay more taxes but you will have net more money at the end. 

If you are below the poverty line and making more would remove your healthcare, housing, insurance, etc. then for some people it makes sense to not make like $1000 more that will put you in a tax bracket where you can‚Äôt receive those things, but not make enough to afford them alone. 

The number of people who have been convinced that you shouldn‚Äôt take the pay raise is crazy.
IK it's a marginal, but you can place this $250k gains first then his salary on top.... Or, you could do it the other way. Either way, he's likely paying like $106k or $100k depending on if his state has income tax...
And these people vote‚Ä¶
Y'all mistaking my question. It's just his taxable income at the end of the year will be $310k. I was just lumping his salary (estimated) with the lump sum to show folks how short-term gains can cause juicy taxes.
> AGAIN- I AM AN IDIOT. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS IS NOT ADVICE OR GUIDANCE. JUST GOOGLING AND REGURGITATING.

Most important thing in the comment
Over $1M you can‚Äôt use mortgage insurance and must put 20% down at minimum. Detached houses in the poorer areas tend to go for around $1.2M. Generally, I would expect to pay more like $1.5M for a detached house to start.
Wouldn‚Äôt live in Seattle, California, or must certainly Canada if you gave me a million dollar house.
I mean, if he lives where he wants to and it‚Äôs cheap there, more power to him.

I just couldn‚Äôt imagine earning this amount and even then feeling particularly ahead. I‚Äôd feel more secure, for sure, but it wouldn‚Äôt get me much further, lifestyle wise lol
When a mortgage is over $1M, you cannot take mortgage insurance and therefore must pay a minimum 20% down.

All houses here are over $1M. A nicer place is over $2M.

I have coworkers who both work in tech and split a mortgage with parents (who are retired and made good money and owned property throughout their life.)

For detached houses, you gotta pay to play.
it's tough losing it the second time.

This month of february im up 400% in my trading account, after 9 trades, i do put all money(of small trading account) in one trade with 2x leverage, also i trade 4h not daily charts, month is not over yet, so i should reach my 8 year average of 500% each month, completely boring i check charts only 3x a day, takes 1 minute a day total, 0 "research", pure buy cheap sell expencive based on average price of last 21 candles, it is be all end all of TA, because all other strategies or indicators do more or less same thing, buy cheap sell expencive, only thing different is how exactly u define normal price. No gambling. Trading is called trading, because its very different from gambling, i would be doing gambling if i didnt manadge risk, didnt define my edge, didnt know whats cheap whats expencive, then it would be gambling.
I got the reference, just wasn‚Äôt sure what prompted the bot to respond to me with that.
Turns 10k to $0, and then gets a $20k loan so he can make back his losses. And so forth.

Hello my blonde hair, blue person friend! üôÇüëã
That does not sound correct. One time I failed to report a stock sale that I wasn't aware occurred. It was a stock sale of $10,000. My interest and penalties on that after a year of not payment we're under $200. Because it was the first time occurrence they waived the penalty and just charged the interest.

I don't believe a fucking word you saying
I need a selfie of you holding your nuts in San Juan or I‚Äôm calling cap
I can't believe the IRS went after you for a $230 gain when there are people out there doing fraud for thousands and millions
How is that possible? IRS has a max penalty of 25% 

You sound like you‚Äôre being scammed or something
Do you have to live there all year?
ü§£
"I refused that raise at work because then I would be taxed more. I would be losing money!"
I know right. Like people, you live one life and have to learn one system. Just learn it and then you‚Äôre good for life.
?? Brother, it doesn't matter in the slightest what order you report it. Income for the year is income for the year. The first 11k of his 310k income will be taxed at 10%, the next ~33k or so will be taxed at 12%, the next ~50k at 22%, etc
First question will be whether these are long-term gains. It seems like they are not, so we are tailing bout ordinary income under Section 61 of the code. The order of whether the gains are the first $250k or the last doesn't matter. HIs total taxable income doesn't delineate between sources. Using the numbers you came up with, and foregoing any unknown deductions, he will have an effective tax rate of 27.4% and will pay \~90k in federal taxes including FICA. 

Additional taxes will depend on state.
I understand, but this does not affect how his salary is taxed. At all. His 60k salary is not being taxed at the highest bracket which you claimed. Even his short term gains won‚Äôt even touch the highest tax bracket‚Ä¶ so none of his income will be ‚Äútaxed at the highest federal level‚Äù
ah yes the WSB special of quitting your $60,000 job so you have $0 income and then only earning like $11,000 per year from stonks as your sole income source to avoid paying taxes

brilliant, really showing it to the man.
Taxes don't work like that.

Lets say below $20000 you are taxed 10% and above you are taxed 50%. 
If you make $21000, you will pay 10% over the first $20000 ($2000) and 50% over the remaining 1000 ($500).  So your total tax over the $21000 will be $2500.
Seattle? Shit is absolutely insane, definitely not the norm for the country.
I assumed you were being a bit hyperbolic lol. That would be around a $1.4 million house with 20% down. That‚Äôs higher than the median price of a home in pretty much any city in the country.
Especially since that‚Äôs the time that you never get it back. Or was it the third time?
It‚Äôs a put but different kinda from what I gather

Naked calls are to a 900 number from the bathroom
You pay for the right to purchase the stock at a certain price in the future (the strike price). So when you get to that point in the future, if your strike price is say $50 and the stock is currently trading at $75, you buy it for $50 bc you locked in that price then turn around and sell on the market for $75. Boom $25 profit per share

I don't believe them because they said they made money

Seriously the tax on that would have been like 50 bucks, how does that become 8k, especially when you say look my tax lady screwed up step off my nuts
Yep, that's exactly how it goes.  IRS sends a short, polite letter saying they noticed something amiss, and says if you agree with their assessment you owe 'em $xxx.  Which is NOT $8000 for not declaring $228 of income.

Once they said "we think you owe us $2500 for these two goofs" and I wrote back saying "first goof is your goof, not mine, I owe 0 on that, and second goof was because the broker sent me an updated 1099 on March 21 after I filed on March 19 and on that I compute I owe $43--here's your check".  They wrote back saying "we compute you owed $47...close enough, we good".
This made me chuckle
The ones with thousands and millions are paying lawyers and accountants to defend them, the IRS seems to go for the low hanging fruit, not ones who will fight back. If they are trying to collect 100k, but have to spend 50k on legal fees and an extra 20k in staff pay to get it done they may decide just to go after the little guy who cant afford to fight back. Just a random theory.
Because that kid is lying out his asshole.
We Have to pay taxes on the money we make?????
Yes, Hunter and his Dad!!
you typed "full of shit" wrong.

I argued with an employee for weeks about this!!! He never took the raise either. I even showed him the Tax Schedule and the different levels.

Taxes should be based on money that you already have, instead of money you're just now getting, IMO.

Like, if I have a million already, fine. Take your 22%. But if I've been broke my entire life and now I finally get $200k, and you *still* wanna take so much? C'mon. Have a heart, man.

That was similar to one of my experiences. Theyve always been very reasonable when I've had to deal with them.
I have had one run in with the irs. Honestly wasn‚Äôt bad at all. A few years out of college and I just had to turn in a few extra things and it was all straightened out.  Usually if ‚Äúthey‚Äôre going after you,‚Äù you‚Äôre trying to cheat on your taxes. Mine was taxes on 25k insolvency. Not a lot to the government, but a lot for me.
That‚Äôs still only 70k, worth it for 30k
If you make good money on stock market you should have a tax person so you are square with IRS. Don't do fucking Turbo Tax free edition or HR block.
This is 100% accurate.
i feel like you got scammed by your tax preparer and not the IRS

Bang Bus was real.
For certain groups of people who has a lower income, and get financial aid from certain programs, they are better off not to get a small raise, if their income goes over a certain amount, they loose those benefits.  So that they would loose more if they got the raise.   
 That is where I think it's a dumb incentive.  The aid program should keep with providing the aid when in certain years they might make a little more, so they can build their savings, and so that enventually they become better off and no longer need this financial aid.  If you keep people's income just near the poverty / low income lines, they will have a more difficult time to do good or willing to do good for themselves and get off the aid over time.

Real numbers vs financial numbers.  A lot of people are good with the former, and clueless about the latter.
![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)
That‚Äôs the way we like to fuck. Spoken like a true ape.
I mean this isn't like the concept of alpha, theta, and that shit. It's basic percentages, those are real numbers.
Coinbase has just blocked all users from selling. 
Again and again, we‚Äôre shown why we shouldn‚Äôt trust CEX‚Äôs and why self-custody is so important. 

Every Coinbase user is suddenly showing 0 balance or no balance in their wallet. Right after it pumps insanely the last couple hours. No one can sell. What *convenient* timing for this glitch to happen.

Self-custody is literally so important and this is why. Robinhood pt 2. These CEX‚Äôs don‚Äôt want us to make money, they want them to make money. I‚Äôm 90% in self-custody, but even just having the 10% I have on the Coinbase CEX blocked is just rage inducing. I didn‚Äôt even want to sell but it‚Äôs the principle. How dare they. Genuinely. 

Edit: some users are suggesting it might be a traffic surge, which is a different but potentially valid explanation. **I do really hope this is a genuine mistake**. Either way it still emphasises the importance of self-custody. 

It‚Äôs about the choice being yours. 

Edit 2 (19 hours later): to users asking what‚Äôs the point as you need a CEX to sell‚Ä¶you just send funds to **any CEX of your choice**. Advisably one that is working. Because self-custody **gives you back the choice to do that**. Your funds aren‚Äôt stuck in a CEX that is frozen.
Forced diamond hands lol
You can't buy ether. Feel more like Coinbase got overloaded/glitched and that caused the drop
[They are aware of the issue and publicly stated so on their status site. Forced diamond hands.](https://status.coinbase.com)
Knowing Coinbase, I think the statement "Never attribute to malice, that which can adequately be explained by incompetence" applies here.
First bullrun for OP lol
Wouldn't matter if you hold your coins in your own wallet, you still need an exchange or platform to sell.
Brother, this shit pumped like mad today and their systems clearly got overwhelmed. Also, self custody does not help you if you want to buy or sell on high volume days like this. Self custody is for storing them, not trading!
I mean you can self custody all you want but that isn‚Äôt solving the issue. You cant sell to fiat directly from your wallet.
>convenient

It's not convenient, when their money-making site goes down, they lose money. It's going down because millions of people are logging in and their system can't handle it.

Also Joe public doesn't want to store their wealth on private wallets or under their mattress, they want entities to hold it for them, which is why CEX's are popular with the public.
Tin foil heads, Coinbase got a surge of traffic and their API went down. Get over yourselves, it's not intentional. Can't deny it did trigger the temporary crash back down into the 50s.
Wouldn‚Äôt Coinbase not allowing you to sell just hurt them? Don‚Äôt they make their money off of trading fees? Which is different from, at least how I understood, RH makes their money. I‚Äôm thinking this is just high volume having an impact on their system.
This post is idiotic.
Wouldn't be a bull market without a coinbase crash! Bullish!!
LMAO

"Coinbase won't allow us to sell and get cash for our crypto, so you should put your coins in your own private wallet....where it takes an hour just to transfer any amount and where you still can't sell your crypto for actual cash."
This is why you have limit orders in place for pumps like this. I do think selling/trading before the halving is crazy though.
May be a noob question, but how do you sell and convert to fiat, if not through Coinbase/Binance etc.?
genuinely asking, are you new? This is pretty common, and I would think understandable, when there is a sudden surge of users. You seem to be insinuating that Coinbase is deliberately doing this, but I don't see how this would help them, as any directional volume makes them money, not just increasing prices.
It's nice to have the self-custody, but eventually you will have to move your assets to an exchange to sell them. I don't see the relationship between self-custody and coinbase block.
Im having this issue as well, what exactly is happenign? Never had this issue on my coinbase and have had it for 4 years.
I think your title is misleading... Coinbase isnt necessarily "blocking" people. It's clearly just a massive influx of users causing it to crash the servers.
Delusional. Coinbase is a public company accountable to shareholders with the direct goal of increasing shareholder value aka profit. Preventing any transaction, which is their main source of revenue, goes against that. They want you to sell. They want you to buy. They don‚Äôt care what you do as long as there are fees attached. Implying that a business wants to shut itself down, prevent generating revenue, and harm their customers/reputation is simply delusional
[deleted]
It's probably just an indication that a lot of traffic is going on at CB right now, which isn't surprsing
So what is the alternative for when you need to sell?
Go to Advanced Trade, all your assets should be showing in there. Just checked mine. It‚Äôs probably a glitch on the front end from all this new booty traffic
This might be the last straw to get me to shift all of my crypto either to a different exchange or my ledger wallet
Kraken
The hamsters are tired and can‚Äôt get their wheels going fast enough to keep up with the server demand from a runaway crypto market
How does self custody solve my problem to sell?
Welcome to Crypto! You should know that anytime the price rips, all the CEXs will struggle. Been that way for years. Do not base your strategy on using Coinbase to try and sell/buy in the middle of pump. It will not work as you expect. That's just a fact of life.
Reminds me of GME
Okay, your argument is self custody is so important because these CEX won‚Äôt let you sell. Okay, so if I want to sell and I self custody, how can I do that without a CEX?
Relax, this is not a coinbase corruption problem, it's an overwhelming activity problem.  Their servers can't handle the load.  Remember that Coinbase makes money off of each individual transaction, why would they want to lock everything up on purpose?  I still support self-custody of your crypto(NYKNYC) but this post is some tinfoil hat BS.
How will self custody allow you to sell?
What‚Äôs self custody got to do with this? Regardless  everyone will sell on an exchange , if you can‚Äôt get on then doesn‚Äôt really matter.
How would self custody have helped you sell at peak if you can't get on an exchange to sell?
How is self custody going to help you to sell it lol. Still need to put on some cex to off ramp
The traffic surge excuse is a lame one in 2024.
Unbanking the unbanked.

Maybe it's such a shame cause nobody actually cares of doing anything useful with crypto except trading it back and forth to each other for real dollars. The irony
Coinbase Is known to do this, FUCK THEM.
I‚Äôm going to buy more GameStop and LRC.
The calmer you are, the clearer you think. Move with strategy, not emotions.
If only there was a way to sell your bitcoin without having to rely on a CEX, wrapped assets or shady alleyways.

*cough *cough Hydranet DEX
Self custody isn‚Äôt going to help you sell when the time comes. They‚Äôve rigged the game
Mine lasted for about 15 minutes then ot came back.  You shouldn't be keeping much crypto on the exchanges anyway.
Loopring: Hold my beer
Tomorrow BTC will be ATH, coinabase is taking care of you don't sell too early
>some users are suggesting it might be a traffic surge,

Coinbase has enough money to be able to scale with the traffic. Every other major company can do it and this isn't the first time that BTC has seen this much volume either...

It's very convenient timing that's for sure.
They made a public statement 

‚ÄúInvestigating - We are aware that some users may see a zero balance across their Coinbase accounts and may experience errors in buying or selling. Our team is investigating this issue and will provide an update shortly. Your assets are safe.‚Äù

Edit- Here is the [link](https://status.coinbase.com/)

Edit- Go to advanced trade, there you can see your balances and send or trade. IMO this means there was just heavy traffic to the basic Coinbase website/app and is not intentional.
I might be wrong but I think what the OP is saying is that these companies conveniently are unavailable at time when a person can sell and make money.
It's happening for everyone, very convenient.
My friend texted me asking if I had anything on Coinbase and when I went to check everything was at zero. I keep everything in hardware wallets luckily, so I didn't have a heart attack when I went to look. I guess I'm just being hopeful that this isn't convenient timing on their end while BTC is pump to new highs. As of the last few years, I would have considered them pretty trustworthy as far as exchanges go.

  
Never a boring day in crypto, that's for sure.
Sounds like they need to invest in better infrastructure
More CEX FUD. Guess we‚Äôre gonna ignore the endless post of people getting scammed on defi or losing their keys and money FOREVER.
Had this before with Coinbase. It was the reason I stopped using it.
Kinda misleading as you can't buy either.  
Yea, self-custody is important ofc, but this is just coinbases server crashing.
Even if you hold your own cold storage you will one day have to send to an exchange to sell. unless you can find a millionaire with straight cash‚Ä¶.which u won‚Äôt.
My assets showed for a split second.. down 7% in since it crashed.. now it‚Äôs back to displaying zero.
Puts on COIN?
It's because this was a pump and dump. This was not beginning of bull run, no other markets really increased like this.
Well, this was the final slap in the face for me to finally get ALL of my assets off of Coinbase and in to cold storage. üò°
What??? Calm the fuck down.

Coinbase went public and now has investors. Coinbase needs trades to make profit to keep said investors happy. No way they'd intentionally "block" it.

Absolutely nothing like RH, which was owned by a hedge fund who stood to *lose* infinite money if people kept buying.
TBH it would be more convenient if a bad actor who stands to profit from CB losing market share waited to launch a DDOS attack on them right when BTC starts big time mooning near ATH
so......how would you sell with your Bitcoin in your own wallet then if Coinbase doesn't allow selling?
Happens every fucking time there's major movement in the market - CB just crashes - fucking bullshit
What a silly thread, you can tell the new people
Stop talking nonsense OP. How you gonna sell your stuff if it‚Äôs in a cold wallet?
Mine just came back.  However it seems as though the coinbase crash is what halted the upwards momentum
You new here? Every bull run people shit themselves because Coinbase goes down when it has too much volume
Bruh acts like a crypto noob. CB always goes down when price moves up/down quickly. It‚Äôs called website traffic can‚Äôt handle too many users clicking buy and sell at the same time.
They've posted they are aware of a technical issue. They do use technology, and technology fails.

I show my full and accurate balance.

Can we stop with the unnecessary FUD?

Make a deal with you: if this turns out to be nothing, punch yourself in the face once for over reacting.

CALM THE FUCK DOWN and watch this be a big nothingburger. Jesus H.
Last bull run was sane shit, just too much traffic and transactions, don't be a drama queen.
But you can‚Äôt sell from self-custody, sooooo‚Ä¶
Coinbase makes tons of money off fees. It‚Äôs in their best interest to let you buy and sell. Especially during these volatile times they can make more money on the spreads. They don‚Äôt want it to stop working either. System overload.
They are helping me to make a decision: no selling
Only scrubs believe this. They had a surge and their API went down
Srop apreading missinformation. 
They disnt blocked anyone from selling. Glitch affectes everything
To be fair most services catering to crypto were extremely slow or unreliable today, but Coinbase should have been prepared like the rest
Coinbase makes money on people buying and selling. People doing nothing is not a profit. So I cannot imagen this is what they want.
If you self custody then how would u sell?
My balance is showing. There‚Äôs a message that some users may be seeing a 0 balance and they‚Äôre working on the issue. They‚Äôre not blocking sales.
Omg everybody chill. 

The market is goin crazy today, everyone who fucked around with coinbase in the last few years has been opening that bitch up and checking out what's going on. Yoloing in or cashing out. Their servers are probably overloaded. A large and sudden spike in users strains any website or application. 

Does that excuse the issue? No. But let's not have a heart attack just yet.
Coinbase is my best account at the moment with good positions, long holds and sale orders in place that might not hit for another year or two. Regardless, that's just bad business and I imagine a lot of people are extremely angry about it.

If this happened on my Binance or Kucoin account, I would be fucking livid.

Super thankful that I managed to sell some tops and buy some bottoms over there.

Any horror stories?
While self-custody is totally my thing, I would argue if you're trading there's no way around some sort of third party,be it Coinbase or something else.
Coinbase makes money on every trade, buy or sell. They don't care which you do. "Freezing assets" doesn't make them any money unless you say they're going to keep everything forever, which they're not.
Coinbase has done that for literal years, they were doing this shit that I can personally remember back in 2019, and likely MUCH longer.

They just claim "their servers were unexpectedly overloaded", and of course conveniently never address that like clockwork, if their servers are ever expected to handle an above average volume, their apps/site is unusable. It's a willingly-kept bug used as a feature (by them), and they of course use the guise of "well how could we have known there'd be high user activity, not our fault!" time and time again.

Fuck Coinbase. I haven't even messed with CC in years, and still, fuck Coinbase. As long as they're allowed to be corrupt legally, they will continue it nonstop.
Yeah, they had a glitch. Not everything is that deep. It got fixed quickly and the market just keeps going up right now, so it's no great loss. They have no reason to do this intentionally.
lol this is so not true, this post is Uber FUD. Just overloaded with activity from the crazy price action today.
This happens all the time when there's too much traffic on the site
Don‚Äôt block my comment just because you don‚Äôt have experience here

Wow, feels like yesterday(2021) when I first dipped my feet into crypto. I almost feel like a vet compared to some of the new users. Crazy this is only the beginning.
There have been many Glitches and mistakes the past years by corporations handling billions and billions of dollars... 
You tell me this is all just a mistake?    

THE FUCK IT IS!!!!    

They're responsible for our money and make more money than most of us ever will be and you're telling me their system is this ass bitch shit which can't handle shit? Nah brother its all a big ponzi and you should start contacting your Congress man rn!
Happens every cycle. Think they‚Äôd be more robust by now..
Oh yeah, how did the price crash smart guy????
To say coinbase is glitching on purpose is a bit of a tin foil hat moment. 
The reality is this is a cock-up and the website is stopping withdrawals because they want to keep everyone‚Äôs bitcoin safe. 

Not to disagree about self custody, but coinbase is a good company and an important off and on ramps to help us buy real world assets.
If you sell they make more money.  If their servers bog down they lose customers.  This is not convenient for them.

Yeh it's annoying.  It was an issue last cycle too.  It's not a conspiracy.  Be prepared to sell your alts on a DEX cuz at the peak of the market coin base will probably be down
I sold, but they won't let me cash out now, it says my balance is too low no matter what I enter to withdraw, but it says the cash is there and available.
This happened last cycle, during peaks so I switched exchanges. Its just not good enough.
Time for a whole new cohort of people to learn the lessons of their ancestors?
Yep. An old Binance trick from 2018 days. ‚ÄúScheduled maintenance‚Äù while liquidating.
They didn't block people from doing shit.,.. they are getting entirely to much traffic.
How do you sell if it‚Äôs locked off-chain in self-custody?
For all but 30-40 minutes‚Ä¶
The entire concept of an exchange centralises bitcoin and therefor destroy the concept completely. Bitcoin and other crypto users should remove their money as soon as possible.
Total clown post
Ok but how else are u gonna sell it
It‚Äôs not a glitch, they suspended trading due to high volume. But yes that‚Äôs the main reason why you don‚Äôt keep your money on exchanges. It‚Äôs no diff than your bank at that point and that‚Äôs not the purpose of crypto.
License to steal. Welcome to the world of online trading. I could tell you stories from the 90s
Stop the FUD.  Seems the problem is resolved.

I had a limit sell order executed at 60k and another at 64k.  I also cashed out funds to my bank which processed with no problems.  


Don't EVER rely on market orders.  Their systems WILL get clogged up with orders when we hit all time highs.  Enter your limit orders in advance and don't stress.  

WAGMI tick-tock next block friends.
Remember, not your keys, not your coins. Get rid of CEXs!
Very good choice having the 90% on cold!
probably a glitch, I have seen this happen at least a dozen times when using Coinbase.
"Every Coinbase user is suddenly showing 0 balance or no balance in their wallet"

Not for me.

Shows everything just fine.
Every braindead person hasn‚Äôt been here long enough lol. Exchanges have outages especially when things get a little crazy. It‚Äôs not going to be the last time an exchange pauses trading this cycle
How do you sell under "self custody"?
Rugpull!!!
Not your keys^DRS, not your crypto
>These CEX‚Äôs don‚Äôt want us to make money, they want them to make money. 

Ummm... They make money from fees when you sell, not when you hold.



>Self-custody is literally so important and this is why.

You can't sell it without a CEX.
You guys ever try to use your phone at an event? Same thing

Scaling is super difficult
coinbase has done far worse than this, but sadly in crypto what you read rarely matters until it happens to you, myself included. Stopped using that shitty company years ago
This happens literally every time the price pumps, and has been the case for over a decade.

Coinbase make enough profits to invest in sufficient server resources. Instead they prefer to profit themselves.
I don't understand how self-custody helps you sell at this time?  You still need an exchange
Fake news. Calm down. Coinbase was overwhelmed with users coming onto the site. Ofc it's gonna crash the site. Armstrong already commented about it almost immediately after it happened.
Not everyone. Believe that....whales bought and sold.
They make their money from transactions and would have no incentive to stop people from buying/selling. The only situation where it makes any sense at all is a mass exit from an exchange (aka a "bank run") where the institution may have liquidity issues cashing people out all at once.
Both Buying & Selling. Think they just couldn‚Äôt keep up. The Frenzy just started, Coinbase better be prepared for the next wave.
Seems their servers got overloaded. CAN WE SAY BULLISH AS FUCK? ü´°
Traffic surge? Lol. Been in crypto over 10 years. And everytime there is a rally you can't access Coinbase.¬†
Nobody was going to sell anyway. Just stop complaining we haven‚Äôt even reached the halving yet
It wasn‚Äôt just Coinbase, Gemini also froze
Serious question. How do you sell and cash out without a centralized exchange? 

If you go full self custody do you not need to transfer to an exchange in order to take profits?
Question...I self custody my Bitcoin.  However, when I want to sell, I move it to coin base, execute the sale, then transfer the dollars to my bank 
Is there a better way to accomplish this?  Keep the hate, a real question from someone still learning.
Can‚Äôt drop Coinbase stock like that! To many people sell the price on stock exchanges drop significantly and they lose investors like Kevin Durant
Or it shows how this is all just a giant scam. Once volume is low you can trade‚Ä¶what a great currency.  If you disagree I‚Äôd love to sell you some EQ coins.
Don‚Äôt you need to return to a CEX if you want to sell?
Coinbase and others win money with fees, basically us buying and selling, so that crash was actually financially hurt coinbase : p
I couldn't even send to a self custody wallet yesterday. RIP anyone that wants to use defi. It's fixed now though.
Please don't post when you have no idea what you are talking about.
Gemini FTW
You should be thanking them you paper handed b%‚Ç¨¬•#
These traffic surges have been happening every bull run. They have been using the same excuses since 2017
The app went down for maybe like an hour they didn‚Äôt block people from selling, ridiculous, guy probably had $2,500 on there too
Self custody has its own set of risks
Haha, okay sorry for laughing, but I'm not trying to sell right now and much like the bitcoin cycle this is not my first time to this rodeo... like clock work.  I don't hate coin base, but I'll go ahead and predict you'll see this again multiple times before next year.   Your take away from this should be to take self custody, and sign up on multiple exchanges doing full kyc and making sure you can round trip between bank, exchange and wallet with each.  When shit really takes off (and not this isn't it yet) you may find that only one of multiple exchanges is still operational and currently not signing up new customers.
so wwhat's the difference between a CEX traffic surge and a DEX traffic surge?

we should just go with DEX
That's why you take your coins off of CEXs and trade on DEXs from your wallet
Cex still owes me 30 btc from an ipo I launched years ago.
Ok, but self custody doesnt help when you have to sell anyway. I mean, if you want to sell you have to send crypto from your wallet to the exchange
Coinbase is the worst CEX to trust, Kraken is way better if you're a US citizen. If you're from Europe I don't know what the hell are you doing on Coinbase
Ok let's say Coinbase did it on purpose. First - why would they? They get profits from trading fees, so the times of volatility are the most profitable for Coinbase.
And secondly - how would self custody help you in this situation, if you still need Coinbase/Robinhood/Binance to sell Bitcoin for actual money?
So they aren‚Äôt letting you paper hand your bag for some vape juice? Rough bro.
It definitely brings back nostalgic conspiracy theories during the 2021 ATHs and the exchanges had "outages" or "technical difficulties"  when things were pumping.  Things that make you go hmmmmmm ü§î ??
im sure you will move the market with your 187$ sell
Genius. Everuone was tryong to access which overloaded the servers making them unresponsive. This is a common problem. Thats why you can place orders and your crypto will be sold or u will buy at certain prices even if you cant access the exvhange due sn overload...
Binance (non US) and Kraken are daddies. Or a DEX.
COINBASE IS NOT UR FRIEND
Why would anyone be selling when we aren't even in the post halving bull market yet
Yeah, I totally agree. No private keys‚ÄîNot your coins. Self custody is what the heart of Bitcoin was about. I don‚Äôt believe there were supposed to be gatekeepers (CEX) and regulations and SEC control. It‚Äôs was always about non-KYC and wild Wild West yall. At least I hold those values still
It still seems coinbase is unusable. This is really bad form, they need to sort their servers out.
Why sell? Its just getting started
Has anyone used fidelity? Might be moving to them in the future. All my normal investments are on there through my wife‚Äôs account. This shit is infuriating. I didn‚Äôt plan to sell anyways, but still.
Selling hurts the pamp for the big boys. Wait until they pull the rug, you will be able to sell just fine then so they can accumulate your crypto for next time.
Bro are you braindead? Coinbase wants you to trade at the highest price possible, they charge a percent fee. It's a software glitch not a conspiracy. Some intern pushed some shitty code, calm down.
I was about to hit sell when the app refreshed and everything was gone‚Ä¶mfers
Nothingburger.

Besides anyone selling now will almost assuredly be kicking themselves a month from now.
Same homie i have like 90% and 10% on cb this is robin hood all over again imo
But of course you can still buy more Bitcoin on Coinbase. You just can't sell yours.
Op I hope you know you are literally guilty of FUD for no reason at all. Stop thinking everything is some conspiracy. Legitimately go outside
lol ‚Äòforced everyone from not being able to sell‚Äô. Dramatic much?
traffic surge or not, fuck coinbase
RH is fucked too. My $20k account just vanished and only showing $4k. Waiting for chat service to figure this out‚Ä¶. Wtf
[deleted]
OP you wanted to sell? üìÑ üñêÔ∏è üê©
It‚Äôs like people don‚Äôt believe crypto is just a big fucking con üòÇ
Are dapps down too? Can anyone confirm. Last bull run this happened a few times during high volume times, guess they are still not ready.
DownDetector for reference
Why would you sell. And why would you have anything there in the first place..
To be honest the DEX on Solana was acting funny. Big price spreads.
Everything is back to normal now. You want to sell? Sell now. That happens every time there is super hype. They can't handle it and it's normal. Happened many times. It also happens with e-commerce sites in discount days.
Binance didn't have any issues btw
I couldn't stand coinbase after I was told by support to just add $10 of ETH so the system could tell me how much it would cost to swap one coin to another and they couldn't give me an estimate, unlike binance where I'd see what the rate is and changed in real time. In the end I needed $130 worth of ETH to trade $100 of one coin to another
Same happened to me. I cannot sell on Coinbase, when I try to sell it showed I do not have anything to sell.
Also I have sell order, but it does not show up in the incomplete transactions either. 
When I try to sell it shows I do not have BTC to sell .
But on a home screen I have my balance of BTC correct....

How come it can be legal to do this?
For iPhone recommendations for wallet‚Ä¶ Coinbase,exodus any other suggestions??? I was kicked off robinhood.
Pump and dump is real!
same with my account. "Sell" button is disabled for more than a week as March 20, 2024 ... crazy
Yep, right as it peaked my balance went to $0. This shit is too shady. I am done with coinbase. I have been trying to set up kraken but the app keeps getting stuck in the verification steps so that doesn't give me much confidence to put a large sum of money there either.
Shut the fuck up already and quit spreading this doomsdayer bullshit
100% a ‚Äúhalt‚Äù in stock terms.

BTC was going too high too fast for the elites to benefit from so they pulled the plug to gain an advantage again.
Your first time dealing with crypto? Although I agree with self custody if you cant sell you cant sell. Did you write this in a rush lol
Oh no how am I gonna sell!? Oh wait, I have a cold wallet... and I also don't want to sell.
The saaaame exact shit happened with amc and gme stock lol
OP is regarded. Coinbase is under peak load, autoscaling infra is not magic. If you have too many users due to hi demand, even an autoscaling system can be overwhelmed if the load increases too fast for autoscaling to keep up, or service limits are hit.

It's not a conspiracy, you just don't know how anything works.
My account looks good ü§∑üèª

Coinbase locked my funds the last time the value was this high and didnt release them until 6 months later after the value was less then half. They provided no reason, but i assume it was because my email was included in a breach i didnt know of until it was too late. My account was safe, but because there were people (trying) to breach it and coinbase support takes months at a time to reply i lost a lot of money with them. Thats the short version. Ive been offline ever since. Point of the story fuck coinbase and fuck there non existint support, do not ever trust them if you care at all about your money.
Self custody is why crypto will never be mainstream.
Digital garbage go bye bye
Lol ponzi scheme tho
This is why you don't buy crapto
Self custody still won't help you sell tho. Sure you can trade from BTC to something else with dapps, but you can't get out of crypto without a centralized exchange
Ok, so we shouldn‚Äôt use CEX‚Äôs. Got it.

Then how do I sell to fiat and transfer to my bank account?
Not true. At all. Was just a glitch for some.
Thts why I‚Äôm rocking with Kuswap, dex built on a fully decentralized blockchain built by a defi community, the actual true purpose of crypto, if you stop let centralized actors fck you in crypto you‚Äôre  a pleb

This is what I was told when celsius had its fiasco
This post is a bit sensational isn‚Äôt it?
In the GME days we called it Robin Hands.
it has nothing to do with "diamond hands" when an exchange  *steals*  customer funds, sherlock.üôÑ
and as so many others have done. how are you so unaware of what has gone on these past several years??

Yeah the page and app are down. Displaying $0 balance but Coinbase says that funds are safe. Relax folks. This is my 3rd market cycle and this shit happens to Coinbase every single fucking time. They need to invest more money into fucking servers. SMH what a bunch of clowns they are.

Edit: Site is back up. You can see your balance again.
r/cc is so in love with conspiracy theories.  Exchanges crash every bull market since the invention of crypto but it's the last thing people are willing to accept.  Coinbase stealing your money is a much more enjoyable narrative.
This, I highly doubt this is a coordinated effort to keep counbase users from buying/selling. It's more of a BTC went nuts to the tune of almost 20% in 48 hours. Here in the past 6 hours it went from high 50s to mid 60s for a bit. I'm sure coinbase got absolutely hammered, and things broke down. 

This is common in the tech space. I work in the video game industry and companies have poor server stability, not enough resources to handle large instant loads, among dozens and dozens of other possibilities.
Coinbase BTC volume today 3B. BTC volume today 73B

That's 4.1%, right?

I doubt that is enough liquidity for such a move
[deleted]
Which happens way too often. What kind of company are they running.
Server overload. Happens. People are overexaggerating things.
Does that mean we should short coinbase (COIN)?
Puts on coinbase........!
when will you people realize that crypto is a scam and blockchain is a joke? they haven't yet, apparently. just because morons are pouring money into it and propping up the price doesn't mean it's worth ANYTHING.
The HODL'ing will continue until server stability improves

OP's needlessly hysterical freakout has aged predictably poorly.

I don't believe some of these people have the emotional temperament to be in this.

&#x200B;

>Self-custody is literally so important and this is why. Robinhood pt 2. These CEX‚Äôs don‚Äôt want us to make money, they want them to make money. I‚Äôm 90% in self-custody, but even just having the 10% I have on the Coinbase CEX blocked is just rage inducing. I didn‚Äôt even want to sell but it‚Äôs the principle. How dare they. Genuinely. Fuming.

&#x200B;

This is not the emotional mindset of a stable person. Nevermind the fact that if you have BTC and want to sell it, it doesn't matter if you self custody it you still need to sell it off on a CEX.
Oh they are aware

I was worried for a moment 

All good then üôÑ
Yeah, likely an issue with extremely high traffic volume, maybe a DDOS attack. Seriously seriously doubt Coinbase is attempting anything shady. Bitcoins not even at an ATH, why would they Robinhood themselves for pennies
Yeah the page and app are down. Displaying $0 balance but Coinbase says that funds are safe. Relax folks. This is my 3rd market cycle and this shit happens to Coinbase every single fucking time. They need to invest more money into fucking servers. SMH what a bunch of clowns they are.
Unless they are being incompetent on purpose, that seems malicient
Yet ‚Äúsufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice‚Äù.
To a large extent it doesn‚Äôt matter why. Point is they are blocking people.
I can‚Äôt see that quote without the nerdy kid being interviewed in the mall voice and I know that‚Äôs where you got it
They are fully wfh, I thought that means they are hyper productive?
that "statement" makes it so easy for malicious people to pretend incompetence. Such naive bullshit.
No kidding!  Just Coinbase Things.
Price wouldn't be pumping if people weren't buying and selling though so the exchange probably wouldn't be down
I mean sure but you can transfer your holdings to a stable coin and once an off ramp is working again you'll be ok
There's lots of options for off-ramps, relying on only one is setting yourself up for issues when stuff goes sideways.
You can sell for stable coins on a DEX if you self custody or swap out of one asset to another. Also, I have access to multiple CEXs. So I can pick and choose which one to move crypto to if I want to use a CEX to sell. I like Coinbase as a CEX for fiat onramps. And it is one of my two main CEXs. But I would not keep more than a small part of my portfolio on any given CEX. 

With that said, I don't think using Coinbase to custody is a horrible idea if you are new to Crypto and only have a small amount invested in it. For those with larger portfolios and more crypto experience, a hardware wallet and self custody may be better.
Yeah and there are plenty of DEX with off ramp you can use instead of CB
Decentralized exchanges are not affected
This is what I don't get. I have my eth in a ledger wallet but it's f wanted to sell wouldn't I still have to go to a place like coinbase?
can use DEX to convert to BTC and use BTC ATM
Or you can transfer to a different exchange‚Ä¶
You know coins can be traded with anyone, right? No just centralized exchanges...
This is so not true, people can trade with other people directly...you know, peer to peer?
Honestly I was looking for the right fud comment to reply with essentially this but might as well just agree with yours 
Anyone who thinks a<1 hour service outage affects them that much must be outraged by multiple hour possibly even day long transaction times on BTC

But I have a feeling the people saying this is why you self custody are also BTC maxis and probably somehow still against L2 scaling
[deleted]
Great point. People seem to miss that.
So true, you'd spend a lot more on fees, and by the time the transaction is sent which is from hours to days depending on the fee selected, the price is already different.
Most people want to trade bitcoin, not hold, if someone wants to hold them I get the argument and it is a better option to store it on a cold wallet instead.
Never heard of DEXs and stable coins, have we?
[removed]
One day it might go down and not come back.
That‚Äôs also what happened with RobinHood. They operate on a trust module that lets you trade without the money actually changing hands. They had so many people trading at once that they literally did not have enough money to fulfill the orders, so they had to halt trading to make sure they could actually afford to fulfill all the incoming orders
Self custody is definitely for trading. That is the entire point of decentralised exchanges.
Reading through this thread and thinking the same thing. Mad I can‚Äôt sell on Coinbase so I‚Äôll move to cold storage where I can‚Äôt sell. Feel like I‚Äôm missing something.
his going to run outside and sell his bitcoin on the street corner
Joe Public is way more likely to lose their coins trying to self custody than for Coinbase to go under.
Joe Public is gonna keep getting Mt.Gox'd and FTX'd until he learn self custody
There‚Äôs literally an error message stating that they are working to resolve the issue. I looked on Advanced Trade and all of my assets are still there. Looks like it‚Äôs just an issue with the front end
"no, everyone is against us!!" This sub, probably.
Please tell me you‚Äôre joking.

Do you think a Coinbase server triggered an actual BTC crash? 

Please tell me you‚Äôre kidding. 

What do you think, that BTC is hosted on Coinbase? The same Coinbase which contributed a mere 5% of today‚Äôs total trading volume for Bitcoin? 

Do you realize that a server glitch has nothing to do with actual prices of BTC, much less a server glitch on an exchange which provides little volume?
regards need to get off the gme sub and realize that not everything is a conspiracy against them. For people "investing" in technology they are technology illiterate.
This is exactly it but of course people love to have their tin foil hat theories
Not necessarily. If they're overloaded by traffic, they'll be overloaded in a crucial moment too.
I agree with the sentiment, but an hour? Can go from Ledger to CB to initiate bank transfer in a matter of about 5-10 minutes. With Eth anyway, not sure where current BTC speed is
What about buying? Would you still buy between now and the halving at current prices?
[deleted]
Good idea to have multiple CEX‚Äôs so you can sell at one that isn‚Äôt blocking, including non KYC ones so you can sell to USDT and then transfer USDT to Coinbase later when they allow you to sell it to fiat
Honestly it's easier just to sell into like usdc or some other stable coin and attach that stable coin to your card..... You can do that in a lot of places just in America we are behind
If you've had it for 4 years and actually used it you're not telling the truth. This happened during the last bull run too.
Not sure, if you check the Coinbase sub you can see everyone‚Äôs having the same ‚Äúglitch‚Äù or ‚Äúbug‚Äù where wallets are showing 0.
Yeah the page and app are down. Displaying $0 balance but Coinbase says that funds are safe. Relax folks. This is my 3rd market cycle and this shit happens to Coinbase every single fucking time. They need to invest more money into fucking servers. SMH what a bunch of clowns they are.
They've gone through so many cycles and each time it's the same thing. Honestly, I'm tired of it. I think I'm going to move away from coinbase as a result.
[deleted]
You ever shake your head at the easily-conditioned mobs listening to a speech stereotype in movies? How everyone instantly becomes an insane NPC? This is this thread.
I‚Äôm showing a zero balance and my transaction history is gone.
I feel like this outage gonna be the whole day.
And yes. This is insane. Literally I guarantee people missed out big time due to this glitch
Curious about this too
DEX!

Where gas fees will be humongous lol
From Coinbase? You can‚Äôt. Everyone‚Äôs wallets are showing 0 as some ‚Äúglitch‚Äù or ‚Äúbug‚Äù. They don‚Äôt have access to their crypto to sell at all.
There isn‚Äôt. This is just your typical mind numbing echo chamber FUD.
Really? Ftx wasn't the last straw?
Bro kraken was just displaying 41 k for btc.

Love kraken, but they‚Äôre not immune to glitches.
P2P bisq or other
P2P bisq or other
"Some"
lol.
Lmao yeah this. Sorry I don‚Äôt always verbally phrase things the clearest.
I hope that‚Äôs all it is. Fuming at the thought it is not.
No.  There‚Äôs plenty of on and off ramps out there.  Most major DeFi platforms have one
This isn't the point.   The point is people who want or need to sell can't.
I use it (minimally). Fees are outrageous and there is no ability to send off platform presently. *Hopefully* that‚Äôs coming but I would wait. So it‚Äôs basically exclusively for trading atm.
Fidelity doesn‚Äôt do crypo‚Ä¶ 

Okay maybe it does lol. I dk shit. üòÇ
Why would you sell 50 days before a halving? Understand bitcoin or stay away
Dude I wanted to buy, tf?
Mine does not. $0 for everything.
I did not, but it‚Äôs the principle that‚Äôs pissing me off.
it's become a pyramid scheme, the big fish get to dump it when ever they feel like the markets hitting a peak and leave all the small guys as the bag holders. it's been obvious for years that those with money are manipulating all the small people into buying more, raising the price so they can dump their stake, over and over and over again.
Never heard of decentralized exchanges?
This is not the same as Celsius. It was a traffic surge. It‚Äôs happened on Coinbase roughly 400 times since they started. But I don‚Äôt disagree with OP‚Äôs point about self custody.
Still waiting for the Celsius distribution to hit my CB account
What massive pumps? Shit isn‚Äôt that different to yesterday, slightly down even :/
Yeah can understand the frustration but there‚Äôs obviously no malicious intent behind the outage. Coinbase are a far cry from FTX and comply with all US regulations as a publicly listed firm. Fact is it‚Äôs just difficult always being prepared for volumes and traffic to the site to spike that much that quickly.
[deleted]
I don‚Äôt recall anyone calling it that. Robinhood allowed selling while preventing buying, effectively dumping the price of the stock.

Coinbase merely halted trading both directions. Far less impact on price one way or the other.
Pun intended?
Uhhhhh‚Ä¶ tell me you weren‚Äôt in the gme days without telling me you werent there üòÇ
What are you, 7?  This wasn‚Äôt that long ago.
You are the only one that said this lol
They turned off the buy button.
Coinbase is a publicly traded US company. If you think they're gonna steal customer funds, you need to stop huffing gas.
It's called learning master ! Maybe you never did that maybe you was born with crypto knowledge and insider info.. maybe you're just a troll ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è in both scenario the end of your comment is such a useless pos ! How can you not know something you don't know ???? FFS xD logic of a 5 yo
>They need to invest more money into fucking servers

Not to get too into the weeds, but a quick Google search seems to indicate they run on AWS. Things would likely be way worse if there ran their own servers.
Now when the Kraken flash crashes start happening we'll really be on the run.
Exactly. Comparing this to robin hood is complete bs. Coinbase just has bad servers. It was down for like 20 mins.
‚ÄúCoinbase crashed muh Bitcoin‚Äù, I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyesü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Thanks for the rare common sense here. 

‚ÄúDoubt‚Äù it‚Äôs not enough liquidity is not even the word - Coinbase doesn‚Äôt have anywhere close to enough volume. People here are very U.S. centric and ignorant of the market, so things like the above insanity actually get 700 upvotes. I don‚Äôt have the words for it.
Every platform I use is bugging out today, it‚Äôs ducking weird
Having similar issues.  A paranoid response is not normally my go to, but anyone think this is weird all on the heels of national cell phone outages?
No
But this dip you goo
Dont
They dump it from 64k to 58k to take out the stops ü§°
They need to invest in network security then. They are a billion dollar organization and their customers are being taken advantage of. 

If they can‚Äôt get off their ass to put protections in place then they don‚Äôt deserve to hold my money. It‚Äôs negligence at best, stealing at worst.
I disagree completely. 

Let's explore this.
Too much selling caused a glitch.
Ok but what about when tons of buy orders are coming in? No problem there huh?

So u xan put money in but u can't take it out
Maybe it‚Äôs the opposite of shady. The hedge boys have shorted bitcoin. On other exchanges price had a plummet blip and loads of stop losses were triggered. The candle sticks are out of this world. For such a short period in a very upward movement the candle stick spread is so bizarre. Lots of (most likely newer) retailers have lost positions here. I can‚Äôt quite understand how that can happen so out of the blue and then revert to same price/ trajectory in a similar blink of an eye. 

Perhaps Coinbase saw it coming and thought uhuh. Not having this.
Spending on server hardware and technician services can never compete with the increasing scale of user request. Math just never lines up.
It ain‚Äôt people that pump price by buying and selling‚Ä¶it‚Äôs institutions ‚Ä¶big,big institutional money is what moves the price, not ‚Äúpeople‚Äù like you and me‚Ä¶ that is why a price dip when Coinbase is down should be viewed as suspect. Not saying Coinbase being down is intentional and for nefarious reasons but sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt say it isn‚Äôt. Definitely suspect.
This works with everything except bitcoin. I don't know of any dex that takes native chain btc, if you do let me know!
Yes but then you will be subjected to tax on both transfers.
What's a DEX that lets users trade BTC without wrapping it first? 

CEXs are also limited in some states within the US. Kraken, for example, doesn't serve New York or Washington. 

Between those two factors, it's actually difficult to off-ramp BTC via reputable exchanges for some folks. Sometimes the cost is exorbitant spreads like Coinify if you try to use Ledger Live's Buy/Sell plugins.
Any1 have good advice on what YouTube videos can help teach a boomer to use DEX‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ L2‚Ä¶.  Bridging ‚Ä¶ etc ???
Conversions are taxable events
Wait wait wait, crypto isn't just made up bits of code to make more USD????
If I had 1 BTC I want to sell right now I'm going to have a fucking terrible time trying to find someone in person that I trust enough to sell to
maybe they tried self-custody lightning and didn't like it? 


‰πÅ‡ºº‚òØ‚Äø‚òØ‚úø‡ºΩ„Ñè
Times like this are good for a laugh, at least.
If exchange services are down, you cant trade stablecoins either. Coinbase has USDC as well, which you couldn't trade during the outage. 

As for DEX's, i'm aware but never used one. They could be an option, sure, but that's still an exchange of some kind and not "cold storage."
> DEXs and stable coins

What you want everyone to wrap their BTC? You know how insane the transaction fee's would get if even a minuscule fraction of the trading on coinbase got pushed into a DEX?
Yes, to store computer code. If you have the keys for your coins you can always sell them on a different exchange. Cryptocurrencies aren't going to disappear if another exchange shuts down for any reason, but Coinbase isn't going anywhere. Service is already being restored, and this is very obviously just from a surge of users in response to the massive price increase. 

I assume, at this point, this thread is just attracting people from the rest of reddit.
While that is theoretically possible, if that is your concern on days like this then you lack any common sense whatsoever. Even Mt. GOX and FTX customers are getting their money back, eventually. If Coinbase did steal customer funds, it wouldn't happen during a random outage on +10% day, Brian Armstrong would be immediately arrested and end up sharing a prison cell with SBF, and all coinbase customers would eventually get their money back after a lengthy bankruptcy  process.
A decentralized exchange still requires you to put your money in a hot wallet, and those can be compromised in a variety of ways. "Self custody" is about putting your coins in cold storage, and if they're in cold storage then you can't trade them.
[removed]
You're not it's just the loonies.
> Joe Public is way more likely to lose their coins trying to self custody than for Coinbase to go under.

So true and every time I say it or say anything like it I just get the "not your keys not your coins" mantra mindlessly repeat back to me. No thought put into it, just fingers in ears and la-la-la levels of productive conversation.
Bingo, spot on correct. Or Binance. Or Kucoin. Or any large exchange. People here have no clue even after multiple bear markets, these exchanges aren‚Äôt going anywhere at all.

The other way round, services are going to emerge that can feed the demand. They already are - the ETF.
I have about a third of my portfolio in Coinbase and sleep like a baby. If it‚Äôs good enough for fidelity and blackrock it‚Äôs good enough for me.
Coinbase being publicly traded doesnt set itslef apart from these?
Yeah, figured as much. I was wondering about some workaround just to check if funds are still parked. Thanks for that info
[removed]
You're thinking of r/superstonk
Look at the timing. It doesn't take much. It's all psychological.
BTC transaction validation is an hour and will stay an hour for the foreseeable future.

ETH validation is only ~10 min, but you trade away speed for gas costs.
how much does that cost you per transfer?
Definitely looking to buy, but not at current prices. However, I‚Äôve been waiting for a dip since around 43k.
And the precious one too...
I am that same user lol. But these things happen to websites of even the biggest companies in the world.
It‚Äôs a weird coping mechanism that happens anytime people lose money. Happens in the stock market, must be a hedge fund conspiracy. Happens in sports betting, must be Vegas rigging things. People don‚Äôt want to accept the loss
Same here
DEXes don't give you cash, they just give you more worthless coins that promise to give you cash later.
I didn‚Äôt have any crypto with them.
Yea if it‚Äôs intentional that is fucked but I am pretty sure it‚Äôs that their hardware or software broke
Oh. How about Ebay?
They do actually. Well I should say investments at least, not sure you can take your coins off.
They‚Äôve had Fidelity Crypto for awhile now, but you can‚Äôt self-custody
[deleted]
They have ETF of BTC which is similar
Well I wanted to buy, so fuck me right.
bwaahaha, you're funny
I mean when a lot of users all go onto something at once these things can happen.
Lol

It feels pretty normal cuz they just can‚Äôt handle the sudden influx of users when prices jump or dump
Worse is the manipulation to drive liquidations.
If you‚Äôre still waiting, there‚Äôs a problem. I think most of the distributions should have happened by now.
Yeah it‚Äôs almost like this post is trying to stoke fear
Can confirm closest I saw back then was ‚ÄúRobbin da hood‚Äù
During the covid crash in March 2020, Robinhood did indeed prevent selling.
Yes bro Robinhood prevented selling don‚Äôt use that bullshit app they will do it again
Robbin your potential realized earnings
Whatever it is it's not right. People need to complain about this so it stops.
you have a LOT to learn about publicly traded. USA  companies..but keep drinking the kool-aid, Einstein.üôÑ
Lol Crypto Bros ... "Fight"...

I'll stick to my Vanguard Indexes... Bitcoin isn't even Bitcoin anymore.

Crypto is crack.
Yeah, adding servers takes some time. Can't just flick a switch, especially with physical ones. For AWS or Azure it still can take some time, some CFO will have to sing it etc. approve budgets etc. while admin is sitting there and waiting with his hands tied lol.
This stuff is just going to happen in any sort of field at some point.
That makes zero difference. Cloud servers are not anything magical. It‚Äôs still the responsibility of the customer to size the compute and storage appropriately in cloud services.
Unless AWS is being compelled to restrict them by the DOJ.  Coinbase is being sued by the SEC for running an unregistered securities exchange and clearing house.  But this is civil.  If during this investigation, the DOJ also decided to open up an investigation, they can compel platform hosts to do a lot of things including shutting down services.
Oh god. I remember those doom wicks. RIP anyone using leverage
How about Self custody and DEX.

F all CEXs
F CB, How about Self custody and DEX.
How about Self custody and DEX.

F all CEXs
Pretty sure CB is on AWS, quite possibly an AWS problem and not CB.
Whelp, was a good run but I guess the internets going away now

Dad did always say it was a fad
Are you saying ducking or fucking?
It's claus schwab and Jim cramer.
Supposedly there is an azure outage right now‚Ä¶. Or was and it was just fixed.

Having trouble finding info on it, but saw a post on Reddit about it in the last hour or two¬†
It's not the same. The glitch happens during selloffs because it is a cascade of bot orders all selling everything at once including alts so the systems get overloaded. This is not the same during the run up as basically mostly btc was only running with a few alts here and there.   
When it crashes it all crashes at once but when BTC is rising it is generally on its own.
The reality is we don‚Äôt know what caused it. But there‚Äôs a difference between a million people all draining liquidity at once from Coinbase by selling, and a million people all adding liquidity at once. The former puts way more stress on the network than the latter because there‚Äôs a dozen more security measures to make sure there‚Äôs nothing fraudulent happening. Yeah Coinbase fucked up, but assuming they‚Äôre out to fuck their customers is conspiracy theory territory
Plus, adding servers on the fly takes some time too. People think you can just flick the switch. And when it's quiet during the bear market companies scale down with servers based on demand.
No, it's really not. And wtf are you talking about, people literally got BTC in the tens of thousands of dollars before institutions genuinely started getting involved.

EDT: this sub has been invaded by trend chasing morons
Thorswap you can swap cross chain with native btc
Thats you hold wrapped btc.
If you use WBTC you can use DEX
Hydranet Core DEX. Native BTC to native ETH, USDT and a few others. Trading limit of 1k dollars though.
Wouldn't you only be seeing a taxable gain on one transfer though?
Shapeshift and Thorswap
Hahah? I was more talking about against BTC L2 as a concept the same way the entire chain got divided over blocksize resulting in BCH and the general lack of upgrades the BTC code has received. Even stuff that satoshi already drafted
DEXs are an option if a CEX is down, can always use them. And yes to use one you'd use a wallet that's not in cold storage.
The actual USDC token will be on the Blockchain, you'll be able to trade them without any cex
> Even Mt. GOX and FTX customers are getting their money back, eventually

bahahahaha.  Mt Gox is 10 years and counting.

> If Coinbase did steal customer funds, it wouldn't happen during a random outage on +10% day, Brian Armstrong would be immediately arrested 

And if it's Barry in accounting?  Or Sazzad in backend server support?

Every single one of you chumps thinks it could never happen to you.  You know what the real reason is?  You can't control your gambling addiction.
You're confused about the term. Self custody means you're holding your own private keys and are in full control of them - as opposed to a having a CEX be the custodian. You can have self custody in a cold OR a hot wallet.
I have more invested in crypto than probably 95% of posters here and a third of it is just sitting in coinbase & I sleep like a baby. In fact, with the stories coming out about Ledger last year I sometimes wonder if I should have less of my portfolio on a hardware wallet.

I think more than anything people on reddit just want to try and fit in/act like they're experts, so they'll say whatever. For most people on this sub reading this, Coinbase (read: specifically Coinbase, not CEXs in general) is probably a safer bet than self custody. Probably.
It has been around for a decade, publicly traded, licensed to conduct business in NY (strictest regulations), the custodian for ALL of the major ETFs.... 

I mean it's not perfect, and the support sucks if anything goes wrong. But it is still the most reputable CEX.
What are you even talking about? The glitch was fixed within an hour‚Ä¶. You sound bitter.
No. I'm not. If you search, you will find a plethora of threads saying things such as, but not limited to, "they are coming for us!!!!!!!111!!"
Gez, guess I‚Äôve been out of the loop for a while if BTC fees are less than Eth, how the turntables. Didn‚Äôt know BTC was a full hour for confirm either, always thought it was more like 20, that‚Äôs significant
What's funny about waiting since 43k is that the dip from this price will probably be 43k lol
I mean still, that didn't ring any bells to you? Like wow, I should not trust exchanges
You cannot take your coins out of fidelity and you cannot transfer coins in
Nobody called it Robin Hands.  That comment is stolen valor for those of us with positions at the time.
That was 6-9 months before the GME days
If you kept your btc, you‚Äôve already realized your earnings. hth
Publicly traded companies have never done anything wrong, and they're run by complete angels.
Yea, care to enlighten me? When was the last time one literally stole funds and ran off with them? I don't think you even know what the words mean and I'm pretty sure you're a literal child. You need to sit down and crack open a dictionary, not be giving advice to people.
ThisüëåüèΩ
Coinbase is operating on infrastructure as code, meaning automatic server deployments across availability zones when certain thresholds are hit. This can literally take a few minutes depending on the application and server image. It's most likely a budget constraint rather than a problem with their capacity management planning. It's impossible to know what day BTC is going to moon and when there's going to be an anamolous spike in user activity bc of it. They probably just hit their budget threshold for February
Reading your comment, I'm just imagining some CFO singing some special song to increase the aws servers they pay for
I run AWS servers. You basically have unlimited scalability if you set it up.
That's what autoscaling groups are for....

Have you seen that warning from head of fbi last month or so saying to prepare for a monster cyber attack?
Duck the ducking duckers!
No one can make me believe coinbase didn't prepare their systo handle this scenario. 

I'm calling bullshit on their part
I think the reality is we don't know what caused it because we'll be lied to. But if we all feel the same way about what happened, why, and because of our sentiment of the same company, I'd sooner think we are right and we're also right in thinking we're being lied to.
Did they stop support for thorswap on trustwallet?¬†
Yep a lot of misinformation going around regarding crypto taxes. Makes sense when the first sign of technical difficulties at coinbase is a conspiracy. Not like this happened before and was always server issues.
Thanks! At first glance looks like fees are really high at the moment (to be expected I guess), but this is a great option to keep in the back pocket for when CEXs freeze up.
Then they'll get Barry! Nobody is escaping the long arm of US financial law. 

>Every single one of you chumps thinks it could never happen to you.

Going on 11 years and haven't lost any to a scam yet, I must be doing something right. Having an irrational fear of the single largest, most successful, and highly regulated exchange, and then putting your money in shady anonymous projects and startups, is exactly how people end up losing their money the most. Remember the backdoors in to Trezor wallets? Most of you self custody types are too incompetent to do it yourself and end up giving your money away to the actual thieves and scammers.
I know myself, I know how bad I am with passwords and needing to write stuff down or take screenshots for important information in my life. I mis-click on stuff and get pop-ups as an image loads under my thumb, so much stuff happens over the course of a day, a week, a lifetime. Id lose my coins in under a month if I tried hard to self custody. ***Something*** would happen, and then I'd be here making a desperate post (like I've seen a million times) asking what went wrong only for some snarky ass to condescendingly tell my that the air gapped cold wallet that I bought with a burner phone passed by a NFC equipped gas pump that surreptitiously uploaded malware on it designed to watch for small test transactions and allow them through and then shunt larger transactions to a third party... Or whatever.

F that. I'll use coin base who hopefully have people there who's job is is to stay current on all this security stuff that I can barely wrap my head around between changing diapers and getting the kids to school...

Not my keys not my coins? Still not my coins if I *immediately lose the keys.*

I'm the guy who gets logged out of Facebook and can't log back in, puts my password in that I know is correct nine times. Then tries to change the password only to be told "sorry you can't use the same password"
Good lord, you must've been out of the loop for the better part of a decade. ETH fees were hitting thousands of gas in the last bull run.

BTC has always been about one block every ten minutes, and most places require six block validations before a transaction is considered "finalized." I've had it take as long as 90 minutes if miners were just unusually slow at validating blocks.
I have roughly half on personal wallet and the other half on coinbase. 

I enjoyed the advanced analytics on coinbase and the ease of swapping which is why I keep half there.
exactly my point..so many people think they're run by perfect, moral angels..it's astounding how many believe the nonsense..guess they don't read or get out much.
"...and ran off with them??"
that's NOT at all what I meant Coinbase was doing, omg.

it's amazing how much gets lost in the comprehension skills  weeds. but if you don't understand how it works I really don't have the energy to explain it..but if you still care, you definitely have some reading to do.
Right. It‚Äôs not like they have a 60bn valuation, right ? Somehow it‚Äôs acceptable that they have the SLA (and customer support quality) of a basement startup
I was wondering, what song do they sing ??? Is it a company secret ???
You also have unlimited bills then lol.
I'm in Canada and the dog sled team is late with our news unfortunately
Source?
This literally happens to TradFi exchanges too. These systems are not immune to overloads, glitches, or service providers fucking up.
> Then they'll get Barry! Nobody is escaping the long arm of US financial law. 

bahahahahahaha.  You can shout at the television!!!  "We wuz robbed!!!?!?!?!  I hope he goes to prison for a long long time.  Honey, let's share our packet of ramen tonight.  It's hard starting over.  And we could both lose some weight anyway."

Who are ya kidding?  She'll dump you in a flash for being such a chump.  "You mean you lost all of our savings because of your gambling addiction?"
>it has nothing to do with "diamond hands" when an exchange steals customer funds, sherlock.üôÑ and as so many others have done. how are you so unaware of what has gone on these past several years??

This is what you wrote and what I replied to. What do you think running off with funds is if not stealing them?
People assuming it‚Äôs budget related lol. Load balancers exist and are certainly implemented.
i guess it has to be a secret, or it would've been publicly known ü§îüò§
You pay by the second, you either have it set up properly with horizontal vm‚Äôs that will spin up on demand and pay the nominal fee which would work out to be approximately fuck all, and absorb this nominal cost, or your servers crash when you get overloaded with demand.

It‚Äôs honestly not expensive, you have to pay to service your user base, and in modern web server management, it‚Äôs not even complicated or difficult to do.

This is a fuck up that was entirely avoidable, and I‚Äôd argue that the loss of fees in the 9 minutes they were down dwarfed the extra vm fees by a couple of orders of magnitude.

Sorry about that I was offline for a few days haha!
Get absolutely right they are not immune to glitches and mess ups however you'll never see them glitch when there's a rug pull and there's a massive sell off however you will see them glitch when people want to get in at a good price and take their money out every single time and this is only on exchanges that are like Coinbase. We have seen multiple complaints about Coinbase every single day so this is nothing new.

It is the very reason I stopped using Coinbase. Thankfully I didn't lose anybody to Coinbase with the exception of sending a test amount of stellar lumens to Coinbase just to see if my wallet transaction would work. As I did that I wanted to convert XLM to USD T however when I went to Coinbase after the transfer I wasn't able to do anything with it and I simply watched the value drop and drop and drop period to the point of where it was worth almost nothing thankfully it was just a test amount and that was at this point two years ago that it removed myself from Coinbase
of course if they ran OFF with funds it would be stealing, too..you're justbassuming far too much about what things mean. but, omg, I give up, LoL!!üòÑ.
Load balancers are definitely implemented and work great when you have enough servers to distribute the load across. I only assume it was a budget issue because costs would be a key reason not to spin up more servers for a brief spike in user volume. Granted, due to the nature of their business, Coinbase should really have capacity management and business continuity plans in place that are regularly tested against these exact scenarios. But I'm assuming due to the lack of competition in the market, Coinbase probably doesn't give a fuck about lowering their recovery time objectives since they won't lose customers over it, or the impact to their margin is less than the the impact of briefly spinning up more servers
Good point !!!!!!
what you mean to say it is not that expensive maybe for the coinbase, but afaik this can easily cost millions if traffic is spikes huge
For me the issue is more along the lines of why the fuck did it show 0 balance? 
If servers are down you wouldn't be able to access at all, why would you be able to access and see a 0 balance: even if trading had halted, still shouldn't zero you funds. I find that odd.

I don't use them anyway, so...  nonetheless it's concerning that they won't pay the man, the impact of this on the customer base is regarded and even more so on their own fee earnings as you said.
Because everyone talking about 'just buy more servers/moar AWS, are they stupid?' are talking out of their ass.  Scaling isn't as easy when there has to be a single shared state across all instances.  The databases and processes that handle messaging can lead to weird bottlenecks and  deadlocks that can't be fixed by simply making more copies of them.

It takes time for even the most skilled programmer to dig through logs and figure out where the problem is coming from and then implement a fix.  It isn't just a matter of cloning VMs on AWS, because that is a simple fix and wouldn't take long to implement and any idiot on the Internet knows how it works so they would have done it if it were an option to fix the problem.
You can horizontally scale your databases and share a single state across them all with dynamic resharding. Don‚Äôt give them an out, they fucked this up it‚Äôs not that hard to do.

They fixed the problem in well under an hour, this was an oversight.
I can tell momma I officially made it: Featured in a Forbes article

‚ÄúThe key to Reddit‚Äôs success is the mods‚Äù

Again with the unpaid labour trope. You guys volunteer to mod subs, you didn‚Äôt interview for it and later accept a job offer to do it. And people created the subs because they felt like it, not because they expected to get paid for it. Unless you work for reddit and they aren‚Äôt paying you for the work, then I don‚Äôt want to hear shit about ‚Äúunpaid labour‚Äù from fucking mods.
In Forbes magazine must be an important person.
This guy is the regard we need.

Why do companies NEED to go public? Seems the result ends with way more ads, scrutiny and pressure from investors for a product to inorganically evolve in order to maximize profitability. Which ends up fucking up a good product
Never imagined that any of you regards would end up at Forbes.

And we've managed to do it all without even trying hard, believe me. Other administrations, they tried to keep things stable, to prevent a downturn. Not us. We went big. Really big. Other countries, they look at us now and they're amazed. They say, 'How did the United States manage to create such a massive Depression?' And I tell them, it takes a special kind of genius. A business genius. 

We've had people, many people, come up to me and say, 'Sir, we never thought we'd see anything like this. It's historic.' And it is. We've set records. Stock market? Down more than ever. Unemployment? Higher than ever. It's incredible. And remember, it's all about making America great. We're doing things that will be talked about for centuries. 

The media, the fake news media, they don't want to give us credit. But the people know. They see the greatness of what we've achieved here. It's a reversal like no other. And we're just getting started. Who knows what else we can accomplish? The ground's the limit. We've got the best people, the very best, working on making this Depression even greater. It's going to be fantastic, folks. You're going to be so depressed, you're going to be sick of being depressed. But it's all part of the plan. Making history, one downturn at a time.

Donald Trump planning to make a National Shitcoin to pay off the 35 Trillion dollar national debt.
So the Genius Donald Trump who likes to call himself the "Crypto President" has proven that he doesn't understand how crypto or bitcoin works when he promised to pay off the US national debt by writing them a little crypto check.

Trump:

>Who Knows maybe we'll pay off our thirty five trillion dollar, hand them a little crypto check right. We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our thirty five trillion Dollars.

Maybe this guy isn't as smart as he thinks he is.

Clip of Trump proving he doesn't understand Crypto or bitcoin

[https://x.com/atrupar/status/1819379866732462375](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1819379866732462375)
He would probably do the most successful rug pull in history if he wanted to, just create that coin, convince everyone that it has government backing, and boom
So 35 trillion a coin by eoy?
I'm still waiting on his much, much better healthcare plan.
"Maybe this guy isn‚Äôt as smart as he thinks he is."

This is the biggest understatement of the millennium.
Trump doesn‚Äôt even know how to run casinos, let alone understand how cryptocurrency works. He bankrupted 3 casinos from 1991 - 2004. Literally, the house always wins and he still managed to fuck that up.
He can put those Pennsylvania coal miners back to work mining the new coin.
Doesn't understand crypto, finance, the concept of money, politics or government. He's literally the guy trying to get into your pants by saying whatever he thinks you want to hear.
This is so stupid.
 Where can I buy it?
"Maybe this guy isn't as smart as he thinks he is."

Maybe??  I would say definitely!!
1. print $35 trillion and buy bitcoin

2. borrow usd using bitcoin as collateral

3. pay off $35 trillion debt

4. use bitcoin collateral to satisfy loan

5. **abolish the fed**
Other administrations, including Obama‚Äôs, have discussed issuing a trillion-dollar coin. In real terms, I don‚Äôt think Donald Trump is far off; what is more likely is that you don‚Äôt fully understand how crypto works in the hands of a US president.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/top-us-officials-discussed-minting-trillion-dollar-coin-memo-reveals
If I had lower morals and more money to create it I‚Äôd make a shitcoin specifically for this flavor of American conservatives. Like why don‚Äôt people do this? It seems like such an easy way to make a lot of money quick.

Scamming the far right seems almost too easy
The more trump talks about crypto, esp after never mentioning it ever and obviously having zero idea about it, the more convinced I am someone has sent him several million $ worth of crypto to circumvent the foreign interference laws, and now trump is doing his best to pump up the price before dumping.¬†
Trump is an idiot, he has no clue how crypto works.
This sub is a political circle jerk. Always is during election year.
More bag holders in the making!
Imagine creating such a coin and convincing China to hold that coin as reserve currency
You have to understand about crypto

Crypto's a very interesting thing

Very high-level in certain ways

Intellectually very high-level.

But.

If we don't do it

China's gonna do it

China's gonna do it

anyway

But if you don't do it China's

doing it.

China's already doing it.

And.

If we don't do it

other countries are gonna do it.

So we might as well be at the forefront.

And we.

There are people in crypto that are very

very

smart people

who do love our country.

And they think it's good.

Who knows maybe we'll pay off our thirty-five

trillion dollars hand them a little crypto check right?

We'll hand them a little bitcoin

and wipe out our thirty-five trillion dollars.

Oh it's going to work easily

It's already prominent

It's moving along

It's very

loosely regulated that's one of the reasons

it's moving along.

But it is a different form of a currency

And.

It's gonna end up benefitting the country.

But if we

shut it down like Biden's trying to

shut it down

Biden doesn't have the

intellect to

shut it down.

Can you imagine this guy's telling you to shut something down

like that?

He has no idea what the hell it is.
Objectively hilarious
I saw no reference to anything but Bitcoin so I'm not sure what youre talking about with "shitcoins", also it sounded pretty clear to me he's advocating for buying large sums for government holdings before another superpower does it first. The first mover advantage is huge because the price is limited. He may not understand it as well as you or I but it seems he's got a plan.
Well he can do that tho
Just make a $35 trillion NFT

Use it to pay off the national debt 

Once it‚Äôs paid off, rug pull the NFT

ü§£ü§£ü§£
Actually, this is an exceptional idea. People will dump Bitcoin to buy a government protected asset.
Vote. Let the Courts send trump to prison
Still waiting for Mexico to pay for the fence!
Honestly I love my crypto and want to see the sector grow via friendly government policies but this weirdo is clueless on how crypto works and my worry is that he will do more harm than good.
I see the same brain algorithm that produced "and then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it‚Äôd be interesting to check that, so that you‚Äôre going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me."
Trump is most definitely an idiot.
He's definitely the President of Idiots....
He's a fucking moron.
Mixing half true things, with nonsense.

Yes US can and maybe should "print" the 35 billion and pay it back. or go default on it.  
They can do that with normal USD. Or they could just disband the the Fed.   
No need for any Trump coin for that.

That will cause huge economic problems. That must be together with a balanced budget and maybe tax cuts to help the collapsing economy.

Something that a Ron Paul could do, but with Trump it would be a collapse
Trump is an idiot, he has no clue how crypto works.
You need a clip to prove Trump doesn‚Äôt understand Bitcoin?

This is the guy who wondered aloud, publicly, if we should drink bleach against Covid

This is the guy who thought we could extinguish hurricanes by bombing them, Sharknado style
Breaking: Trump said a thing
God this guy is so stupid. There‚Äôs a reason crypto is crashing hard right now. He‚Äôs toxic for everything he touches. Would be really fitting that the guy who bankrupted 3 casinos would be the catalyst that ends 4 year cycle theory. What a dumb freak.
Clip of Trump proving he doesn‚Äôt understand Crypto or Bitcoin‚Ä¶or what the National Debt actually is.
Why the flak? That's literally the thought process of memecoin founders
He's a fucking imbecile, and so are all of the MAGA cultists.
Any moron that thinks Trump is pro crypto is just that, a huge moron. Trump is pro Trump, that‚Äôs it, nothing more. He‚Äôll run any scam, swindle, boondoggle, hustle, ponzi, or pyramid do long as he comes out in top. Everyone else involved gets fucked.
Not sure on the details of how he plans to implement this but‚Ä¶.it reminds me of greenbacks that Abraham Lincoln brought in - rather than be beholding to private banks
Maybe they allow bitcoin to appreciate to alpha centuri in comparison to their shit coin US dollar, then sell a fraction of their bitcoin to pay off their phony $35 trillion.
he's the pinnacle of fiat bullshitery - it should surprise no one that he would pitch a ponzi scheme nearly identical to the existing fiat scams to "pay off" the existing/failing fiat scams lol
This sounds an awful lot like that Always Sunny episode where they hand out Paddy dollars to save the bar
Grifters gotta grift
Hell yeah amigos, get rich and pay off the debt that the pendejos Democrats got us into.  He'll yeah viva se√±or Trump.
This is what a couple million dollars gets you in American politics.
"We gonna write them a little crypto check."

-DJT
Keep my Bitcoin out of your goddamned mouth
I mean he blew it out to by a good amount so you‚Äôd hope he starts paying it back.
The way she says crypto is grating
prices can be manipulated.   I mean if the financial institutions can create quadrillions in debt with derivatives, you think you couldn't inflate the price of a crypto to trillions?  Yeah maybe itll flash crash if real transactions were allowed, but it doesn't matter, you can use it to settle debt while inflated and itll never see light of day.
Didn't he sell "trump-bucks" to his fans, that actually thought they held a value?

Can't recall if I readit on /r/theunion or /r/nottheunion
The grift keeps on grifting
Unfortunately, I think 80% of people still don‚Äôt understand crypto
He's going to create $35b in crypto by fiat?
Trump, Pump and Dump for the MAGA Chumps that worship the pan he shits in.
You can talk shit all you want but the guy launched shit social network and sits on more than 3 billion dollars worth of shares by doing almost nothing
Donald Trump is such a fiat maximalist, he sends crypto using paper.
Sure, that‚Äôll work. Fuckin‚Äô idiot, this ain‚Äôt a casino.
To the surprise of absolutely no one. The man is dumber than a box of rocks. He wanted to nuke a hurricane and inject us with bleach to kill the Coronavirus. 

Par for the course but when you‚Äôre the leader of idiots that also have no clue how crypto works it makes him sound smart to them.
If it did miraculously started making money you know he‚Äôll start grifting it with his other shady friends. He only makes debt, never pays anyone or anything off!
I like how his argument is that ‚Äúif we don‚Äôt do it China is gonna do, China is gonna do it anyway‚Äù and he has no clue China already been there done that and has banned it and made it illegal. They don‚Äôt want anything to do with it because it gives their citizens too much freedom.
Can‚Äôt wait to see @POTUS account shilling random shitcoins on X üòÇ
Don said, ‚ÄúMagnets don‚Äôt work when they get wet‚Äù my guess is that he has very, very, very limited technological knowledge and ability.
Now remember, he is a stable genius. Wait a sec. Let me qualify that. He is a self-proclaimed stable genius.
He‚Äôs the ‚ÄúLaundering King‚Äù
this guy's going to use the Fed like a piggy bank. 

on the bright side when he drives our monetary policy into the ground, since we all have credit and debit cards now we won't have to use wheelbarrows to carry around giant piles of cash to buy a loaf of bread.
The problem is the people who listen and follow him. To the abyss
Coinfefe
Yeah, that wouldn‚Äôt destabilize the global financial system *at all*.
Trump up in his tower playing Tropico 6 using it as a dictator simulator, looks like he just made it to the modern age.

Trumpcoin and Elontherium, the best of the trianglechain.. after he's fired, there will be a Ginsnero.. which will be used to continue the elites laundering and profiteering on the undernet. After Trump unites the world.. earth will be renamed Donald. From there he will establish the first corporate star system.. named Trump. The Trump system... with new biotechnology he will cyborg himself to be an immortal businessman and great leader of the star systems. It will be a sick spinoff of star trek where he makes everyone wear itchy suits and funny hats With his name on it, infact every artifical item in this time has trump on it...but the federation is called the united people under trump, and he runs it more like Kim in NK.. and his life is sustained by star system wide bailouts to pay himself for the unimaginable cost he made up in trumpcoin.

Ginsler strikes back - deep within the undernet ginsler and the underforce have been siphoning Trumpcoin to make a clone army...of ginslers...am I spelling his name right..

Alright I'm done..
A ‚Äúvery high level in certain ways‚Äù. What. The. Fuck.
If he thinks the national debt is something you can ‚Äúpay back‚Äù‚Ä¶ thats just idiotic.

The national debt is nothing but a record of the government spending in excess of taxes collected. It is the money in circulation. 

Some of it, like bonds, are paid over time. This is our money supply he is talking about lol
I mean he's got Baron on cyber duties with experience creating shitcoins.
A Donald Rug Pull 
With all the trimmings 
Missing his best friend Epstein
This so called man is just plain weird!
So weird
>Maybe this guy isn't as smart as he thinks he is.

I believe there's been something of a cottage industry centered around maintaining this man's self-image as a smart guy for 4-5 decades. Problem is, you can't unconsciously smooth the edges of that delusion when you're the fucking president.
lol wat a weirdo
Does anyone even need to be told this? The former dipshit-in-chief doesn‚Äôt understand anything besides being a sexual predator.
Donald is an expert on taking a business, taking all the money and funneling to himself then forcing it to go bankrupt while his personal accounts are flush.  It‚Äôs what he did 2016 to 2020, a book suspects he got $1.7 billion and we can all Google quickly to trace Bill Barr and his DOJ as well as Congress(blocked by republicans) refuse to investigate.  This to me means the biggest rug pull in history while Trump exiles himself to Russia.
Can you launder it with bleach?
TRUMP IS GOING TO WRECK BITCOIN. 

These dumb shits should have never let him in the hen house.
Trump has covered about every community to get votes. I think the next community he will look for votes is the sex offender community
This isn‚Äôt a solution. Trading fiat debt for Bitcoin debt is the dumbest and most desperate thing I‚Äôve ever heard from this community. It is NOT tangible.
And people want this moron to lead our country....
Didn‚Äôt he say in 2016 that he would reduce the national debt 

He has a lot of ideas, but can‚Äôt actually get them to work
I mean the US Gov was already debating minting a 1 trillion dollar coin and then giving it to themselves to pay the debt. Like a physical coin.
Earth 2 is a weird planet.
Can you use the Shitcoin to buy his gold sneakers
He's a Clown with orange face and Cotton Candy Hair
He loves to talk out of his butthole
He doesn‚Äôt need to believe it will work. He needs his voters to believe it
This was the crypto community I was looking for!  One that doesn't simp for Don the Con.
Just don‚Äôt name it safemoon
So it‚Äôs starts. Just remember the Nacho Libre shoes guys. Just no.
At what point did anyone actually think he knew what he was talking about? 

Honestly, I give him credit. Takes 100+ hours to get Bitcoin and why its the apex predator of the market

Just the fact that presidents, senators, congressmen and institusions are discussing Bitcoin as a reserve asset is MIND BLOWING

Imagine someone posting that this would happen in 2020. People would laugh in your face and say Bitcoin isn't even regulated. 

Well.... dont. fucking. blink. fam.
At least he has a positive outlook on crypto. Not like the other options we have.
dude cant joke about anything
Lol, if he gets the opportunity he's going to use crypto to embezzle public funds, he understands it better than the users on this sub.
 " ... and Mexico will pay for it.. our beautiful, beautiful wall of digital coins.. and if it doesn't work, You know its all Joe Biden's fault.. " lol
Nah, he already has USD shitcoin.
Trump is so weird and creepy.
i think he is referring to the government holding a bitcoin reserve and holding as it appreciates, then using it later to pay off the debt
You don't appear capable of discriminating between a joke and a serious proposal.   This was the former.
A lot of crypto enthusiasts are dumb enough to believe the massive liar Donny trump
maybe, lol. He's a fucking moron and rapist.
I mean he‚Äôs a billionaire and you aren‚Äôt soooo ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
the debt was 28 Trillion 4 years ago, crazy right?
He could actually do it and you people would still be mad. It‚Äôs great when it goes against him but any time he gets it done it‚Äôs a silence
Billionaires have already laundered him money from his dumb NFTs. Same shit here
This is smarter than people realize 90% of Crypto is worthless a lot of people only put money in based on hopium.
Pay it to whom? I don't think these idiots understand what a national debt is
Exactly why the folks who bought into the Trump crap hype are getting the news sold on their asses :-0  Don't mean to make fun of anyone who bought in the high 60s and is freaking out or panic selling....if you did, hold the line!  In 12-18 months you'll be glad you did, Trump or no Trump.
He DOESN'T ANSWER QUESTIONS WITH ANY SUBSTANCE.  you fucking fools.
[removed]
last week Trump said ‚Äúbitcoin will be mined minted and made in the United States‚Äù
Sounds to me like he had one Mar-a-Lago dinner conversation with someone in Peter Thiel's orbit who has figured out a way to skim a trillion dollars off this deal.
Maga think he is a genius with the Capital J
Maybe he isn‚Äôt as smart as he thinks he is? There‚Äôs no maybe about it.
It still completely baffles me that anyone thinks this man is somehow smart. Just listen to him talk about anything for 15 seconds and you can tell he is as dumb as a fucking brick.
Trump couldn‚Äôt understand stand tariffs or NATO membership so why would anyone think he could understand crypto. ü§£
He said "maybe we could use the value accumulation of BTC to pay off debt", but he did it in a Trump way. You all are slow as hell if you still don't get how Trump talks. Said nothing unsurprising, and laid out the same possibility everyone in this industry has been preaching forever. Repeating what he's hearing in Trump words.

You could leverage BTC pay off debt as a reserve asset. Even just holding BTC would strengthen the US economy to allow more printing to pay debt.
He is such an idiot.  And crypto bros love to simp for him because sometimes he says good things about crypto.  (Depends on who he last talked to.)
Donald Trump IS a national shitcoin.
Vote Red ‚ô•Ô∏è
#I prefer NOT to take any advice from or vote for a rapists and felon,  convicted on 34 counts of election interference by way of corporate and campaign finance fraud.  


Lol - he is bigly dumb and evil.
One day we will have to do a debt jubilee, and on that day, it might help soften the blow if all the bonds are replaced with some newly created Fedcoin. He sure as hell isn't paying off the national debt with Bitcoin, becasue the feds only have like 30,000 coins, and that aint even 2 billion dollars worth.
I'm just curious, since when was he into crypto?
Isn‚Äôt xrp supposed to this when it reaches 69 dollars lol. I mean potentially it could work if the gov buys 2.5 million bitcoin and hold until one million and rug pull it
My brain hurts.
As long as it mentions electrolytes
"I have the best coins"
Can't wait to see his face when I create my own national shitcoin and pay off the national debt myself
Nobody will hols crypto if your gonna have to pay unrealized gain tax every year sooo
What a great idea! üí°
Back new non-Fed USD with Bitcoin+other hard assets. Let everyone exchange old Fed USD for new sound money USD. Take all the collected Fed USD (now worthless) and pay off the Fed debt. This could be what he means.
So stupid it just might work
could work

* print USD, let inflation rip and roar
* Use lots of newly printed USD to buy BTC. This can rapidly drive up BTC and down USD
* pump BTC to the point that the government's btc can pay off the debt
    * Thats over 160million USD per BTC
* Hand the fiat banks some BTC, call it even.
    * boom: National debt is gone, dollar has nearly no value. 

It works out the same as monetizing the debt and killing the dollar system.
Or maybe he‚Äôs thinking there‚Äôs going to be a LOT of inflation.
I mean I've heard of a crypto fascist but this is a whole different kettle of fish
Why will I buy into a digital currency issued by a failed state?
Legitimate question -

Is it possible theoretically that they could print 35 trillion dollars to pay the debt and temporarily destroy the economy and then burn 35 trillion dollars after it‚Äôs paid to undo the damage?

Edit: nm just realized why this wouldn‚Äôt work, as they wouldn‚Äôt have the 35 trillion to burn as they handed it to other countries.
Based on the amount of stupid people willing to dump money into the most shit of shitcoins, maybe he‚Äôs onto something.
Holy bots Batman
Clearly he understands crypto. But not Bitcoin.
There is already a little trump meme coin on Solana.
Send $5 of ETH to 0xb2ed0D2952ad408Aac8D2A7B286123D04d1117de  will send 1 Shitcoin üí©
Why did Elon Musk buy Twitter?
Make all the world pay off our national debt, it's fucking genious!
Bitcoin only needs to reach $175m
This will unironically tank other cryptos¬†
Dollar is that coin he is talking of.
He could make a shitcoin‚Ä¶.
It could actually make money‚Ä¶.
But there is literally zero point zero percent chance he uses it to reduce the debt rather than line his own pockets‚Ä¶
Maybe he‚Äôs playing with your mind and you‚Äôre not really that smart after all. That could also be the possibility. Imagine the sheer thought of such a travesty!!!!!! ü§£
What a weird idea
Ngl, I'd try and get in early because there are a shedload of people that'd buy it in the states
Rug the Planet!
Rugpulling the world's creditors would be the most based thing imaginable
This is like the overweight person who wants to lose weight without doing the work. I‚Äôve got no idea about how to pay off us debt (national lottery?) but it will take some hard work and backbone by our politicians.
lol... give the federal reserve a shit coin, and the US will ditch the federal reserve notes of the 8 families?
Ironically, he has shown that he absolutely understands the vast majority of Crypto investors and developers.  Start new project that takes no skill and adds no value, make fast money, leave someone else holding the bag, repeat.
This guy is gonna launch a 100 quadrillion supply shitcoin with $100 liquidity. And airdrop the debt away.
Very dumb, but no dumber than 99% of non-Bitcoin crypto.
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt buy treasuries.
Uuughhh
Enough hopium could at least make a sizable dent in national debt.
possessive society knee many fly noxious bells brave light numerous

Genius guy, lol
He only cares about making as much money as possible by being president and staying out of jail.   Will literally say anything to meet those goals at this point
This guy just needs to go away already
An idiot saying idiot things, who would've thought...
Biden wanted to do that with an actual coin
lol, nope
Comments sorted by controversial is the way.
this is going to be his biggest money maker to date. awesome idea
I immediately started to laugh, and then immediately started to cry
For a minute I actually got happy. I was like wow so awesome ü§£ü´£üòÇü§™üòúüôÉ
He meant buy bitcoin. Let it appreciate. Then pay off the debt. It isn‚Äôt rocket science lol
IRS 2.0
Paying off a fiat currency debt with an invented fiat currency that will never return on the investment??  Seems legit.
If the government used a few hundred billion to create massive mining farms and acquired a big chunk of total hash power then, yeah, at some point he might actually be correct about that - it just will take a long time and meanwhile that debt will continue to grow‚Ä¶ but probably not at the rate the value of bitcoin will over time. At scale, who knows, at some point in the future a single bitcoin might be worth $35T USD. It‚Äôs already worth $24m Zimbabwe Dollars. Just depends on how microscopically worthless the US Dollar gets debased to.

PS national cryptomining funds UBI
These oldies finally getting into crypto without understanding it marks the end. They will only ruin it like they have the actual economy
It makes perfect sense and was predicted by many, when you consider that BTC will become the new backing of the USD like how gold used to be.  This is literally the only way USD maintains its status as the world reserve currency.  This is part of the collateralization strategy of USD 2.0, the incoming CBDC stablecoin.  The only question is what the exchange rate between USD 1.0 and 2.0 will be...
So, a tax on his republican shrills? Ok sure‚Ä¶
Jeez so what should he do then? Regulate it?
It‚Äôs a self sustaining economy like paddy‚Äôs pub paddy‚Äôs dollars.
Damn, that would be bad ass.
What a piece of shit. It will be pre-mined and distributed. I‚Äôll try and get in. Write a script to trade enough to make a few dollar for fun and bank it all in BTC
This is like the trillion dollar coin idea but stupider.
> Maybe


Yup, maaaaybe
 I believe in NFT‚Äôs and you believe an NFT then we all get fucking rich!
Magatoken 35 trillion dollar market cap 100% owned by Chinese government. World saved.
Did anyone listen to Michael Saylor‚Äôs talk at the Bitcoin conference? He may be trying to refer to that.
He will call it the ‚ÄúObama‚Äù and feature the face of Barack Obama surrounded by shit
I will never utter a word in defense of trump but since when does he call himself the "crypto president"... I feel like he probably doesn't even know the word 'crypto'.
I thought he was using Bitcoin?
!withdraw 303
But what if it works üòπ
I'd drop $20 to buy some debtcoin, lmao
Trump will one one coin worth $35 trillion
And will give it to Montgomery Burns
A ponzi scheme will totally fix everything.
Depends how much Bitcoin he buys and how well it does.
> QUICK, NORMAL GRIFTS AREN'T WORKING ANYMORE! WE NEED TO CALL IN THE BIG GUNS; CRYPTO! /s
He‚Äôs copying RFK‚Äôs entire platform minus the brains
Also, At the BitCoin conference it was RFK that said he wanted the US to buy 500 bitcoin a day until having a reserve of 4M coins.
The government should print a trillion and buy Bitcoin. Force the price up then bag ‚Äòem.
It will help for at least a few bucks lololol
Even Gronk know that not real money
Heyyyyy! Heyyyyyyy Heyyyyyyyy! Biiiiitconnect!
https://youtu.be/3l9nLXczT3s?si=praBR2Wovp2aWsrZ
Yup. Same post, different day. TRUMPS fault for everything.
I mean, if selling shitcoins to crypto bros would help pay down the debt I'd be all for it.¬†
Title is misleading
Please don't let this beautiful sub turn into a political attack echo-chamber, no matter what side you're on üò¢. 

Not accusing you OP, just a general comment and worry I have
USD is already a national shitcoin
!balance
if US keeps printing to buy BTC, other countries would like to buy some, you and your grandma would like to buy some. No one will want to sell, why? because greed and we know for fact is that US keeps buying. Slowly but surely using small chunk to pay off debt.

not only you are able to inflate your way out of debt but also abuse government power of printing unlimited amount of cash and turn it into something with limited supply and back the dollar with
just make a real iron coin.  say it's worth 100 trillion.  NOW YOU OWE *US*
Trump so easily trolling the whole subreddit. So classic.
Didn‚Äôt work for FTX.
Lol these capitalists are so cooked their trying to redistribute the debt hahahaha
When I compared Trump with Maduro, people used to say I was just exaggerating...

Well... this would be Petro 2.0
Haven‚Äôt you guys notice CEOS and other high paying jobs are paid in stocks ( capital gains tax is a lot less then regular taxes) and like the comment said they just get a loan against the value of stock and never touch his money and keep doing it over and over remember when Musk was very worried about his 56 billion most was in stock that he just went to go get loan and pay off other loan which he use to buy twitter and the cycle will continue hence billionaire
he said bitcoin so yeah no, but keep buying üí©coinsim sure you‚Äôll do great
I honestly think a maybe candidate is better than trump. He ruins everything and he'll ruin crypto. It doesn't matter that he's been paid off by crypto people.
Is there some collective brain aneurysm that causes nearly 99 pct of people to not have an understanding of what national debt is?
You guys are still coming up well short on the IQ points required to make it to r/SelfAwarewolves 

All crypto is a scam for ponzi schemes, fraud, and money laundering. It will never be a medium of exchange, and you all bought in at bagholder level.
Planning.  Right.
Reminds me of Rick and Morty when he crashes the economy by changing the currency value from 1 to 0 lol
I don't even know what is real anymore
Welcome to idiocracy¬†
It was just a sarcastic remark, nothing serious.
So let‚Äôs just rename Reddit to the ‚Äúanti Trump platform‚Äù
Watching this man burn bridges in literally every single industry makes you want to make some popcorn.
its just the platinum coin dilemma turned into the crypto coin dilemma. what a moron lmao.
same energy as " just drink bleach to cure covid "
Like I said in another thread, there's zero possibility Trump understands crypto in any way, shape or form. Which is why his hallucinatory rambling in that Crypto event recently wasn't at all crypto related, just his usual insanity.

Anyone, on any part of the political spectrum, who votes for this insane old pedophile is just purely nuts themselves, or actively anti-democracy.
The correct question to this should have been ‚Äú what do you mean hand them a little bitcoin?‚Äù
No thanks. 1 Sam bankmanfreid was enough
I"m thinking he is going to do something where he leaves the whole Federal Reserve Bankers holding the bag.  They've been screwing us for over a 100 years, its time to turn the tables on them. I think there is a plan, he never shows his hand before he plays it.
We already can do this. Treasury could just mint some very large-denomination coins and hand them over to the Fed to buy back all the bonds they‚Äôve bought in this QE4eva experiment we‚Äôve been in for the last 16 years. Would it end well? Maybe not, but it could be done.
Yeah ok
So you‚Äôre telling us that the idiot is indeed an idiot. Tell us something we don‚Äôt know.
All his fan boys might buy into it. 

Might be worth buying then selling a day later.
Maybe? Yeah he is an idiot.
Donald Trump planning to make idiots pay off the national debt
If you think this guy is the ‚Äúcrypto president,‚Äù then I‚Äôve got some magic beans to sell you. Great deal, DM me!!!
Forget the financial and technical implications.

He doesn't understand the religious implications.

There are loads of evangelicals in his camp, they hate the "one world currency" and payment by "mark of the beast".

My in laws were convinced it was a democrat/soros/deep state plan to move us there. If Trump is now saying he'll convert the US dollar to crypto backed they'll lose their minds -- or more accurately find some way to rationalize it as good.
It‚Äôll be like his NFTs
I don‚Äôt care who the politician is, but hypothetically, a hundred billion dollars of Bitcoin, that the Gov hodls for ten years, could very well pay off the entire debt. 

I know, I know, it won‚Äôt happen. Not enough short-term payoff for politicians to do it, and no politician can be trusted to hodl when it could be spent on wars and votes.
Already exist. They are called bonds
But are they doing this with the dolar already?
You mean the same thing that the government are already talking of doing?
So he's going to let the fed create their fake token system?
You‚Äôd be better off not playing in the mud. Trust me it‚Äôs way nicer.
A little exaggeration + some childhood dreams. That's the whole secret of this quote.
Oh yeah, "maybe" he's not. Hmm I'm "starting" to have my doubts.
They need to mandate a balanced budget and no excess spending allowed, before they devalue to dollar like this.
So DJT basically lol
He could call it US Trump, or for short UST.
Not gonna lie. Even if it verifiably had govt backing I wouldn't trust anything with his name on it
He just needs to post that's it's real magic internet money on Truth social, promise his followers that he would never rug them and remind them that he doesn't lie for them to throw their retirement funds at it.
Apparently no one thought it was suspicious when him and Putin, both formerly very anti-crypto, within two days of each other both endorsed it? Likely he got told to back it so Russians can use it to get around sanctions.
It's almost as if that's been his business model for decades upon decades or something.
Pump and Dump Trump
r/idiocracy
  convince everyone that it has government backing 

LOL, the only thing I'm convinced of when Trump is behind it is that I will get scammed
Already did, his stop the steal campaign he launched after the 2020 election raised like 600 million in a few weeks.

I think less 10 million went into actual litigation.
And then what?

Shifting the debt to the citizens?
Or keep the debt, still ruin the citizens but have 35 trillion in his pocket ü§£ü§£
People that still trust him after his history are some of the stupidest people there are, it's actually the perfect market for a rug pull, it would be insanely easy and they would probably defend him.
He already does have NFT cards and has scammed a lot of people lol
I'd watch this movie üçø
10x the entire crypto market in one shitcoin! Brilliance! /s
>‚Äúwho knows maybe we‚Äôll pay off our 35 trillion dollar debt. Hand them a little crypto check, right? Hand them a little bitcoin, right?‚Äù

>‚ÄúBut how do you want it [crypto] to be more prominent in America? How will that work?‚Äù

>‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs going to work easily. It‚Äôs already prominent. It‚Äôs moving along, it‚Äôs very loosely regulated, that‚Äôs one of the reasons it‚Äôs moving along. But it is a a different form of a currency, and it‚Äôs going to end up benefiting the country‚Äù


lol normally I can follow a deranged rant, this‚Ä¶. This is pure lunacy. Weird doesn‚Äôt even cover this old man‚Äôs sundown symptoms. Maybe aderral will help???
EOY 2022!
Even this is too much for SaylorMoon
Is that audit done yet so we can see his tax returns?
Sorry, it‚Äôs infrastructure week again.
There was also apparently gonna be a wall...

Not that I wanted a fucking wall, but the guy was pretty set on the wall. And nothing!
Also waiting on his inflation elimination policy. 404 not found.
He told us all we needed to know at the Bitcoin conference after he finished reading the speech on the teleprompter: ‚ÄúHave fun with your Bitcoin and your cryptos and everything else you‚Äôre playing with.‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about any of it, or any of us. Someone told him he could get praise and votes if he was pro-crypto, that‚Äôs literally all this is.
He does not seem to understand how tariffs work and thinks that the Chinese are the ones that will have to pay them, not us. He thinks that the NATO countries that are not meeting their defense spending targets are not paying us. He suggested fixing the Social Security Trust Fund by discounting the obligations. As a financial wizard NOT he is an idiot and crook. He only made money by screwing other people and repeated con games and bankruptcies.
There's an eyeroll that you have you insert into that part.
Politicians and delusion, name a better duo
He understands pump and dump schemes just fine.

Hardly something new and innovative.

You do not need to understands crypto to make money off crypto. Just have an audience of gulible idiots.
https://i.redd.it/ji2n0lm8jbgd1.gif
Is he even a White Man? He looks Orange to me
To be fair, he is very smart. 

He is very smart to know how to scam his cult and do it over and over again.
That would make Bitcoin to skyrocket over $1,835,824.86 dollars per Bitcoin.

Nonsensical, if anyone is dumb enough to execute this plan, liquidate all crypto. This is it.
For all practical purposes a trillion dollar coin would have the same effect as typical QE with bonds.

And yes, the inflationary effect would be devastating for the US economy.

It is just QE with extra steps.
 The coin in question was a suggestion to get past the obstruction of the GOP held congress and Senate, which was shot down hard.

 As to Trump, he doesn't care how finance / economics works, only that he can get something out of it for himself.
The problem is most of them don't know how to use any tech, they might be able to use a couple of apps like X, Truth social and Facebook but they won't be able to buy crypto unless you sell it directly with a credit card on a website. This is why Trump had to sell his NFTs with USD and not crypto
You said it all in one sentence. q-:

I'd raise you to "he has no clue how \_many things\_ work" ;-)
MAGA crowd will bag hold any shitcoin to zero for Trump and do it over and over again
This is my plan for Moons and you all will support me on it!
[deleted]
-Sir, this is a Wendys
Just like what microstrategy has been doing.
He wondered if we could just reuse the flu shot for Covid. Like it‚Äôs interchangeable. Complete idiot.

It‚Äôs amazing if you listen to this clip OP posted just how much pure fart gas this guy is spewing from his mouth.
Why are you people always twisting his words to make him look bad?  He suggested that we *inject* it, you dunce!
Didn‚Äôt he also ask if he could nuke a hurricane?
To attempt to prove it to his supporters who believe he's the world's greatest investor who came from nothing but pulled himself up by his bootstraps to become a billionaire
He's got the best words and says the best things, really high intellect things.
Bro... he's literally not the president right now. How the fuck he's the reason for crypto crashing?
Yeah that‚Äôs the more shocking part to me (not really shocking, he‚Äôs an idiot, but still‚Ä¶).

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll hand them a little Bitcoin‚Ä¶‚Äù as if some entity (probably China in his/supporters‚Äô minds) owns the national debt and we can pay it off like a credit card. Amazing.
Don't forget he suggested that the Paris Fire Department should use a helicopter used for forest fires to dump insane amounts of water on Notre Dame when it was burning.  This likely would have caused the main building to collapse because of all the weight and unconteolled nature of said dump.  Idiot.
TinkleMe
Orangemoon
Shit dollar. Literally comes on a roll now..
So many idiots in this sub apparently that don't understand what he was saying. You are the first one I have seen with this reply. He previously said for the US Government to HOLD all of it's Bitcoin, and stop selling it off.
It's okay, none of the other idiots voting for them do either.
Thank you!! He never said to make a shitcoin. If you watch his speech at the Bitcoin conference, he specifically said he doesn‚Äôt want to create a national coin. He wants to deregulate and lower energy prices so it is easier to mine crypto in the US.
Since he started falling behind on the polls
Can‚Äôt he cash out his shares soon or did that date already pass?

Edit: nvm it‚Äôs not until late September.
So worthless basically
Pesonally I'd go with WCF - Weird Creepy Felon
Wouldn't be the first time UST fucked people over
or DBC - Donny Bagadonuts Coin.
![gif](giphy|sDcfxFDozb3bO)
Doesn't even need to lie, lol, some would still eat it up no matter what
So a tax on stupid, same as DJT stock.
Better than Bitcoin, it will be biggly, we get all rich, richer than rich, only I can print it, I alone....already tired of winning? You can buy 1 Trumpcoin for 1000 USD, or direct from the Trump store only for you for 1200 USD. That is a hugely 20% discount

I have to agree if he does it like this it will work.
You can't get around sanctions with BTC.

That's what Chainalysis does for the FBI with big budget. They have the most detailed map of Blockchain in existence.

More traceable than tradfi
Sure, Donald‚Äôs version American dream. People swallowing this shite are the real problem.
Ah, Shib holder math.
Greatest businessman ever!!!!!
Audit means indictment in MAGAland.
He‚Äôs even less transparent than Tether regarding audits !
Someone needs to tell him an unmonitored wall doesn't work.https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/ht_wall1_dc_170303.jpg

It's not the wall that protects, it's the monitoring.
He did put up some wall, spent a few billion of our dollars on it, stole land from hard working Republican Texans to do it. It's easily scalable, can be dug under
he told the republicans to vote against it so they did.
Sadly my tax dollars in Texas are still going to this stupid wall that doesn't work since our Governor decided to use the Texas national guard to build it himself
Hilariously, the Biden administration ultimately got Mexico to contribute 1.5 billion dollars to border security.
A wall of hot air.

...Climate Change!
Sir just tell them you love crypto and you'll get some extra votes.

![gif](giphy|l2JhIUyUs8KDCCf3W)
And he would go the next day to somewhere else and tell he will ban all that fake crypto money and it is only the Dollar allowed. And the next day telling only gold is money....Next day free trade with everyone...next day 100% import duty...
Sad to see Crypto becoming a toy for politicians.
"If we don't do it, Chinas gonna do it". Hasn't china banned bitcoin like half a dozen times already? And doesn't he want to ban EVs, leaving the door open for BYD's worldwide dominance? Makes no sense, China has no interest in bitcoin but they are positioned to be the leader in green energy.

He just wants to enrich his oil/gas buddies, as bitcoin requires a ton of energy.
It's all a function of his NPD he will say whatever will make him look the best in front of the crowd he is currently speaking to.

It all perpetuates the delusion.
> Someone told him he could get praise and votes if he was pro-crypto

Prolly same folks that told him Gold Sneakers would get him tight with black and young voters.
> ‚ÄúHave fun with your Bitcoin and your cryptos and everything else you‚Äôre playing with.‚Äù

Is that...  wow.  That can't be real.

Oh, wow.  Yes, that quote is real.  I found a clip, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQhK3yB3Pzo&t=11s).

What a clown that guy is.  The orange skin.  The yellow hair dye.  The big floppy suits that he thinks hide his blubber.  The liter of hairspray it must take to lock that weird combover in place.  It's all so bizarre.
Just like the wall with mexico. Only thing he successfully have other people pay for something was his golfing trips and the american people paid for it.
> He only made money by screwing other people and repeated con games and bankruptcies.

He made money by being born extremely rich, everything he has done in his life has made him less rich than just coasting on that money would have.
oh the tariffs, I love bringing that up to people and watching their faces crinkle up in confusion.
My bean tosser and my left hand
Perfect person for this.
You are confusing intelligence with unrivaled greed. Most of us have enough care for each other to not fuck over others, that is not the case with Drumpf.
That says more about his cult than the man.
I always think this when I see those commemorative coins with like Biden in jail on the back or stuff like that. 

Ok what we do is make a very American shop that sells it through cc payments. Make it a subscription. American flags, eagles, extra large font on every page. Hire a couple ‚ÄúFreedomCoin consultants‚Äù whose only job is to rile up the old people on the phone and use their credit cards to purchase the coins. Make applying for credit easy on the site, and rug pull the shit outta it when Trump eventually dies. Then we release FreedomCoin (Baron‚Äôs Version) and do it all over again.
They were gobbling up those AI-generated NFTs not too long back with no issue. 

I'm pretty sure they'll buy his used diapers if someone put them on the blockchain.
It's not even crashing. It's where it was two weeks ago.
I was going to say I have never heard of him ever favor crypto but I haven't been watching the news recently.
He doesn't need to ever cash out his shares. He can simply take a loan out against their value, getting a huge sum of money without tanking the stock.
You will know when that date passes because the stock will tank as he fire sales it¬†
On a day like this, Comedy is the best medicine. Thanks guys!
How about ORANGE?

Old, Racist, Angry, Nepotistic, Greedy and Evil.
WTF - Weird Trump Felon
I see what he did there too lol
And the funny thing is that it would work on Drumpt‚Äôs supporters lol
I made $50K on SHIB, held to the top during Elons SNL skit. Never used crypto since.
Flipping Texas is not as crazy as people think. There are more Democrats than Republicans in Texas, but the Republicans have run a very effective "why bother voting blue" disinformation campaign for the last 16 years and the Dems don't vote. Here's a guy talking about the problem https://www.tiktok.com/@lonestarleft/video/7393930005899676974

Send this video to all Texans you know
>Sir just tell them you love crypto and you'll get some extra votes.

You can exchange crypto with a whole lot of other hot-button issues and it applies. 

Man is a spoiled grifter manbaby.

He has nothing in common with the people he pretends to care about.
I hate that he's in any way associated with crypto. He's a known scam artist. I mean, it's not a good look for crypto at all with all the scamming that comes with it.
Where have you been lol.

Crypto is the perfect tool for laundering money and funneling bribes.
Exactly, turning crypto into a partisan issue is just going to pervert it...  No technology should be a partisan issue...
Is that Chaucer?
Are you left handed or are you into strangers, Dave Chapelle-style?
Remember when people forgot to unclick the tiny option box that said "make this a recurring option" for his failed reelection campaign? That shit was a weekly payment. Yes, there were refunds but there were people who overlooked it because it "was for trump". A conman with willing victims.
Assuming a brokerage would lend against stock in a company trading at 7000x sales.  I‚Äôm skeptical.
He is absolutely going to cash out as soon as he can because that company is going under the moment he loses the election.  It literally makes no money and people are only holding for the chance he does win again.
You think a bank will give him a loan with those shares as collateral???? Not a chance
What bank is going to loan Trump money against DJT?
Well done with that‚Ä¶I love it.
> people he pretends to care about

He's now making jokes about the guy who died protecting his family from a bullet intended for him.
"Known scam artist". That hasn't stopped people supporting a crypto project founded by scammers.
It literally exists so individuals and foreign entities can legal funnel him money without worrying about campaign finance laws
Ya, we've all seen our fair share of rug pull coins.
This. 

I don't know why everyone is so mystified about the valuation. It's absolutely worth that much to the shareholders... because they are using it to funnel money to him.
Because it‚Äôs hemorrhaging money
My point is that it's not a real business and people keep trying to use traditional ways of coming up with a valuation. 

It's a way to funnel cash to a politician. Why would the fundamentals of the cover business matter one iota?

If Trump loses, the share price will collapse. But in the meantime, the stock price isn't this high because people around the world actually think this is a promising stock. It's because people around the world are using it to bribe a presidential candidate.
I keep looking at this Mafia-run sandwich shop around the way and it doesn‚Äôt make any sense! They never have any customers, their shop is always empty, and yet they report sky-high revenue. They must be business geniuses.
The difference here is that once the Capitol in the business is spent, the stock price alone can‚Äôt keep it running. They‚Äôll need to sell more stock, which the SEC may not approve if they have no hope of turning a profit, as it would be seen as money laundering
Been buying bitcoin every month for 76 months now
Started in October 2017 with the goal of 'enough bitcoin to retire'. Got the general idea from the FIRE community (financial independence, retire early) but instead of buying the S&P every month, I chose to buy bitcoin every month. So, basically I save as much as possible from every salary --> buy as much bitcoin every month as possible. When I have a stack of 1 million euros in fiat terms, I consider myself as successfully retired and most likely gonna quit my job. I document my journey in this blog that I try to update once per month, hopefully you like it interesting and motivating! And whatever your capacity and timing for stacking sats is, I'm pretty sure this kind of 'bitcoin retirement plan' is way more efficient than the government one, so starting anything similar is highly recommended. Enjoy reading!

Ps. doesn't work with shitcoins

I remember you ! I was wondering what happened to you. Glad to see youre alive and well.

I was asking before and I will try again, how did you do the graph that shows BTC total stack and fiat stack
Ah to be able to buy at  2017 priced again would be a dream.

It's funny you mention you got the idea from FIRE as they absolutely hate crypto, but congrats to you on succeeding!
I admire your discipline and conviction to ride through the ups and downs.
The PS made me curious and I like spreadsheets so [I ran some #s](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wxndMg3mdFlzqhILdtsPI18ipDNDU2LsivLryemdL_M/edit?usp=sharing).  If you did this with Ether... 

* 1 ETH today = ‚Ç¨2094.74
* Total ETH = 106.55
* Total value = ‚Ç¨223191.87
* A little bit over 29% more vs 4.47 BTC valued around ‚Ç¨172,597.83

I pulled the historical price data in $ from CoinGecko and got historical USD to EURO rates from a Google function built-in to sheets.
Hey OP - Congrats and keep up the good work‚Ä¶
 
Bullet Points for the people in the rafters:

OP invests 500‚Ç¨ of his monthly pay 

His most recent purchase was at 39,100 ‚Ç¨ / BTC (or ~.013 BTC), giving him ~4.47 BTC total as of today.

The total amount invested after 6+ years is ~40k. 500‚Ç¨ one month at a time. 

This strategy has thus far yielded a profit of ~330%, whereas the S&P strategy would have given me a profit of 42% for the same amount after 6+ years
I've been doing this with ethereum over the past year, and full intend to keep buying every month for the next 5 to 10 years without touching it. Originally I was saving 1,000$/month and 200$ of that was on eth, 50$/wk. So basicslly.my savings is 80% low risk, 20% risky AF. However my risky AF balance is now more than the 80% in low risk investments. I just got a big raise, and don't really NEED any of that extra money. So I have anew plan starting February. 

I'll be able to save about 1750$/month. I'm going to be doing 1000$ into the LR investments, and 750$ into crypto. I haven't decided if I'm going to stick with ETH, or switch to BTC though.
In 2017 I cashed out my 401k with heavy penalties‚Ä¶but bought 3 bitcoins. 

Smartest financial move I‚Äôve ever made.
Love the post and the graphs! Really shows how putting some away every month soon adds up.
I'm still at a loss for having bought at a high 70k+ üò≠
Respect from a former cryptobro. 

My only concern is what the bank will say when the time for the final retirement cash out comes... Because its not easy sometimes, for a traditional financial system its an enemy and they do everything to make its interaction unpleasant. Good luck tho m8.
May I ask where do you buy bitcoin and where do you store it? 

Love the blog btw.
Are solana/Ordi considere shitcoins?
Are you gunna sell some of your 5.5 BTC when it hits $250K in 20 months then buy it back plus more when it drops to 60K???
Putting your entire life savings in BTC ain‚Äôt it. Number 1 rule of common sense investing is diversification. It may work out for you but there‚Äôs also a significant chance of failure. Godspeed.
That is great but I don‚Äôt think you should be banking on Bitcoin for your retirement. You should have other securities as well. diversify, and all that.
Bro's gonna be shocked when he finds out 1 million eint that much anymore.
nice..hope you reach your goal
I can only stack ethereum...
But but if it doesn't work with shitcoins and I can't turn the 13 bucks I found under my seat into billions..... I'll have to get a job /s.

This is the fucking way dearest shitcoiners.
What your avg cost?
So wheen you cash in your btc gains, how much taxes you expect to pay on it?
How do you store it? Which HW?
Hey OP, recommend checking out the most recent podcast of Darknet Diaries by Jack Rhysider, it's basically about how a group of youngins target people for elaborate üêü ing scams, break security measures to gain access to a HVT's accounts, perform SIM swaps on a targets device, and how to make sure one stays off their radar. Stay safe out there.
Love this.  Thank you for sharing.  I rather enjoy the style and read it in a generic Czech/german style accent and it makes the odd typos quite amusing. 

I wonder if you‚Äôd started in  say, 2021, how your performance would compare? I might go nerd out in excel now and make some similar charts. 

Bonne chance with it all.
Fkn legend
I like a lot of what you're saying, but retiring on 1 million euros, is not a good idea. 3 million would be much more reasonable for a modest standard of living. And you'll want to move to more conservative investments when you do.
Should‚Äôve bought Msft
How do you plan to cash them out? I mean you are located in Europe, me too, does your country have any regulation about btc regarding taxes?
What‚Äôs / when the exit strategy exactly?

Sell all in one txn when fiat value is 1M$??? Something better I hope?
Are you planning on selling a % during the bull and then going to reinvest in the subsequent bear or is that too much tax headache?
return of the mack!!!!
 "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it." - Albert Einstein
I rather buy hbar or cardano, better gains in the next bull market.
TLDR; OP was lucky enough to buy early. That‚Äôs all.
So you are putting all eggs in one basket? Great

Only works if the asset just goes up. 

Will the government ever stop expanding the money supply?
Hope it pays off
THIS IS THE WAY
I thought the purpose of bitcoin is to become the new digital currency not something you buy and hold like buying an indexfund that pays dividends but use it a currency/medium of exchange. If everyone hoards bitcoin how is it supposed to replace regular fiat?
U got no pay increment for 6 years?
As someone a bit further down the risk curve than most of people on this subreddit, I‚Äôd suggest breaking it up. Here is how I see the current bull happening:

140k-250k BTC
9k-15k ETH
500-900 SOL

I‚Äôd go 40% BTC
40% ETH
20% SOL

If you REALLY want to get into the weeds: 
I‚Äôd start staking ~2,000 USD Worth of TIA, ATOM, OSMO for airdrops / claims. 

Start buying $MEME (@memecoin) on Twitter. For Stakeland which is launching with big brand partners and staking gives you their coin or some iteration of it. 

Start buying memecoin on Solana: $wif or $bonk. $JTO or $jup will be good too. 

Blast is launching an L2 on Ethereum which should do well, they‚Äôre up to almost 1B TVL for their staking reward mechanic. 

Finally, you can look into DePIN etc.
Bitcoin was once a shitcoin, don't ever forget that.
It‚Äôs so funny people here bash shitcoins, but thanks to shitcoins I made over 100k in the past year. And I only started in 2023. Pepe, Pepe 2.0, unibot, harrypotterobama Bitcoin, Mubi, WIF, Bonk, Maga, Harambe. I can name many more plays. If you‚Äôre patient and wait for the right play, you can make so much money
I bought 5 BTC in 2012. Never bought any since.
If I may ask, how are you planning to live off your btc portfolio? 1 mln euro is not enough IMO to just spend, unless you have like 6-7 years of life left. BTC ‚Äûstaking‚Äù? Converting it to stock and living off dividend? Other defi?
Does this mean you have ‚Ç¨150,000 fiat and ‚Ç¨225, 000 in bitcoin? Am I reading that right? And you only put in ‚Ç¨40,000? Or is the fist stack not profits from bitcoin sales?

Either way, congrats. That's really impressive and has worked very well so far
If *enough* of us do this, then the value/price can only go up!
What is your age range? I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to retire on 1million honestly
This is great but any analysis what would the situation look like if you stopped buying when the price jumped up in 2021? I would think the bulk of your gains are for the buys you did pre that year no and the buys since them have actually reduced your overall return?
Poor guy, all in on a shitcoin that you can't even transact or use.
If you started buying in October 2017 when the price almost peaked it means you're an idiot. Bitcoin ETF approval is the worst thing since 2008 when many people lost their retirements because of greedy bastards from Wall Street. The same will happen again when the Bitcoin ponzi comes crashing down.
A million euros isnt that much unless you are well over 50. While its perfectly possible to invest it so that you get enough to live off of it for the rest of your Life.

Taking 3k a month (which is still very average living) out of a million, the million wont even last you 30 years. But yeah, its not like you wouldnt generate passive income but its crazy how at The same time million is alot and isnt that much
There‚Äôs no point at all of this, there is better original cryptos that gives you much greater risk/reward.
Forget all dogs and cats and buy original top 7 coins in 2017  
When those run you really retire
1 million fiat is not very much money big picture
The blog looks cool! I've only read one entry so far but it looks like an interesting read. Do you ever get disheartened as the price goes up and you get fewer sats than you used to?
Cool Blog! Gonna follow you
I do the same for Ethereum, been buying every month since 2020.
This is actually really cool to see over time / great for the reality of how much you've put in over time to get where you're at etc
Impressive, thank you for sharing!
How do you purchase Bitcoin without getting ate up in fees?
DCA FTW
>not gonna name anyone but Peter Schiff you pussy

Hah!
Your graph became my motivation to track my stacking
Its stuffed get out while you can¬†
I been putting in 50/week for a few years now.  Sometimes more, sometimes less.  Dont forget to self custody now and then so i dont leave too much on the exchange.  Then back to my day job.   Someday i hope to pay off my debts with it
Someone seriously needs to rewrite the your money or your life book where the investment section is just this
Very well written blog!
Bravo. You're on the right path, and I'm there with you. All I wanted to say was plan on needing more than 1 million Euro. The way inflation is going I think we're going to need 2-3+ in order to survive 20-30 years retirement.
Good for you, I have changed strategy and it's not a good idea, I am telling u.
As you're all-in, I really hope you secure your coins well.
a typical investment fund would get you around 50k a year from that million.  If you owned you home that would likely be enough to live a normal life and not work. If you worked part time even better. I consider working part time as retired
Reading the title I thought 76 months was a long time and BTC was probably $100 back then, until I realized it was 2017 and I'd been buying longer than that
What‚Äôs your drawdown strategy for when you reach the 1 mil euro stack?
The next bull run may make you a millionaire, but that wealth may be short-lived, will you wait an extra cycle to be safe?
Always waiting for your updates. Inspiring story! Keep on stacking.
Really nice charts. We can see that your discipline trumps several levels of axiety and uncertainty, and it is refreshing to see
Where do you keep them? Ledger?
Don‚Äôt know all your personal circumstances or your age but 1M euros if you‚Äôre young isn‚Äôt enough to retire. 

It‚Äôs an unorthodox road to retirement but could very likely work. Either that or you‚Äôre left with nothing :-) 

Once you get to 30 - 40% of your goal, I‚Äôd recommend putting a hundred grand or so into something more stable, like VT or VTI.
Been following for a long time, you are inspiration sir, we started at the same time in the Crypto space lol
beautiful. This is how you wealth.
Do you immediately withdraw to cold wallet after buying, or wait for few months to withdraw?
That's amazing. 500 a month is less than my mortgage, yet in 6 years alone the stack is worth more than my house.
Just curious, how are you buying? Automated or manual? I‚Äôve been playing with the idea of buying a nominal amount of BTC everyday. Just feel like I can never trust one platform, even if they make it wildly easy
well done! thanks for sharing your Bitcoin journey, bookmarked in my browser.
1 million euros is a lot of money, but not enough to live well for a lifetime without having other income.
1mill is a good target, but depending where you are a large chunk of that is going to be taxed these days. Investing it wisely after could provide a nice income to run through into retirement for sure.
The 50-80% drawdowns don‚Äôt make you nervous if you retire?
Love your graph.
Interesting strategy, but your S&P estimate cannot be accurate? It went up 25,% in 2023 alone and 80% in the last 5?
What's the best way to buy Bitcoin? Should I use Coinbase or Robinhood to start? Or should I get a wallet and put them there? And how would I do that?
I've been doing similar to OP since late 2017 as well. First it was about every 3 months bigger $$$. Than I went to once a month $.¬†


I'm up 370% on bitcoin at time of writing, about on par with OP


DCA boys, DCA
How do you plan to withdraw the funds ? I guess you will move to some place where they won't tax 50% of your withdraws. What is your plan for that ?
Nice little stack of bitcoin. Sadly I lost my smaller stack üò≠
Great wite up!
Please tell me you have other investments than just Bitcoin. 
I am a big fan of Bitcoin, but I would never advise having it as your only investment.
So what do you consider a shitcoin?
WELL DONE SIR YOU WILL THRIVE IN THIS LIFE
Bitcoin maybe a 3X if your lucky.  Cardano, hbar and Algorand will 10X to 20X. Bitcoin isn't the only crypto out there newbies.
Wow, I am thinking about doing something similar
Good luck with your small UTXOs.
Do you use a bot to buy or do you do it manually?

Do you use a "normal" exchange like Kraken, Coinbase etc. and do you keep all of your BTC stash there?
Your strategy makes sense if you have reason to believe that Bitcoin will follow a long term growth trajectory. The S&P has proven this for example over centuries of performance.

What evidence do you have that this will be the case for BTC? Exclude the first few years, which was a period of initial explosive growth from a zero price point, this bit doesn't count as evidence for long term growth behaviour.
4.5 nice stack homie!
Thanks for the update. I always look forward to hearing from you! Good job!
‚ÄúYou gotta be willing to go underwater for a while to get 1000% returns in the long run.‚Äù 

Love that quote. This is everything. It‚Äôs also the hardest advice to follow but if it was easy, everyone would do it. If bitcoin never crashed in 2018, you‚Äôd have way less than 4.5 BTC. Those crashes made people richer.
I‚Äôve been buying 200$ in BTC a week since late 2021 and not gonna lie I really forget about the automatic buys - and my dumb luck has me very happy with an average of about 26k per BTC
What country do you live in where 1 million euros is enough to quit your job and consider yourself retired?
Let me know when you cash out so I can sell first. 

Jk, that's cool. But on a real note, profits are really just other investors investments.
Are your S&P benchmark figure total return? Gotta make sure those dividends get reinvested
Just for a laugh, how does one do with 'enough bitcoin to retire'? In other words, how does this provide an income stream?
Awesome, awesome awesome.

Keep us updated.

I only play with shit coins and have learnt a lot.

Made a bit of money on the last run. Just to put it all in to NFTS and im planning on swapping my alts for btc and fiat this time round.
I remember you OP and I always look forward to your post. I would love if you posted more frequently.
@ U/jamespunk. Ijust starting out on my journey, about a year in. im buying  BTC at $100/wk but i tend to get distracted by ETH and making small spot trades to generate a little $ to offset. 

My question to you is, if you came directly into 50,000-100,000 euros, would you make a a once-off spot buy of BTC or would you drag the purchases out with weekly recurring buys? 

Thanks and good luck
[removed]
That was a pleasure to read. Good stuff! Keep us posted.
At first to was surprised that you were still not a millionaire yet. Then I realized how hard it is to have a little extra to invest every month. Congrats to you, buddy. Hopefully you accomplish your goals.¬†
I‚Äôd love to know what your average cost is right now. Could you share it with us?
Wish I had your foresight or a clue of the wealth I‚Äôm missing out on. Hopefully I get to 1. Before it‚Äôs out of my reach.
I‚Äôll be playing catchup with ur portfolio, yolo-ed from 2017-2020 then liquidated all my holdings. Just started re-accumulating last month
Remeber 2013 and 2017 when me and a friend talked about going allin in bitcoin. I regret we didnt.

Now its to late to buy, at least to see 100x. Maybe 5x from here.
Where do you store it? Exchange of cold storage?
Very cool idea, but you could also put some in Bitcoin mining stocks since they seem to outperform it.
Fire community ? Send link pls
When you have a million in fiat term, are you going to sell the btc to fiat or are you gona live of the btc? Can you enlighten us of how you are planning to do that?  With volatility and so.
I did the same, but with ETH. Instead of investing every month I only bought after big crashes (like 3-5 days in a row with more than -10% and wait until everybody is panicking). I could retire now.
Won‚Äôt the hard part be to sell, won‚Äôt you take a big hit ?
Excellent. $BTC is the best performing asset in the world. It‚Äôs litteraly on #1, so I completely understand this way of investing. I just don‚Äôt understand why most people are still going for an index fund‚Ä¶.
Damn Bro, you inspired me, for real. 
I‚Äôm into Crypto since 2017, but i wasn‚Äôt that smart. 
I bought some ETH and other shitcoins here and there and made some dollars. 

Thanks to you, I‚Äôm gonna go for some tiny amount of BTC and/or ETH frequently, instead of gambling with shittys. 

Thanks again!
People who use the metaphor ‚Äúshitcoins‚Äù are the stupidest people on Earth LOL.

I sold BTC in 2019. Got lucky. Those days are long gone.

DePIN is the future. Bye bye BTC.

FYI: $TQQQ has smoked BTC since 2020, and will always smoke it from now on.

The days of 100x on BTC are over and have been for a long time.
Interesting..going to follow this
Is it too late to start this??
I am 35 and make less than $500 per month 
Thanks
What do you think about Luna ?
I still prefer altcoins.
Keep stacking
Props to OP! You‚Äôre a legend mate!
Amazing DCA well done OP
This is the way
How you doing with those UTXO thingies?
Should do this with ethereum and see what‚Äôs the best!
good luck cashing out... seems all of the exchanges are shady AF
Patience is the greatest virtue with Bitcoin. Once you understand the why of Bitcoin, the only number that matters is how many BTC you own. Certainly not the valuation at a given time of your Bitcoin in weak money.
DCA is the best strategy, all time
Spreadsheet converted with any sort of visual tool probably.
If you paste your data series data into GPT4 and ask it to plot it got you it will create a pyplot plot for you automatically.
You can do it in excel quite easily actually.

I think the YouTuber is quick sheets or something like that. Does breakdowns on excel usage.
It‚Äôs Excel. (I think 2017 based on chart styles - not far off default charts).
They would really hate this post
Eh I‚Äôm tried and true FIRE (70% there) and have about 5% in crypto. Risk tolerance isn‚Äôt as high as OP but happy with my gains on both fronts.
I got banned for talking about BTC in a finance group. Trad-fi clowns can't stand that crypto is do successful.
I dont know if I would say that they hate crypto entirely, and some level of risk exposure is usually warranted, but they would definitely not support 100% savings going to crypto (nor would most other people).
Lol the boomers rage when it comes to crypto I love itttt
In hindsight when these reddit financial communities that hate crypto look back in 10 years and say "well it was risk, who would have known it would do so well" we'll just roll our eyes and say, we knew. It was never as risky as they thought. They just refused to do their own research. It's not a time share, it's math and science.
I've known a lot of people in FIRE that love crypto. There's just as many crypto haters in this group as in fire groups.
[deleted]
People will be saying that about this year in 2031. Buy now.
Peeps would still wait for a dip. Rinse and repeat
The FIRE community isn‚Äôt a monolith. There are plenty of FIRE influencers that aren‚Äôt outright against crypto and even some that are crypto investors. That said IMO BTC and maybe ETH are the only ones compatible with the general philosophy.
Easy when you have a low cost basis
Then you don't understand what DCA is then. You are probably one of the people in this sub that believes this stupid trend of DCA in and DCA out crap? Buying and selling is trading. DCA is investing. They are two separate things. Anyone who says DCA out is a thing is a complete noob and has no clue what they are talking about. Anyone who says you need conviction to not sell during the bad times of market volatility also has done zero research into the asset and even less research into investing in general.
How does it go against NASDAQ?
Plus you could have staked the ETH.
Valuable comment.
Interesting!
Nice! I also did the math on his blogpost, where he made a comment that doing the same for investing in the S&P would yield him a gain of 42%, which they claimed would be equal to inflation. However inflation from then to now was 24%.
It hurts knowing I bought almost as much BTC (4) in 2015 or something for like $750. Forgot what I even spent it on tbh‚Ä¶
Would be a completely different profit if they had started buying in 2020
Dont write bullet points when you retire
Do not become a writer? As a writer I have trouble to agree :)
And it could all be -100% tomorrow
Smart with hindsight. Could have gone the other way
Gotta wait it out bro, it's a long term game!
Just sit on it. If you thought it was a good investment then, nothing has really changed.
Bitcoin have never been at 70k. All time high is ~65k.
Not sure if you mean UK but for me quite easy in US . Either Coinbase or Gemini working fine .

I do not try Kraken yet
It's not a problem in the US, provided he pays his taxes. This means keeping detailed info on cost basis and filling out the annual form.
Ya and what‚Äôs your social security and pin code
[deleted]
Coinbase, move to a digital wallet on your phone called electrum


That's one way
I‚Äôm curious too
He links to Swan in the blog. It seems like a pretty valid option for DCA. Another option is Kado.Money. I use Eldorado.Market and do self-custody on my own keystore.  

Noteworthy because Eldorado uses the r/MayaProtocol which doesn't require KYC (Know Your Customer) and the default state is self custody.  No counter-party risk where whoever holding your BTC decides to not give it to you (or is prevented from giving it to you).  It's a purely decentralized solution.
Yes
lol
To a 2017, literally everything but BTC is a shitcoin.  ETH going to zero *any day now*.
You have a good understanding of Bitcoin and the cycles. Well done.
With 1m you can buy studios and rent them, getting pasive income for the rest of your life while retaining the initial value in proprieties.
BTC/USD and BTC/SPX would objectively disagree, but you do you.
Plenty of places in the world you could retire on a milly, just comes down to your personal preferences and environment
I wouldn't say no to a million euros.
In my country, with 1 million euros, you can buy a nice house and invest the remaining 850k euros in dividends, allowing you to live comfortably for the rest of your life.

So it ain't much, but you live a good life without working.
You say 25BTC is not much?
[deleted]
Thankfully it will only get better with finite bitcoin.
That‚Äôs why my goal is $10M. All crypto until I get there.
You can't retire unless you get a job first. *Taps head

I don't think he plans to cash out soon, but obviously he will have to pay taxes in order to do so with such an amount. Any other attempt is not recommended.
I like 10% off the top and then DCA out slowly as needed.
Idk where are you from, but in my country you can ‚Äúskip‚Äù the tax headache with selling BTC to a stablecoin. In my country, crypto is a blackbox, trading doesn‚Äôt matter only fiat <-> crypto conversions.

Bad bot
I buy BTC on Strike and send it to cold storage for zero fees. It's practically free on Strike app.
Cost nothing to print
They can't. Just interest alone is 1 trillion dollars a year, More than the entire military budget if I recall.
They just released the debt schedule for the next 10 years. You can see their plan.
Not everyone spends 150k a year
Buy 2 houses, rent 1 out
1mil is quite a lot but probably not guarantee retirement in many places.

Im not sure what kind of life OP is living but lets say he is single and lives pretty frugal life with 30k spent per year that would get him to over 30 years if btc price didnt move anywhere.

But if btc went up like 20% avg per year he could live off it pretty easily.
Depends on where you live

90k/yr in California is not the same as 90k/yr in Texas

&#x200B;

Some places you can live a very very good life if you net 40k euro/yr. That's 25 years.
He just buys BTC, he spent 40k through the years. He didn't sell anything. He has almost 4.5 BTC, so ~150k in today's btc price.
Depends on location
It is if you diversify your investments after reaching your goal
Still has 3x value and in bull market he'll be even or even x2 since 2021 ath.

A buddy of mine has 4 million in ETH. Just the staking alone nets him a ton of money.
Tell us more, how is ur average how much eth u have now, are u staking?
I've used Kraken since day 1, and I don't know what you consider "ate up" but I never thought the fees were that terrible.
You can invest the 1m to gain passive income.
You're both saving. He is earning compound interest on an investment, while you are paying off interest to the bank. However, future appreciation of the house is all your profit even though it was a leveraged investment. The bank gets profit now in interest, and you get it later in appreciation. You can't take shelter in a Bitcoin.
Take your shitcoin profits and split them into BTC and ETH, 75/25.

Is plyplot plot a redundancy?
Someone should link this to that subreddit, and then compare the gains of Bitcoin to the S&P since 2017. 

Instant aneurysm. 

As a side note, I like the concept of FIRE but I left that subreddit because of the incessant toxicity.
They really do hate this one simple trick.
I wouldnt assume OPs risk tolerance is high because they buy bitcoin, they might just analyse the risk differently.  


To some, buying bitcoin may be the least risky option.
The only time I ever put money into mutual funds I ended up only gaining 1% in a year. To me stocks are more risky. I've been in crypto since 2012 so it's my old faithful. I wish I had put that money in crypto instead. So I think it depends on your understanding and experience of the world.

\*Edit: funny some of you still think stocks are some how safer than crypto
!remindme 5 years
Yeah a lot of the original FIRE community were computer programmers which has a high overlap with a lot of the original crypto investors.

Both groups are willing to go against social norms to follow logical thinking.
You do realise all assets trade off sentiment right genius
Everything's value is only what someone else is willing to buy it for.
Bitcoins value is not in what's underlying it but rather its ability to settle transactions relatively instantaneously, across the world, with very low transaction fees, with no intermediary party needed, with minimal risk to the security or authenticity of the transaction. If governments choose to back it tomorrow, it could have an underlying value (I.e resources, military might, similar to fiat). 

It's simply a better form of money, having both attributes of gold and fiat simultaneously. But you're right that there's no underlying asset of material worth. However the more transaction volume escalates, the more viable bitcoin can be recognized as a form of settlement, thus increasing its value to users.
BTC, like any stock. Prices based on sentiment.
Bitcoin does have underlying value.  It takes energy to mine it.  It's also more fair than any other currency out there because more can't be printed.
We'll see.
New to all this. Why does a low cost basis mean? Is there a good source you can perhaps link to? Thanks in advance!
What are you on about?
It's crazy how you wrote an entire snarky paragraph that said absolutely nothing substantial

It‚Äôs almost like it would be completely different every single year‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
No shit. And yet he would still be at 15% compared to about 10% for the S&P. 

Your point is pointless
Where I'm at. Still holding for a gain.
His blog has a breakdown on the profit/loss on each of the purchases that he has made. Check his [December 2023](https://er-bybitcoin.com/stackin-em-volume-35-december-2023/) blog.
Yeah of course, but it didn‚Äôt.
69k
Sorry. Not 70k+. Bought at 46k to 54k. Still at a loss‚Ä¶ Just waiting for it to go higher to recuperate my losses‚Ä¶
Ive had like 1 or 2 transactions inveatigated by my bank in Czech Republic(EU) after that no problem, but ive always been taking small sums just a few k‚Ç¨ out, just in case.
In a world where people think stating what exchange you use is equal to giving out your SSN and pin code...
Oh boy, if that‚Äôs the case, he‚Äôll be in on for one hell of a surprise when he wants to move that BTC (network fees)
Thanks. I hope I'm right, but nothing is for sure with crypto's. ü§ôüèº
Passive, meaning you don't have to deal with damages, repairs, upgrades, evictions, etc?
Enough to be mortgage free and only have to work 20 hours a week for spending money.
Lemme guess, you‚Äôre from Iowa?
If that's his only asset, then I agree. If you already have some real estate paid for, plus that much cash, I don't think many people would complain.
I'd argue it's not at ALL unless he's 85.
The supply is still increasing though and for a long time.
That‚Äôs a crazy cost basis fair play to OP
In my country you can sell without any taxes if you hold for atleast one year.
Mostly nothing.
The fact you don't know how compounding works, tells me you won't be around here for long.

Oh word. Thanks for explaining it! I think the "fiat stack" threw me off. Hadn't heard that term before
Getting fewer sats for the same money
Total of 60 Eth + staking. Trying to buy 1-2 Eth a month
Totally, I understand. But I think the mistake we're making (myself included) is thinking that 4% passive income annually from 1M will be enough. For me, I want to retire at 57 (20 years from now), and should have roughly 1.5M by that time. But I have to ask myself if $60K (4% of 1.5M) which is still taxable by the government, will be enough to pay my mortgage, bills, and feed myself, and still have enough to enjoy retirement. 

I think it would be very tight, and quality of life will suffer. There is an unexploded atomic bomb awaiting many of us millennials who think *everything will be fine* when infact, it won't.
True, and it's gone up in value by nearly 100k, so it's not all bad I guess! :)
Literally what I'm going to do, on top of taking fiat.

Million.. a million Bitcoin?? Geeze im born in 96‚Äô, so I had no idea it was even a thing but how much was it back in the day?
The point is very pointful, actually
It is not pointless. If BTC just yields 5% more return compared to S&P for all the extra exposure, it changes the narrative.  


Just goes to show how %return vs S&P is not necessarily the best way to measure performance because it can be manipulated so easily (though I do not have better alternatives myself).
That‚Äôs some very quick maths you just did. Care to share your working?
So it wasn‚Äôt smart because it was a gamble
Would you buy more? add to your bag from lower levels so your average entry is lower. 

Unless of course you already bought more than you're comfortable with at the beginning
I've transfered crypto, into fiat, and transfered into my bank account instantly probably a few dozen times over the past few years. Not one issue. In US, bank with chase.

No it was during 2020 - 2021. I invested in major mutual funds like ARK and a few others I'd been hearing such amazing things about. If I would have put that money into crypto I would have outperformed the mutual funds by an order of magnitude or more.
What‚Äôs the underlying value of Facebook? Yes, they have positive cash flow, but that‚Äôs the effect of its underlying value, not the underlying value itself. 

The underlying value of Facebook is the network they built. The company was able to monetize the network by selling ads to people in the network. But the reason anyone was willing to pay Facebook anything was because the network they have is valuable. Yes, this is oversimplified, and the data collection they do is a big part of it (and they‚Äôve diversified a bit since then, too). 

But at the end of the day, the value of Facebook all derives from the fact that there is an existing network that billions of people use because they see value in using it. If people lost interest in the Facebook network and went elsewhere, the value of Facebook would plummet dramatically. 

The underlying value of bitcoin is the network/functioning system it exists on that people see value in using. It is valuable to be able to buy, convert, send, and sell currency purely electronically. In the case of Facebook, their network was owned by a company that needed to be able to turn a profit. They were able to leverage the value of their network to generate ad revenue, which makes Facebook a profitable company and plays a big role in the value of Facebook stock. But the network, itself, was already valuable before the owner of the network became profitable. That‚Äôs why people used it (and still do). Facebook users find value in using the Facebook social network (at least enough value to continue using it, even knowing they and their data are the product). 

For bitcoin, there‚Äôs no owner that needs to extract revenue from the network. Just because some owner isn‚Äôt making a profit by exploiting the network, doesn‚Äôt mean the network isn‚Äôt valuable. Just as Facebook users see value in the ability to connect with friends and family and see photos and share articles and chat in groups and so on, users of the bitcoin network see value in the ability to buy and store a digital asset on a stable and existing network and be able to send money around the world and trade coins in the hope of making a profit and so on and so on. 

And the bitcoin network is a fairly stable one. It is pretty hard to kill. It might not be the best in terms of cost or speed, but it is the best in terms of staying power. And there‚Äôs no ‚Äúhead‚Äù to kill to make the body fall apart. It almost runs on its own (not exactly, but it‚Äôs so decentralized). But many cryptocurrencies have some level of underlying value because of the existence of the network and the value people see in the network of people using the system. 

What‚Äôs the underlying value of any fiat currency? There‚Äôs no positive cash flow. There‚Äôs not gold backing it. But there is an existing network of people and functioning system for using that fiat currency. 

What‚Äôs the underlying value of the SWIFT system? Is it not that it‚Äôs an established network of people using it? What‚Äôs the underlying value of the NY stock exchange? Yes, the owner of it makes money from transaction fees, but why do companies list on the NYSE instead of a cheaper exchange? It‚Äôs because of the network of people using the NYSE. More people are using it. More people default to it. It‚Äôs easier because it‚Äôs been the default so long. That‚Äôs the value. If everyone started to use some new stock exchange and left the NYSE, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to make much money on transaction fees and would go belly up. 

The cash flow isn‚Äôt the value. The value is the reason there‚Äôs a cash flow.
You don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs baseline value lies in the energy cost to produce it?
Humanity chose gold to have value because it is shiny and easily melted. So not a lot of difference between gold and bitcoin in that regard.
Thank you
Bro, it‚Äôs 2024‚Ä¶ do you really still believe this about bitcoin? This take is older than 10 years old. 

Do you still buy DVDs?
Miners being fed isn‚Äôt a great analogy. For this you would consider the equipment, time, and money invested into mining the gold. It‚Äôs difficult to get due to its scarcity. If you consider those factors then it does become similar to Bitcoin.
I mean, if every gold miner suddenly ate a bullet for breakfast, the price would likely go up.  
But thats a whole other discussion.

1. 15% compared to 10% is a 50% increase in returns.

2. 3 years is too small a time frame to appropriately evaluate this.
I googled bitcoin DCA calculator and S&P 500 DCA calculator and put in a 3 year time frame.
Not really a gamble if you understand this at all
Ok üëç
I already bought a lot at the top. When it dipped, I bought, and it dipped and dipped, until I run out of budget already. I am not comfortable anymore to spend more than 10% of my portfolio for 1 coin, so I stopped. Now, I was just waiting for it to go up to hopefully 100k ish.

¬£10k is barely enough to cover my food shopping, coffee, eating out and beer expenses.

10k wont stay the minimum for 100 years mate. prices increase. in the last 3/4 years alone prices have increased 150%. and i doubt most people want to live on ramen noodles and potatoes for the rest of their lives in a shack in the outlands.
I would have to know a lot more about your life like your age and whether you are married or plan on having children or any of those things.

  


I can tell you pretty confidently that a million dollars is not enough for you to live the rest your life on however.

You're mixing up the word 'compounding' with the trad finance concept of 'compounding interest'. If you really want a direct comparison then consider eth staking.
Wow.

Suppose you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin, and the annual return on your investment is 10%. At the end of the first year, your investment would grow to $1,000 + ($1,000 \* 0.10) = $1,100.  
  
Now, for the second year, your investment is not just $1,000; it's $1,100. Assuming the same 10% annual return, at the end of the second year, your investment would be $1,100 + ($1,100 \* 0.10) = $1,210.  
  
This process continues, and each year the return is calculated based on the new total, not just the original investment amount. Over time, the compounding effect accelerates the growth of your investment.

You don't need interest to get compounding effect. The increase in value IS the compounding over time.

It's even greater if you continue to pour inn more money each year. How is this hard to grasp?
Compounding isn't restricted to fiat money, smarty pants. This is BASIC economy my man.
Chat GPT thinks:  
Compound interest is a concept typically associated with traditional financial instruments like savings accounts, bonds, or stocks, where the interest earned is reinvested to generate additional interest over time. However, the concept of compounding can also apply to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but in a slightly different manner.

In the context of Bitcoin, compounding can occur through strategies such as "hodling" (holding onto Bitcoin for an extended period) or participating in certain investment platforms or protocols that offer interest-bearing accounts or staking rewards.

Here are a few ways compounding can work with Bitcoin:

1. **Hodling**: If you buy Bitcoin and hold onto it as its value appreciates over time, the increased value of your Bitcoin holdings effectively compounds. For example, if you bought 1 Bitcoin at $10,000 and its value doubles to $20,000, you've effectively experienced compounding growth.
2. **Interest-bearing accounts**: Some cryptocurrency platforms offer interest-bearing accounts where you can deposit your Bitcoin and earn interest over time. The interest earned can then be reinvested, leading to compounding growth of your Bitcoin holdings.
3. **Staking**: In certain blockchain networks that utilize proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, participants can stake their coins to help secure the network and earn rewards in return. These rewards can be compounded by restaking them, leading to exponential growth of your staked Bitcoin holdings.
4. **Yield farming and liquidity mining**: These are advanced DeFi (Decentralized Finance) strategies where users provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges or lending protocols in exchange for rewards, often in the form of additional cryptocurrency tokens. These rewards can be compounded by reinvesting them back into the protocol.
Idk about coinbase
Dm me
Ah yes, Reddit comments, where you go to learn the most basic of Excel‚Äôs functions.
I definitely understand your point but if we‚Äôre looking at function there are much more capable, more sustainable variants of blockchain technology than bitcoin. I‚Äôd argue bitcoins biggest strength at this point in time is its position as the first of its kind, almost every other aspect has been superseded by other blockchains. 

I‚Äôm confident the floor for a lot of these tokens has been seen already as we move into a second cycle of smart contracts and locked tokens. People are now purchasing and truly owning proper digital content like books and soon audiobooks, films and games. For the first time in history we‚Äôre reclaiming ownership of content produced by artists that they want you to buy and own. 

The production companies seized ownership for themselves in the digital age with their own subscription based services. These streaming services are great for some but you don‚Äôt own anything, if you stop paying you can‚Äôt listen. Even if you paid for 3 years or more costing hundreds you have nothing to show for it until you continue to pay. You can‚Äôt then decide to resell any of that content or lend it to anyone, it was never yours.

With decentralised distribution artists can get their content directly to the consumer without a middleman, they can retain 10% royalties using smart contracts embedded into the NFT. In my opinion it‚Äôs the most exciting thing (and one of the most valuable) that‚Äôs happened since the beginning of the internet. My problem with bitcoin is that it can‚Äôt do this and uses way too much energy for something that relies on energy scarcity but exponential increase in consumption to retain it‚Äôs value and function
I hope no one believes that because the energy is used up in a very inefficient manner and then it‚Äôs gone for good. Think of it this way: would you be better off to own 100% of Apple or 100% of Bitcoin?
Also its an inert metal which happens to be a good conductor.

What exactly is compounding when you hodl a coin? Are you under the impression that appreciation (which itself is not guaranteed) is the same as compounding?
Appreciation != compounding and the other 3 points don‚Äôt even apply to Bitcoin specifically. Maybe you should‚Äôve used GPT4.
What's your return on staking?
No problem!
Heehee
Yes, but things will keep getting more expensive!!!!

Jokes aside, I am in a similar boat. Once I cut out rent, my cost of living will be way below 10k. In fact, 10k a year for me would be quite luxurious on my own. I am a simple man. 500k into KO would give me that in dividends while protecting me from inflation. 

In all honesty, I think I would need about 450k to be set for life. A bit more to raise a big family. The goal here too is to get to 1 million.
yeah but inflation is going beyond any investing you could do. Unless you expect 150% return every 5 years. so maybe read it again yourself mate. Have a good one.
But it's way more than what you have today. It's what you need tomorrow but this is each person's decision to make and they will have to deal with the results of that decision...
God I hope so...
I could use staking as an even simpler explanation, but I thought that kinda speaks for itself. Your brain is stuck in fiat mode, there are other ways of compounding than plain interest rate.
Kinda hard to teach math to a monkey it seems.
It's a form of compounding. People are way too used with fiat interest, it's not the only form of compounding.

It literally is not compounding under any definition. Just because something goes up does not make it ‚Äúcompounding‚Äù.
A Mean Reversion Strategy with 2.11 Sharpe
Hey guys,

Just backtested an interesting mean reversion strategy, which achieved **2.11 Sharpe**, **13.0% annualized returns** over 25 years of backtest (vs. 9.2% Buy&Hold), and a maximum drawdown of **20.3%** (vs. 83% B&H). In 414 trades, the strategy yielded 0.79% return/trade on average, with a **win rate of 69%** and a profit factor of **1.98**.

The results are here:

[Equity and drawdown curves for the strategy with original rules applied to QQQ with a dynamic stop](https://preview.redd.it/ptsjrshdpn1d1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=675b9a055c17ecb18d7a5b683e6e206732d4df8d)

[Summary of the backtest statistics](https://preview.redd.it/ky1f3cagpn1d1.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=709b17b15f012f157bfc7e5d2afcff3abe8f0b9a)

[Summary of the backtest trades](https://preview.redd.it/igfihwuipn1d1.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c8fcf360a4c29fec75465321041f0c3899650f6)

The original rules were clear:

* Compute the¬†**rolling mean of High minus Low**¬†over the¬†**last 25 days**;
* Compute the¬†**IBS indicator**: (Close - Low) / (High - Low);
* Compute a¬†**lower band**¬†as the¬†**rolling High**¬†over the¬†**last 10 days**¬†minus 2.5 x the rolling mean of High mins Low (first bullet);
* **Go long**¬†whenever¬†**SPY closes under the lower band**¬†(3rd bullet), and¬†**IBS is lower than 0.3**;
* **Close the trade**¬†whenever the¬†**SPY close is higher than yesterday's high**.

The logic behind this trading strategy is that the market tends to bounce back once it drops too low from its recent highs.

The results shown above are from an improved strategy: better exit rule with dynamic stop losses. I created a full write-up with all its details [here](https://quantitativo.substack.com/p/a-mean-reversion-strategy-with-211).

I'd love to hear what you guys think. Cheers!
So few trades of such short duration and high win loss suggests very strongly to me it‚Äôs seriously overfitted. Check my math: to go live you could not have 99.5% confident that is was still performing  at 6:1 until 5 years. Why don‚Äôt you trade micro lots for a year and see how you feel then.
Have you tried it on each of the major components of QQQ?
"Compute the rolling mean of High minus Low over the last 25 days;

Compute the IBS indicator: (Close - Low) / (High - Low);

Compute a lower band as the rolling High over the last 10 days minus 2.5 x the rolling mean of High mins Low (first bullet);

Go long whenever SPY closes under the lower band (3rd bullet), and IBS is lower than 0.3;

Close the trade whenever the SPY close is higher than yesterday's high."

How sensitive is the strategy w.r.t. these parameters? E.g. if you take 21 days instead of 25, IBS 0.25 or 0.5 instead of 0.3.

Also be careful when assuming that you both know that the close is higher than yesterday's high and that you can still execute at close. In practice you'd need the price 10 mins before close etc
Seems promising, but still cherrypicked? It seems you benchmarked it against QQQ, but started the benchmark when it was pretty much at its highest (QQQ had an 80%+ drawdown from the dotcom bust). If you had started your backtesting in 2003 instead of 1999, your strategy would have underperformed QQQ. How does the graph look against SPY?


Also worries me that there are only 414 trades, which is a small enough number to possibly be luck based too.
I coded and tested that strategy in Tradingview Pinescript here is the result.

[Tradingview Link Strategy Example](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/QfevgYfZ/)

SPX -> 1995 to now.

* Profit: 478%
* Drawdown: 29.28%

The graph looks nice, but it experienced some struggles after 2017.

I am sharing the indicator code so people can test it in TradingView using the FreedX Backtest indicator (Custom Signal section with importing sources):

    //@version=5
    indicator("Custom Strategy", overlay=true)
    
    // Input variables
    length = input.int(25, title="Rolling Mean Length")
    length_high = input.int(10, title="Rolling High Length")
    multiplier = input.float(2.5, title="Multiplier for Rolling Mean")
    IBS_threshold = input.float(0.3, title="IBS Threshold")
    
    // Compute the rolling mean of High minus Low over the last 25 days

I just tested your strategy for an hourly period instead of a daily period for some stocks like SPXL and BITX and for the leveraged stocks it does pretty well. Here are some of my results: 

Exposure Time \[%\]       18.434670

Return \[%\]              91.540093

Buy & Hold Return \[%\]  150.349208

Volatility (Ann.) \[%\]  101.763651

Win Rate \[%\]            66.666667

ETR \[%\]                496.564857  (This just says what the return would be if the return was multiplied for 100% exposure time instead of 18%)
Good stuff. Simple, yet clearly well though out strategy!
Forget about the results. The methodology is more important than the results and you didn't really describe it anywhere. It looks like you made the beginner's mistake of not using a tripartite chronological training/validation/test split of your data. You performed your parameter space exploration using something resembling grid search over the entire dataset which you also performed your backtest with, which is a big no-no. Performing curve fitting with the test dataset will consistently yield amazing **Sharpe ratios greater than 2.0**. Unfortunately they hold **no predictive power** and will fail the paper trading test.

I suggest you throw out all your current parameters and change your methodology such that you at least have bipartite chronological split with the fitting using data from, say, 2000 - 2015 and then the test being performed with data from 2016 - now. Be aware that even such splits still invite curve fitting because people will keep on tweaking the algorithm to improve the results with the second dataset, which will diminish their predictive power. This is why a tripartite split generally yields algorithms with greater predictive power.

Also, I would like to point out that any approach based on just OHLC data is unlikely to beat the market nowadays. For low frequency systems you generally want fundamental analysis and sentiment analysis in addition to price data. For high frequency systems the most important thing might be order flow data.
Looks interesting, could you perhaps check the strategy performance during high/low volatility? From a brief look it seems like the strategy performs better during high volatility periods (which makes sense since you are relying on IBS).

Also, I‚Äôd check how it performs during large SPY movers earnings or other news outside of trading hours.  

This can also apply to specific sectors and other markets that are more volatile and have a higher chance of correcting their price the day after a spike
Did you also compare long term tax rate vs short term? If you take into account short term capital gains you probably aren't beating buy and hold (for at least a year).
I would calculate the returns for each year and compare it to benchmark. Some years appear pretty flat. Not that it's a bad thing but given the low # of trades, you might wonder "is this thing really working?" when you're running it live and the benchmark is outperforming it. Run it through a tearsheet library like quantstats. 

In your article, with the long/short version the max drawdown is reduced but if you use, say, 3x leverage but the total return is still less than the long only version. I think the long only version with 2x leverage would be best. Max drawdown would be the same as S&P 500 but the total return would be much higher. Gotta take taxes and margin interest into account though, I don't know the calculations for this off the top of my head. 

Nice work and thanks for sharing.
What do you use to do the back test?
Looking at the individual trades on a chart, it becomes clear that you get no trades over quite long periods when qqq is trending up and the pullbacks are less volatile. Maybe use an sma-filter to differentiate up-trend vs down-trend? Loosen the thresholds when in uptrend, and tighten the thresholds when in downtrend.

  
I implemented your strategy in tradingview and changed the following differences:

Rolling-high lookback = 25 (same as rolling mean) -> one less parameter

If close > sma50: IBS-threshold = 0.2, band-multiple = 2

if close < sma50: IBS-threshold = 0.1, band-multiple = 3.5

  
Seems to yield quite a lot better results, at least according to tradingview's backtester.
Market  has  changed   over  the  years.     Some  25  years  ago  ,  there was no  market makers ,   number of  computers trading  was   below 20..
..
  Let  it  run  2 -4 √∑ months  in forward  testing mode  (dry run )   real market ,  demo money ...  and    after  x  month    analize it
Here's an idea: why not try and let the profits run for a bit (it would be trying to mix mean reversion with momentum type strategy, but who cares if it works). Also the stop loss of lower than 300-day mean must be very wide during bull market, would you consider some kind of trailing stop instead?

Modified exit rule would be something along the lines: 

- trailing stop as a  rolling mean of high minus low (1st bullet) - or a fraction of it

- potentially (but not necessarily) take profit of rolling low plus 2.5x rolling mean of high minus low (3rd bullet) - to make it symmetrical with entry rule

- scrap the original exit rules 

  
It would be useful to see what's your skewness (or best and worst trade, or  the number for overall best/worst trade ratio that's missing in your per-trade stats). Mean doesn't tell the whole story, it might be heavily skewed by outliers. We like when those outliers are positive but not otherwise.

My guess is that you have few very bad trades, but the best are much smaller (negative skew). Better stop-loss, not necessarily the one suggested above, might improve this.
Tested on GSPC going back to 1928. From 1928 - 1985 it was on a straight pathway to zero. 95 % drawdown with no recoveries in between. Then started to work from 1985 onward.
What is IBS?
What software/website did you use for strategy backtest?
Any code we can look at to backtest it ourselves?
I backtested this from 1980 and sure the equity curve looks like yours. However, the actual Sharpe is not around 2 as that only takes into account the days with returns. Taking into account all the days where you don't have any positions, the actual Sharpe is around 0.65 (before fees).
Yeah one question, does it only work when interest rate is low?¬† See it drawdowns around 2023 onwards when interest rate creep higher. Maybe it's susceptible to regime change ? Backtest data prior to 2022 are all in a period of extremely low interest rate that tends to make stocks bounce back up faster. If interest is going to stay higher for longer does it still work ? # just 2 cents for your consideration¬†
Can you link to the original blogpost where you got the original rules that you mentioned in your blog?
Cool stuff.  Lever that shit up 1.5x
remindMe! 2 day
To OP: What about short performance? I mean us equities have one of the best two decades of long only
The results from 1993 look good but it has massively underperformed buy & hold over the last 10 years.
The strategy mostly hinges on the period 2000-2003. Most of the other years it greatly underperforms B&H. If you can prove the 2000-2003 period would repeat itself in the near future, you have a winner. Since you can‚Äôt prove that, it‚Äôs a losing strategy going forward.
mark
What are you using for your data source? Using NorgateData I was getting sharpe of 0.85 annualized returns of 13% and drawdown of 23% for same timeframe, 99'-24'. And that was without including commissions or slippage.
When are you executing the trade? 

I also had a very good backtest using IBS but the issue was that when running it live, you cannot know the high/low/close of the day and buy on the close, even if you do it at 3:59:59 a second before market close. The high/low and close execution was vastly different than what was reported in the consolidated feed after the trading day is over. 

I would try moving your execution over by one full day (next day close) or next day open, and the backtest results will likely be much worse.
I don't have much to add other than great post! I hope you open source your engine.
Are you using python for backtesting? I‚Äòm trying to reproduce your strategy but with much worse results.
This is an Odmund Grotte strategy, based on Larry Connors (based on Linda Rashkle). I traded stuff like this since 2009 and did well out of it (although my main speciality was VIX trading (when it worked) and then VC). The general idea is to buy short term pull backs then sell a few days later. It works fine if you have the stomach to make the buys on these short term pull backs, that takes balls and I think most people could not do it (it is scary!). It is not really overfitted as anyone can verify by examining how the results change as the parameters vary within an obvious reasonable range. The issue for me is that you can have many years sub 10%, eg for these params here I get 1.8% return in 2023. Nobody would stick with that strategy in reality... you would always be thinking maybe it's been arbed and I need to turn off the strategy. Or years '16, '17, '18, '19 results of 4.8%, 8%, -17%, 7.8%. It's not enough... need to be aiming at things in the 15-20% CAGR range to make it worth the stress and time of running the strategy. IMO
Very interesting and great thorough post. I have a couple questions on the lower band and the rolling high indicators being used:
- is the rolling high a single number each trading day which is equal to the highest high made over the last 10 trading days?
- if so, than the lower band is just a single number as well on each given trading day correct, computed as: rolling high - (2.5 x rolling mean)? 

Thank you for the info, just wanted to be sure I understand! I appreciate it!
This strategy is worse than the buy and hold on the average, it was only able to avoid that huge drop in the beginning. Otherwise the gap between them is closing...
How is the strategy performing now over these last 5 months? This will be a perfect test if the strategy was overfit or not.
Out of curiosity, what platform do you use for back testing?
Nice
How did you learn all of these? How can I start man üò≠
How you do this mate... Can you please tell?
YOU WILL (there is no doubt about it) GET SCREWED by the slippage, backtest with bid/ask data then comeback to us
Can you just use a Bollinger band?
Can you please share the code to reproduce this analysis?
Sooooo... Buy the dip?  Seems ok but it's not earth shattering.
I built a Mean Reversion EA for MT5 that takes $1,000USD and rolls it to $2,000,000 on Brent Crude Oil Cash (XBRUSD) in 25 months. I‚Äôd post a pic of the results but I can‚Äôt here
Yeah, I will change it to trade all components of Nasdaq 100 simultaneously, in parallel
The real overfitting comes from knowing the history of the SP500 over the last year. The whole motivation for the strat is based on ex-post knowledge that the market did, in fact, bounce back after all of the large downturns which occurred.
Also, it would be better to put it into a official national bank, they give you on average the same ¬±13% profit on your account and it's a secure income.
I'd say they are pretty robust. Just ran your suggested numbers (21 days instead of 25, and IBS 0.25 instead of 0.3), and got 1.96 Sharpe, 11.5% annualized returns, and -18% max drawdown. The trade statistics are almost the same: 68% win rate, 1.95 profit factor, 2.11 win/loss ratio, 1.0 payoff.

The equity curve is almost identical.

Regarding your last comment, it's a good point: I'm executing the orders at the price of the next open, so we are covered there. :)
Is it a bad strategy if the Sharpe is sensitive to these parameters? Aren't all strategies sensitive to something?
Starting on Jan-1st 2003, the strategy would have achieved an even higher Sharpe (2.22) and lower max drawdown (-17.1%), but indeed a lower annualized return vs B&H (10.5% vs 14.5% QQQ... but higher than 8.6% S&P 500). Btw, important to highlight: the exposure time is only 14.8%.

Here's the equity curve [vs. Buy&Hold](https://imgur.com/a/WTcG7NB), and [vs. S&P 500](https://imgur.com/QMOQcro).
Thanks, do you also have a graph of that?
Thanks! I'm sorry, but I didn't do a grid search at all! In fact, I stuck with the same parameters throughout the whole strategy development. There's no need to train/test/validate if you are not changing any parameters... I did no "parameter space exploration" as you mention whatsoever :)

In fact, as I pointed out in the full write-up, **I don't believe in parameter optimization at all**, as I believe they lead to overfitting as you rightly said. So, I did zero optimization. 

You have a good point regarding fundamental analysis and sentiment analysis. During this great discussion, someone pointed out the low # of trades, and a good way to fix that is to trade all components of Nasdaq 100 individually, in parallel, using the strategy rules. I believe that will be a great opportunity to use fundamental analysis as you mention, to prioritize stocks with good fundamentals.

I personally don't think I can beat the game at high-frequency trading, so I don't even try... don't even look at order flow data...
Great points‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll check them for sure! I‚Äôm thinking about changing the strategy to make it trade all Nasdaq 100 components individually, in parallel, and what you are suggesting is a good criteria to select which ones to prioritize
No, I didn't. This is a critical topic... if you start thinking you must pay up to 37% in capital gains if you trade short-term (<1 year) vs. up to 20% long-term (>1 year), you might end up giving up and just buying a low-cost ETF and forgetting about it until retirement. If you are too much concerned about it (and I'm not saying you shouldn't be), maybe algorithmic trading is not for you, because it will certainly mean you have to pay much more taxes than just buy & hold.

Now, having said that, I don't think simulating backtests with tax considerations is a good idea. Let me tell you why I think so:

1. It's personal. Every person has a different tax bracket depending on his/her tax planning strategies. So, 2 different persons might execute the same strategy and get totally different results (i.e. one pays 10% taxes, and the other 37%). This by itself is a no-go for me, as it will make it harder to compare 2 different backtest results (you might end up comparing apples to oranges without knowing it).

2. It's complex to implement. It's not that the US tax rules for short/long-term capital gains are too complex (there are countries with way more complex rules), but writing the code to compute taxes will indeed add complexity to the code base and make the runs slower.

Does that make sense?
Many many many years ago I implemented a back test engine in python for my master‚Äôs degree‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs an event-driven engine (they are slower than the vector-based engines but imho they are easier to write strategies for, understand and debug) with all blows and whistles, similar to the late zipline. In fact, I tried most of the python back test engines that exists, and that‚Äôs why I prefer to use what I built over the years: I have 100% of understanding of what‚Äôs happening, and 100% of control. I‚Äôm thinking about open sourcing it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not that complicated, not even 1000 lines of code‚Ä¶
Yeah, I tried Market Regime Filters... I tried SMA 150, 200, and 300: 300 worked best... I don't know about TradingView's backtester... I'm not particularly a fan of using backtest engines that either i) are free, or ii) I haven't developed it myself (so I truly understand what is happening and have 100% of control over it)
Great points, thanks! As I reported in the [full write-up](https://quantitativo.substack.com/p/a-mean-reversion-strategy-with-211), I tried fixed stops, but they never quite worked. I'll try trailing stops and your suggestion of exit rules.

Regarding the distribution of trades:

- In the 4th line of the 2nd table I reported the best/worst trades: +18.07%, -10.75%;

- Here's the [histogram with the distribution of all trades](https://imgur.com/FMmSs4y). The red line is the median (0.92%), while the green lines are 5% and 95% percentiles (-3.8%, +5.1%): 90% of trades occur in this range.

Contrary to what you guessed, there's a positive skew... but anyway, I will try your modified exit rules... thanks!
If you follow the rules I shared, you should get the exact same results. Anyway, to help even further, I'm thinking about open-sourcing my backtest engine..
Great to hear!! Regarding sharpe ratio: the correct way to compute it is to consider only the days where we have positions in our portfolio. We should not consider the days where we are 100% in cash.
The rules don‚Äôt take interest rates into consideration
It was a post on [quantifiedstrategies.com](http://quantifiedstrategies.com) that I found I saved some time ago.

I can't find the original, they keep changing the website...
I tried using leverage... a lot... PSQ and TQQQ... it never quite worked. Although I was able to increase returns, the Sharpe ratio suffered a bit... but the big hit was always on drawdowns. And as I am really trading these, larger drawdowns are not an option. (More about everything I tested [here](https://quantitativo.substack.com/p/a-mean-reversion-strategy-with-211)...)
And also try other international equities that are a bit sideways (e.g., China)
Thanks... but just to highlight: the exposure time is only 15%! Had you been invested in Buy&Hold only 15% of the time, you'd see how great the strategy is in comparison to B&H. Or put in another way: looking at the exposure-adjusted return (annualized), you see 86.6% annual return vs 9.2 B&H!

Of course, it's not realistic to assume we could complement this strategy so that we could be invested 100% of the time (which is what the exposure-adjusted return considers). But say we can complement this strategy with 2-3 additional strategies with similar characteristics, so that we could double the exposure to say 30%: this means we would be able to double the annual returns, reaching over 25%.

Looking at the strategy as is, standalone, I'd say it is good but not great yet. To be great, we need to add more strategies to it and increase the exposure time. It's a good start, but not the end product. (Yet.)
For those, I used Yahoo... Norgate is not an option; it doesn't work for Mac. But I'll have to redo it using Sharadar. I used 1 basis point of slippage
I always execute on the open (backtest, forward test, or live trade): it's much easier
Yes... I'll open-source my backtesting engine so everyone can reproduce the results... 

What are you using to backtest?
The draw down is super low though. You can easily combine this with another strategy or a risk free rate sort of investment. Heck, you could even buy and hold and since we're only in the market 15 percent of the time we can afford to make the trades on margin

I'm super curious what you think because I might run a similar strategy to this

5 years of college (aerospace engineering) + 5 years of grad school (masters in computer science) + good courses of finance engineering/derivatives/etc + over 5 years of discretionary trading/investing + an very large number of books..

My suggestion to get started from zero: learn to code, learn the math (especially probability & statistics... and calculus if you want to trade derivatives), read everything you can get your hands on,  study as much as you can... and start small... 

For sure there are other ways, but I think this one minimizes the risks involved in the journey :)
Sure‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if you saw, by the end of the post I linked a more complete write-up, where I explain with more details this strategy. Take a look, and if you have any inputs/comments/questions just let me know! :)
400 trades in 24 years. Slippage is not a major issue.
All the runs consider 1 basis point in slippage costs, which imho is fine for such a liquid asset.

Increasing it to 5 basis points would lead to 2.01 Sharpe (vs. 2.11) and 12.3% annual returns (vs 13.0%).
If you follow the rules I shared, you should get the exact same results. Anyway, to help even further, I'm thinking about open-sourcing my backtest engine..
Mean reversion at its best :)
Try the top 7. They make up 50% or so. Individually I would expect more trade opportunities. Ideally optimise each individually.
what are you even saying?
What country are you in where a national bank pays 13% per annum interest?
I'd extend the backtest as SP500 data is easily accessible and "paper trade" before putting actual money on it. Good luck!
The more parameters, the easier it is to overfit/find a combination that works from pure luck. 

E.g. "Compute the rolling mean of High minus Low over the last N=25 days;

Compute the IBS indicator: (Close - Low) / (High - Low);

Compute a lower band as the rolling High over the last M=10 days minus r=2.5 x the rolling mean of High mins Low (first bullet);

Go long whenever SPY closes under the lower band (3rd bullet), and IBS is lower than  q=0.3;

Close the trade whenever the SPY close is higher than yesterday's high."

Here we have N,M,r,q as parameters. If you run N and M in [5, 252], r and q in [0.1, 0.2, ..., 5], you'll have 247x247x50x50 potential combinations, or over 152 million combinations. A decent PC can run this as a for loop in minutes and spit out the best Sharpe. This method is guaranteed to fail. This is why it's critical to test robustness of parameters.
I hope someone else can correct me if I'm wrong, but since the exposure time is only 15%, can't the remaining balance be considered as earning the risk-free rate (currently ~5%)? 

Of course this risk-free rate changes throughout the years, with most of the years returning 0%.
Oh, but you did change parameters. You changed the trailing stop rule, the SMA window size and possibly other things. As soon as you adjust these based on knowledge from the "future" (i.e. the holdout dataset), you're curve fitting outside the training data.
Nice, well done mate
Interested. Will follow you in case you do. Thx
ok, I think I misinterpreted what your line best/worst trade meant, these are indeed the numbers that I wanted.

From the histogram, positive skew is clear... event better for the strategy. 

Still trailing stops might improve performance. With profit taking it's easy to overfit, but I would still run 1 or 2 simmulations with some broadly sensible numbers.
This would be very cool. Looking at building my own right now so would love to see yours to get new ideas
I may be looking for the code as well
Well no, when you're 100% in cash you have a 0 Sharpe.
Yeah I know that. What I am saying is this backtest may be subjected to regime change as most data during the backtest period is an environment of very low interest rate.¬† So it may not be as profitable as it is now.¬†
In the [full write-up](https://quantitativo.substack.com/p/a-mean-reversion-strategy-with-211), I wrote about a long&short solution. Shorts improve the backtest results..

However, I tried the strategy in some international markets, and they did not quite work...
I also tried to repro using Norgate from \~99'-23', QQQ, executions on next day opens. I get similar results to FeverPC. There is a nasty drawdown during Covid 2020 that I don't see in the posted equity curve [https://imgur.com/a/DWyptSC](https://imgur.com/a/DWyptSC)
Oh interesting. Looks like I need to re-evaluate IBS and try these rules out! I will post back if I can reproduce similar results
Awesome, I like backtracking.py. Not well maintained but super handy for such tests.
[strategy on GitHub](https://github.com/fxhuhn/backtesting-trading-strategies/blob/main/strategies/mean_reversion_ndx100.ipynb)
Did you have the time to take a look at the code to see where the error in my thinking lies?
Hi. I agree with all that. Although... 20% DD is not "super low", it's actually normal or a little bit high (for a good strategy).

This is a perfectly reasonable strategy to run, especially, like you say, if you pair it with a fixed income asset, or some sort of trending strategy or even just an investment in the S and P 500.
Definitely open source it. I'm sure many people would like to compare your approach with what they're doing. Plus then any results you present can be audited and hence gain credibility.
average trade duration is  4 days, average return is 0.79%, I still think bid/ask backtest is necessary
Kk cool, I'll attempt to reproduce this weekend when I have time.

And that would be greatly appreciated if you do!
Yeah, I'll do something like that. (It's not that simple because I need to get the top N (7 or 100 or any number) stocks at that specific point in time in the past... otherwise we would be introducing survivorship bias...)

I get what he‚Äôs saying - He‚Äôs likely referring to calculating the indicators on the entire historical data vs. warming up the indicators and performing iterative backtesting (i.e when the algo can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù what‚Äôs ahead). Many ideas I had failed at this step in the backtesting process.
Colombia
100% this.

OP: I'd be curious to see a walk forward analysis, and parameter sensitivity charts.
How do you test for robustness?
"The more parameters, the easier it is to overfit/find a combination that works from pure luck."

I agree. But in the context, the OP had apparently 24 years of data. Isn't it hard to overfit on such length given relatively small number of parameters? It's not like a machine learned model with thousands of weights.

And I don't think optimizing 152M params can be done in only minutes. If the search space is this large, I'd imagine different people come up with different tactic to choosing the parameters. It's not like everyone would come to the same solution, as you implied, given enough computing power, which is just mainstream.
You are right, but I didn‚Äôt compute the risk free rate on the cash for the sake of simplicity. Also, the plan is to add 2-3 strategies to run together with this one, so we can increase the exposure. Say we can add those strategies and they have the same characteristics of this first one, and we manage to increase the exposure time to 50%. In that case, we would be able to double the return, reaching over 25% pa
The risk free rate hasn‚Äôt averaged anywhere near 5% over the last decade

You gave op some of the best advice. But he seemed to refuse the logic. I chuckled. The market never failed to teach the smartest lessons while extracting a cost, let alone the overconfident.
Imho that's a pretty purist view... in a very strict sense you are right.

I know this is a controversial point... But I know other professional quant traders and practitioners in general who share the same view I practice. In the end, imho, there is the science of things, and there is the engineering of things. And I'm an engineer..

Anyway, let's see how this strategy behaves in the forward test! :)
That's incorrect... You should only consider days when you were exposed to risk (days when cash is different than 100%)

Didn‚Äôt look in details, but just opening it 3 things caught my eye:
- although simple, my ‚Äúiterate‚Äù method (similar to your ‚Äúnext‚Äù) has over 50 lines of code. Yours has way fewer lines
- as I mentioned somewhere in the thread, I always trade at the opening of a day, based on yesterday‚Äôs close/indicators‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt see that in your code
- didn‚Äôt see the exit rule implemented.
In my experience, these kind of details matter a lot in this game.. hope it helps! Cheers
Even for something as liquid as QQQ? I can‚Äôt imagine it making much of a difference
I do medium/long term equities with end of day buy/sell calculations . There I calculate the daily value rather than capitalisation and only select those from the entire market that have a median daily $ great enough that my trades have sufficient liquidity.  For optimisation I use the most recent years that represent my guess at the current nature of the economy. Of that, I take a random third of the equities out of the training data as independent test data. I also test on the entire market in prior years that had a clearly different economy, e.g. pre to pose COVID. To ensure that a change in the market will not fail the system completely. When both test sets stop improving I stop the optimisation.

I don‚Äôt see how using the past 20 years of data is overfit to the history of the sp500 over the last year. By including the past different market regimes, we can see that it reacted and upheld in different cycles. The market has been in a steady upward bias for the last 100 years, indeed if that would not be the case for the next 10 years, then sure this strategy won‚Äôt work in this environment.(mean reversion still would have less DD than buy and hold in this instance) Otherwise, the strategy is exploiting a mean reverting behavior that is inherent to all the markets.
I mean, essentially yes? if you look at the equity indexes over the past 100 years you would, indeed see that chart goes up. I dont really understand why the need to claim it is overfitted just because the indexes have indeed gone only up over the past 100 years. The risk of ruin is covered by the 200 ma, so I really dont understand why use the term "overfit" here.
What do you mean the algo "sees" what is ahead? My Pine script algos can only work with past data.
Lol and what about currency exchange risk? Youll lose all your money due to peso depreciation (due to market or law).
minus the 6.x % inflation.
Thx! I'm starting forward test this week, will share an update once I start getting results
A surface of backtests. Visualise it and pick the simulation that is surrounded by an island of profitable runs.

If you just get a spike in a sea of unprofitable backtests, then the strategy is not robust and most likely just an outlier.
It may be 24 years of data, but it's only 400 trades, so definitely small enough to overfit
Sounds promising, don't see anything wrong with it, good luck!

Edit: Actually the downside I see is that with such few trades of about 1 a month, it'll take you a couple years of trading before you'd know if this system is working or not working. Because after 1 year of trading, lets say your winrate is only 40%, is that due to a couple bad luck trades or is the system not working? So the downside is that you could potentially waste years trading an unprofitable strategy before you realize it
How do you compute sharpe without the risk free rate? Sharpe is literally returns versus risk taken with the risk free rate as a baseline. If the risk free rate isn‚Äôt true/correct, your sharpe ratio will be way off.
This the way! 

What happens when you run the same strat on lower timeframes tho? Moar trades != moar better?
You performed look ahead bias (statistics conxept) when tweaking your strategy. Market will tell you, when the strategy stops working and your strategy starts losing money or stagnating.
If you drive 100kmh for an hour, stop for 30mins and then drive again 100kmh for an hour. What's the average speed throughout the journey? 

This is how people would read into it if their money was being invested. Unfortunately noone would read this as 2 Sharpe.
Backtesting.py trades by default on next days open. As I said, it‚Äôs super handy.
Pick some date in the past, and set it as the ‚Äúpresent‚Äù and test to see how well it does when it‚Äôs introduced to the following days. You ‚Äúsee‚Äù the following days but the algo cannot.
Every currency suffers a depreciation due to inflation, do not they?
Inflation will affect your investments, no matter if it's trading or bank PM.
Ah, walk forward analysis is robustness testing technique.  Where you take a portion of the data (and leave the other portion as "out of sample") optimize parameters for it, then apply those parameters to the out of sample.  Do this repeatedly over different portions of data. 

Here's a link for more.

Great point!
Great points‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm thinking here‚Ä¶ maybe a solution to the low number of trades is to change the strategy so it trades all Nasdaq 100 stocks individually, in parallel. Then, I‚Äôd expect around 100x more trades I the same timeframe..
Good point! Currently my whole setup/code is designed to place orders once a day, once the market opens‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd have to implement a big change to test your suggestion‚Ä¶

(It's a common mistake, I give you that.. :))
LATAM politics currently are shit and mex,col and ch are depreciating, so its a big no no during the short term at least.
Sure, but it is the amount - in relation to the interest paid - is important.
In other words: in this context, walk forward testing has nothing to do with live forward testing.
I'm thinking about looking at this and turning it into something that can be run on NQ so that instead of a few trades a year it's a few trades a month
That sounds great, I do that too. Just be care about overfitting if you start changing the numbers in your algorithm to fit to each stock individually, because there will definitely be stocks that are just super unprofitable with this strategy. But trading on all stocks should definitely provide you with a good sample size much earlier on, even if it's not as profitable or even unprofitable.
So this is daily chart and only trades ~1/month?
Nothing wrong with the premise I guess, just need more algos by it's side. Does the same strat work on other index markets for you?
Run this on NQ? RTY? YM? Other futures?
Just telling you how people would view it in practice, not in theory
But also remember that it's a SECURE investment, where trading is unsure, so I think it's worth it.
Yeah, totally... I'm really NOT into optimization, so I will apply the same global (fixed) parameters to all stocks
Yes, about \~1/mo... and yes, you are right: I will complement it with additional strategies to increase the exposure (and thus the number of trades).. No, it works basically on equities, large caps (QQQ, SPY)
In practice, people don't include days with no positions, as explained by Chris Aycock
Here's another source saying that, in practice, people don't include them:

[https://quantnet.com/threads/sharpe-ratio-question.3217/](https://quantnet.com/threads/sharpe-ratio-question.3217/)

There are tons of resources explaining that people exclude days with zero risk and why... hope it helps!
That I have not internalized yet. In that sense I'm still gambling sometimes when trading, I need to work on that.
If you want a more flattering backtest number sure, if you want to be transparent with investors then it's incorrect/misleading.
I understand your point. But that's not my point. My point is this:

* The industry computes the Sharpe ratio by excluding the days with zero exposure.
* If we, in our calculations, do not follow what the industry practices, it will be impossible to compare 2 different strategies. We must follow the industry standard, otherwise we would be comparing apples to bananas.

I assure you I don't care about flattering backtest numbers. (In fact, I only care about the profit a strategy makes, but that's another discussion :)). I'm only following the industry standard as any other professional, so people can compare apples to apples.

But I understand you. You have a problem with how the industry computes the Sharpe ratio. I personally don't mind. If the industry's standard were to compute including all days with zero exposure as zero (which is not what they do), I'd do it, no problem.
3 Years Ago, One of the Biggest Crypto Scams Happened. SQUID Went from $0.009 to $2,861 and then the Rug got Pulled
"A digital token inspired by the popular South Korean Netflix series Squid Game has lost almost all of its value as it was revealed to be an apparent scam.

Squid, which marketed itself as a "play-to-earn cryptocurrency", had seen its price soar in recent days - surging by thousands of per cent.

criticised for not allowing people to resell their tokens.
This kind of scam is commonly called a "rug pull" by crypto investors.
This happens when the promoter of a digital token draws in buyers, stops trading activity and makes off with the money raised from sales."

source: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59129466
Who still remembers that live video of that guy getting rekt by SQUID?
Everyone got rugged to dead and someone got rich. Like in the show
Well, seeing that it was based on a game where only one person can win and everyone else gets slaughtered, I'd say everyone who got rugpulled deserved it ü§∑
I remember watching the charts live waiting for the rug pull to happen. It was incredible to see happen in real time.

Can't believe 3 years have passed since!
You guys forgot about Bitconneeeeeeeeeect?

Or LUNA ?
You couldn't even sell this shit right? "Not a loss until you sell" gang is in shambles.
They took advantage of the series hype. Mfs were slick with it - They should serve some serious time in jail but people who bought this crap what were you thinking
Craziest part is the code including the scam was put up on GitHub for all to see.
![gif](giphy|7xZAu81T70Uuc|downsized)

Just saying.
Didn‚Äôt people already know they couldn‚Äôt pull their money out when they bought in?  I remember reading people already knew this, but were buying in just to be millionaires on paper.
Every single person who throws their money in such crap deserves to be rugged.

Get some common sense, seriously
Ah the good old days
Can you really call this a scam, though? Whoever bought was essentially aware of what would happen
This just happened to me last night on solana so idk what all the fuss is about
Yeah but it's not a scam by definition because they did exactly what they advertised. It was really genius
Spoiler already: any coin that has sell conditions is a scam.
makes 300,000x

*NO MAN I AM NOT SELLING THIS IS GOING TO THE MOON I JUST TURNED $100 into $30 million FUCK YOU PIGS GET REKT*
This technically wasn‚Äôt a rug pull. It was a scam / theft.

I swapped my $50 bnb to squid and when it jumped I tried to revert it back to bnb. But it prevents me from doing so. Basically it‚Äôs locked and that‚Äôs why it shoots up to 2.8k because nobody could withdraw.
Haha, I remember that. I told people in the daily chat that it was most likely a scam and that people should probably stay away.
3 years already? Holy shit >.>
Probably all rugged while one person experienced a dramatic increase in wealth.
Been a long while since I heard of this, why couldn't people sell?
They made it so that you'd have to buy a coin that was more expensive than Squid if order to be able to sell it, and it said it in the whitepaper which no one bothers to read of course
A lot of that was Covid relief funds - imbeciles will lose their money one way or another. 

This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things like Universal Basic Income.
I will never not laugh at people who fomo into scams
I remember hearing about it and thought to myself, there‚Äôs no way people don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs a scam. Oh was I surprised
You needed "pearls' to be able to sell, and the only way to get them was to mine them by depositing regular crypto. The pearls did actually get mined but they kept increasing the ratio of pearls:squid you'd need to sell in the smart contract so you'd never have enough pearls to sell a decent quantity of SQUID so to catch up and beat the next increase you'd need to end up putting more crypto in to speed up up the mining. The moment they rug-pulled they also emptied everything that was deposited to mine pearls.
[Sayonara, motherfucker](https://youtu.be/CpR2kMxy7O8?si=IuImbONTo1--dN0L)
I was ruined as well
Red light!! üî¥
Kind of gutting really. Rug pulls like these are what scare people away from crypto.
did any regular people get to cash out or was that the one where only insider could sell
3 years?! Time goes by too quick..
But one question remains, can is still buy into it?
dude that was nothing, kadena went from 4 bils to 100 mil and is still scamming new idiots
Like safemoon.
Not the first rug and definitely not the last.
And then season 2 of the show was financed. Shocker‚Ä¶
Who could have possibly seen this coming? /s
Imagine how stupid people must be to "invest in crypto projects".
I will never be sad about people losing their money because they had to chase something because they saw it on Netflix. Fuck Netflix.
No. The biggest crypto scams are still ongoing.
How is that a scam ? It's litteraly the same thing in the TV show, only 1 guy get all the money.

Ok, there's some rugpull, but this one was made on purpose, it was the rule of the game since the beginning.
Squid Game 2 out end of this year!
Who remembers the_dent getting rekt does someone have the clip?
Nice to learn something!
Season 2 is coming out soon, be prepared üíÄ
Crazy how time flies! The SQUID rug pull was a harsh wake-up call for many in the crypto world. Just a reminder, if a project limits selling or sounds sketchy, it‚Äôs probably not worth the risk. Stay sharp!
Why have I never heard of this üò≠üò≠
Are rug pull perpetrators ever caught in the crypto field? Or are they getting away with all that money?
To be fair, why would anyone invest in squid token? It's like pouring all your money into Shitcoin cause lulz.
I actually made a few k after the pull
Ahahahah crypto is the future of finance üòÇ

Ah memories
I invested around $20 didn't get anything, I was but about invest 100 more bucks but scam happened , I still remember more than 30k members were in TG channel
there were so many obvious signs about that pull
Imagine finally being a millionaire thanks to a shitcoin but then you get rugged
Ya there‚Äôs a lot of financial scams crypto just gets the spotlight for some reason
This is one of the challenges is Squid Games season 2. Everyone must buy and only the top 50% of money earners survive.
I'm so glad crypto has evolved and nothing like that will ever happen again. üòê
Lmao
Wait there was a SQUID and people bought it üòÖ
Who tf bought this shit at $2800 üòÇ

Never saw it before and all I got was lmfao lol
Oooof haha.
So what's hot now?
If I‚Äôm not mistaken I‚Äôm pretty sure the creator said it was a scam from the start.
What happened there can someone tell me please
Just watched the video in the comments and can someone explain to me how it possible went to zero in like a second? Would that mean literally everyone sold at the same time
It was pretty hilarious and based lol
Things are only worth what people will actually pay for them
Ok, now type in google: "How to set up a 'rug pull' scam"
That video should be an NFT, on whatever blockchain squid was launched on.
as i recall, they also changed the website after the scam to have a single message rubbing it everyone's face that they got scammed lol
Didn‚Äôt know about this wild af
This was an early warning sign. Many more lethal scams would follow this one. Oh the ease of hindsight ü´•
![gif](giphy|7SUdMJQ7PovEiK4tts)
Fastest rug pull i ever saw burned into my memory lol
Guess same as what happened to AXIES SLP lol
Personally I‚Äôm still waiting for milfcoin to take off
And still not caught by authority?
Season 2 is going to be awesome
Lost a good hundred on that shit üòÇ still can't believe I fell for it
"hooooold, it's just market correction. Trust me bruv I'm a 18 year old with 2 years of experience and run a scam group on telegram to benefit myself".
I had a friend who lost a fortune to this
Are we stockpiling for season 2?
Bros is this a bottom signal? Is it time to go deep on squid game coin
There was a very interesting documentary series done by a journalist who came very close to tracking down who did this scam.
Î¨¥Í∂ÅÌôî ÍΩÉÏù¥ ÌîºÏóàÏäµÎãàÎã§!!!
It had a supposed cap of more than BTC at its top .. stupid pump and dump.. lots of Dumb F**k tokens out there‚Ä¶ the literally is one called ‚ÄúSMOKINGCHICKENFISH‚Äù or SCF.. WTF is that
It was insane to look at.
I mean this was kind of an obvious thing that was going to happen, for a while I couldn‚Äôt believe no one had made a Squid Game token to rug people with - I was tempted to do it because it was so obvious but ya know I have a conscience
Safemoon! I turned $1000 into $17,000. The rug pulled that into $37 :(
Feels like yesterday when the discords and telegrams screamed out in unison ‚Äú I can‚Äôt sell SQUID!‚Äù

Nothing like a rug pull.

Sad part is, they even said it in their white paper no one read.

‚ÄúOnly one winner.‚Äù
Ltc ü¶ç
There is a longer clip of the live rugpull here

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFRhm4CZpR0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFRhm4CZpR0)

Some guy bought $50k worth literally seconds before it got rugged. Possibly the shittest move of all time.
Fuk i wish
I mean it was fairly obviously, it‚Äôs hard to feel bad for folks when they buy a token that you literally can‚Äôt sell
[removed]

Are there any for this season? Any squid game tokens on SOL?
The Trump family are taking notes
For those who want to bring back memories or didnt saw it. Here the video: [https://clips.twitch.tv/InspiringFreezingDelicataTooSpicy-8mqk44jw\_4zZ5mJJ](https://clips.twitch.tv/InspiringFreezingDelicataTooSpicy-8mqk44jw_4zZ5mJJ)

Epic!
"Oh! It went to zero!....Yoooooooowwww....Daaaaaamn" üòÇ hilarious
How could such a safe investment go wrong?
[removed]
He had a redeem that he would TA any shitcoin you wanted him to look at, it was coincidence on his end that he was looking at it when it went to 0. He didn't have any money on it.

I suspect the person who redeemed it might have had something to do with it.
Where is the link üòÇü§£
He didn't get rekt, was just watching the chart for fun on stream
Core crypto memory.
I remember it ü§£
It would be more memorable if someone DIDN'T get fucked by it lmao
It's almost like it was programmed
From what I remember it was all detailed out in the white paper, tokens would be locked without you being able to sell but people don‚Äôt read and simply just buy whatever is pumping
Lore accurate
No one could sell so only the creator got rich
It was a canon event
The real Squid Game were all the rugs we made along the way.
Feels like just yesterday everyone was ranting and raving about binge watching the series. The rug pull was crazy live thoughüòÇ what the hell were people thinking
it's incredible when you didn't  fall for the scam, devastating if you did lmao
Squid game season 2 is coming out in a few months, maybe we will get SQUID 2.0 the second rugging
How is it considered a rug pull if you can only buy but not sell until they allow it. Wtf did people expect?
I can't believe 3 years passed since 2021 and we didn't hit 100k /s
Here the video:¬†[https://clips.twitch.tv/InspiringFreezingDelicataTooSpicy-8mqk44jw\_4zZ5mJJ](https://clips.twitch.tv/InspiringFreezingDelicataTooSpicy-8mqk44jw_4zZ5mJJ)

Enjoy!
I bought Luna at $60. My ancestors are ashamed of me.
Ponzi scheme is a different type of scam still and plenty go rich compared to squid where you could buy but couldnt sell. (I think you could through a convoluted way but was made thay you would end up paying more then its worth)so only makers got rich.
We will never forget. Unstable Kwon and Bitconnect is forever etched into crypto lore and history

*‚ÄòSteady lads, Deploying more Capital‚Äô*

*‚ÄôHey heey heeyyyy‚Ä¶‚Äô*
I don't think Squid even breaks top 20 crypto scams. It just got a lot of mainstream attention due to its name.
Bitconect.
¬£1k learning experience for me.
Sounded so good at the time aswell.
Don't remind
Wattamigonnado?!
Hahahhah still remember that bald asian dude and maaaaaany memes hahahhaha.
Yeah I remember it getting locked up. Red flag or nah?
"Not a loss until you sell" is coping. So many people still hold their useless coins thinking they're going to get their money back :¬¥(
Did someone say safemoon army?
They were pretty upfront with that too. I heard about it and one of the first things people were saying was that you can buy in but can‚Äôt sell. And yet people still bought
The mfs weren't that slick people were just dumb af lol.
I remember posting at the time - the website and the terms were very clear that you couldn't sell. So they delivered exactly what they promised.
When FOMO kicks in, most of us see only the reward, not accounting the risk.
atleast now we have more active crypto detectives all throughout social media bringing justice
They were thinking about getting rich. Nothing more nothing less and it got them rugged good and proper
Now we got trump coins lmao
Everyday you have hundreds of new scam tokens named after the most recent trending topics. From PEPE 2.0 to MAGA2024... there's everything you can imagine and people just have to be more careful.
All verified solidity contracts are public to see.  Be wary of proxy contracts.
You didn't even have to look at the code, and it wasn't a scam.  They were very up front about how you can't sell until holders vote to enable selling.
While all those years someone made a big money and living a luxurious life.
Yes, everyone knew.  Not really a scam if the entire point of the token was that you couldn't sell it, and that's why people bought...
Common sense is not that common.
I mean, if people got money to throw at something stupid they could have just thrown it at me. At least I'd say thanks.
Dude, this is r/CryptoCurrency
Agreed. Too many morons in crypto looking for that get rich quick with as little effort as possible route.
Not that I don‚Äôt think squid was crap but people said the same thing to the early investors in bitcoin.
Yes, because even if you fulfilled the sell conditions that were put on the coin it still didn‚Äôt allow you to sell. It was in fact a popular scam technique at the time that was used where only the creator of the token was able to pull out liquidity slowly but surely.
I assume they just thought they would sell the moment before the rug was pulled. Their intuition would tell them when, no doubt.
It happens every second on Solana
Me when it turned out Flappycoin wasn't the next big thing
Wht happnd with solona ?
> It was a scam / theft.

Is it a scam if the literal point of the token was that you can't sell?  This wasn't some secret.  The token was created this way and it was openly publicized that this is how it worked.
Honey Pot. I fell in one when NF Prompt was in Binance launch pool. I decided to buy on a DEX and sell the minute Binance lists it.

Long story short, there were 5 tokens named NFP listed on DEXs.  I could buy each one. None of them was sellable.

Honey Pot. Once you fall, there's not climbing back up.
God damn

![gif](giphy|ERIB4ws3cw17uWN4mF)
How are you holding up
How much did you lose?
Nobody but the creator made money.  The entire point of the token was that you can't sell it.
Out of that 30k at least half were probably bots. But a valuable lesson learned by some.
Assuming one of us nobody‚Äôs were able to sell that moment and not just the whales getting richer.

I didn't saw it so thank you
See*
Yeeaahhhhoooooooooooooo
Sayonara nother*ckers !!
The market gave them just long enough to say 2.8Trillion MC and then zero.  epic.
That video looks like he's observing, not getting rug pulled himself.
Legendary moment in crypto history.
I remember the video, but not the 2+ TRILLION market cap.. did someone or someones really rugpull 2 TRILLION dollars in crypto?
And also on a 15 min candle lol
Believe it or not but I never saw that before! That was an epic meltdown right before our eyes!! I watched it about 20 consecutive times .... Thanks for sharing üëäüèª
Holy shit I‚Äôd never seen that before and seriously cannot stop laughing, something between that background music his face tats and le epic reaction I‚Äôm actually dying I cannot breathe

Well, being able to distance yourself from the FOMO and simply observe puts a man into amother level. Congrats.
And I wouldn't be surprised if people fall for another scam squid game token once more lmao
By December bro, trust me bro.
Shorted luna x10. Made s9me gains then shorted SOL at 9 x10 and then lost it all
I bet some of your ancestors bought railway company stock or something like that and lost their money. Or they were buying real estate on the moon in the 60s

it was "stacked" or something. guy even admits in on that live stream. 2.1 TRILLION dollars market cap!
*Cries in Algo*
Its easy to be smarter than someone who's dumber than you
when greed takes over, it's over.
Expect to see these stories on the daily once again when the next bull run comes along in 2025
Fomo is one hell of a drug.

Yeah KJU and his lackeys
Common sense is a super power in politics.
Let's just start calling it sense
They still do
I was in a token that went from 50 bucks to 1800 dollars. I sold half at 1600.  Everyone else was hodl. I was selling, and this can not be sustained. It started going down. I think I sold another half at 1200, then 900, 600, and 300.  I ended up with some left when it hit .003.  I told my people how I sell.  I didn't get wrecked, I know a bunch of people that did.
Might be taking over by BASE with its meme tokens...

I do understand people fomo but still a shame
I did not know I could not sell or swap it at the time. I was promised to get huge return by a person in twitter. 

I‚Äôd presume that defines as a scam. Although yep I should‚Äôve knew better back then but it was $50 lol
Hope you stay safe now üíù
Worst scam ever. Dream shattering one.  When u see ur 2009% gain worth noting very next hour
$400

Hmm...

You know, I'm something of a candle enjoyer myself
TA is useless against PUMPO AND DUMPO
In fairness, anyone that talks about crypto acts like an analyst
Your classic crypto investor.
The most legendary crypto clip of the year. How could we ever forget that ?

Yes, the Crypto Wild West. People must be careful with everything nowadays. Now with AI, more careful. Future looks quite dangerous.

Right up there with the "guh" guy from WSB.
I used to watch him from time to time, think he said he was fresh out of prison when I was watching.
Good question. Two billion was the market cap, but that does not equal two billion in actual money invested. Actual money is always far, far less. Probably a few million in this case.
SafeMoon‚Äôs ATH of 3 billion in the 2021 bull market would mean it is on par with Polygon‚Äôs market cap today.. absolutely incredible for the scam it was

Almost as if the SQUID whitepaper itself didn‚Äôt expressly say that it was meant to be a rug pull !!
I'm pretty sure there are a couple that bought Luna at $100 and rode it all the way down to $0.000001
Omg please no more reminders of that trauma.
I bought luna at $4 and rode to the top and back without taking profits. 2021 was my first cycle...i've learnt a lot since then!
Exactly. Makes you even more cautious.
Shocking!
This is something Forrest Gump would say
That dude is a god send
> I‚Äôd presume that defines as a scam.

A scam is when someone intentionally lies to you in order to profit / steal money from you.  Right now it's just some person on twitter who maybe lied to you and maybe thought they were telling the truth but didn't know what they were talking about.  It likely was not the person who created and profited off the token - as the whitepaper was fairly open about how the token worked, and it doesn't make sense they would tell the truth to everyone only to lie to you.

More likely you just believed some random idiot on twitter and lost money due to not researching what you were buying.
Let us all be that way.
Damn. And nobody was able to sell? Or could you have sold?
Hks name is the dent.. i cant
I think you‚Äôd be surprised. I‚Äôve spent some time around finance bros and I‚Äôm not convinced Wall Street has any real idea of what it‚Äôs doing. Remember 2008? It‚Äôs really easy to make the math and numbers sound complicated.
I'm more of a dildo guy myself
TA is helpless in the face of the inevitable PUMPA and DUMPA !!
TA is always useless.
Pumpo and Dumpo sounds like an animated duo for crypto satire jokes
Deep Fakes gettinf real is even scarier
Also, with Former President Trump promoting his own coin. The future is truly bleak.
Something I‚Äôve always wondered, did any ordinary investor actually manage to make money off scams like Squid or BitConnect back in the day ?
No pattern day trading to start with, easy as hell to see support and resistance on it, trends nicely, tradable asset that's open 24/7, fractional ownership that you don't have to wait for market open to realize, trade bots a plenty, arbitrage, dozens of ways to farm income from it, compared to traditional finance funds settle practically instantly and can be transferred and stored off market. 

Honestly it's probably one of the best and easiest assets out there, you moon bois just have zero clue what you're doing.

Edit: oh also forgot options are available for it now too along  with
Yeah, drunk driving accident.  Did almost a decade behind bars in Illinois.   Seems like a good dude, does a lot of self help stuff.  He did recently come back from hiatus where he admitted to going broke due to gambling slots after having been pretty financially secure.  Was hoping to see him on more but he hasn't been around much.
SuperSafeMoon
Thanks but maan I'm too old to watch these people yelling into their microphone like they're apes or something lol
I bout it at 19c and sold it when it went back to 20c. My diamond hands were on vacation that day
Not a cent. 
Cashout/transfer options never worked
I feel they must hav looted millions. And no one was able to do anything. 
Its even harder back those days to distinguish among fake shit coins and genuine alt coins
Red or green?
True that! üëç
If that is true, then why are many people profitable using TA alone?
To a clown ü§°, yes.
It was impossible to make money from squid. The contract didn't allow sales of the token. Anyone who bought it was stuck with it. That's why the price only went up.
Reckless drunk driver, gambler and thief. 

Seems like a good dude - op
You have to be such a regarded degen to gamble on slots. The odds are literally posted and you can‚Äôt affect them with any ‚Äúskill‚Äù like a card game or really even a random choice. Literally just choosing to lose money. No sympathy.

Name one person who isn‚Äôt profitable since 2012
Same reason why some people win at casinos.
They‚Äôre not. Plenty of studies have proven the overwhelming majority of traders lose money in the long term.
ah so people that bought it and watched it were *extra* stupid
Was it‚Äôs possible to know you couldn‚Äôt sell it before you bought it?
You can paint it how u want but I didn't say he was a thief.  Gambling doesn't make someone a bad person... I mean you are in a poker sub so idk what your problem is there.  Drunk driving offense was over a decade ago.
It's possible to be a good person and get wrecked by your vices. Bros got demons like the rest of us. He fucked up by driving drunk and paid the price. He just fell into another pitfall. Doesn't make him a bad person.
Sounds like he might have some impulse control issues.
Yeeeeeeeow!
What are you even trying to say?
There is a difference between being profitable and winning at the casino. But you know what I meant, you are just arguing in bad faith. So kindly fuck off.
But the 10% out there that do make money, are typically very successful, usually around 60%+ win rates on their strategies.
Jesus it feels like im talking to people here who don‚Äôt even trade.
Yes, but people don't look at contracts. They are degens. 

A reasonable person would see a $2 trillion market cap and realize something is up!
Ok but does it make him good?

And being a crypto twitch steamer doesn't exactly help lol
A frog was profitable trading crypto currency. A frog. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you hold, use TA, etc etc
10% is generous.  Show me where you‚Äôre seeing 10% of traders are profitable over long periods of time.  Some might get lucky in the short term, but very few are profitable in the long term.
So, you just made up that 10% figure then?

Or post screen shots that prove you‚Äôve been profitable over at least the last 10-15 years.

But you‚Äôre right, I don‚Äôt trade.  I buy and hold BTC and broad market funds. 

If you‚Äôre so profitable, why aren‚Äôt you running a hedge fund by now?  You should be one of the richest people on Earth.  But I‚Äôm willing to guess you‚Äôre not. Or you trade with $10 and are up a few bucks from last week.  Just give it more time‚Ä¶you‚Äôll eventually lose.
Sorry if this is a stupid question but if people were unable to sell, how did someone sell (rug pull)?
I am not talking about random lucky trades... I am talking about being constantly profitable for years. I agree that there is some data in papers on the topic that suggests that your strategy doesn't matter in the long run, i.e. if you're scalping, swing trading, using TA or any other strategy and excluding people that lose money, the profitable traders make roughly the same profit. It's tricky to evaluate statistically, because there is such a small general fraction of people that make money trading, which is why your initial statement confused me. Over 90% of traders still lose, rather than being constantly profitable.
Lol yes traders can‚Äôt be profitable just like no one can beat the market. That‚Äôs what they tell the plebs to keep them from trying.
The contract limited sales to whitelisted addresses. The people behind squid were not limited like everyone else. If I remember correctly, they also had 100% of the liquidity pool so they could just pull everything out.
Intern Lost us a Client
I work at a mid-tier firm and we had some interns that started a few weeks ago. Since we‚Äôre encouraged to utilize the interns I picked up one of them to help out with cash on one of my audits. I figured it would be a good learning experience for him. He told me he had only been working on EBPs until now, and this was his first audit.  After walking him through an example, he said he seemed confident that he can complete the workpaper. Also told me he had just finished his audit 101 class, and was top of his class. I just smiled and said great, and turned around rolling my eyes as I walked back to my desk.

A few hours later after getting no questions, I go to check in on him and he frantically told me that he found fraud, because one of the bank recs wasn‚Äôt tying to the bank statement. Typical intern, always thinking everything is fraud. I took and look, and of course, he was comparing the bank statement to the wrong bank rec (literally the same one he had started working on hours ago when I walked away). I‚Äôve worked with some bad interns before, but this one probably had to have been the dumbest. pointed out that he was looking at the wrong bank statement and he responded by telling me he‚Äôs fresh off his audit 101 class; then mumbles under his breath that I‚Äôm rusty and don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about. Asked him what did you say? And he didn‚Äôt say anything like the little weasel he is. I‚Äôm a 5th year senior and been on this client since I was an A1. And this kid is telling me I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about? Lol

The next morning I get a message from the lead Partner telling me and the manager to come to his office immediately. Turns out, this little dumbass intern directly emailed the clients CFO, CEO, and Controller and accused them of fraud. HE THEN CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED FRAUD. Needless to say, we lost the client and the interns getting fired.
I always miss the origin post that the shitposts make fun of. Can someone please link the original post?
Not me getting my popcorn and rereading this post thinking we had some reddit Accounting drama. Only to be let down that this is a "shitpost," which I'm assuming means made up. Not gonna lie, if they keep it going, I'm reading every post. It's like the best type of office drama, the kind that can never involve you.
10/10 shitpost
Can‚Äôt wait to hear from the partner and the client‚Äôs CFO in a few hours
We had a new staff report fraud after an inventory count
You had me there‚Ä¶until you said 5th year senior lol
To anyone wondering , here's the original shitpost (1) in the first place

https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/s/N5XrwLmfip
Posts like these help me get through the day
The post are leaking.

I don't think you understand the concept of "intern". An intern is an inexperienced person who requires guidance and _supervision_.  So who was their supervisor,  and why were they not doing their job?
lol I want this to be real so badly
If anyone is interested, there‚Äôs another version over on the consulting sub!
Where was this kid in 2008 prior to SOX? üòÇ
**I find this story hard to believe, no intern would call the cops. Show us the email or it's fake /s**
This was so good that I actually believed it until I read comments, I swear I‚Äôm not like this intern üòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠
I get that this is a shitpost, but I feel obliged to gripe that 

1) I've told our auditors, to the point of turning blue in the face, that the difference between our trial balance and the bank / brokerage statements is entirely due to unsettled trades - we book at trade date, whereas the statement totals reflect settlement date

2) They still included a bunch of adjusting entries to "fix" this.
the client: enron
There's gotta be a term for chad interns like this. Like, anti-partner? Dark partner? 

He's not good at sales. In fact he's the opposite!
ü§£
LMFAO this is hilarious
Why would you waste your time writing this out
It literally shows the level of training at your firm.
Are there any reddits left that are actually for accountants or is it all shitpost bullshit now?
5th year Senior? I have a feeling you‚Äôre the problem.
Great shitpost
Lol wow
How dumb and brave intern‚Ä¶
god i love it here
 now waiting for the intern to post after getting fired
**FIRED**
I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that. That being said‚Ä¶ fucking hilarious
Holy shit.
Is this real ?
I laughed, thanks
Lol always love the "what did you say" or "what was that "

You're the weasel. You used that instead of responding to what he said. You clearly heard it, then acted dumb on purpose to avoid the conflict.
‚Äú5th year senior‚Äù - Does this mean you‚Äôve been a senior for 5 years?
I honestly hate these so much.  Apparently I'm in the minority.  Real life is actually interesting enough.  

I certainly don't mind that folks enjoy this stuff, but I would love to filter it out or have a separate sub for fantasy story time.
What‚Äôs the point of this ‚Äúshitpost‚Äù? The only way this is funny is if it is true, which it is not, so now it‚Äôs just a wildly made up story..
"Turned around rolling my eyes" üíÄü§£
This 100% cannot be true. Why would your intern who is helping you on your first day have the email to the CEO, CFO, etc. I‚Äôm sure he also wouldn‚Äôt call the police without talking to someone at your firm. This is a bizarre story.
‚ÄúUs‚Äù it‚Äôs not you or your parents company. Jesus.
Damn. Must be some leftist ideologue. I'd find it challenging resisting the urge to beat him.
jeez, RIP to revenue of that portion.
i don‚Äôt believe it lol
lol good one. Had me there for a while
I'm not even an accountant and I figured out my discrepancies were probably a mistake on my part... So I look more... I'm also pretty damn good at identifying when customers are trying to scam  or, when they are just crazy and I need to give them something to make them go away. The company I work for didn't have a system to track how many times an order was replaced or, if an order had been created in the first place and word got out so, I had fun cleaning that up. I still get people trying to scam me for free stuff. They back down pretty quick when I ask for any information that will help me find their existing order.
Reminded me of a case when I was studying towards CGA (It was before the merger). It was a study case of an audit (not actual audit)

Our group was working for a study case. The information that the case says indicates income management (referring to manipulating he time hen to recognize income). 

I reminded the study group that even though it may indicate so from the information that the client sent us =, the study case explicitly states that it was during the period when the client approached us for an audit and that **the engagement letter has not been signed yet**. That is, the audit has not officially started. Thus it is not appropriate to assume anything at this point.
Are you for real?
It got deleted :( some kid who wasn‚Äôt even finished school yet was CONVINCED that because the bank statements didn‚Äôt match bank recs it HAD to be fraud. Was not going to entertain the possibility of it being anything else. He thought he was gonna be a hero, and then was convinced that everyone was corrupt because no one took him (the intern) seriously. The original post may have been a shitpost too, but the OP was doggin all over the comments trying to defend his position

I thought you lot were meant to have 'professional scepticism' lol

The post said he emailed the CEO and CFO directly accusing them of fraud, and asked if he had the powers to perform an arrest on them because the police wouldn't help. On what planet was that not an obvious shitpost
Wanted powers of arrest too.
I was there for the OG post and it reeeeeked of shitposting. Like it was every single stereotypical ‚Äú1st year found fraud‚Äù shitpost thrown into one but apparently written convincingly enough that some people thought it was legit. It def wasn‚Äôt.
I saw that one but it read so much like a shitpost that I assumed it was. Did he really sound serious in the comments?
[deleted]
Excellent, thank you
I saw the post last night, that's why I grabbed my popcorn.  I thought this was coincidentally posted and OP just hadn't seen the original  post. That's why I had to reread after noticing  too many similarities...lol
Wait, that was real? I was sure that was also a shitpost.
The OG post was def not real. It reeeked of ‚Äú1st year found fraud I‚Äôm bringing the while house down hur dur‚Äù shitposting.
That was absolutely not real.  You need to re-calibrate your professional skepticism.
That‚Äôs why I said 10/10 shitpost‚Ä¶
Or real vendors who pay you a cut under the table.
Any real accountant will tell you if the bank recs DO tie out then you know there‚Äôs a problem haha. Someone‚Äôs covered their tracks a little too well.
I‚Äôve actually seen it happen with photoshopped bank recs to change balances and edit out transactions.
Are you telling me the company doing the fraud isn't paying me to find the fraud???
Hey if you‚Äôve been to school for accounting it‚Äôs not a stretch to picture that type of student haha, the reason I thought it was a shitpost is cause he said Audit101 or something, implying it was the very entry level audit course, which kinda plays into the joke of the original post more, idk
On what planet do your coworkers enjoy being around you? Cause it‚Äôs probably not earth‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt sweat it friend. Plenty of people got deceived üòã
Well, I see this type of fraud as often as the others.
I've seen a lack of proper controls (segregation of duties) allow a single employee inflating invoices to the vendor who gave them a cut.  The fraud was in the millions, and it was at a household name you would all recognize.  It was at a competitor and when it made the news, corporate was crawling all over me to make sure we didn't have the same gap.

Finding a fraud friend outside the company is way easier than inside the company.
You could also make it your own company. 

Create a contracting firm. Hire them exclusively. Send the work to subcontractors for half the price. Pocket the extra.
[deleted]
A friend of mine once observed an executive new hire negotiate company-covered coaching into their offer. For a number of reasons everyone agreed this was a good, if expensive, thing.

The entire 12+ month fee was eaten in 8 weeks, but the important thing is, the game was so obvious in retrospect that everyone involved was too embarrassed to make a big thing out of it.

Or so I‚Äôve heard.
Had a company set up a dummy company and invoice dummy company (vacant lot ‚Äòship to‚Äô)and assign fake invoices to bank. Provide pdf of inventory perpetual to bank and inflated invty 1.2 million even dollars. Prior bank auditor and CPA missed this when it was around$900k difference. Company said oh it was the hand wireless scanner didn‚Äôt work in the back of the building. There was several other bullshit fucking around with stuff too. Luckily some dumb ass contractor field examiner for another bank missed all of the items and paid out the loan so my bank got out of a shit deal. Can‚Äôt remember if the FS was audited or review level.
Only if your internal controls suck. This kind of fraud happens when there is no SOD, no monitoring, no procurement process controls, etc. Periodic performance analysis, spending analysis, and price analysis can help you find it.
Plus, the side receiving the payments would be "under the table" i.e. outside the company
Nope. Those are all good controls but they would not have caught this.  It was a fluke combined with someone having a good eye and questioning it.
Btc to 40K!
When btc hit 40k I remembered how nuts this place was. I also remember the sudden increase from 35k to 45k as we embraced the false prophet (EM). 

Since 2021, I have learned a lot. Now having  gone through a bull and brutal bear, i feel time has allowed me to muture. I  regret being afraid to buy the dip because it may go lower. What i come to learn is DCA and sometimes you just need to buy at a good enough price (rainbow bands).

My second regret was greed  and putting some of my assets in  Celsius; however,  I have been slowly accumulating  more. I‚Äôm hoping this cycle ill have made enough to  make up for my past mistakes plus some. I‚Äôve learned and positioned myself better for this next year and upcoming cycles. Onwards to 14Q 2021 btc to 100K!

Edit: stay strong bothers, WAGMI
Pfft, it‚Äôs already $60k here in Australia, catch up.
Somebody out there is ready to deploy the next Celsius, the next ftx , the next scam wallet. The scammers are getting very exited too. They can feel the beginning of euphoria.
Plus there's literally no mainstream media coverage. This run hasn't even started yet
Boy I‚Äôm glad I put money across stocks and crypto. 

Pretty happy that it has gone up so much this year! Can‚Äôt wait for the cat vibing to levan polkka memes to start again!
Ssst! We in europe are waiting for the ‚Ç¨40k! üöÄ

I got greedy as well putting my stuff at Celsius; about 10 BTC, will be happy if i get 2 back.  like many, we will never get what we use to have, as everyone needs to learn it the hard way; people just wont listen and simply DCA nonstop like Michael Saylor, dabble in shitcoins, etc, and will always mess up one way or another.  It's part of the journey

I joined into the crypto craze around 2020. Back then I was a sweet summer child and I heard many tall tales from fellow hopefuls about life changing gains. But the OGs would come along and caution about devastating losses that would break many a noob when the bears are unleashed.

Now that we've have gone through that cold, frigid winter and survived the hungry bears on the prowl that devastated many a wallet, while being a handful of those who have survived, I feel like we're now starting this all over again. This time I guess it's our turn, those are still standing - the grizzled vets who are unphased by market movements and learned the way of the HODL, to caution all the newcomers of the dangers that lie beyond the euphoria. But it is nice to see the sun once again.
I remember what a fellow redditor said here: if you feel the need to brag to your friends about your portfolio, it's time to start selling.
I really dont think the bear market was that brutal compared to 2018
Coinbase gave me $15 in free crypto! I don‚Äôt even use crypto anymore but I‚Äôll take the free cash!
Muture lol
I've learned a lot, namely that you can't possibly know if you're in a BTC bull or bear cycle.
Buy the top, make random mistakes and cringe when you think you bought the bottom. Once you‚Äôve accomplished all 3 you are immune to everything accept constant dca in the beginning of a bull market.
Anyone else think it weird that this always happens during buying season?
I‚Äôll be ready to buy when it hits $60k
Still feels like a suckers rally, but maybe I‚Äôm the sucker ü§î
Lmao this sub is euphoric again. Time to sell
At 100.000 people probably wake up.
CNBC is talking about the imminent bull run. Might be time to sell...
Fuck alex
I think this is the year I get to just get a random online job and can ditch the stress. I can feel it.
Knew it was getting there but my greedy mind is upset I didn't get to finish buying all the amount I wanted ü•∂
The 1 BTC and 8 ETH I lost on a platform going bankrupt are really starting to sting now.  Glad I still have another 1/10 of each or I would be swinging from a tree.
\*42k now
If you DCA weekly since the top at 65k you would be up 45%. It is the only way
Amazing. ETF and halving coming too. This setup couldn‚Äôt be more perfect
The last time Bitcoin at 40k ETH was $2700. Not ultrasound money.
Will there be a retracemnent?
Finally, my BTC is in profit!
Don't retire in a bear cycle !
Shit, 40k is pussy number. Ain't selling shit till it's 1 mil.

It's the 3rd millennia and there is only crypto.
31k is still rational, also don't get too crazy over a weekend pump you can almost time them when they happen on weekends especially with low volume.
Celsius wasn't your fault tbh. Just a shady company.  I got lucky, I had the most money I ever had in my life after covid and had all of it in Celsius. $40k. I got lucky and pulled it out for unrelated reasons before it would've gotten locked up
Micro strategy and others buying up a billion worth of coins, seems like a pump and dump. Don‚Äôt hold the bag!
wagmi is the most moronic thing people say specially those like OP treating Bitcoin like a speculative asset and pricing it in fiat.     
This type of activity is selling to the greater fool, most people are going to lose .      
The price is not going to magically stay up while people cash out.
Y'all are a bunch of fucking loons. This is all straight up cult talk
Even VET made it to coinbase! Not sure when but it's there and that was news to me!
It is now year 2100 and my kid is 77 years old. She has 1BTC that her father passed onto her and always said: ‚ÄúMy child, Never sell your BTC to whales.‚Äù
I‚Äôd read this again
is the bottom in though, I still dont think this is over
if you didn't buy in around 35K, you're already behind
Not your keys = not your coin!  
HODL, $100K nexxt year
Gonna burst past 70K this time!
Meh, when ATH?
how are we sure that BTC will rise during the bull like its hey days after all the negative news and legal actions against some crypto firms these past few years?
I think BTC will surely hit 40k . Market is recovering speedly
Some days ago i took profits from SUPER at 0.22$ and i just found its 0.63 today. I COULD HOOOOLD IT!!
Wow! So much idiocy in one post.
I'm glad I recently started getting crypto exposure with some tax-free money by buying ETHE, COIN, and GBTC with a ROTH IRA. I only started this a few months ago, and it's already up around 80%. If only I'd been doing this the whole time...

What's really interesting is the hype level. Pretty low. This cycle will be wild
What is EM?
BTC is enjoying the holdiday season, tbh.. everybody deserves a break
Hold your horses, you ain't seen nothin yet.

What‚Äôs the best way to protect your crypto from an exchange?
Now waiting for 40k in euro
Wen 100k?
Hmm Celsius, not too bad (depending on value of assets at that time).

My first encounter with crypto brought my greed ahead to MM Finance.

I mean, Mad fucking Meerkat, can‚Äòt believe I actually went for it, seen retrospectively.

BUT I still do consider all things learned through that occurrence tremendously valuable. Part of the game, I suppose.
Soon guys. Soon‚Ä¶
BTC pulling its weight again!
Wen Lambo?
I also bought a crypto currency in celcius! I haven‚Äôt find a way to get back my money tho‚Ä¶
I bought in right as the prices slumped in 2021 so I‚Äôm pleased with the profits I‚Äôm seeing even though I‚Äôm hodling for at least another year

Hate to be the bear of bad news but we‚Äôre still in a bear market. BTC to $45k and crash. You can‚Äôt just press a button and print money and expect to flip to bullish. Money printer going brrrrr right now

$40k after tax... Works out quite well looking at US price and that is approx what you will be left with in aud after tax.
Rookie numbers. In the Philippines we're way past 2 million.
Pfft, it's st 780 000, in my country, you guys are living in the past
Pfft, it's already $0 here in this future world 2050, catch up.
Sell it all, it's at 20k here in Chatham Islands
>$60k here in Australia

so what you're saying is AUD is hot garbage? sorry
There are lots of degens in Australia as you guys are active here, lol. Don‚Äôt mean anything bad with that tho üòÇ
Wo wo oop
They won‚Äôt get me this time ‚Ä¶.
It is our duty to protect the noobs coming in the space
scammers gonna scam
Be wary, we‚Äôve learned a lot these last few years.
The next set of services will likely be regulated and way safer than these previous monstrosities. But there will always be scams and greedy idiots running companies.
>Somebody out there is ready to deploy the next Celsius, the next ftx , the next scam wallet.

It might be called Blast.
The scammers were the cause of and solution to your pumping problems.  When you have Sam coin upon Sam coin, the price was skyrocketing, but they were built on a glass foundation, and when it broke it all came down.
And same Luna, Luna classic , Luna usd, Lunatics is pumping in prison man do kwon
Every fucking time. I think even during slumps scammers are always looking out. Look at the "services" to help retrieve scammed accounts. Victimizing victims.
What I ever. What will happen is ever time BTC/crypto starts to gain momentum the government release a sound bit to crash it back down.
Lol
There's always a new NEO, or LINK, a new SOLANA, POLY, etc. The more people that think they understand it the better it does. 

&#x200B;

We shall see..
Can confirm. I took an Uber yesterday and he wasn‚Äôt talking about crypto. We‚Äôre still early
Man if BTC ever hits 100K, shit's going to be insane.
National evening news in Australia talked about BTC - I was in another room but came in to my girlfriend telling me BTC is on a surge.
omg i was feeling like wathcing this meme earlier today
Word...... Then we will start selling O.O
¬£40k soon too
Canada already blew past 50k ;)
Here in Brazil it's already over 200k BRL
I doubled my stack at $16k! Lol
I remember it crashing to $160 (from 1200). That felt like the end of days.
Get used to it, if you are not down at least 90% in your first crypto bear market, you are doing extremely well and should be happy about it. My stuff went down 98.8% and I was totally fine with that haha, and bought the hell out of the bottom and now I'm actually in profit.
Same. I managed to hit the buy button and put the remaining of my cash in. But God, was I sweating it.
Line go up so it means that all valid criticism against my cult is invalid
everybody acting tough when they up lol

you werent saying this last year
I was waiting for 12k to load up :(. Got a good stack either way at least.
Glad you pulled the trigger!
What country are you in, where you had +100% inflation?
üíØ


Effectively, all crypto beyond BTC is a shitcoin 


Don‚Äôt get me wrong - many have value and a place in the market and perhaps all of future society


But, also, every single one of them will always be tied to the first, historic source of truth that the Bitcoin ledger is


Its first block timestamp and the words ‚ÄúThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks‚Äù, can never be erased from history


The Bitcoin ledger is literally the global fiscal Bible of where our civilization is heading
Ouch, hoping this bankruptcy  ends soon so we can move on
Celsius offering 18% on BTC was the red flag for me.

I hope you get some of your $ back!
Yeah, that‚Äôs a legit fear, just don‚Äôt sell all of it.  Save 25% of the stack for 2032.
Figure out an exit strategy now. That‚Äôs the best advice I ever received and when implemented it will save you from any regret. 
What are your goals? At what point are they attained? Remember, BTC follows a 4 year cycle pretty well. Get out when you‚Äôve attained your goals, and you‚Äôll have the opportunity to buy back in before another run with new money. 
A lot of suicides related to finances could be avoided if people stuck with their plan and didn‚Äôt get greedy.
>Would I be throwing away generational money?

That's not your problem
Sell slowly
I have the same situation and same thoughts but I figure that if I have enough money to retire on comfortably then really it is probably not that big a deal to not become a multi millionaire. I could wait, retire later with potentially loads more but less time left on this earth to enjoy it.
Big houses wont make you happy.  It's extremely expensive for the ability to throw a few house parties.  You can always rent out an AirBNB for an occasion.  Big properties are big responsibilities.
[deleted]
You need to adjust your attitude to unrealised gains. Money that you fail to make is not money that you lost.
Its not all or nothing. If you have 1BTC and sell 5% cash value 13 times you will be left with 0.5BTC after fees. I have thirteen price points that I‚Äôll sell at and ride the wave.
Just a thought, imagine selling BTC at 200k for a bunch of Fiats.  
And then shortly after Fiat gets into a huge scandal and all their cars are worth next to nothing anymore.  
Be careful, never put all eggs in one basket, no matter which one.
That's an eye opener for me, as I've dabbled for a while and my portfolio is starting to mature. I'm emotionally attached and it's scary just like you said.
Why would it mean selling? If it hit that level, we‚Äôd be getting closer to it being a proper currency in its own right.
Easy, take out a loan backed by your assets in Bitcoin, and then sell only what you need in order to make payments on that loan. Perhaps wiser to take out maybe a year‚Äôs worth of payments at a time to capitalize on bull runs.
I've been into it since 2014.  I got an OK stash and ive sold in chunks of 50%. 

So far it's given me a good return and I still have good chunks for the "what if" .   And last bull season i sold eth at around 3000, not even close to max. But for eth bought at 20-50 usd, it was great
This is because BTC doesn‚Äôt have inherit value outside of what the next person will pay. If a stock got overvalued based on its free cash flow, I‚Äôd sell for profit, and re-buy at a better valuation - the same cannot be done for BTC. You can chart it and run technical analysis, but there is no underlying worth to value it at. 

It‚Äôs Why I choose stocks, you can measure cash flow and actual value, which BTC will never have. I can vividly see if a company is doing well, growing, or dying.

At bitcoin, you are at the mercy of Paul down the street who decides to sell just cause. There‚Äôs no backstop - a cash flowing company never goes to 0 cause it has inherit value through future cash flow. Just my 2 cents. I dabble in crypto, but to have your entire net worth in it is foolish imo.
[deleted]
I‚Äôm starting to think that the bull won‚Äôt be as intense this time round either. But we have got the ETF ace on the hole this time so it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess.
You know the bull market is about to start when crypto companies start to give free money.
Today's bull market is tomorrow's bear.
We did a full one year bear cycle after the 2021 top. Now that's over, and we are back in a bull cycle (ever since Nov. 2022). Seems pretty cut and dry to me.
I believe there will be a big sell before halving anyway. Last "cycle" the same happened. Even without the COVID crash BTC was going downward before it went up to actual ATH.
Depends on how long you've been saying it's a suckers rally. At some point you'll probably be right. üòÇ
Nope. Just early in a bull run.
That‚Äôs what I said at 15-20, 20-25, 25-35 ‚Ä¶.at some point, will btc go down ? Absolutely. I believe btc will at some point go to 100k which is still ridiculous return
haha nice try bear. Its a real pump. Welcome to the bull market!
"Suckers" who are 150% YTD up on the best-performing asset in the world.
It is suckers rally
Exactly.... dca back in later
Give it another ~2 years.
Latley it feels like ive been the only one selling....
i feel like the etf announcement will be a massive sell the news event just like the venezuela adoption. who knows what‚Äôs gonna happen until then tho, we might hit 50k and go back to 30-35k, placing us back to last week.
gotta be careful, i think that‚Äôs part of the bait to dump on all the new comers
got to be
Happy rollercoaster riding. Don't forget to TP.
Def not retiring! Not after all this waiting
Tell me you are sidelined, without telling me you are sidelined.
This thread got recommended to me and it's scary to read the comments from people. "I'm worried about what happens when it hits 250k, will I be able to sell". 

It's like someone who's bought a lottery ticket fretting about what to do with the hypothetical winnings. 

Bascially just wait forever and keep buying it and maybe someday something will happen where you and everyone else will try to sell and then realize the exchanges don't actually have real money to cash out into? 

And they're so arrogant and snobby about how they can predict the future. Like, what is even happening.
All the crypto millionaires out there and you say this lmao.
If VET is up everything should be up.
[deleted]
i guess there is no guarantee. past performance doesn‚Äôt guarantee future performance. we just have to be willing to risk it i guess
It's at 41.5K now.
And it is back and it is gone, but wait its back, nope gone again. You must be new here.
i like the approach of not even hiding you‚Äòre an incel
It is pretty cool living in the future. We‚Äôll let you know when the price drops for us
Shit. You found the cheat code
I hope your fucking right dude. I just put my life savings in!
It's behind though
If you bought at $0.01, which I‚Äôm sure no one here did.
What is tax?
I won't pay tax at all :) just export history report from Coinbase to proof that I held it longer than 1 year and the wins are tax-free in Germany when you do it like this.

This is the whole purpose of toxic bitcoin maximalism. At first they offend you, then you agree but reason that they could speak more kindly, and finally you understand.
We are the protectors
What's that?
aka buy opportunities!
Sound funny but i think that is a genuine signal! I recall getting an Uber at the height of the craze and the guy was lecturing me about crypto trading
Both times (2017 crash and 2021) the peak was marked by my Uber driver talking about it.  It‚Äôs a real indicator.
What do you mean if?... its when..

So you're saying that in the next bear market BTC will go down from 100k to 10k? I guess I'll wait till then to buy then.
I‚Äôm still waiting for that valid criticism
And you're still acting like this even when it's up lol.
yes, we were.  the halving effect is real.  I've had this season circled on my calendar for nearly two years lol.
This guy knows how to sell low.
Yeah because we were investing more while it's low...
Lol stay poor get back to your hole
a lot of ppl hoping for it to go to 12k at the time made me realize that it wont so i bought at 16

i don't really get this kind of bitcoin maximalism or exclusivity. sure i'd guess the vast majority of 'crypto' is a scam. but there will certainly be a handful of actually useful projects made by honest, honorable and ethically thinking people out there that have a place?
That's like saying that you're a great person, but your children are shitpeople because they're related to you.
üíØ.  it took me 5 years of shitcoining to realize that Bitcoin is the only thing that matters long term.  everything else is a gamble to try to "catch up", but every ponzi comes to an end, some faster than others.  

a bitcoin maxi is born every time they learn from their mistakes.  the people that don't learn have either left the space entirely or ... ‚ò†Ô∏è
What about eth? That's shit coin?
LTC never left the back of my mind. Currently 72 bucks, I'm curious for that one in 10 years. Its steady, especially compared to all the shitcoins that come and go each cycle
Crypto just benefits as a whole from lose monetary policy. Doesnt really matter what you buy in the end. Even scam coins will pump 100x in bull
Btc being outperformed by a lot of alts in the past 5 years man.
Go read a chart
What‚Äôs happening in 2032??
Thanks,.  That makes a lot of sense.

24 years ago I missed out on life changing money and a very early retirement.    All because I got too greedy and held on too long.

(.com boom and bust)
It is if he could have made enough money to clone himself and thus become the next generation.
Or quickly, depending on what's going to happen tomorrow.
Dream home doesn‚Äôt = big home. It‚Äôs just me and my wife. I want a two bedroom cabin with wet bathrooms and an outdoor Japanese style hot bath.
Nah.   I'm to old for all of that.  My partying days are long behind me.

It's more about having a place call my own,  being able to provide a place for me and my wife's aging mothers as well as leave a home for my disabled daughter to have after I'm gone.

It's about building a nest and finally being able to relax a little.
Wheat, Corn, Pork Bellies, copper, gold, silver, paper                 

Know what they have in common?   They have no free cash flow either.
so what would you tell someone who has been speculating on oversold and overbought limits and sold just a few days ago when BTC hit heavily overbought?
I‚Äôve sold a big chunk of btc at 35k, so I‚Äôve been saying it‚Äôs a sucker rally for more than a month lol
Many of which needing a 5x on some random alt coin to break even
Good luck with that
I sold 24% of my stack this month - 12% at 36.5k, 12% at 40k. 

Not sure if it was the right move, but I feel more at ease holding what's left (can't go broke taking profits).
I feel like the halvening us a general mark of the halfway point between cycle tops. Its still ~5 months away so i dont see why 2024 would be some stellar year when we are looking back in like 2030
Although I agree with most of what you said, I'd just like to point out that exchanges don't buy or sell crypto, the users on the exchange do. Maybe that's what you meant, but I see a lot people making that mistake so just pointing it out...

But apart from that it's indeed why it crashes every cycle, too many people trying to cash out, not enough people wanting to give their cash for it.
No matter how crazy you make it sound, it‚Äôs possible. And it‚Äôs happened before. 2021 my alt coin made my friend and I 150k+ each. Swapped for USDC. Sent to my bank. No issues.
If it makes you feel better, I feel attacked everytime I buy high and sell low, I'm just not built for trading or crypto
Yeah but your water drains backwards.
Hahaha must inform us all lol
Love the enthusiasm! The go big or go home approach can end well‚Äî a bit of diversification for the life savings may be a safer bet but everyone has their own risk tolerance.  When I hear those words ‚Äúentire life savings‚Äù just seems hella risky but it‚Äôs likely one of the best places you can invest with a longer time horizon.  Maybe  peel off a smidge and put into another investment vehicle just in case but again- just me.
Bro was joking man‚Ä¶ 63k AUD to 41k EUR. It‚Äôs just currency conversion.
What other saving do you have?
Well, i thought about it once. Does that count?
üòÜ nice try. You and 95% of us the Filipinos.
Haha nice try using google translate üòÜ
Do you think it's devalued due to the extreme Covid measures in AUS? 

Also, USD is not far behind, BTC and Gold r raging.
Through the fire and the flames we carry on.
Because they lost all their money to the last scam üòÖ
I **wish** my tokens had gotten burned instead üë∫
Fucking voyager crushed me
Right? Fuck scaminsky
Just stfu, DCA in, put in cold storage and stfu some more. I don't have time for this. Your welcome.
The ETH "L2" that isn't even really an L2. Just a multisig that dummies sent their money to.
It always is
sheeesh
I'm saying shitcoins can dump a lot more than just 40% and it's still survivable and  being down just 40% in this bear while keeping your money in BTC is nothing to be scared about.
im not a moon boi so yeah
sTaY pOoR says the dude who's portfolio is down 95% lmaooo
Ya I‚Äôm thinking for the bull run everyone will be waiting for 100k so 97kish should be a good sell point.
Yeah but Javier Milei is based and better times they are a coming, book it
Well this 40k vs 20k is in USD
If you've been around long enough, you'll see that even projects that appear very legitimate end up being a whole lot of nothing and getting all of the money siphoned into BTC and/or ETH.   Then the founders/developers of those projects disappear like nothing ever happened.
My form of BTC maxi comes from the belief that the global banking system of the last 100+ years is being dismantled precisely because of the decentralized and censorship resistant qualities of Bitcoin


What other tangible asset can claim the same - to be decentralized af as well as censorship resistant?
They are often times
I think so. Smart contracts are cool and some interesting use cases will come out of them. But by that time they will be running on L2s on Bitcoin.

Proof of Stake is the stake in the coffin. Goodby decentralization. Now it‚Äôs the rich rent seeking in perpetuity.
I enjoy the updates from the guy that's constantly buying LTC on here. I had some back in 2017 I think it was around $15-$30 but never held it lol

Agree, crypto as a whole does benefit from loose monetary policy. 


But, I disagree that it doesn‚Äôt matter what you buy in the end. There will be winners and there will be losers. 


That said, on a larger note, I would agree that at present it doesn‚Äôt matter too much what you buy‚Ä¶ it will likely go up in the coming months/year+, but I would caution to have a sensible exit strategy for your place/needs in life before letting greed take over
It does matter because almost 100% of coins/tokens lose value against BTC in the end.  Also, the majority of people who put money into scam coins don't even sell at the right time because of greed or they become the exit liquidity.
There is a small percentage of alts that outperform BTC. Then there is like a huge percentage of alts, probably over 95% or maybe over 98%, that under perform BTC.  On average, you're better off investing in BTC in the long run. And I hold a lot of alts.
Not sure what charts you're looking at, but almost every single alt has lost value against BTC over a 5 year timeframe or longer.
Which chart?
You won‚Äôt be there don‚Äôt worry
Damn man. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake twice. I got extremely lucky and turned 2k into 52k with weed stocks roughly 10 years ago. My exit strategy was that as soon as I could pay off my student loans, get out. I got out, and within a month the stocks had plummeted. That saved me $500/month for like 7 more years. That was indeed life changing money in a way. In 2021, I went against my own advice and turned 7k into 56k with LRC(using leverage). Lost it all due to being greedy and not having a strategy. I Have struggled with bills since. Be reasonable and modest with your goals. Love you long time.
i did teh same thing with my crypto goals: get to this amount and sell.. but then it got to that amount in 2021 and the youtube guys kept on saying it will go even higher, so i didn't sell. It's a good thing not to let those voices influence you. I am left with just as much as I put in because I didn't sell back then in 2021. And I still find it hard to set a goal and then to sell it, with the fear i might miss out still on higher profits.
A fair position, but I have to ask. Does ownership of a piece of real estate make you feel more secure than owning Bitcoin? I personally find this to be a legitimate question. Renting while letting my Bitcoin appreciate is something I‚Äôm seriously considering.
And they also aren‚Äôt investments - but I do get your point
The no inherit value, but people banking on appreciation just a hard concept for me. I‚Äôd get it if it was a way to protect wealth and stay stable like gold, or had use like wheat or corn. BTC is just a speculative asset, where you need others to buy it in order for you to make money. Definition of a ponzi imo. 

My point was you can‚Äôt know when to exit, cause there are no points of reference or value, you‚Äôll never know if it‚Äôs under or over valued, cause there is no inherit value outside what the next guys are willing to pay. Making the exit point extremely hard. I just trade it off technical levels. 

Shorted it against 44,000 today, and have made $600 in a couple hours
Ouch.
Thanks, fam. I might need it üò≠
Yeah, I just mean if someone has 1 billion usd worth of doge coin, good luck finding the 1B in liquidity to turn that into actual money. I guess you could move it around from exchange to exchange trying to cash out as much as you can?
What if theres is forwards and ours is backwards?
I‚Äôm kidding


Edit: I do own substantial amounts of BTC, I‚Äôm not kidding about that, but it‚Äôs nowhere near my life savings nor the majority/entirety of my investment portfolio (about 10% actually). Also, I‚Äôve owned it for years.
Wow. Dude I‚Äôm joking. Jesus lol

Edit: I cannot believe how many people couldn‚Äôt see that obvious joke for what it was lol. Seriously like at least three people! Jesus! I wish there was an emoji for something going over someone‚Äôs head cuz I‚Äôd put it here lol
I‚Äôm kidding. Obviously it was joke. I thought it would be obvious anyway

i am in fact a newbie so i wouldn't know. i heard a few things but i just can't believe that literally every single altcoin project is supposed to be a scam. there have got to be decent people out there right!
i mean if you want an entirely public ledger of your how much you have and where you spent it, for criminals, the government, and your jerk brother to have total access to : certainly bitcoin's your guy
I mean shitcoins are shitcoins, but you are taking things too far üòÇ
Good question to ponder.

THanks.  I'm going to noodle on that for awhile.
The way I see it is if property prices collapse, you can still live in a house.

If bitcoin prices collapse there's not a lot you can do with your bits.

I'm not saying they're all 100% scams. I'm saying that even the ones with good intentions don't make it long-term. Maybe you'll get lucky picking one that does somehow work out, but that requires a ton of luck.  Might as well buy a lottery ticket.
It's the criminals, the governments, and our jerk brothers who should be forced to use Bitcoin, so we can see what they're up to, and we all use Monero.
Exactly. The hardest money should have a ledger for anyone and everyone to inspect

Backtest results for a simple "Buy the Dip" strategy
I came across this trading strategy quite a while ago, and decided to revisit it and do some backtesting, with impressive results, so I wanted to share it and see if there's anything I missed or any improvements that can be made to it.

**Concept:**

Strategy concept is quite simple: If the day's close is near the bottom of the range, the next day is more likely to be an upwards move.

**Setup steps are:**

Step 1: Calculate the current day's range (Range = High - Low)

Step 2: Calculate the "close distance", i.e. distance between the close and the low (Dist = Close - Low)

Step 3: Convert the "close distance" from step 2 into a percentage (\[Dist / Range\] \* 100)

This close distance percentage number tells you how near the close is to the bottom of the day's range.

**Analysis:**

To verify the concept, I ran a test in python on 20 years worth of S&P 500 data. I tested a range of distances between the close and the low and measured the probability of the next day being an upwards move.

This is the result. The x axis is the close distance percentage from 5 to 100%. The y axis is the win rate. The horizontal orange line is the benchmark "buy and hold strategy" and the light blue line is the strategy line.

[Close distance VS win percentage](https://preview.redd.it/394y75l3amkd1.png?width=543&format=png&auto=webp&s=c67c39068dc188da0dc0d3d3929fb58b9af234ff)

What this shows is that as the "close distance percentage" decreases, the win rate increases.

**Backtest:**  
I then took this further into an actual backtest, using the same 20 years of S&P500 data. To keep the backtest simple, I defined a threshold of 20% that the "close distance" has to be below. 

*EDITED 25/08: In addition to the signal above, the backtest checks that the day's range is greater than 10 points. This filters out the very small days where the close is near the low, but the range is so small that it doesn't constitute a proper "dip". I chose 10 as a quick filter, but going forward with this backtest, it would be more useful to calculate this value from the average range of the previous few days*

If both conditions are met, then that's a signal to go long so I buy at the close of that day and exit at the close of the next day. I also backtested a buy and hold strategy to compare against and these are the results:

[Balance over time. Cyan is buy and hold, green is buy dips strategy](https://preview.redd.it/omf6eg77bmkd1.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c648497275a5a54ac6e33fbcc4438e7b899c6a2)

[Benchmark vs strategy metrics.](https://preview.redd.it/lbr5paivamkd1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0eb01da5b52b71f49ae483aa980477b35213517)

The results are quite positive. Not only does the strategy beat buy and hold, it also comes out with a lower drawdown, protecting the capital better. It is also only in the market 19% of the time, so the money is available the rest of the time to be used on other strategies.

**Overfitting**

There is always a risk of overfitting with this kind of backtest, so one additional step I took was to apply this same backtest across a few other indices. In total I ran this on the S&P, Dow Jones, Nasdaq composite, Russel and Nikkei. The results below show the comparison between the buy and hold (Blue) and the strategy (yellow), showing that the strategy outperformed in every test.

https://preview.redd.it/blqhj6fibmkd1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aa3e5cb3e6979e32b936b4a3b4ba6e01b3e1f71

**Caveats**  
While the results look promising, there are a few things to consider.

1. Trading fees/commission/slippage not accounted for and likely to impact results
2. Entries and exits are on the close. Realistically the trades would need to be entered a few minutes before the close, which may not always be possible and may affect the results

**Final thoughts**

This definitely seems to have potential so it's a strategy that I would be keen to test on live data with a demo account for a few months. This will give a much better idea of the performance and whether there is indeed an edge.

Does anyone have experience with a strategy like this or with buying dips in general?

**More Info**

This post is long enough as it is, so for a more detailed explanation I have linked the code and a video below:

**Code** is here on GitHub: [https://github.com/russs123/Buy-The-Dip/tree/main](https://github.com/russs123/Buy-The-Dip/tree/main)

First, good post. I like seeing ideas and the results people get. Just a idea.... I wonder if adding the overnight gap to it would improve accuracy or not.
My first trading firm‚Äôs biggest strategy was a ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù on SPY. It was a long only strategy that outperformed during both up and down periods.

That was 8 years ago and I guarantee they‚Äôre still running it.

Buy the dip strategy intuitively just makes sense.
Interesting demonstration of the mean-reversion feature of markets.

You might be interested in this paper: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4339128](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4339128) 

And this twitter thread: [https://x.com/RelSentTech/status/1743369914864250909](https://x.com/RelSentTech/status/1743369914864250909)

"Twice the market's return in 29% of the time?

Here's an interesting stylized fact of equity markets based on their strong mean-reversion properties (which have surfaced since the turn of the century, e.g., https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4339128‚Ä¶).  

Yesterday, the S&P 500 finished in the lower 10% of its range (commonly referred to as the 1-day stochastics). 

SPY closed at 467.31 with a low of 467.05 and a high of 470.96.  

Since its inception, when SPY has finished in the lower 10% of its 1-day range, if you bought at the close and held until there were three consecutive days in which it did NOT finish in the lower 10% of its daily range, the total return (excluding commissions, slippage) would have been 1.9x the buy-and-hold return (3567% vs. 1886%) while being in the market only 29% of the time.   

The "Sharpe ratio" (ignoring the risk-free rate) was 1.9 vs. 0.6 for the buy-and-hold, and the maximum drawdown was -21% vs. -55%.  

In the attached chart, "TIM" stands for "time in market," "SR" stands for "Sharpe ratio," and "MDD" stands for "Maximum Drawdown"  

If we only took the trade when the index was above its 200-day moving average, the total return was only 25% of the buy-and-hold return, while being in the market 19% of the time with a SR of 1.8, and a MDD of -18%.  

If we only took the trade when relative sentiment was bullish, the total return was slightly higher than the buy-and-hold return (1947% vs. 1886%), while being in the market 20% of the time, with a SR of 2.6 and a MDD of -15%."
Looks like the Internal Bar Strength strategy - good stuff. Now try replacing exit to closing near the high of the range...2-3x your results here.
Running this live, you will find executing a couple seconds before the close while using it as part of your indicator invalidates this strategy (Caveat 2). The close price is the price after the closing auction has taking place. You will have to submit your order 10-15 minutes beforehand depending on the exchange to participate in that auction. Executing couple seconds before the close will not suffice and you will find much of your performance will be gone. 

Ernie Chan has a great presentation you can find on youtube about the spurious mean reversion present in daily close prices that you cannot capture by executing just before the close.
I see a few major issues.

1. What isn't mentioned in the 'rules' above is the actual entry criteria being used in the backtest:

price\['Long'\] = np.logical\_and((price.Pct < PCT\_THRESH), (**price.Range > 10**))

I checked, and with this criteria in place (range < 10) , there are over 100 fewer trades placed.    **This extra condition wasnt mentioned above.**

The issue with using a hardcoded number like '10', is that it biases the results for when the index was smaller.  It doesn't scale as the index grows, so while at the beginning of the dataset this will filter out a bunch of trades, as the index grows it will become increasingly uncommon for the range to ever be < 10.   You need a different way to calculate this filter, or explain why it's there in the first place, how it was arrived at.

2)  The strategy purports to compare the performance of 'buy and hold' vs. 'selective buy and hold'.  That is, we want to test whether we can enhance our gains, and also reduce our risk, by finding a way to limit market exposure.  As such, it does not (to me) make sense to then calculate our gains in a compounding fashion, using something like  
price\['Sys\_Bal'\] = (STARTING\_BALANCE \* price.Sys\_Ret.**cumprod()**)

By doing this, you make an assumption that all gains are reinvested and compounded.  But this is not what we are trying to test.  We are trying to test whether or not we can beat the benchmark by selective participation.

I think the combination of these 2 is skewing the results early on, and as the index grows it starts to fail.  Not saying it has no merit, but it needs refinement and retesting / redefinition to define exactly what it entails as a trading strategy.  My independent results used a simple calculation of rebuilding what the index value would be if we did not compound and did not use a range filter.  The results are not nearly as outrageously good as they appear to be from 2000 to 2020 using the method proposed.  OP, I will share my code with you, it is quite simple.  DM me.
Good discussion.

But a code that gets financial information from the website and incorporates into signal processing is essential since people will shorting the stock overnight and the price will go down the hill.

Trying on that code now.


But good analysis.

My favorite reddit post this week.
This systems takes a huge amount of self discipline. Had an investor truly started on Jan 2000 he would had to trade this system for almost 8 years before starting to see anything on his account.
What you've proven is essentially that these indices go up more than they go down.   You can base any number of strategies off of this bias.
Caveat 2 will likely invalidate

You might compare sharpes, run sensitivity analysis on params and different time periods. IMO long tests on indices don't tell much.
What I found interesting is that if you start with this strategy after 2010, it seems to vastly underperform buy & hold
Cool results, could you implement the reverse as well, and basc short it if the close finishes near the high of the day?
I just set up and ran an equivalent analysis using Sierra Chart data.

I find that for SPX:  

With a closing Threshold of .75, this strategy outperforms the benchmark slightly  (6450 vs. 5634) since 1-JAN 2000.

With a closing Threshold of .2, this strategy underperforms the benchmark slightly  (5274 vs. 5634) since 1-JAN 2000.

This somewhat contradicts the hypothesis.  Also note, my results are not matching those posted in the original thread.  **It could be a mistake on my part, I was not able to spend as much time as OP.**
This is exactly the kind of strategy I've been wanting to implement, but my coding and math skills just haven't been up to the task. Basically just taking advantage of churn when things are mostly sideways or trending up.
Buying dips in general is good on bill market which seems to be the most of the time for the market. How about during a bear market like that 2008, 2000, and a possible black swan.
Nice write up and a neat idea. I would have also also use 20% as a threshold based on your presentation.

One thing that caught my eye is that you have calculated the CAGR as 4% for S&P from 2000-2020. I know there was a lost decade, but is this right? It seems a little low given that 2010 to 2020 was a rocket ship.
Hell yeah!

I'm curious why you chose one day dips as opposed to weekly or 3 day dips?

I would assume it would assist in the potential over fitting(I don't believe you did) and allow for larger allocation potential/less fees

On the contrary, my thoughts could be too common of an observation and therefore priced in(red weekly candle>buy)

Either way, if it ain't broke don't fix it! Great find!
It‚Äôs been in drawdown for the past 6 - 7 years even without accounting for trading costs
I don't think you incorporated dividends in your comparison.  A 2001 to 2021 hypothetical test in this article resulted in 409% for S&P.   [Put $10,000 in the S&P 500 ETF and Wait 20 Years (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/022216/put-10000-sp-500-etf-and-wait-20-years.asp).   Love the enthusiasm and effort, you learn and you grow more sophisticated and you learn what doesn't work.
For your caveat about trading on the close, you can use Market-On-Close (MOC) orders. You do have to submit the orders more than 15 minutes before close.

Edit: clarify when orders have to be placed
Nice work
I wonder how the win rate would change if you modified your entry criteria to include some voting scheme between all of the indices you tested, i.e. 2/5, 3/5 or 5/5.
Have you considered back testing this on futures or options? I know you said the drawdown was pretty low, so maybe it would transfer well.

Are you able to share the maximum number of consecutive losses?
Guess I know what bot to try first. 

My other 4 range from bad to only losing a little.
Apart from the obvious issues with actually getting the EOD price, 

The strategy outperforms the benchmark 2000 to 2010,

The benchmark beats the crap out of the strategy 2010 to 2020.
Not really a question about this post, but where can I find good information on how to do this type of testing, as someone who doesn‚Äôt program every day?
Hey! Great post. One question, what kind of platform can you use to run this with real money? I supoose you need access to a broker account API and I guess a way to run python automatically. I am new in this and looking forward to build my first strategy.

Thanks!
Do one for selling at tops
interesting!
Good infrastructure OP, did you take different thresholds rather than 20% to test maximum potential gains? We could also add a lot strategies into this frame work, i.e. hold the next day/buy more shares if larger DIP observed. Thanks for the post!
Interesting thing to see on the first chart that that no matter what "close distance" is, the win rate will be always above 50%. Also the predictor is very monotonous.
There‚Äôs so much liquidity during the last two minutes of each day, I would probably focus on that rather than acting too much sooner. There tends to be significant movement in the last minute candle, it tends not to be so much that it‚Äôs going to cause a change in window from less than 20% to greater than 20%. I haven‚Äôt tested this, but that‚Äôs my intuition.
This is great! 
I‚Äôm working on something similar with 1DTE overnight 
Trying to figure out spread strategy like firing off a bullish put spread on close 

My algo can trade off hours too so I‚Äôm thinking the option flow at close might give me a tiny boost

Nice work! Thanks for posting
When trading futures, the low of the day can happen after the ‚Äúclose‚Äù or settlement price and you need to distinguish between settlement price and last price. It actually happens often and is a pitfall of such backtests.
This is quite interesting. In testing against a simple buy and hold benchmark, have you considered a rolling forward approach? With a buy and hold approach, you are unfortunately beholden to the day you buy and if I buy and hold on a dip, I might have stronger results. What do you think?
Nice work. Strangely enough, I've found this relationship between closing distance and win rate to completely inverted in highly volatile markets. Any idea why this may be so?
Good post I like your idea, pay attention to in what points in time this performs well, eyeballing this looks like this method worked super well in 2004 to 2008 what is your benchmark outperformance say 2016 to present. 

Might be worth while slicing the results then measure it vs benchmark instead of looking at it like one thing.. this way you filter out periods where the strategy performs exceptionally well influencing the overall result.. 

Have you tried applying this on a more granular level say 1h timeframe 15 minutes timeframe.. 

Looking good keep up the work. And keep posting ! Love to see there posts more
Great backtest
i love this sub
I don't see how you are not introducing lookahead bias in your results here. 

You are filtering out poor performing days, that information can only be accessed after the day's trading is concluded.
What happens in the downward market? If markets are going up I would expect this to work because markets are going up.
So there was an approximate drawdown of 8 years? (2000 - 2008). I prefer less than 4 years.
From the win rate vs. close distance graph, I understand that x-axis is actually the threshold chosen for the strategy. I am curious what will happen if i try to short the market when the close distance is bigger than some threshold, say 80%.
Very interesting post, thank you for sharing. I will try to reproduce myself.

I understand why some of most-downvoted posts here why downvoted; they were somewhat poorly worded. However the criticism stands, I think. It does seem remarkable that the method has actually underperformed in the last few years. Could it be as @kamvia_io suggests that this method actually ‚Äúno longer works‚Äù as big-money algotrading on very short timeframes has taken over? Or another reason?

I‚Äôm just hesitant to apply this strategy ‚Äúfor real‚Äù given its relative poor performance in more recent years..
Great stuff currently working on a similar analysis for selling 0DTE credit spreads based on where SPX is at 13:00


If SPX is inside the top 20% of the range sell a Call Credit Spread around 15 deltas¬†


If it is in the lower 20% of the range sell a put credit spread same Delta.¬†


Wait for the price of the spread to go up to a specific value based on the width. If triggered do not hold to expiration.¬†
Something must be off.  I looked into this hardcore over these last 2 days.  Here are the results I have vs the buy and hold SPY. Over the last 8 months got an annual return of 14.25%

[Chart 1](https://ibb.co/V2pM527)
[Chart 2](https://ibb.co/Qbnv3rr)

I'll check 5 year here in a sec
Could you do this for IWM? Really interested in small caps and rate cuts !
I am a little confused on how out/under performance is calculated for such a strategy. Since this strategy is buying the market, wouldn't a way to estimate if it has under/out performed the market to be if (% time in market) > (% of buy and hold profits)? 

For example, If I am spending 20% of time in market but I gained 50% of the profit from buying and holding, isn't that a "outperformance" in some sense since I can reinvest the money (the 80% of the time my money is not in market) somewhere else?
Hi, thanks for sharing and starting this discussion!

I noticed you used:

* An Index, not a tradable product
* Close and not Adj Close

I tried with SPY and Adj Close and cannot replicate the results

  
EDIT:

For your list of ETFs, again i suggest:

  
**\^GSPC (S&P 500 Index)** - Equivalent ETF: **SPY**

**\^DJI (Dow Jones Industrial Average)** - Equivalent ETF: **DIA**

**\^IXIC (Nasdaq Composite Index)** - Equivalent ETF: **QQQ** 

**\^RUT (Russell 2000 Index)** - Equivalent ETF: **IWM** 

**\^N225 (Nikkei 225 Index)** - Equivalent ETF: **EWJ**
If you‚Äôre using todays close as a signal to enter for todays close, there‚Äôs already look ahead bias. The last few minutes can be volatile. 
Try lagging the signal for a day, and enter at the next open, and see how it goes (likely stale but who knows)
Will be interesting to see this on special days. I.e, if the company publishes q result after market, will you get a buy signal to buy and sell the day after the report?
For a real ticker (and not an index) like SPY, if the ETF has any dividend between start_date and end_date, would you have to account for those and add them back into your bench_balance? 

For example, if SPY had paid a cumulative amount of $2,000 in dividends during your simulation time, you‚Äôd have to add that back into your bench_balance?
Interesting. Are weekends / holidays included?
So I didn't trust the research on this. As an R guy, I knocked out the same study in under 10 minutes (go me+ ChatGPT!)  and I plotted it.  I now independently agree with the OP on their assessment of the predictive nature of the Close Distance.  I also include my code for those who also, intelligently, don't believe me either.

It will generate a nice ggplot graph with blue dots.  The grey underlying bars are a histogram to see the density.

You fitted it to a bull market of course it‚Äôs going to work. Look at the return when the market was trading in a range earlier in the data set you picked the returns were marginally better.
Buy the dip and hold?

I think it‚Äôs important to note that the index has more mean reversion nature than individual equities, so this may not hold up with I.e. AAPL or TSLA. 

I‚Äôm also noticing a lot of - perhaps all of, or even MORE than all of - the outperformance came in 2008. This strategy may well underperform outside of bear markets. Three things I can think of to look at - how does this perform through COVID shock? How does performance correlate with VIX? Would this perform better if we‚Äôre below a declining 50 day SMA? (Somewhat similar to the vix question)
Glad you're doing this with an index, you'd have to include companies that failed to backtest it for companies.
275% roin in the 20 years ? Worth ?
Test again
I think this is inherently flawed as this is only testing on the S&P500, which goes up over time. This only works on assets that are currently at or near all time highs. If you believe the asset you're purchasing will increase over the long run, then you're getting a relative discount versus buying before the dip happened.
Nice analysis! Reproduced similar results on my end in both excel and c#. Quick question: are you using the close price or adjusted close? If you are using adjusted close are you also adjusting the open, high and low? I‚Äôm currently using the actual close price but have been confusing myself on whether that‚Äôs correct or not. Thanks and nice post!
Test it again but when s&p500 gives buy signal buy TQQQ and when it's not strong enough buy signal then buy SQQQ!
You can see on the chart that its performed poorly compared to the index for the last couple years.  Every single one of these ‚Äústatistical edges‚Äù eventually reverses, generally the moment you start trading it.  It‚Äôs almost an argument for simulation theory.
explain the test to me again as if I was a moron. You go long when the close of the day is close to the low of the current day? What if the close is below the LOD
Thank you. Good point, I didn't specifically isolate the overnight gap, but when I was looking through the data to check it against the SP500 chart I noticed a lot of the profit actually came from the gaps, so that's why the backtest buys at the day's close, to take advantage of that gap.

Of course buying exactly at the close isn't realistic, so I realise there's some inaccuracy there as a result, but the idea would be to buy just before the market closes to take full advantage of the gap.
[deleted]
Sounds like the same thing as the OP strategy except it just holds for three days instead of selling at next day‚Äôs close. Thus being in the market 29% of the time versus 19% of the time.
Very interesting, thanks for linking those papers, I will have a look at them later tonight.

My backtests are a bit more rudimentary so it's useful to read up on similiar studies and tests to see what I can improve. It's good to see that other's tests have shown positive results from a simliar approach though. Of course a backtest isn't a comparison to live testing, but it gives a good starting point.
Huh, just googled that strategy and you're right, that's basically the same thing! I kept the exits simple for this first backtest to see if there's any observable edge there, so I'd definitely want to play around with the exit strategies to see if it can be improved. I'll give your suggestion a go and see what the results are. Have you traded this strategy previously?
Excuse me if this is a stupid question, but why not trade futures and buy after the stock market close?
This
Most underrated comment.

Any magic numbers in an algo will almost always take away from it's robustness.
Ah, very well spotted. Once I finished the backtest, I noticed there were some trade signals being generated by days with a small range, meaning that even though the close was near the low, the day's range was so small that it wouldn't be considered much of a dip.

So to filter this out quickly I added the **price.Range > 10** condition. This wasn't intended to be part of the backtest, otherwise I would use a value that is based on previous x days average ranges as my minimum range threshold rather than a fixed value of 10. So this was a quick and hacky check that I then forgot to remove.

For reference, without that condition, the results of the backtest are actually much better:

[https://imgur.com/a/mPVECeW](https://imgur.com/a/mPVECeW)

I'll edit the post, that's an annoying oversight but I don't think it invalidates the underlying logic of the backtest.

Regarding point 2 - I think my approach is valid. The cumprod() is multiplying the returns for each day to give you the total return over time. The benchmark return is calculated with this method as 122.01%. In my data the close price on day 1 is 1455.22 and on the last day it is 3230.78, so if you use those numbers alone then you get ((3230.78-1455.22)/1455.22) \* 100 = 122.01%, the same number.

The system return is set to 1 on days when there is no trade, so the cumprod() works the same way there, it multiplies the daily returns cumulatively, but on days when there is no trade, it multiplies the running total by 1, so nothing changes.

I would prefer to do a backtest where returns are reinvested and the balance grows/declines over time because that's how I would be trading it, so I'd want to visualise it in the same way.
Thanks, yes I think something like this would be good to automate or at least auto generate signals for so that you can get into the trade
Can you explain your comment? I don't understand.
Computers are fairly disciplined. Fail to see the problem.
No, not really. What I've proven is that when the price closes near the low of the day, it is more likely to go up than go down, when compared to the underlying index.

Ultimately the point is to outperform the market isn't it?
Casualty of algo trading?
Any single strategy will most likely underperform buy and hold in total profits, especially on an index...and that information is just as irrelevant as your comment. Nobody algo-trades a single strategy... So as long as it's profitable, it can be added to a portfolio of many. This one is in the market only 19% of the time, so there's a ton of room for others to add up and vastly outperform the market.

These pointless comments make me feel some sort of way I tell you hwat
I did a quick test of that, here's the equity chart - the system is in green:

[https://imgur.com/a/wfMl1cf](https://imgur.com/a/wfMl1cf)

It worked amazingly during the 2008 crash but has been pretty bad since then. Pretty disappointing result as it would have been great to have a strategy that works both long and short.
I linked the code just in case anyone wanted to mess around with it. It took me a while to get the hang of python and back testing but I learned from youtube tutorials and it's been worthwhile because it allows me to quickly test ideas like this. So the code is there if you want to have a look and get some practice :)
Ask Chat GPT to code it for you, no joke
Backtest is from 1/1/2000 so it includes both of those events, it actually performed surprisingly well during 2008. I guess even in a downturn there are going to be corrections and that's what this strategy captured. You get panic selling, then a correction the next day. Not always, but often enough to get profitable results - in the backtest anyway
Thanks! To be honest, no reason other than that‚Äôs the data that‚Äôs easy to get. It could also be tested on weekly but I don‚Äôt go faster than daily because I can‚Äôt easily get free and reliable data for anything faster like 1hr. 
Strategy like this would be quite suitable for daily trading though. I can check for setups once at the end of the day, and place market close orders if there‚Äôs a signal so it is a minimal effort and emotion kind of system. (Assuming it holds up in live trading)
Thanks. I've never actually tried using those, I normally just set market or limit orders as I haven't tried trading these "end of day" strategies. That's good to know that it's an option though, so within the last 15 mins of the day, a quick check to see if there is a signal developing and then place an MOC order.
Cheers!
Hmm possibly. I‚Äôve been given so many ideas and variations to test from the comments that it will keep me busy for a while üòÖ
I haven‚Äôt got that far yet, still trying to develop strategies to test but my plan when it comes to live testing will be pretty much what you said. I will look for a broker that has an API and then develop a way to automate the trades. I‚Äôve heard of it being done with a raspberry pi. There will probably be online services that allow you to do this but depends if their own fees are acceptable
Thanks!
I tested various %-ages during the initial study, which is the first part of my post that shows the chart with various % thresholds and the resulting win rate. In the actual backtest I stuck with 20% since it gave a good number of trades, but easy enough to tweak to other values.
Yep, the S&P during that period has a winrate of over 50% by itself since it has been in a general uptrend for that time, so that was my baseline, but the strategy win rate then increased even further
How about using SPY as the signal to trade SPX futures. That would solve that problem.
I hadn‚Äôt tested various take profit strategies on it yet, kept it simple for the initial backtest but one of the next steps of developing this strategy and backtest further would be to do what you mentioned and look at different ways for exiting the trades and perhaps holding onto it longer having bought at a discounted price (the dip). It‚Äôll take some time to do that though, so I generally to a simple test like this to get some initial data and decide if it‚Äôs worth continuing before I sink too much time into it
Strange, I‚Äôd have to look at the individual trades that the system generates and see if there‚Äôs something observable that could explain it. That‚Äôs part of the problem with backtesting though, unless you test in on absolutely everything, you‚Äôre going to miss out a lot of scenarios.
Thank you! Yes it does seem like it has times of very good performance and times of sluggish performance so it would be interesting to dive more into the trades and see if there‚Äôs anything specifically different about those periods. 
Daily data is easy to work with for a quick backtest so I start off with that first. It can be taken to a more granular level but requires some more work to the code.
He's buying near the close of the day so he already knows that information I guess
I reran my code on SPY over last 8 months and get similar results. Looks like it underperformed the benchmark this year although with a smaller drawdown and only 20% time in market.
The strategy probably could do with some refinement around the stop loss and take profit. 
On a separate note, what did you use to perform this backtest? The data output is brilliant! So many stats and so much information there.
Calculated about 17% for todays close distance percentage. Couple that will it being the last day and Spy historically goes up on the day before Labor Day I hope it‚Äôs gonna be a good day tomorrow.
Yea the backtest hasn‚Äôt included dividends, but I do a first pass backtest like the one I presented to get some initial results before deciding if it‚Äôs worth looking into the strategy further. Then I would model it more accurately with trading fees, dividends etc.
Yea the data is from yahoo finance. Weekends and holidays don‚Äôt have any data
This is true, and was commented on in other comments. But the counter-argument there was that this strategy is in the market for only 19% of the time, leaving a lot of cash free to invest in other strategies alongside. It was suggested this to be one strategy alongside others. Furthermore, it apparently also works in a bear market if the strategy is reversed (albeit you need to ‚Äúknow‚Äù that you‚Äôre in a bear market).
Thanks, good to see you‚Äôre getting similar results for confirmation üëç
I use the close price. A couple comments mentioned using adjusted prices but I‚Äôm not really familiar with that and I‚Äôve not seen anything to say that using unadjusted prices is wrong. But I‚Äôm no expert on this stuff, just trying to figure it out like the rest of us so maybe adjusting the prices is the right way to do it.
Please reread your last sentence. Make sure you've had your coffee.
At worst case the close would be equal to the low for that day, in which case the distance between the close and low is 0, so it still works.
Yes, I would‚Äôve suspected that. A lot of the profit would‚Äôve come from overnight gaps as well.
From what I remember it could be multi day but there were targets to exit that day.

I do remember that entries were only done in the first 30 minutes of trading
I am also curious if anyone has any real life experience with us. It seems like some of these strategies may have worked prior to dramatic increase in algorithmic trading. But have the rules changed now that machine learning is here and the trading volume has gone up dramatically?
Yeah that may be viable and worth trying out in a backtest. The point is that the close price provided by most data providers (using consolidated SIP) is the final closing auction price reported by the primary exchange where the stock trades. This information is not instantaneously available at 4pm EST. It can be reported much later.
Are you familiar with JSON response?
Computers are fine. I want to see you invest your money for 8 years before you see 1 penny of positive return.  That's the fallacy. Not computers. Humans that give up way way before.
Running a computer for a loss 8 years is a human decision.
My point was just that the directional bias of the indices makes a bunch of long-biased strategies, like yours, possible.  There's a huge array of possibilities.

I have two long-only strategies in forward testing right now.  Neither would make a dollar if the market didn't tend to go up.
Not everyone is an algo expert on here. I have 0 algo trading experience as prob 98% of the other people here. I‚Äôm just here out of curiosity. So yes my comment is worthless to you but might still be worth something to the OP. 

Nonetheless, half of your comment I found interesting. Indeed he could try to add other algo‚Äôs for the 81% that you‚Äôre not in the market. For the other half, i hope i triggered you in all the right spots
People also tend to forget about leverage. Show me a strategy that gives me buy & hold returns with less drawdown, so I can apply leverage and get higher returns until my drawdown matches b&h (or something I‚Äôm comfortable with).
Thanks, I'll check it out!
Most underrated comment on here. Really does change the game if you know some basic coding, how to avoid overfitting, and know how to prompt it properly.
Fair enough.

I bet it does hold up, but that staying true to the system is more emotional than it seems.
I edited to clarify as I see I was ambiguous. You have to place the order \*before\* the last 15 minutes. All those MOC and LOC orders get put into the closing auction.
I was more talking about win amount rather than win rate. You may have 80% wins at $1 each and 70% wins at $2. Your model may make more profit at a specific threshold that represents the peak earning of this strategy.
Makes sense, thanks for explaining!
I used lumibot.  Here is my code https://pastebin.com/VDE3Lx6W
[deleted]
üò≠üò≠ but maybe he‚Äôs talking abt aftermarket hours
ya ok. My comment was badly phrased
Cheers, and do you use any stop loss? Are you trading index futures here or ETF's
[deleted]
According to a former FED chairman the current generation of traders don't actually know how to trade a market that isn't perpetually going up. It seems exploiting this is the norm.

That said, the results for the NIkkei are promising.
Again with these people that think you only run one strategy.... That's not how it works? If your strat shows good results in any market, you add it to portfolio and see how it stacks. What if it loses for 8 years but covers losses of other starts for 2 other years?
Ah I see what you mean, that makes sense although with the way the backtest is setup here it doesn't follow the trend so much and is more of a mean reversion strategy. But you've got a good point, it may fall apart completely in a different market regime. Would need some more testing for that.
Hella triggered. Rawr!

Buyandhold comes with massive drawdown potential, so I fail to see it relevant to compare. Portfolio of algos has an advantage of being steady and preeictable, with significantly less drawdown if composed correctly. 
Regardless, everybody always says it and I am an angry tired reddit asshole so you got what you got =)
Actually, the L/MOC cut off time depends on the exchange. For instance, NASDAQ starts accepting L/MOC orders at 15:50 EST and stops accepting MOC orders at 15:55 EST and LOC orders at 15:58 EST. More info here: [https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/productsservices/Trading/ClosingCrossfaq.pdf](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/productsservices/Trading/ClosingCrossfaq.pdf)
No stop loss but the strategy only holds for 1 day. If I was to develop it to hold for more days as others have suggested then I would want to add a stop loss to limit the downside. The test is on the underlying index which can‚Äôt be traded directly so for the sp500 I would be trading the SPY etf. I‚Äôve never traded futures though so maybe thats a possibility too.
I have never once heard the term frictional costs before so Im gonna go ahead and say no
Why not test the symmetricly opposite strategy? Should resolve the dispute. If it closes near high then you short. I would be very much interested in seeing numbers for that strategy in a follow up post. Together with simulation for some commissions.
Just reverse your strategy by shorting when the indicator is above 90%, you will see this method will lose. This method works because the index trends up
Done, and the results are indeed pretty poor. This backtest goes short at the close when the close is in the top 20% of the day's range, so it's the opposite of the strategy in my main post.

[https://imgur.com/a/wfMl1cf](https://imgur.com/a/wfMl1cf)

It did incredibly well during the 2008 crash, but has been pretty poor since then. Disappointing result although I don't think it invalidates the long only approach. The long only method is useful in an uptrend to extract a bit more money than a buy and hold by getting in at discounted points (dips).
Nice. 

I always offer this test case to people who do long only, and I never hear from them again.
So it does poorly after 2010 and also does poorly 2006-2008. I would say success strongly correlates with overall trend if not for the 2003-2006 period where market was going up but short was still successful. I'm not making any strong claims from just one plot, but it sure seems success depends on overall trend direction.

I do agree that both long only and short only strats are useful because they perform better than baseline in respective trends. So if you can figure out the global trend beforehand that can be huge.

Actually, if you combine both strats into one, will they cancel each other out? But 2008 should be profitable for both.
Sure, but that doesn't make long-only wrong.  You just need to avoid giving back much when the indices are moving down.  Lots of ways to do that.
Symmetricaly opposite strats don't work. Market moves down differently than it moves up so make opposite strategy of even something that is an awful loser does not at all guarantee success. I've done many and they never play out the way you think they would.
They should, and they do, if you structure the trades correctly. 

Long/short is a thing, and all good academic/scientific research is evaluating a theme from both sides of the market.
Where Do You Get Your Data For Backtesting From? 
It seem like a proper thread is lacking that summarizes all the good sources for obtaining trading data for backtesting. Expensive, cheap, or maybe even free? I am referring to historical stock market data level I and level II, fundamental data, as well as option chains. Or maybe there are other more exotic sources people use? Would be great to brainstorm together with everyone here and see what everyone uses!

I use Schwab‚Äôs API and just store in a local database for backtesting.
For tick data, [dukascopy](https://www.dukascopy.com/trading-tools/widgets/quotes/historical_data_feed) has a free feed. Their data is based on quotes.

For 1-minute OHLC: [databento](https://databento.com/) (live and historical) and [firstratedata](https://firstratedata.com/) (historical only)

For daily, [csidata](https://www.csidata.com/) (that's the source behind Yahoo)
Norgate data. Has all the historical index constituents and delisted companies to avoid survivorship bias when building stock trading systems.

For the intra day guys, Norgate don't have intra day data. I don't understand why intra day is so popular with retail though, too hard to compete with instos in the short timeframes IMO.
Polygon offers the best developer experience I‚Äôm aware of, along with competitive pricing. However, there is a HUGE caveat that is essentially a deal breaker for any serious research work I do: I‚Äôve encountered multiple data accuracy issues in their stock data. These can range from duplicate entries in their flatfiles to incorrect stock splits data, which makes the entire adjusted OHLCV history for many tickers completely wrong. Data issues reported on their GitHub seem to stay open for months, if not longer. In my opinion, if you're looking for the highest quality data, there are better options at the moment, at least for stocks. Hopefully, they will work harder to rectify these issues in the future, as data quality is the most important factor for most users, because I think the infrastructure they have to serve the data is very user-friendly and I'd love to be able to trust their data more.  
Personally for the least amount of data issues I'd use Databento, or IQFeed, Barchart, or Quodd/Nanex for cheaper options but with a good track record of being very reliable.  
Another notable mention is financialmodelingprep, data seems of good quality and they offer a ton of fundamental endpoints, for the price I highly recommend trying it, there's tons of value.
[deleted]
Very nice sum up. Thank you a lot! I was using Databento and was very happy with it but a bit expensive.
I use databento or for downloading in csv backtestmarket
I use databento's python API. They're relatively new but only place I found with L2 data.
My understanding is norgate is gold standard for point in time if looking at universe of stocks at daily level but could be cost prohibitive to some with yearly subscription. Databento only has a few years of data which may not be of use at daily level. I'm looking at a quantrocket 1 month sub to grab a dataset, think is 30 years all stocks for like $30, removes survivorship bias. Anyone used it?
Data bento. They give you $180 in credits which is plenty for downloading OHLC data. You could get years of 1s candles for ES, NQ, and others, without going over this limit
You're not going to get this data for free. 

You can get OHLC data from most brokerages including Tradier. You can also use Yahoo Finance *provided its not for commercial usage*. 

If you want intraday data, you can use Polygon. 

For fundamental data, you can use SimFin for really cheap.
A little unconventional, but I write my algos in EasyLanguage and backtest them using the Tradstation platform. It‚Äôs free if you have an account with Tradestation
Love the thread. For crypto Binance's API is quite good and free data but you need an account and it's restricted in a lot of countries.
For crypto data, I use Binance, which can be used as market data provider without a verification of account. I am not sure if you even need an account to get data. Last I check it was free use
I'm not an algo trader but use SierraChart.

They have this for your consideration https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/SierraChartHistoricalData.php
For me FMP and norgate data cover everything I need for equities and are very good value for money
Thanks for summarizing the suggestions!
I use Polygon for 1 minute ticks and it has good options chains too
What do you guys think the best provider of international equity intraday data is?
A bit of a cheap hack, but you can export data from NinjaTrader easily.

A little bit of C# (can share my script if you want it) as a "Strategy" can export OHLC data on the chart, probably other stuff too.

I used it to export about 12 months of 1s futures chart data to CSV for free.

Not sure what the easiest way to get a Ninja license is, I got mine by signing up for a Apex Trader Funding prop firm challenge account for like $20-30 bucks on a sale, probably other ways to get a cheap license too.
Commenting so I can come back

Also I use Alpaca that I‚Äôm integrating with
Dukascopy for me has been very helpful for ML training since it's free, relatively easy to use, and the downside of missing data in places can be handled if you have a basic data cleaning pipeline set up. Some data is better than no data at all, and the data they have is high volume and therefore high quality (for the instruments I've used it for like Nasdaq 100).

For crypto only, Binance (again, free and high quality).

For actual backtesting I use cTrader, which provides actual tick data for free so the backtesting is highly accurate. The broker I use right now is ICMarkets which is relatively high volume.

The rest I'll need to check out! Threads like these are genuinely helpful.
I wonder how you guys think about OptionAlpha? They have a platform for you to do backtesting without coding. First 30 days is free and then it's quite expensive. I am kind of interested in exploring but want to know first hand experiences.
Thanks everyone for the positive feedback. Ping me if there's anything I can do to help.
I actually got the bulk of my data from IEX TOPS, parsed and processed it on my machine. This has a three main advantages:

1. It's completely free
2. I store it locally (on QuestDB) for faster execution and more control
3. It allows me to collect more data besides trade OHLC, e.g., bid/ask spread, logarithmic mean, standard deviation, etc... Such data may help me model a more realistic market simulator for backtesting.

Furthermore, I plan to combine it with more data, e.g. from https://stooq.com and SimFin.
Good post about backtesting data.
ccxt
If you create an Alpaca account by putting in $1, it has free historical SIP data (must be older than 15min) with 200/min calls. But you can batch symbols and get a ton in one call.
No yfinance? üòî
I‚Äôm so surprised barchart for excel has not been mentioned yet. All the historical data you could need and options history
Can we also divide the list your pulled together into ‚Äòfree‚Äô, ‚Äòfreemium‚Äô and ‚Äòpaid‚Äô data sources ?
alpaca, yfinance
For Binance data https://github.com/ocignis/tradezap
Which do you suggest for historical intraday charts (M1,M5,M15) for US Stocks?
[www.kibot.com](http://www.kibot.com)

They are reasonably priced.
CQG
A bit expensive probably, but I would add Bloomberg as an excellent source for market data, although intraday price data is clearly lacking.
i use Yahoo Finance
What about Alpaca? it does provide a historical data for free
I really liked Finnhub
Would love to see a the difference between stocks and options data sources.
Economic data: [Observer Desktop](https://vyntix.com/Downloads)

Disclaimer - I wrote it.
For stocks, I use YFinance.

For crypto, depending on the bot, I use the platform's API. For example, if I am deploying a bot for Binance, I will use the Binance API to fetch prices. But the engine I use (ZapCLI) automatically downloads the data for me so I don't have to do it manualy.
I use the free version of MarketStack right now, but it only gives you 1 year of data. You have to pay for more.
Are there any APIs with intraday sentiment analysis?
I actually use Oanda but I'm starting to think it's not so good
Intrinio, Benzinga

intrinio is a bit pricey, but the data quality is worth it. FMP-like data has too much wrong data.
This list is missing the data that's available from the Nasdaq Data marketplace, within which there are a number of quality vendors selling a wide array of data.
[deleted]
FMP
Mt5 export broker data
Surprised no one mentioned QuantConnect.  You can't download/export data, but even on their free tier I've been able to backtest on tick data, using their cloud framework.
Theta Data
TickStory is pretty good too. The data is from Dukascopy.

Has anyone found issues with Polygon's trade and quote data?
I'm curious if anyone here uses EDGAR? Free and right from the source but my issue is that its not standardized..
Hi everyone! We're searching for beta testers for a new tool we're building that automates the execution of your trading strategies. If you are interested join us¬†[https://forms.gle/uSPdtNNgQNPpzAxH7](https://forms.gle/uSPdtNNgQNPpzAxH7)
Out of the API's you have listed here -  which one did you go with?
How reliable is alpaca?
I suggest you take MarketStack off your list. They are a fraudulent service wrapped in a nice packaging. I paid for their monthly subscription and used it only once but turned off autopay since their data wasn't good. Then they tried to still charge me automatically for the next month on the premise that they hide a line in the Term and Conditions that says you need to notify them 30 days in advance that you want to cancel.
From the streets
Iqfeed
I don't. 

I use bootstrapping models based on Bayesian Inference and use synthetic correlated assets and input priors I believe could happen.

I check if my posterior is theorem proof like Pythagoras and it can be thrown in a monte carlo simulation. 

I don't pay for data. 

Because if I do, by definition I need two (as one always has a mistake) - and need to build a reconciliation report between the two as well.

The worst is Bloomberg. By a million miles. The times when I was young in GS doing m&a and saw some intern take data out of Bloomberg as given, was, frequently being fired on the spot. 

I try to sample out of Dirichlet distributions, and do bootstraps on synthetic correlated assets to obtain data as much as needed. All free.
Do you need an account with them? Do they offer intraday, tick maybe even level II data?
Cool, thanks! :) Do you know if a solo developer can get access to their Developer API?

  
And also, it looks like FirstRate data and Csi data have somewhat older UI appearances which is totally fine. Do you think they provide higher quality data, e.g. less missing data points etc ? I guess quality of the data could be another factor but this is even harder to gauge, other than talking to people and listening to their opinions on this.
Man those are disgustingly expensive, nah polygon has them all pretty much beat on price or better yet your broker if they offer it free.
Looks extensive, maybe a bit pricey but on a first glance it looks like they put in effort to provide high quality data?

  
Also, I tend to agree with you on the second part. The longer the timeframe the more likely you are to find a profitable strategy just because buy and hold wins long term if diversified properly.
Let's say I'm fine with not performing walk forward optimization once I have come up with a strategy, so I'm just gonna subscribe to Norgate only once. Is there a way to export all the data to ascii format and store it locally while my subscription is active? I don't see that this can be done using RealTest, so is it doable using Norgate's software?
I would say the opposite.  What's the point of an algo for longer timeframes?  Might as well buy and hold.
I'm currently using their data, so I'm curious. The duplicate entries you mention, is that in the tick level data?
Oh wow, this is really cool, i already liked DukaScopy. It is awesome that someone put that together as a JSNode repo! Thanks for sharing
Of course! Great to see this may be helpful to other people :)
Very cool! They even have an Api for historical and live data feeds, thanks for sharing ü§ó
I second databento
Has looking into L2 data been any helpful for you?
Sorry you need to sub to quantrocket also to get this so becomes much more expensive - thought could buy standalone! sharadar/nasdaq is approx $50 for survivor free end of day equity data back to 1998. Think start with yahoo, if strat looks good with slippage/fees and enter on next open to avoid gaps then get point-in-time data to get more realistic historic view. databento looks awesome at such low cost for end of day point-in-time, 2017 onwards - even 1 minute data. Only if you really want/need to go further back in time is worth paying more I'd say. 2017+ suvivor free could plenty after a yahoo initial test with more. Think I'm rambling now, have a good day all.
Interesting, that is really helpful information
Never heard of SimFin. After a quick glance it looks interesting. Thanks for sharing! :)
Yahoo Finance has really poor quality data. I tried it and you'll *consistently* run across wild candles. You simply can't use it for anything non-trivial.
is fundamental data quality Okay?, I've seen many situations where the data is parsed improperly and I wonder what it's like with simfin.
Nice, that is mostly for futures trading, correct?
Thanks sharing! That must be some high quality data there
Of course! :) the list keeps growing and im glad to find new options and data providers. I would love to have an measure for which data is conisdered to be high quality but this seems to be rather difficult
Maybe the Interactive Brokers API can provide a lot on that end? Not sure if its free though.

https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ib-api.php
Little update on this - it seems more inconsistent than I thought.

At one point (about 12-6 months ago), I had been downloading historical data for ES and NQ every week for the market replay function.

Yesterday, went back to export NQ - let me load 1s data back to about June 18th, 2023 without a problem as normal. No idea why I can't load older data.

Then tried to load ES 1s data; could let me look back more than 12 months.

I'm guessing there's some kind of local cache going on, although I thought mine had been wiped.

Still, its worth taking a look - you can probably get a large chunk of data for free no matter what's actually going on.

Also worth mentioning - Databento offers $125 in free credits. With those, I was able to pick up about 2 years of 1s data for NQ for free.
What is your opinion on the quality of the data that is provided by through this approach? I think I remember there where ways to do the same with Prop Trading accounts on MetaTrader5 for manually exporting into a cvs file for all the data one could load into the screen or so.
Never heard of it but also interested in this. It looks like Option Alpha is for free if connected to TradeStation or Tradier Brokerage.
DataBento joins the chat, awesome üôå
I need to add a credit card to create a free account to view sample data. Nahhhhh.
Thanks :)
This looks like it mainly provides crypto data across all exchanges? That is actually a really impressive feat... Too bad the commercial financial markets are not capable to supply this in such an easy to retrieve manner. Unbelievable. That shows that if you really want to things can get done.
Fixed :)
Good point, that's nice they provide options chains like that
They are so fragmented into different data types, markets, prices, and business models that it's hard to do that but there is certainly a trend where some of them provide more free data compared to others. Other than price it would make sense to sort them according to how 'easy' it is to get the data and how long it takes and whether things work out of the box. If for example it takes me 10mins to set up a pipeline to download data or call a python library then I would gladly pay a little more then having to setup code to fetch data from the api and make sure not packets get lost etc.
Thanks for sharing :)
Are you looking for quality, cheap, or easily accessible data? With gui or via scripting? There are many approaches here
Very cool, Thanks for sharing, although Im not sure I would call them reasonably priced... At least not compared to the above data providers. Are you comparing them to other even more expensive data providers?
I'm having a hard time finding pricing information online. Do you know how much they charge?
Thanks for mentioning Bloomberg, will have to check them out. If intraday data is lacking then that means they only provide end-of-day data? These days end-of day data is most readily available for free, so not sure it is worth to pay for that.
Added :)
Thanks for sharing this with us! :)
Don't pay them!! RUN!! I made the mistake to use the $9.99 because I wanted intraday data. Big mistake because I could only get 15 min data and it lacked integrity. After that I chose not to use it again but there are still try charge me for the second month, claiming I was supposed to notify them 30 days prior that I wanted to cancel the monthly subscription.
Interested in this as well if anyone has any recommendations
So far I've been using Alpha Vantage but their sentiment only goes back to 2022.
Well, good that there is a summary of resources not too far away :D
Do you scrape Benzinga or use their official API?
Lets me check them out!
Wow that is really disturbung... Thats simply really bad... I think someonebelse raised concerns on that end as well
Oh wow, this is really cool, is reasonably priced, and has a ton of interesting endpoints other than just candlestick data. Very cool, thanks for sharing!
That's a good point, I guess the Cloud Research option on QuantConnect allows to do Data Analysis on historical data. That is pretty cool. I was not aware of that. Thanks for sharing!
Reallt cool work TickStory that is!
Damn... I hate when they do that? How long is your subscription running now?
... the streets of New York?
Seems like I need to chat with IQFeed customer service to receive quotes for their product. Is it expensive?
Yeah you have to open up an account with them. I used them for daily OHLCV. I‚Äôm on mobile right now so this is just based on memory but the parameters you pass in to get the historical data I believe have a spot for period and frequency. They acquired TDAmeritrade recently and basically brought their API over to Schwab with some slight modifications. You have to make a developer account with Schwab (separate from your trading account) in order to view the API documentation. But if you wanted to get a feel for what the API is like, the TD Ameritrade docs are still up for now. 

https://apiforums.tdameritrade.com/price-history/apis/get/marketdata/%7Bsymbol%7D/pricehistory

And here is the link to Schwab‚Äôs api

https://developer.schwab.com

To answer your other questions, I‚Äôve never tried to get the level II data. I‚Äôve heard you used to be able to on TD Ameritrade but I haven‚Äôt needed it with my strategies. Option data should be supported.
Databento has fantastic Python support, both for live and historic data. Supports other languages too. It's totally worth the money. They usually offer $150 of credits for new accounts, which if you use for 1-minute or slower OHLC will allow you to kick the tires sufficiently.

Firstratedata provides csv download. It's about a 100 lines of code to automate the process.

CSI data doesn't have a reasonable API, but they provide a windows app to download the data (into csvs). One can automate it to some degree.

From my experience, all these data sources are of high quality.
Think it depends on the data you're after, if you select the basic stock bundle and ohlcv daily or even 1m it looks pretty low cost, and the fact it has delisted stocks is a massive plus, for me anyway. Will post back when I've got it and see what it's like.
Yeah it's pretty much the gold standard now used by a bunch of well known systematic traders.

Eg Cesar Alvarez, Nick Radge, Andreas Clenow, Marsten Parker.

The guy who runs it is a super friendly guy too, always happy to chat on discord or forums to help with any data questions.

I use RealTest with it to trade from it, and test of course. Integration is seamless and all the included systems that come with the software work with it out of the box.
Yes go tools->export task manager and it can create CSVs
>What's the point of an algo for longer timeframes?¬†

You said the inverse of the answer in your last sentence - "buy and hold". The point is because systematic trading using daily or weekly bars outperforms buy and hold. Even using monthly bars outperforms buy and hold. In particular, it can avoid the big drawdowns that buy and hold gives you.

If your interested for real, I'll post some backtests of my momentum and trend systems just let me know.

Also for longer timeframes, it doesn't have to be THAT long - I trade a weekly swing that buys on Monday sells on Friday which uses weekly bars. You can even day trade using daily bars (buy or short on open, sell with MOC order). Or you can do something in between.

Algo doesn't care about timeframe, but retail commission costs and slippage does.
No, I don't have access to tick data, hopefully that one is ok, I would assume realtime data is also ok since it should come directly from the SIP. The most concerning thing to me that I've found so far is in the stock splits, which for a few stocks are not correct, and then the entire adjusted ohlcv aggregate is computed in the wrong way because of it. It's just a lot of data sanity checks and debugging that I have to do to make sure something isn't majorly off with historical candles, and you'd expect they would do it for you in the first place. I briefly looked at the dividend data and it looks like there might be some issues there too, although that's less important to me. I can't speak for their realtime offerings or for other products, they seem ok at first glance. Nobody is perfect, but I'm gonna try other options for historical data (did not find the same errors with the splits with FMP for instance)
Happy journey bro!
Do they have ES historical OHLC? Since when?
Does DataBento end up being pricey for you? 

  
Edit: I do like the price estimate calculator they provide. That's a nice heads up for expected costs, especially across different timeframes etc
I use it for stocks
It is free up to 1minute candies, for exchanges in your own country. Pay extra for other exchanges.
It seems just about accurate to the CME feed I see on TradingView; I haven't noticed any major discrepancies. I definitely find it satisfactory and usable for generating data for live trading, particularly for the price point (free).

The trade entry/stop/take profits of trade generated by the system, based on candle patterns (so extremely sensitive to any invalid OHLC data), have matched up with what I'd expect from the TV CME chart in tested cases (haven't tested 100% of cases).

Sometimes, there's a missing bar; since it's a 1s timeframe 1s, I just fill it in using the previous bar's data. Not 100% accurate but good enough.

Theoretically, that filling-in could introduce an unreliable piece of data once in a while if that was some enormous 1s bar that's missing... but that's quite rare. Usually any missing data is during electronic trading / slow hours.

Convenience factor is nice too; can load up around 60-90 days or so of 1s data in one screen, enable the strategy, a few seconds later its done spitting out the the CSV file (doesn't only export what's visible). (Way better than what I used to do with manually exporting chart data from TradingView - only what fits on a screen - that took forever to get 1s data for a long time range and was very error-prone).

Main limitation is I can't seem to get it to show me 1s data past about a year, which means my backtests are very limited. You might be able to see back a lot further if you were using, say, 1m bars.   
  
(If anyone knows where to find older 1s data, let me know pleeease!)
‚ù§Ô∏è
Sample data is actually available on the dataset detail pages without signup.

The instrument-specific detail pages have the old signup wall and that‚Äôs an artifact of the past when we didn‚Äôt have any signup button on our homepage so we had to put it somewhere. We didn‚Äôt bother removing this wall because it‚Äôs being removed with the next refactor of our site - you can even disable it from the browser actually.

Regardless, signup is free in spite of card info. We did give much thought to how we can avoid asking for card info upfront, but (a) deferring that means we have to design a much more complex UI because the user portal will need many additional states, like a user that doesn‚Äôt have payment info and tries to pay exchange license fees and (b) having no card requirement makes it easy for fraudulent users to create many burner accounts and from what we‚Äôve seen, those users indiscriminately hammer the API and make the experience worse for our legitimate users.

It may not be for you now but I hope you‚Äôll give us a try some day!
In hindsight, you might be right. I used them for futures and I only had specific needs, like VIX every half hour or EOD. To get that at firstrate data, it's $100. Additionally you would only get VIX but you get 1-minute, 5-minute, 30-minute, 1-hour, and 1-day timeframes. At kibot It'd be $100 but you get 30m timeframe continuous contract for all Futures.
Case by case, use internal, maybe it would be okay to scrape
[https://data.nasdaq.com/search](https://data.nasdaq.com/search)
Yeah for sure. I think it‚Äôs the best financial data resource.
Polygon is best value for money. Idk any cheap futures data. My best recommendation is to go for crypto. The traditional market is way too competitive for retail traders in directional stock trading
Thanks! :) It looks like 1min candles are supported but no ticks, at least not on that endpoint. Should do a deeper dive into that Api, its free data after all. Im curious to see how far back ond can go on these tickers etc
Back in the day think or swim was one of the early movers in publishing an api for stock and option investors. That was quite a while ago, but they used to make l2 data available. I just started looking at my Schwab account again and decided to start using it again.
Thanks for sharing, the python support is great, I need to check if this is a library or API interface
Thanks for sharing this so much. Thats a great resource to have!  From what I was reading you are placing the trades manually, is this correct?
I should have said buy and hold an index fund.  It seems commonly held that index funds outperform stock picking or trying to time the market.  And even if you eek out an advantage over the S&P, you lose out on tax advantages of long term holds.  If that's wrong I'd love to see/hear how.
Thank you! I'll keep an eye out for that :) If you happen to remember any stock where you found an error, then please let me know. I could look into it also. Maybe they've corrected it since then, but just in case they haven't...

I'll also be a bit more critical of the data
Thank you! :) at the moment i am pretty much at an explorative stage and im just looking to explore and understand a little bit more of how things work and operate. For some reason i have this feeling that inddicator based data analysis is probably not the way to go but what else should we do with all this available data ü´†
We have ES historical OHLC since 2017 at the moment.

We're also about to extend this back to 2010 as per [this feature ticket](https://roadmap.databento.com/b/n0o5prm6/feature-ideas/backfill-cme-globex-data-to-jan-2009)‚Äîbut the additional history will only be available to enterprise users.
If you use python and the tools Bento offers, you only really need to download specifically the options/times/frequencies you need.  I.e. No need to pay for high detail records of an option that is 200 points OTM for 0 DTE for instance.   
At any rate, I second Bento and their support team is great.
Also the blokes on their support are very switched on and helpful. I‚Äôve had issues with their API in the past and they were able to send me some tailored python code to fix my issues.
Yeah the calculator is helpful, I believe you also get like a $125 credit on opening an account which covers a lot of data
Update on this:

TL;DR: Ninja data on 1s timeframes (at least) seems inconsistent with itself at times, and very inconsistent with Databento.

Recently grabbed some 1s data from Databento.

It disagrees, quite significantly, with NinjaTrader.

I'm not sure which one is the "correct" one, but I'd lean toward Databento being the correct one (if anyone knows otherwise, let me know!)

Almost every 1s candle, when comparing Databento's data with Ninjatrader's, is off by at least a tick on the open, high, low, or close.

In most cases, it's off by a couple of ticks on a couple of the properties.

In some cases, it's off by over a handle.

This may or may not be too significant if you're testing a strategy on, say, a 5m chart.

I'm testing scalping strategies on a 1s chart where every tick is incredibly important (stops and take profits are often within a few handles of each other), so won't be using NinjaTrader anymore.

Also encountered issues recently with NinjaTrader reporting different values for the same segment of time. After hitting "Reload historical data" on the chart, I'll end up with different values. Not always, but sometimes, and not sure why.

Volume also doesn't match.

Not sure if this affects real-time data or not, although I don't trade with Ninja anymore since I noticed some significant lags and differences in the feed it displays vs. TradingView at times.

From what I can tell, Databento is using Globex as its source, and so is Ninja's historical data, so I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy.

It's only about $5 to download a month's worth of 1s OHLC-V data for NQ from Databento, so that seems like a safer and more affordable option.
Thanks for sharing, added!
Here's the docs to one of the wrappers for the Schwab API.  Doesn't look like it has tick data unfortunately.  [https://schwab-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#price-history](https://schwab-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#price-history)
No, realtest generates the orders for me (I still need to push the button though, and it's end of day or pre-open). 

Marsten provides an app called OrderClerk that integrates between RealTest and IBKR, so when you run your strategy in RealTest it knows what positions you have already. Then it works well to generate closing orders for long term things like trend following strategies.

For short term mean reversion, I have it place MOC or LOC orders with "good after" times up front for the Friday for eg a weekly strategy.

It can also do IBKR Basket trader, or a CSV based on that.

Seamless if IBKR, otherwise you might need your own API to read the CSVs to your broker.

Honestly I had no idea about the order capability, the naming as "RealTest" really threw me off and I initially tried Sierra chart. Thankfully I came around and tried RealTest it's so easy now.
>I should have said buy and hold an index fund.

Sure, but that's what I assumed you meant in the first post.

Systematic trading outperforms it, even taking into account slippage, and commissions. Taxes are individual, but one can use a tax efficient account if it's a long term strategy.

Here's two examples, run on two universes (Australian stock market, and then the Russell 1000). 

This was one of the worst periods in the test for the Russell by the way, the long term result of the system 1993 to 2024 is around 17.8% for the Russell stocks, and 27% on the ASX. But shorter term tests are easier to visualise.

Notice the bear market periods the system goes flat.

The test doesn't take into account what you do with cash during bear years, if you buy gold or bonds, then you can ad a few more percent on top of that. Or you can earn interestd.

I plan to add rotational aspects for bear markets so that I do add a mix of gold or bonds, just need more time to work on things.

Higher priority is to finish all my systems so that they overlap well and don't correlate too much.

That‚Äôs a question for you to answer based on your trading style. There is no one way to do EDA. You can find pattern, anomalies, you can analyze it as a strictly time series data, check correlations, order book, market profile and the list goes on.
Ah, I see, thanks for bringing this up. This makes sense.
Hey u/TPCharts, given the frequency of mismatch you‚Äôve described, it sounds to me that the issue you‚Äôve described is likely that there‚Äôs some kind of continuous contract roll adjustment being applied on NT‚Äôs data. We don‚Äôt ever apply roll adjustments to our data.

Another type of issue that may arise is that we extract our data from MBO, which is technically more accurate treatment of book depth for signal calculation and leaves the implied depth calculation to the client side, whereas we find that NT (CQG?) uses MBP which includes the implied depth. This, however, only affects apparent book depth at top 2 levels and shouldn‚Äôt affect trade prints that affect OHLCV.

One other type of mismatch you may come across, not present here, is that many vendors don‚Äôt calculate the daily OHLCV from tick data, which differs from the official settlement OHLCV published by CME which has a manual element to it and differs from the pricing and volume on the tick data. We publish both, and the official settlement values are in the statistics schema instead of the OHLCV schema.

One last possibility I can think of is to check if NT prints their OHLCVs with highest bid or lowest ask when no trade occurs. Some feeds do that. We only use the trades strictly for consistency.

Otherwise yes, our feed is just constructed from CME‚Äôs raw multicast feed, which is the ultimate source of truth, and we publish the sequence number so you can see that we didn‚Äôt lose any packets. You can further cross-check that our tick data and MBO data has consistency with our 1s OHLCVs.
Thanks!  I'll investigate this more.  Do you run all of your long term investments this way or still do some traditional buy and hold?  Any general details on the strategy you can share?
Wow, thank you for the detailed explanation! I appreciate it üëç
You‚Äôre very welcome. Thanks for being a customer!
6 figure club babyyyyy
4th job in 6 years, never did public cause FUCK THAT SHIT. Looking at the newest 100k paid ASS. controller. Gonna fully remotely CONTROL THAT ASS. 
Congrats on becoming a remote controller!
Congratulations! Have fun controlling that ass
heck yea brudder
Welcome to the club of 'my title is misleading'.
[deleted]
The amount of people calling 100k shit money is crazy. Acting like that's the average US salary or some shit
Damn I'm an ASS. controller, but only making $95k and not fully remote.  Good for you!
Please don‚Äôt be shy. Tell us your story about how you arrived there lol
Amazing

Can't wait for the eventual - I made a mistake, this is a nightmare job post
can i ask what positions you held on the way to this one?
Superb work!
Fuck public accounting lets gooooo
Premium work!
Wonderful effort!
Y‚Äôall kill me. Congrats OP on hitting 100k. I just started my first 6 figure job as an accounting manager after 20 years in the field. Mostly because I really didn‚Äôt want to be a manager. But around me, companies aren‚Äôt handing out 6 figure salaries to non management roles. And honestly they probably would‚Äôve offered less, but I told them bluntly I would not leave a job I like to be an underpaid manager.
Fantastic work!
$100k? Your remote controller ass better be living in India or the Philippines.
This is a gem!
I‚Äôm guessing a small company?
Fuck yea! Awesome work! ü•≥ü•≥
I remember when 100K was alot of money.  2000's making six figures you could live high. now you barely qualify for a mortgage.
Remember to automate your savings and live like you make 60k. Source; lived like I was making 200k when I first made 100k.
Is anyone gonna tell him about the inflation thing or what starting salaries are these days
Prime quality!
Who is gonna tell this guy that 100k is the new 70k üòÇ
Congrats!!
Nice job üëè
Congrats
Congratulations man!!!
a Deep Johnson sounds great!
Dream come true!
I love this post! Thank you and congrats on hitting that six figure mark! Wooo!
Congrats
Took me 6 yrs to get to six too. Started in non-profit, no public experience either. $100K is senior accountant range these days though. I hope you don‚Äôt have to manage people.
Congrats!!!!
BOHICA.
Congrats. 

Im also making the move to controller next week. 

Not remote, but I couldn‚Äôt turn down a 50% pay bump before bonus.

8 YOE, 6 in industry. Left EY as an A2 and never looked back.
Nice lol
Congratulations!  I get really happy when I hear accoutants win since most times we are overlooked.



I hope you enjoy and prosper in your new found Controller position, my friend.  üòä



I am hoping to leave the Controller job for a government job if I get hired.  I prefer the flexibility and work/life balance.
I'm genuinely happy for you, you reddit stranger. Congratulations, buddy!
Congrats
Took me a few moves to make 6 figures too
No public
Got a cma though

Started as a bookkeeper and hopped jobs every 3~ years
Hopped cause the businesses were going to fail or close so I wanted out before that happened
Congrats, looking forward to this moment.
I'll hopefully be joining you in October. Let's go!
Congratulations!!!
lol congrats!
whatever you do, dont put a fan behind it. if it hits the fan, its gonna be a real mess.
Congrats!!! üéä
Save some ass for the rest of us
Whole lotta ass, whole lotta control

Good shit but I made 6 figures 1.5 years into my career.
nice ass bro
I miss my Ass controller role ‚òπÔ∏è I think they took it away because my signature said Ass. Regional Controller
Congrats. You should probably stick with this one for a minute
Congrats! I‚Äôm two years in and got lucky an assistance controller position, although I‚Äôm not remote üòÇ. Also never did public haha!
4 jobs in 6 years? Here I am on my 3rd job in 8 years, and the HR screener called me a job hopper.
Congratulations üíêüéä
Crazy thing is, club membership is arbitrary.  You can get kicked out at any moment.
Congratulations,  a few more years, and you should be making master plumber money.
Me too, 3rd job after 2 years in public. 95k plus my rental income.
What the fuck is OP saying in English?
Yeah, hiring and firing and controlling people, not my thing.
Very high standard work!
Prime quality work!
Great job!
Great effort!
Good shit bro. I graduate next year and want to work remote in accounting. How did you do it?
I was being paid 225k as a non CPA controller in a southern US state with a low cost of living.
Congratulations!!!! Welcome to the club!
Underpaid bro. Tell them pussies to pay you more or start half assing your job. 

No asst controller should be making $100k. Do you know how much that is?  Lol
Lol 100k controller = accounts payable manager
Certified p**sy annihilator?
Don‚Äôt let these losers that barely make above 100K shit on you.. congrats guys! Working 80 hours week in public for a bit more pay than industry.  Congrats on the new job OP, don‚Äôt listen to these arrogant morons.
100k isnt an achievement anymore but kudos for job hopping and making more. wish everyone would do this so more roles open up for everyone else and employers have less negotiating power since they become desperate if accountants are selective about pay, wfh, etc
That‚Äôs amazing, congrats (presumably) brah
Wow that‚Äôs awesome, congrats. (Sssh no one tell him that most senior roles pay over $100k now)

100k is the new 62k

Why yes, I AM the Vice President for Inside, West-Coast, Enterprise Accounting.
I‚Äôm a VP of my department of 1 person - for some
Reason I‚Äôm second to someone who doesn‚Äôt exist

But I‚Äôm remote so winning!
Ass to the remote controller?
For real. I just took my first accounting job a couple months ago making 52k. I was making 35k previously. I‚Äôm happy as shit. 

I cant imagine doubling it and pretending like it‚Äôs not a lot of money.
[The median weekly earnings of a US worker as of Q1 2024 was $1,139. For a total of $59,228 yearly salary.](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf)

Sure I guess $100k could be eaten up pretty quickly if you have multiple kids and such. But still, the average US household is only like $75,000 or something still. Which I cannot imagine trying to have kids on that income at all. 

Wild honestly that the $100k mark, while still good money, doesn't feel like it goes that far anymore.
The term 6 figures was coined in the 80‚Äôs. $100k in the mid 80‚Äôs is equal to about $300k today. About $200k if you‚Äôre looking at the mid 90‚Äôs.

Ive always had a job where I can see other people‚Äôs salaries whether internal or external. 100k is pretty low to average for white collar work. I‚Äôd expect you to be within the first 5-10 years of your career at most if you‚Äôre making under $100k unless you‚Äôre maybe in a LCOL area.
I was barely breaking even in life at my first salary of $50k and still watching my bank balance slowly go down with each unexpected car repair/surprise cost. And this was with my wife covering groceries. 

I was finally comfortable and saving and still having fun at about $77k. Every salary increase since then has been nice and I've been able to save for retirement more aggressively but I haven't felt a crazy lifestyle shift like that first bump.
Yeah comparison really is the thief of joy for some people. I just hit 6 figures and started originally at 40k a year. It's a life changing difference.
Agreed but given public accounting salaries, it‚Äôs lower than where most people who went the public route are 6 years in. Most in this sub went that route initially (even if in industry now) so don‚Äôt have the context of working actual low paying jobs.
Please @ me when he did s
He went from ass holder to ass controller.
power bottom
Depends on the company. At a lot of companies, the controller is just a glorified senior account with 1 or 2 staff below you.
I mean... who cares as long as their salary is increasing faster than inflation? 

6 years to $100k if not doing public isn't bad at all.  Good for you OP
Google the average US salary
[deleted]
Wow do you mean controllers usually get more than 100k salary?
It's still better than getting paid 70K today.
It‚Äôs not 100k today is more like 85k pre-Covid. But sure I guess. lol this sub kills me.
Lol I'm in Canada and $200k is the new $100k. Even at $200k you need a dual income to buy a house in a high cost city, which is basically every major city in the country now. Vancouver or Toronto you'd still be mortgage broke with a family income of $300k.

Hope this guys honeymoon with $100k lasts a few months longer before he burns out and goes back to his rental to cry.
Wow! What was your industry job when you left EY as an A2?
Probably, but it depends on location and industry.
Probably not a real assistant controller and title inflation involved. Likely job responsibilities are akin to an accounting manager working at a small company in a lower COL region.
Or $27k if you adjust for inflation based off of a random date in the past.
hating for no reason
Sorry, did I miss the part where he specified whether he lives in NYC or a 500 population town in Nebraska?

No idea how you‚Äôre gauging whether or not his wage is competitive for his area with no knowledge of which market he‚Äôs in.
sorry, buddy.. your dad is still out there buying cigarettes.
A local sign shop has Office of Ass. Manager on their bathroom door. I laugh every time.

Based on the company and my experience as an ass controller, you actually do everything while your boss takes credit for
Can confirm that my Controller also has very little control
Overpowered
What does OP mean? :(
Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming
I‚Äôve never been so hyped as to type ‚ÄúREMOTELLY CONTROL THAT ASS‚Äù. I mean I‚Äôve been at the level, but that phrase never even came close to something I thought of typing. That‚Äôs like 30 characters too, that‚Äôs like 32 opportunities to hit the back button‚Ä¶ pop off king
Add a couple kids in the mix and money vanishes
Yup, I made 50K right out of college, was super happy and kept that mindset for 4ish years. Now I am 31, married, homeowner, about to have a kid with a quarter million saved up. 

People don‚Äôt want to admit there are 2 sides to the ‚Äòmy income isn‚Äôt high enough‚Äô equation. Which is silly since a lot of us here look at revenues and expenses daily.
Lol. Give it six months and the reality will hit that they‚Äôre fucking all of us over
Agreed but people have to realize they have it better than a lot of people. I'm at 120 and am grateful I get to live somewhat comfortably while the majority of people struggle in this shitty economy
Ass-istant to the ass controller
Started from the bottom now we here.
Can confirm. Was "controller" for 5 years making shit pay (started at 90, finished at 110k, bonus was another 15-20%) but it was so goddamn easy, especially after covid. I played video games all day. Finally got off my ass and go a job with some actually responsibility for $145k + bonus.
Plus OP can get the controller experience and then apply later for a bigger company and make a lot more down the road for a controller position
And there will be people making 100 k 3 years in, 2 years in and 1 year in (albeit maybe not the same job or progression but never the less -> ) Relax the flex
Real controllers, yes. Title inflated controller that is really just an accounting manager in a lower COL region will make $100k.
The one at the company I just audited makes $147k with around a $10k bonus.
Some people are never happy
I‚Äôve moved around a bit. SOX > FinRep > GL. 

Started as a staff IA auditor, and now im hitting Sr Mgr pay ($155k base) with the controller role.
Aint that the truth

Damn it, Donaghy, you're a genius!
For sure. We have one due in a couple weeks. But if I doubled my current salary we‚Äôd be doing pretty well and probably bring home 10k a month together. 

That‚Äôs the eventual goal
You don't even need kids. Throw a house into the mix and the money is gone.
So true.
And the younger folks, by and large, don‚Äôt have experience being the primary earner in their household which just compounds the stress (my significant other losing their job right before I started my staff 1 year with a very lean savings backstop and a situation that was contingent on 2 incomes really kept things interesting my Staff 1 year).

I‚Äôve been thinking about stepping away from public for a bit now, and the prospect terrifies me because I‚Äôm capping my raise potential for the next 4-5 years after my exit around 2-3% and my partner‚Äôs earning potential taps out around 65-70% of where I‚Äôm at right now which is fine, just compounds the stress a bit.

Like we need to be in the 170-195 range in our 30s to float the lifestyle (having a house in the city proper, being able to travel 2-3x/year, 20-25% retirement contributions, etc.), and knowing that I‚Äôd probably need to clear at least 125-130 of that range scares the shit out of me when I know I‚Äôm capping my upside vs public.

Maybe it‚Äôs worth 2 more years of feeling like I‚Äôm having to force myself to play along and slog through things for the long run, idk. It‚Äôs just hard when the expense side is fixed for all intents and purposes and the inbound side is probably going to have lackluster bumps this year/maybe next.
Lol at people saying the economy is shitty when unemploymemt is lower then ever and the snp 500 is making new highs literally daily¬†
He was also an ass-ociate along the way
Jeez.  What industry was this?  I‚Äôve been in automotive supply chain and there‚Äôs a lot going on for the controller

If you have a degree and work in accounting, you shouldn‚Äôt have to double your salary to bring in 10K each month (Gross, anyway).

My logic is that most starting salaries, even in L/MCOL should be around 50K. Unless your wife is only making 20Kish per year, then yes, your math checks out. But if she‚Äôs salaried making anything more than 35K, that means you‚Äôre making under 42.5K salaried, which is low for almost any degree needing accounting role.
Boomers need to stop trying to pressure me and my wife into buying a house. We both have healthy incomes and can have lots of fun and save for retirement aggressively. Buying an ok house in our area would send us right back to living paycheck to paycheck.
I think your last paragraph is key. That‚Äôs what the boomers and gen x have figured out and settled for. The younger generation (I‚Äôm 31, so I get it) has this idea of grandeur and rosy idea that they can work a real job for a couple of years to get a financial base, then they can quit that and do something they really enjoy for 60% of the pay for the rest of their lives.

I get it, that was me, too, that was all of my friends 7 years ago after graduation. That‚Äôs called being in your 20s. Then you get into it for a few years, tell yourself it isn‚Äôt that bad, get more responsibilities with a spouse and maybe children and you suck it up and do the job that you may not love. The 2 years of the slog you mention turns into ‚Äúmaybe 2 more‚Äù then ‚Äúmaybe 1 more.‚Äù

Stock with it, find a team or manager or company you enjoy and stick it out. Or be OK with cutting down your lifestyle and expenses. Traveling 2-3x per year is a great example because after graduation my wife and didn‚Äôt travel outside of work stuff for two or three years, that‚Äôs a luxury that you are baking into your ‚Äòneeded expenses.‚Äô
High inflation would result in new highs for the S&P 500. Unemployment is low but look at purchasing power. Houses are the most unaffordable they have been in decades and the cost of groceries have skyrocketed over the past few years. Food inflation has been 21.5% since 2021. Inflation in things like food and housing disproportionately affects the lower and middle class.

Yes!
Looking to net 10 a month, which according to most salary calculators requires about 167k gross. She currently makes 57, so I need to eventually make about 110.
And that's great if it works for you. A lot of people don't have landlords that treat people well and would raise their rent on the drop of a hat.
I love throwing away a mortgage payment as rent so that the land lord can pay their mortgage on the rental.
Houses are unaffordable for whom?¬† Teenagers?¬† I dont see that.¬† Prices are up but salaries arebas well, as they should be.¬† Sounda like excuses.
Unless you are spending your money on things you cannot afford ie luxury Veblen goods you should be fine if milk goes from $4 to $6
The real problem is there are a couple of generations who find it perfectly normal to spend 1k plus on a cell phone yearly and 300 on sneakers weekly and then complain about housing costs¬†
Exciting! Best wishes to you üíï
I'm gonna throw away money on a mortgage if the alternative is buying a house I can barely afford and ending up homeless when it needs some unexpected $50k repair inspectors didn't catch. The situation here in LA is just insane with low housing supply, real estate groups buying up the small supply, and even regulars buyers being groups with 3+ incomes who are pooling their money. There's homes selling for $900k which still need a bunch of work.
Cryptominers made $100,000 from mining at an Airbnb for three weeks ‚Äî the guests ran up a $1,500 electricity bill | Tom's Hardware
After the experience, the property owner, Ashley, took to her TikTok channel to explain ‚Äúthe weirdest Airbnb rule I had to implement as a host.‚Äù She said the guests left home perfectly clean and a ‚Äúfive-star‚Äù review after their three-week stay. The problem came later when she received the electric bill for the property.

The guests‚Äô electric bill amounted to $1,500 during their stay. Ashley checked the external security cameras for the property and watched the visitors haul out at least ten computers when they departed. They‚Äôd also set up a charging station for their electric vehicle.
There‚Äôs no way this is accurate
Calling bullshit on this story.
No need to rent an Airbnb and use their electricity if you can make $100k on $1.5k of electricity at home.
If y‚Äôall could tell me how to make $100k off $1.5k electricity, I‚Äôd appreciate it cause I‚Äôm gonna do that 10 times real quick
That seems like crazy high returns. I don‚Äôt buy it
How does she know how much they made?


All she has is the bill, not the profits.


Also, you don't make $100k from $1.5k mining.
Only 10 computers?  Bitmain S21 will make $8/day in bitcoin.  There are more efficient rigs out there, but $100k?  Pffft...in today's economics, you'd need 2300 PH/s-days of mining power.  $100k in three weeks!?  That's like 780 rigs of Bitmain S21...that residence can't provide that high of electricity requirements.
Yeah no chance
Seems like complete bs lol
100k is Bullshit. Probably 1k and 1.5k e-bill
That's a 98.5% profit margin even if they had paid for the electricity. This article is a lie.
source is trust me bro
Not possible
Garbage articles like this getting upvoted at all is why I am not here often anymore. This is pathetic
If they can make $100K from only $1500 of electricity why not just do it at home too?

  
If the figures are at all correct, I presume it wasn't BTC that was being mined.
Only $1,500 for $100,000? üòÇ sure.
Can‚Äôt turn $1500 into $100k. If they could they would just be doing it at home with those profit margins.
This is ridiculous! Making 100grand Bitcoin in three weeks using 10 computers and incuring only $1500 in electricity is simply an outlandish claim, if it's true then everyone will be doing it
Doesn't sound right at all

Noone mines at that efficiency any more

It would be worth just leaving them plugged in and paying even $90k at home in electricity to make $100k in 3 weeks
There's no way someone's making $100k on $1.5k worth of electricity

If this was accurate, they'd mine at home because their profit margin is so high
Lol, if they can earn $100k and spend only $1.5k on power, why da fuck they need additional costs with hiring Airbnb? They would just mine at home.
More likely they made $1000
100% fake and gay
I think it‚Äôs a bs story.
I think they just made a mistake and added 2 extra zeroes to that 100k lol.
Such cap
Not possible, fake news
![gif](giphy|OqAeQrGmU7lS6tENnQ)
I think someone may have found the solution to the US national debt problem.
Bullshit. If you believe this, you should stay away from crypto as you're a prime target to get scammed.
This is actually impossible
As an ex miner...


Bullshit.
What a load of shit. If you were making 100k a week from 1.5k of electricity you wouldn't fuck about moving those machines around air bnbs. Whiever fact checked this article is in cuckoo land
There's no way $1500 in electricity mined 100k in bitcoin. It didn't happen.
Is the airbnb a nuclear reactor lol!
There‚Äôs no way this is accurate
Not possible, but nice try ChatGPT!
Maybe they were a porn editing team, with a bunch of graphics workstations.
again? how stupid are these people to push this obv fake news? toms hardware, I'm disappointed
Part of me knows that this is fake. Part of me hopes it's true given the current housing situation in most of the US
Fake no way they could have made that much with a few computers
Can you really make money mining with a single computer setup at home these days?
If the tenants could make $100K in 3 weeks, what makes the Airbnb host think that they can't afford a $1500 electricity bill?
Damn didn‚Äôt realize quantum computing was available to the public already. Cuz that‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôre making 100k from 3 weeks of mining.
I dont feel sorry for any airbnb owner at all, they're leading scum practices
They probably just had an epic LAN party.
Were they also selling drugs? Because the math is way off here.
Absolutely not
Such bs
So fake
Someone missed a decimal point.  

That's 2.2BTC i bet they mined 0.022BTC
No way, click bait numbers.
Crazy profit.

The new meta just dropped.
Even a 1500 electric bill for 3 weeks is reasonable considering the house was probably 150/night on average the owner would still profit close to if not over 2k
Get fucked rent seeking parasite landlord cunts
Mustve been that lucky miner who did a whole block or something. 1.5k to 100k in 3 weeks‚Ä¶ Ashleys full of it
Where is the **comedy** tag bro?
Calm down boys the story is fake. Was just some nerds playing CS over Lan 3 weeks long.
is anyone hosting on Airbnb? im looking to book a staycation.
30k weekly. Are we mining the same thing
> They also revealed they‚Äôd made more than $100,000 mining cryptocurrency during that stay alone

My guess is these crypto guys were just trying to save face from their failed attempt to steal electricity.
What's the chances the miners faked the $100k to sell a course on crypto mining at Airbnbs
10 computers are now classed as crypto miners?! I‚Äôll take $5 for things that never happened
Bullish
Everyone runs masternodes pos is better than pow imo
I called it BS on this story before which was shared here and I'll say it again. Ain't know way the person made $100K in three weeks.
He should just mine crypto instead of run an Airbnb. Also the return aren't 100k it's dumb misinformation.
110% bullshit. Impossible. Not even with top of the line asics
If they could make 100k from 1.5k would they bother wirh shitty airbnb or just pay the bill. Probably they made 400 isd from 1.5k electricity
Call this absolute BS
It was more than likely they were just having a LAN party.
Talk about bullshit
According to nicehash 10x NVIDIA 4090 gpus would bring in about $50/week profit so do the math how far off they are lol
How did dear Ashley knew they made $100.000 ?
Smells like random numbers. But as 100,000 looks pretty cool, I get the idea. Attention > facts
[removed]
[removed]
There are infinity things to worry about already, imagine this being a surprise
Lol
Missing a good two decimal places in that electricity bill.
Since when is this sub just clickbait garbage?
with that price it was simply a 3 week gaming session... fake news
LOL
Seems highly inaccurate. Assuming a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù mining rig with 10 4090 and a few other GPU we‚Äôll be outputting around 10USD per day (according to whattomine dot com). 10USD time three weeks equals 210USD per rig. This times 10 rigs equals 2.100USD (which would be more accurate)

Looking into what she paid from electric fees (1.500USD) assuming 0,19USD per kWh they‚Äôll get more or less 2 times 1.500USD which is 3.000USD.

So from my high level estimations they mined between 2.100USD and 3.000USD which although is very short from 100.000USD still could turn a decent profit depending on the Airbnb price.
Probably hit and run serving scam/illegal internet sites at different places with different IPs. Good strategy lol.
Fake story!!!
Fakkkeeee
Just an excuse to squeeze more money out of people. Hosts are already charging $300-$1000 for $3-$90 worth of cleaning.
$100k USD??
This was back in Fall 2017 when Bitcoin went from 1k to 20k. Profits were insane. 

I had only had one mining rig of 6 Vega 64s and was making over .01 Bitcoin a day ($200+) on Nicehash. It only lasted a month, then went down from there.
>She‚Äôs since added ‚Äúno crypto-mining‚Äù and ‚Äúno electric vehicle charging‚Äù to her list of house rules for the property

That's a lame ass rule on EVs tho
That is pure marketing for Airbnb, a genius movement.

Hey Joe, we got a memo, need to increase reservations for the weekend by 4% asap, what about something with blockchain.

Ok, Mark, I get it. Free electricity for our guests so they can mine with some unrealistics profits. Send the news my booooooyyyyy.

lol if they were making 100k they wouldn‚Äôt be slurping other people‚Äôs electricity
100k in 3 weeks crypto mining? Is this from 2010 when bitcoin could still be mined with your random desktop PC?
Source: Fact checker Jeff Butts has been covering tech news for more than a decade, and his IT experience predates the internet. Yes, he remembers when 9600 baud was ‚Äúfast.‚Äù He especially enjoys covering DIY and Maker topics, along with anything on the bleeding edge of technology.
As a miner I call BS you'd be popping breakers left and right trying to run anything substantial out of residential wires.
$100k worth of BTC in 3 wks means they would have mined 1.5-2BTC in that 3weeks.

Only possible way is to get extremely lucky solo mining or in a very small private pool.
And now he is buying 10 computers to make 100k
They probably mined like $5000 worth of coin.
!balance
Rolled up and parked 6 tractor trailers full of miners in front of the place and ran an extension cord from the house
The fact that they had to steal $1500 in electricity tells me they aren't making anything near $100k. Also, how much does a 3 week short term rental cost? I'd assume less than the electricity or none of this makes sense.
**!faucet**¬†
That's hilarious, this is the best possible response to rent gouging
yeah they for sure made 1500$üòÇüòÇüòÇ probably more like 500 - 2000$ because if they could make so much they would mine at home
I didn‚Äôt know mining was still profitable.
100,000 Zimbabwean Dollar = 310.56 USD 

Could be true though!
[deleted]
Same ppl in here would believe a few pounds of weed is worth "Over $100,000"... SOMEONE IS PROPAGANDIZING YOU.
$100k in 3 weeks, yeah ok, what crypto is that so I can start mining as well
$100k in 3 weeks, yeah ok, what crypto is that so I can start mining as well
If true this is hilarious.  I personally hate Airbnb.  I think they ruined my chance of ever owning my own home.
!faucet
Even if for arguments sake they did rack up that high of an electricity bill, if they‚Äôre paying 400-500 a night (which doesn‚Äôt sound unreasonable for a small group) that‚Äôs 8400-10500 for that 3 week period. Still not like the host is losing money here.
Why didn‚Äôt I think of that?
Genius
We just ignoring the fact that they charged their EV too!  Thats like $5 on top of this exorbitant bill!
Cryptominers made $100,000 from mining at an Airbnb for three weeks ‚Äî the guests ran up a $1,500 electricity bill. Airbnb host makes a "no crypto-mining" rule, a rule you shouldn't have to make, but you do.
Guys had a Lan party and charged her car, end of story- she got mad because she got stuck with the bill. Plus a 3 week stay nets her already 2100 if it‚Äôs a cheap place- odds are- it‚Äôs not
This ad bought to you by antminer!
ü§£ü§£lolllll
If I could invest 100k right now and build the exact equipment they used and recoup imy costs in 3 weeks.

I'd have a 480V 3phase line dragged down into a random building and powering through my retirement fund in 12 months.

There's just no way, we all know that.
Mining what? Bitcoin, Eth, Zeta or?.... Don't want to rent an Airbnb without the facts.
Why wouldn‚Äôt they just stay home and do that?
Don‚Äôt look at my profile best crypto money maker
What if they paid the electricity bill? Then what?
What if it was just an extended Lan Party
Genius
Wouldn't a breaker trip?
Also, the amount of GPUs running nonstop to generate that kind of revenue would trip every circuit in the house.
That is 60x the energy costs. In reality it is about 2x if you have lastest most expensive miners
This is what happens when someone thinks he'll never need math again
More like they made 1000‚Ç¨ or even less on that 1500‚Ç¨. Thats why they use other peoples electricity....
Those were people from the 90s having a LAN party
Well that‚Äôs a good trade off how I do this at my home
It seems impossible!
$1500 electric for $100000 profit? Where do I sign up?
Ehhh she has a property on Airbnb, probably an asshole.
Zero chance this is accurate
I'm calling BS on this.
They probably made $1600.

But in reality they were already mining at home, and would have mined that at their own place, but by mining it on their vacation they saved $1500 in electricity.

Smart
No they didn‚Äôt.

The End.
I mean the least they could do is pay the electricity bill if they made 100k‚Ä¶
I have no sympathy for Airbnbs. Run the electricity up baby!
Sorry, this is bullshit. There is no need to steal power at 95x profit, more like they made $1600 mining with owners free electricity worth $1500
This is 100% fake they probably made $2000 tops
tldr; An Airbnb host implemented a "no crypto-mining" rule after guests left a $1,500 electricity bill from mining cryptocurrency during their three-week stay. The guests, who made over $100,000 from their mining activities, were seen hauling out at least ten computers and had set up an electric vehicle charging station. The host, Ashley, had to provide documentation to Airbnb and eventually got the guests to pay the bill. She has since added "no crypto-mining" and "no electric vehicle charging" to her house rules.

Perhaps they rent Airbnb's to hopefully skip paying electricity. Perhaps this is their profit game.

Oh no get fucked you parasites i hope you rot in hell. All land lords can suck a big fat one.

POW lives on

Ergo to Top10
10 computers and made 100k? Yeah fucking right lol

If each computer makes $10k in 3 weeks off of $150 of electricity there wouldn‚Äôt be a single person not doing it.
I can believe that someone came in and set up a bunch of mining rigs hoping to skip out on the electrical cost of mining

But how the fuck would she know how much they earned?
My best guess is they had a good old lan-party and just gamed the whole time with their friends.
It‚Äôs just her words she‚Äôs obviously lying to make a stronger case for being paid for the electricity, why would the renter / miner say that also, it‚Äôs definitely not possible
They probably did mine. The only inaccuracy is that bit about making 100k. Unless of course they mined a bit of btc, swapped into some meme coin and got extremely lucky.
How would any security camera figure out the address of a wallet, in order to determine the 100k figure?
Yes
Yeah. In my experience, the electricity bill for mining $100,990 crypto would be around $80,000-$105,099 depending on prices, difficulty, etc.
That's definitely an interesting point of view
Yeah I understand math and logic so I'm going to give this a 0% chance of being true
it's crypto related - of course it's inaccurate (and makes no sense and is useless)
Yeah how would they know how much they mined. Wouldn't they have to hit the jackpot as solo miners to get that much
Doesn't say Bitcoin per se. So maybe one of the coins are more rewarding now.
I would gladly pay 1500 in electricity bill to get 100,000
I just came here to say this.  There's no fucking way.
They maybe made 2k.¬† By not having to pay for electricity.....¬†
It's plausible, solo mine, hit a lucky block pretty quick. It's like 20% chance, so certainly within the realm of it can happen.
If people could just pay $1500 to make $100K, they would. No need to find tricks to avoid paying the $1500.
ChatGPT getting creative these days!
Still making the rounds, with no proof yet it seems
It's 100% bullshit. I've mined with ASICs and Eth rigs, you're not making $100k in a few weeks unless you're literally hitting Bitcoin blocks, and the chances of that are just about zero.

Airbnb rental wouldn't have enough juice to power a proper mining OP anyways, so these guys were probably just bringing in computers and running on nicehash or something stupid.

Just made up garbage for clicks and to make Crypto look bad as usual.
Mom can we mine bitcoin at an Airbnb?

> no we have electricity at home

> the electricity at home:

$0.55/KWh
Gaurantee you that dude only made like tree fifty

Step 1: become a crypto bro

Step 2: constantly lie on the internet about how you're perpetually cashing out 200,000 dollar investments (but it'll totally be real when you finally cash out)

Step 3: rock back and forth and cry as you watch your day-trading daydream disappear as another scam broker runs off with your internet dollars

Wait, I got sidetracked.
*‚ÄòYou see, all you need is to rent an Airbnb for 1 week.. miners hate this trick!‚Äô*
be really lucky. It can happen if you solo mine and was extremely lucky.
Buy $1m worth of equipment and get lucky
Got lucky with a block or 4 apparently
This article is trying to tell us that there are people who can make 100k every 3 weeks on auto without any effort, are goin around hauling a bunch of super expensive heavy duty computers from place to place (judging from all that computing power), while risking violating the law by causing other people mega energy bills, just to save 1.5% income on electricity ü§£ü§£ü§£

And Ashley the unsuspecting inn owner either pulled 100k out of thin air, or she casually tapped their data when they were on airBnB WiFi, as one does to unsuspecting customers, as theres 0 reason to reveal you just made a 100k. She might actually be thrown into jail before the other guys ü§£ü§£
You should mine it.
She saw the comments on r/cc saying 'Bitcoin to 100k EOY' and decided to throw out the 100k figure
Read the article maybe? Allegedly the guests themselves made that statement. 

> She provided documentation to Airbnb, and the guests admitted what they‚Äôd done during their stay. They also revealed they‚Äôd made more than $100,000 mining cryptocurrency during that stay alone
They're likely GPU mining something other than bitcoin, but there's no proof of work coin that can be mined with GPU that would produce this level of profit off 10 GPU rigs in that short time
"Add another 2 zeros, and we will print it" - editor who wants to sell more ad space on the article
You could just be mining not in a pool and gotten the whole block reward by chance
agreed, this $100k talking point of the story is bogus.   
not only would $1500 electric be a drop in the bucket   
but only 3 weeks is another variable tell this story is BS.  

it takes about 150,000kwh to mine a single $60K BTC    
a typical 100amp service house could ideally provide  
a quarter of that power in 3 weeks time, and nearly    
half that when you consider the HVAC need to keep   
those 10 computer rigs cool so they can operate at all.  
every number in this story makes no sense at all as  
a $1,500 electric bill would ideally only be 7,000kwh.

how would the home owner even know how much was mined,    
and this miner scamming "free" electricity would likely inflate    
all these numbers to social media brag for clickbait attention.
Right, this is a self-promotion piece on Tiktok from a parasite. As others have pointed out, the math ain't mathing, and none of this makes sense.

But it sure gets her some fame. And fame means views, and some of those views may convert to renters if they like what they saw.

Far too many folks have no shame, and society used to not tolerate that too well in order to keep it in check. People who craft these fake narratives should be run out of business. Instead, she'll get an army of flying monkeys defending her when she makes an inevitable cry video about nebulous "I'm being attacked" remarks.



Edit: it all makes a lot more sense after looking at her account. She is a wannabe influencer. She is filled to the brim with affiliate sales, MLM scams, and course/ebook selling for how to shill your own businesses online/be an AirBnB parasite, etc.. So more views even if driven by sensationalism -> more money. She isn't looking to necessarily drive business to her properties. She wants to sell courses or be a lifestyle influencer to sell products like anti-aging creams.

  
This world would be a lot better off if narcissists could actually feel a sense of shame.
the meth*
Yeah I ran the maths and the only way was if they got a couple of blocks rewards

No way they would have gotten this from a pool
They paid for the airbnb which included electricity.

You can‚Äôt mine ETH
Because electricity is included in the AirBNB price unless stated otherwise. I guess the owner is going to include that now in the contract.
It‚Äôs a bunch of BS
We found the bad tennants who trash your place.
It‚Äôs not accurate.  No way they made 100k in that short timeframe
AirBnB owner gets mad electricity bill ran up to $1,500, so AirBnB throws $100k figure to get people riled up for nothing. Fake news all around.
If they had a $1500 electric bill it was WAY more than 10 computers... even if they were dedicated bitmain miners, your talking like a small server farm to rack up that kind of electric bill...
I was thinking they could have got lucky and mined a bitcoin block, but that would be over $150k. There's some variance in mining pow coins.

After reading it though, just seems like a trash article. I wouldn't be surprised if it's completely fake.
Toms Hardware has turned into dogshit
Yea I'm def gonna need to see the receipts for 10 machines pulling six figures in a month on a rental property. You hit it on the head, if this was real, there would be MANY more people doing this
Miners don't even use 10 computers, a mining rig with 10 gpus would have been more compact and efficient.
I was going to say, could I do this but on a smaller scale instead of a job? :-)

I have not the first clue how to even start, but if anyone can learn then so can I.
>Ashley filed on Airbnb to make the tenants pay the electricity bill, which was a bit of a struggle. She provided documentation to Airbnb, and the guests admitted what they‚Äôd done during their stay. **They also revealed they‚Äôd made more than $100,000 mining cryptocurrency** during that stay alone, so don‚Äôt feel bad for them being forced to pay the $1,500 bill.

So yeah it's just the guests probably blowing up their gains. But it's not inconceivable that they both mined *and* traded during that 3 weeks, which if they knew what they're doing could easily be $100k.
95% chance it was a LAN party and the owner doesn't know what that even is.
On my way to wally world right now to buy ten computers.
We can't assume the writers know anything about mining, but even assuming the 10 computers were actually 10 Antminer AL1s or whatever ASIC it'd still be nowhere near $100k.
Boomer reporter maybe. They may have mined 100k of an unlisted s***coin, but not 100k USD
More like 10 server stacks.
Only way they could have made 100k in 3 weeks is if they were solo mining and one of the ten miners hit a block
Actually i saw this yesterday and ran the maths. If it was 10 bitmain ks5 pros with 21 TH/s and the power consumption of 3400W each it is actually not that much off. The power consumed equals 17,36 MW/h and they could have potentially mined 45 000 kaspa at current difficulty. The 100k comes from a fact that this probably happened a month or two before the article was posted when yield was much much higher, they could have mined literally 100k kaspa. Not a 100k worth of kaspa but a LOT
It doesn‚Äôt factor in the investment in the hardware.
At todays rates yeah 20k of equipment would be like 15-20 daily; if you're an experienced trader maybe 25-35.

during the pandemic i had about 4-5 computers and was earning 25-40$ daily while paying about 300-400 monthly.

these days same equipment makes 2.50-3.50 and costs more in electricty because of rising electric rates
I wouldn‚Äôt be so fast to call BS. Bitcoin block size is 3.25. If they abstained from mining pools and got very lucky and mined a block then they could make 150k from the 1500
I hear that..unless they are like 50,000$ computers
The fact it was also a perfect number in 100k also makes me think that the Airbnb host was just speaking out of her arse
According to the article, the miners made the claim
Read the actual article, she claims that is the number the renters gave her. Though it's definitely a lie on their part.
This used to happen a lot. Everyone has a clause about in their Airbnb agreement now, though.
And brought some massive loud speakers that sucked power
we could at least rule out they were using the same cameras that were in epstein's prison cell/block
It's an absolutely bullshit number.

The reward is currently 3.25 Bitcoins, so if they won the mining lottery, it would've been $200K, not $100k. No other blockchain has anywhere close to jackpot reward as high as $100k.

And if they used a mining pool, they couldn't have won a single jackpot reward.
BTC mining is based on chance when not mining in a large pool, so it is possible just not likely to get $100k out of $1500 USD of electricity.
Makes crypto look awesome when you can 67x your money in 3 weeks.
Shit, why not just 2010 and get the BTC drips and faucets and trade pizzas
But don‚Äôt forget to take an ASIC rig with you
"Get lucky" seems to suggest that this won't happen 99 out of 100 times so over a period of time this strategy won't be profitable
Maybe it's one of those old ASCI miners that make 30$ a day but -20$ in profit after you factor electricity.

Though the story does not add for me because normally regular residential homes don't have the wiring to handle 1500$ of electricity a month.
They're not even saving 1.5% because the Airbnb would have cost more than 1500 for 3 weeks. It would have been cheaper to do it at home.
That makes zero sense tho
Impossible unless they hit a block. Which is very very unlikely unless you have a warehouse full of the most recent miners. Even then they just mine in a pool
GPU mining has been dead since September 2022 when ethereum went PoS.  That $100k number is horse shit.
I don‚Äôt know how they could make $100k with $1500 worth of electricity. 

That‚Äôs a huge profit margin.
Makes no sense to haul all that equipment around, and pay an AirBnB rental fee to save $1500.00 at their own home.
Probably. If it made 100k then fill the place with miners and do it yourself lmao
Surely the numbers can't be right.

If that is the case the miner should just offer to pay double the electricity bill (3k), pocket home the remaining 97k profits and... just keep finding more Airbnbs to do the same thing lol

Miner happy, Airbnb happy!
How would the host even know how much money they made while mining?
Exactly, an article titled "Cryptominers made $647 from mining at an Airbnb for three weeks ‚Äî the guests ran up a $1,500 electricity bill" doesn't quite have the same click bait to it.
Airbnb has proven track record of doing the wrong thing.  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the did exaggerate this to get headlines.
Dead Internet Theory.
The 100K figure came from the tenants
Antminer power usage: \~800 W - 3,000+ W; Let's go with 1,500 W (pretty conservative)  
Cost of electricity: $0.14 / kWh  
Cost per hour: 1.5 \* $0.14 = $0.21 / hour  
Cost for 3 weeks = (3 \* 7 \* 24) \* $0.21 = $105.84  
x 10 rigs: $**1,058.40**

Edit: You posited "10 S21's" in another comment. Those are 3,500 W each, which would be $2,469.60 for 3 weeks.
Even a small server farm won‚Äôt generate $100k off $1500. If they could do that why steal power at all?? Most rigs in the US barely break even. This is why they go to third world countries. You can‚Äôt really reliably recoup the costs of equipment and electric at the same time. Not unless you save the bitcoin and it happens to go up dramatically in value and at that point you may as well just go buy bitcoin. The maths just off.
Not exactly, 21 days, $1500, let's ballpark a kwh cost of $0.25.

$1500/21=$71.5 per day,    
$71.50/$0.25kwh=286kwh/day,    
286/24hrs =12kwh/hr,    
12kwh/300watts=40 rtx 3090s,    
So 10 computers each running 4 3090 GPUs would consume $1500 in 21 days at a kwh cost of $0.25. We also havent accounted for other draw, the efficiency of the power supply, and whatever other electricity they used for other things.

I rigged 5 GPUs to a single gaming pc before with risers, so its doable.
If the electricity only costs $1500 to make $100k, why would they need an airbnb?
You absolutely can. Close your eyes and dream. That‚Äôs exactly how it‚Äôs done. I would add some unicorns.
No ones arguing you can trade 100k
They need to get their shit together then the URL is called ‚Äútomshardware‚Äù
[deleted]
No one said you can‚Äôt use $1500 in power. We said you can‚Äôt get $100k from $1500 in power.
Doesn‚Äôt need to. You cannot make that much off $150 in power. Sure you can make 100k in 3 weeks if you had 2-3m in hardware but your electric would be 10s of thousands
Why would you need to be an experienced trader to mine?
I think it might depend heavily on where you are located, backbone connectivity and how many miners are nearby ( in terms of network topology )
That's like saying you could make $100k per hour in your job if your job is to get lucky buying scratchcards.
No. No unless. I‚Äôd explain but it‚Äôs pointless.
Look at Mr literate here reading the article and shit.
My bad I skipped over it entirely, that number still seems insanely high vs the electric costs, they had to be just trying to brag or something right? 

I don't think there's anywhere in the world you'd get electric costs taking only 1.5% of profit
That's such an understatement, it borders on being just plain wrong.
It's technically impossible. Block subsidy reward is currently 3.25 Bitcoins or $200k. Even if they won the mining lottery, it couldn't have been anywhere close to $100k.

You can't win half of the reward. And mining pools don't work like a single jackpot lottery.
Nah just the GPU mining code and v1.0 software with drivers for the Gforce 580
I mean this story is likely BS (the 100K bit at least), but if getting lucky means making 100K at a cost of 1.5K, then on average without being lucky you could still easily make money, right...?


Plus, the "strategy" involves using someone else's electricity.
Old ASIC miners are worthless, after a year or so the difficulty level is so high that you need the newest model to make any impact on mining. I have some from 2014 that if I plugged them in would just burn electricity and have zero output due to being so old and out of date
Don't forget mining is luck based. Unlikely but easily possible.
Nicehash still has coins that return a profit for GPU miners (depending on your electric cost!). Unless we are throwing the entire article out as false, the renters had 10 consumer grade desktop computers which points to GPU mining

I agree the 100k number is bs
It's not really possible.  They could be lottery mining and got really lucky but the odds are really low.
Obviously it made sense to them
Yeah, if this were accurate the homeowner would immediately go buy 10 computers and passively make $100k per 3 week period and not complain even once.
Even with 10 full rigs, 100k is a HUGE strectch. A HUGE stretch.
What if: This Airbnb owner made this fake news to attract more crypto miners to stay at her place ??
The miners would probobly cost 30k each. Be lucky to break even in a few years and that before the current gen becomes outdated and is slow.
It can be theoretically correct, since mining is based on chance. As long as you are not mining in a pool, you have a very low chance to actually hit a block, but if you solve a block, you get the full block of 3.125 BTC at once. That would be 180k USD, so theoretically they could have mined in a very small pool.

Obviously the chance is small, but it's possible.
Wouldn't even need Airbnb if that's the case, just do it at home
Why not juat do it at home or at a rented space and just pay 1x bill price, not 2x + renting airbnb place..?
Just buy a place with the profits and set up and pay the power bill yourself. That way you don‚Äôt have to constantly relocate and have a real estate asset.
That‚Äôs why we know this is completely fake.
they can smell it
Bravo.
How many amps it that?
If it was really that profitable (close to a 100x return on electricity bill) my thinking is that surely everyone would become Bitcoin miners and we would have heard of these insane returns by now
I wasn't commenting on the amount, just the fact that you aren't drawing $1500/month on ten computers... even 10 S21's isn't going to get you an electric bill over 500 in 3 weeks in most places in the country... So if they were running an electric bill of $1500 in 3 weeks, they were running either something better than S21s, or way more than 10 computers...
Look at all the Einsteins pulling out the math that my degen ape brain can't copute on r/cc
Where are you getting $.25 per kWh? That seems really high. Here in the Midwest it‚Äôs like $.15
I mean most of the kwh costs in the country is \~$0.10 on average after considering off peak vs peak hours... for instance we pay $0.17 peak. but $0.03 off peak which averages out to roughly \~0.08... Now I know not all of the country does peak vs off peak electric billing, but I've never seen electric bills over $0.12 anywhere I've lived...
I wasn't commenting on the $100k just the $1500 bill...
They just like hauling pc's or rigs. :D
Unicorns with pretty wings! I can fly! Wooo....!

:-)
No just one. Each block right now is 3.125 btc plus fees so if you hit one you get around 180k. People have hit blocks solo mining with just one small miner. Agreed that the likelihood is low but it is a possibility
Edit: here is a link to an article about a solo miner hitting a block. https://www.theblock.co/amp/post/291351/bitcoin-solo-miner-full-block-reward
you'll make more money, its not needed, but its helpful to know about exchanges, market caps, candle sticks because crypto in general is volitle and 100$ today can easily turn into 10$ tommorow.

Also when picking what to mine you can go beyond just luck for picking; I've mined coins that have gone up 1000% only to go down 1200% within a few weeks, its better to not be holding bags and to know where to go next.
Pretty impossible. Why would they bother to rent an airbnb if it is 98.5% profit margin lol
Chances are very roughly 1.5% with the correct equipment and cheap energy. Might be much lower depending on energy cost.
Technically not impossible. They could be in a small pool with a friend where they both mine and share whenever one of them hits the jackpot. Same concept as a large mining pool, just two people instead of thousands/millions.
I know though I do wonder why don't they use them in artic bases or something instead of just electrical heaters. You will get at least something back for burning electricity for heat.
If they found a single block to themselves recently it would be worth like 180k. Even at the lows last year with the pre-halving block reward, it would have been over 150k. Ain't no way anyone made 100k mining to a pool with 10 devices.
Not sure how but nice hash wrecked my last gpu
And the miners could just give $1500 to the AirBNB owner so he stops complaining, or just do it at home and pay $1500 for electricity. Who cares about saving $1500 when making $100K?

Generally speaking, if you could pay $1500 to make $100K, everyone would be doing it and nobody would be complaining, I promise.
I think the reasonable explanation for that number is that they were also trading. 

Think they just sat in a room mining crypto staring at the wall? A decent trader could easily make 100K in 3 weeks depending on what they're mining and trading.
Not just a stretch. Total BS. Legit crypto mining operations aren't done in a house anymore lol they are done in data centers. Additionally data centers located in geographic locations with cheaper energy costs. 

There are outfits with thousands of high end ASIC devices. I played wow with a guy who worked for himself doing hardware failure analysis. IE big companies that want to know an exact reason for hardware failure. 

He's seen data centers with 10s of thousands of these units. Those devices are googleable and their sites predict how long to ROI. (Like 200 or so of their units died around the same time and they wanted to know why)

Bitmain i think is one of the larger providers of this hw. 

Even with 10 full bitmain bitcoin miner s21 pro you wouldn't make 100k in that amount of time.
10 rigs, with (8) 4090‚Äôs each would be (80) 4090‚Äôs.    Even if Ethereum was still mineable, and pretend 4090‚Äôs existed,  that would still put you nowhere remotely close to $100,000 even when Ether was near 5k.  Bitcoin 0% chance.

(207) 3080‚Äôs and 3090‚Äôs costed me about $4,000 USD per month in electricity.  Best single month I had was 40k but got lucky off a couple blocks.  That happened one time in 6+ years solo mining a ton of different POW coins lol.
Not when a single raspberry pi makes that one in ten trillion hit of mining a Bitcoin block as a solo miner!  Although of course that would be worth more than 100k.
As an electrician, even if this was possible with more rigs, you would be overloading hard on power I reckon.
Big mistake
100 full rigs is a stretch‚Ä¶ these machines make like $80 a day
"Stay at my miner friendly AirBNB, rates as low as $5000 per night, but you make $100k!"
May as well say whoever rented an airbnb or hotel and won the lottery made millions while dirtying the carpets
You still need the AirBNB to scale out of your home so you can use more computers

The ultimate computer Ponzi scheme !
And they wouldn‚Äôt even exist because the selling would bring down the price
Well it said they were charging cars also and I know charging teslas can cost like 30-40 so if you did that once a day that‚Äôs gonna be 600-700 alone in cars if you charged a full car per day. But that makes their 100k number even more BS
It's a middle ground,  i pay $0.10, my brother in California pays $0.40 /kwh

Deleted my post because you‚Äôre right. But still also wrong because if they hit a block solo they would have made 180k not 100k and I‚Äôm sure the article would sensationalize it.

Here‚Äôs an article about someone winning the lottery. https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2024/07/06/michigan-lottery-winning-ticket-fast-cash-lucky-7s-lansing/74316269007/#:~:text=A%2092%2Dyear%2Dold%20Lansing,according%20to%20the%20Michigan%20Lottery.
That‚Äôs not mining. I don‚Äôt know why I need to explain this. Article is about mining.
The only scenario that would make any amount sense to me is electricity rate tourism, if there was somewhere where electricity was extremely cheap.  Then they just mine and if they are asked to pay the electric bill they do.  Though that still wouldn't make the story plausible to me anyway.  It would be hard to believe household wiring could even support that much mining, among other issues.
This comment is nonsense. The chance of receiving a block reward is relative to the total hash rate a miner has access to, which is in turn relative to the total hash rate of the entire network.

There is never a static percentage chance of obtaining the block reward. It's constantly changing.
There are better ways of generating heat, those machines would generate less heat than a heater, since they're not made of heating elements, the heat generated is a by product of the mining. It would be like trying to cook or heat your house with nothing but lightbulbs
Who said they're mining BTC?
https://decrypt.co/123266/very-lucky-solo-miner-solves-bitcoin-block-for-148k-reward

Stranger things have happened
The most profitable coins to mine with gpu are kawpow algorithm.  It runs hot, fast, and high powered.  The reason it is valuable is because the defaults will destroy an OEM card quickly.  Kawpow needs extra coolant to combat the high compute heat.

Sorry for your loss.
Exactly. Why not do it at home and save having to lug computers around.
There are some that make 250 a day that cost about 50 k each and they will definitely use that much electricity maybe more.
If you're making that much, you would just buy more property to put more computers in and consider that an investment as well
More accurately, the increased computing power on the network would result in a difficulty adjustment to make it much less powerful per computing cycle.
A Tesla at home is around 6$, no? We pay 0.15 per kw
That IS mining. If you never sell what you mine then you are speculating.
At that point the bottleneck is not the amount of power you can draw, it's the fact that they apparently were using standard consumer grade computers, which can only mine at a slow pace. No matter how much energy you dump into those, they are still only just 10 regular computers mining. A whole data center full of supercomputers could utilize more power efficiently and mine faster. But you're right, household wiring could never support data center grade compute power.
That's why I said "very roughly". Very roughly it is true, because miners want to make profits. So if the hash rate is very high, miners will buy less new miners or even use existing ones less. If the hash rate is very low, miners will buy more new miners and push existing miners more to their limit. Over a longer period of time, hash rate is connected to Bitcoin price and energy cost.
What other proof of work coin would they mine with 100k profit?
Trading != mining
I literally don't know. But I wouldn't say it's impossible, just very lucky.
How do you pay for your expenses? You sell what you mine for money. Its not a nine to five working for someone else situation with pay stubs. You mine a coin you sell it to pay for food and shelter and the electrity it uses in most cases.
While I tend not to deal with absolutes, I do lean towards this being impossible with the current state of BTC mining, which is the only possible coin that could return anywhere near this amount upon hitting a block yourself. But that would require at least some hardware capable of mining BTC, which regular computers are not capable of doing anymore. CPU and GPU BTC mining are no longer possible by standard consumer grade computers. It requires data center grade compute power to mine BTC.

Even with 10 computers, the odds of hitting a block are so infinitely small as to be impossible on such a short timeline and with a sample group of only one such incident being reported.

Occams razor suggests the simplest explanation is often correct, and that is that the number is just inflated or made up.
You‚Äôre kinda rambling a lot. You just mine whatever is most profitable for the day then sell it. I don‚Äôt see why this is a discussion.
https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cryptomining/cryptominer-with-palm-sized-dollar179-asic-hits-the-jackpot-with-dollar206000-in-bitcoins

It's really not outside the realm of possibility.
Brace yourselves. People who think they can become millionaires with 1k investment are coming.
You feel it in the air. As soon as bitcoin reaches mainstream news due to high price, they are coming here. Newcomers, who have their first surplus after all the bills are paid and now think that crypto will go up 15% a week for another year or so.

"The math is easy! 15% a week for 52 weeks and my 1000 bucks will become almost 1,5 million!" A flawless conclusion after extrapolating the (very recent) data.

But this is only the fist stage! The second stage:

"I invested after bitcoin shoot up 15% and now I am down 10%! How could that be? It is over and I need to sell!" A sensible reaction after buying a volatile asset that was very overbought. But don't worry, they will be back next day after buying in again and losing a part of the initial investment for no reason.

Now comes the third stage:

"I did the math again and realized that I will become a millionaire much quicker if a invest in this new CumElonDoge coin that I see everywhere. It quadrupled in a day so I will buy today and will be a carefree person in less than a week!" A logical conclusion. Nothing with "Elon" in its name can go wrong! If you think otherwise, go fuck yourself!

If we are lucky, we could stop some of those people, but on the other hand... It is kinda fun seeing this level of idiocy but not being the idiot anymore. So maybe, sometimes, you could just say "you go man! chase your dreams!" and see what happens.
Those people are idiots‚Ä¶ You need to invest 2k.
The scary part is some people do become millionaires at stage 3. Mainly the shitruggers, but some people hit the lottery on a shitcoin.
OP was one of them in 2021. 3 years later he‚Äôs figured it all out and is making fun of the newcomers.
I turned $10,000 to $1000 in a couple of days, does that count?
Remember when it was a bear market (ya know, sooooo long ago) and we‚Äôd joke: The easiest way to become a millionaire in Crypto is to be a billionaire first.

Ahhh memories‚Ä¶
I just saw someone turn 2k to 180k this week. So theoretically, they could.
OP: "these idiots don't even realize Bitcoin will be worth millions someday"

Investor: "ok I'm going to invest $1k"

OP: "you idiot lol"
I'll be happy to turn $1k into $20k


....or just $2-$3k really
[deleted]
finally im 3 years in and it's my turn to look at the market from the other side of the table!
The days of anyone that doesn't already have decent wealth (tens of thousands of investable assets) becoming millionaires on BTC are gone.

Only way that's gonna happen is on alts. And it will happen but lots of luck lmao
1$ investment here! WHY CANT I BECOME A MILLIONAIRE??
I invested 10k and I'm a 100 dollar millionaire
Wait CumElonDoge is back?!!
Wtf are you talking about a year? Jito tripled yesterday. My $1000 will be a mil in a week.
From my high of $284k Dec 30, 2021 I went back to $93k exactly a year later. 

September 11 I was at $114k and hit $214k today.   One helluva 90 day swing. 

Feel like $1m is deserved for hanging on for dear life through all the volatility.
I wouldn't mind becoming a 100knaire. Life changing where I'm from.
Is this some sort of gate keeping?

Because someone doesnt have 100k to invest they cant dream and start investing?

Are you gate keeping because you started investing earlier and those after you are dumb?

What a post
In the last bullrun, you would have needed over $100K to make a million in Bitcoin.

That's after going all in right after hitting the bottom (good luck timing that), between $4k and $8K, averaging in at $6K.

And then somehow averaging out right at about $60K (good luck timing that).

Hardly anyone would be able to time that. 

Keep in mind, the rate of return is lower in each new bullrun. So you would likely need a lot more than $100K this time around, and again incredible luck. 

It's too late to hit the Bitcoin bottom.

You could still do something with alt coins who are still battered, but with the bigger upside there's a lot more risk.
I put 1700 in when BTC was at 17k.

I feel good lol. But I'm not delusional...I just noticeed that bitcoin has soared 3 times in the last decade and each time it did it fell ~80% before rebounding to insanely higher valuations.
The psychology of it is weird.

You look at all the coins that did this in 2017/2018 and it seems like it would have been really easy to do.

But if you chase it, your chances are actually minuscule.

Not sure how or why but it‚Äôs interesting.
If they bought BONK they can
The best I did in terms of percentage gains was turn $1k into $75k with shib. Gotta be ready to dump the memecoins
Had a friend tell me he was interested in investing and asked if I thought $100 was enough.
its not tax time yet
I can feel it, my bag is ready to leave
My tiny investment grew enough to pay for IVF treatment and my wife and I now have a daughter cause of it. She is worth more than millions, maybe like 6 or 7 million idk.
And that hit me right in the feels üòü
*The Nigerian Prince has entered chat...*
I can turn $500 into $5 with one easy step
Totally me.  "GlAd I bOuGhT BtC aT 16k" not mentioning they bought $20 worth.
Comedy flair yet we all know it's true.
I‚Äôm just trying to turn 75 dollars into 75k in business capital in a basket of smaller coins, yes that is my retirement plan and I am aware I am probably fucked. Just not any other hope at this point.
Actually you can! Just leverage x100, go to 10 bucks and then leverage again but this time x250. Rinse and repeat.
Good, let them pile on
84 years
I just dropped $100 on this moon token. You think I‚Äôll be able to payoff my mortgage in 1-2 months???
I want to at least become a thousanare
Those guys aren't due to show up until next year. They usually start popping up when a side chain does really well, there has already been something popular that has done north of a 100x. The really speculative stuff gets going. I mean you might not even really see a lot of them until 2025, it just depends on how front-loaded this cycle actually is
That used to be me. Yuck.

Blue chip coins give me peace of mind.
Hey, don't talk shit about my exit liquidity!
I for one welcome the new investors the bull run because they will be the ones buying my bags when I sell lol.
I honestly hate how old timers act all impatient towards newcomers, it's in our best interest for those people to invest in btc and have reasonable expectations. And if someone really really wants a chance to make his money go bigger faster you could always explain the concept of risk to them and then futures trading directly after.
are you really trying to gatekeep bitcoin? lmao how many coins do you have
The best were the folks with 25 different coins this last year investing $100 or so a week....

Yes.. your roughly $16 into each project a month I'd gonna pay off.
Oddly - there will be more millionaires created through crypto wealth than any other method existing today.
When Lambo
And yet, people do turn 1k into a million. Clearly that isn't you and you're upset? About it? Or are you annoyed because you're a crypto fiend and you don't like the 'blow ins' coming into your territory?
They can, but it's going to take a couple of decades haha
1k you are being generous‚Ä¶
Sell when that happens
It's not impossible. You just gotta be lucky.
I mean you can....
But you're more likely to a lose a million first...
what would u prefer 20 eth or 1 Bitcoin short and long term?
Are you saying I won't become a billionaire with my million dollar investment?
So 2020,  this is the new meta.   
Start with $2, double it 20 times with leverage . Boom easy money .


Please for the love of any god, don't..
Sadly I am still one of those people
Ill take them over the "Gurus" any fucking day of the week
But but but YouTube bitmoonboy told me I could :(
Where can I buy this CumElonDoge, and do I need to, uh, send tasteful nudes to the CEO of this new venture?
1k I can't afford that? I need a lambo with 200 bucks
‚ÄúI think ADA will hit $500‚Äù ü§°
I want at least 500k from a 1k investment
Go to the BTC Reddit half the people think they will be rich with 500 bucks in BTC in the next 6 months
I have 50 dollars in Bitcone , if it goes to a penny , I‚Äôll make enough to pay off my debt and and have about 30k in startup capital for my company . Yes 75k for me is life changing money I am confident I can do the rest. Fingers crossed.
My plan was to start with 1000 and 'simply' double it 10 times.
Not 1k to 1 million, but 1k to 100k is unironically realistic if you know what you're doing. From there 100k to 1 million isn't that hard. Just takes time and lots of research (and luck).
Tbf with 1k you just need a 10x three times. It‚Äôs obviously very hard but not as impossible as people think.
Im still waiting for my 1000 that is now 130 to become 1 million üòÅ
Cardano Future 200x leveraged and you are fine
A few of them will succeed.
That‚Äôs exactly what I did back in 2015
So stupid, you need at least 2 years to turn $1k into $1m.
Not the dreaded crypto bros....
You can‚Äôt make money in crypto without other people dumping their money into it. It has to come from somewhere
I "made" over 400k last time staring with ~700$ with 1000 mistakes along the way, rolling back on what I could have done 1-2 moves could easily net 2Mil+, so its entirely possible.

I put "made" in quotation because after all that work I decided in June after the market tanked to take a leveraged trade, needless to say I got liquidated ~3 Months ago and losing it all
Imagine 1k is pocket change to some people.
It sounds silly and it is unlikely but it happens. I bet there are people in this sub who have 1000x their investments.
The good think I like with crypto is that if you invest 1k, you can only lose 1k. This is pretty badass.
I cashed out last cycle and like a week later overheard someone explaining that all you need is a 100x to turn 1k into a million.

...so I slept easy. "Only a 100x"... thinking 1,000 x 100 = 1,000,000 .. painful.
>"The math is easy! 15% a week for 52 weeks and my 1000 bucks will become almost 1,5 million!"

So you're saying there is a chance ... say no more.
I brought 8 dollars of shib 7 years ago I'm a millionaire in waiting I have 3 lambos and a 911 but high sell low
They are already here
TLDR: Buy and hold bitcoin and bitcoin only.
There's always trading. So it's very much doable.
Not the right financial times for new ATH's. Bitcoin will rise to around 48.000, then ETF approval in January. Then dump.
Cool with me. 

Those people do nothing but make the rest of us money,
You are saying my tree fiddy will become 35k?
like the flowers in spring i'm here for it <3
Wheb the news starts running 'where to buy crypto' stories and when friends who told you that 'crypto is a scam' start asking you how to buy, that's your take profit flag right there. 

Rinse and repeat every three years.
[deleted]
I cant find cumelondoge coin. Where can i buy it?
This is true. But its gana take 20 years and by then a million wont be what it is today. 

But its still way better than holding fiat.
OK, honest quesiton: how much do you need to start, to get to a mil this run?
It‚Äôs simple to turn 1k into 1m, you just need 3 10x trades
Just let them struggle. We made it, those of us who stuck it out through the brutal bear market. Fuck those new guys, they are my exit liquidity.
Are Moons back? Wtf is this for degenerate post.
Those are the worst types of people imo 

also the types who w think they are investing crypto geniuses because they sat on their favorite alts for a year or two and now its worth more 

fuck it plz send us back straight into a deep bear
-How to make 1m on altcoins?
-Start with 2m.
Hey. Stop making fun of me!!!
nah... ive put 10k, its 15millions. 15m is the new 1.5m
Say it with me: pamp it
So Doge? J/k
FTM did a 1,500x from the bottom so yes, it‚Äôs possible.
I mean, it's not impossible. You'd be a billionaire if you invested 1k in Shib 3 years ago.
People who invest 1k usd to php, yes

People who invest 1k usd to usd, unlikelily

People who invest 1k usd to bolivar hell yeah!!!!
Everyone knows the only way to become a crypto millionaire is mooons ! Glorious, glorious moons
Have you checked out SafeMoon2? It will safely moon since it's right there in the name. No chance of going down.
Dude i did not even realize it was turning back around. I am back above even for the first time in months!
Bruh let those people be, that's where we get our liquidityüòÇ
The "fist stage" is always coming after the bullrun!
Well it depends, my 0.15 BTC is 100mil Indonesian Rupiah now . I'm a multi millionaire already.
There is a type of crypto earning that can make a significant profit from a small investment. Look at projects like Helium or Hivemapper.
I don't know why you think you are better thant any of these newly jumpin on fuckers driven purely by hopium.
I mean‚Ä¶I bought 10k dogecoin for $8 back in 2013 and sold it for around $5,500 around the time Elon went on SNL. Definitely didn‚Äôt expect that  üòÇ
You only need to invest the total sum of 38 dollars in order to commit millonaire
Where‚Äôs my lambo
Sounds like liquidity exit to me.
I mean there have been people who invested in lower market cap coins that went into the billions last run, it's definitely not out of the realm of possibility.

Completely depends on the projects you invest in, how early you invest, and how much potential their market cap has to grow.

Last run was INSANE by how much some went up.

Safemoon went to by over 100x after it was announced, as shit of a coin that was.
Let them come.  
Natural selection.
I'm waiting for the next round of millionaires who turn it into $1k.

ü§°ü§°ü§°
But those are the bag holders that will make some of us millions.
Is this a sell sign?
I'm pretty sure they've been on board since 2020/21. They'll just casually start activating as news of the recent bull run reaches them slowly on FB and IG.
In a bull market there will be some coins / tokens that make those 1000x returns.  Not many but it‚Äôs enough to fill 10 stadiums with hopium.  Of course the trick is being lucky enough to have stumbled into one of those 1000x coins.  Reading tech analysis is not going to direct you there.
thank god i can pass on my PEPE so someone else can share the wealth
Damn,  and here i was thinking I'm making an average of 2,500 a day.

Thought for sure i would have a 200-400k by end of next year.
I‚Äôm already here
"This is only the fist stage!"

Yup. Pretty much. LOL.
I am more upset at myself for not investing in the dip... :(

&#x200B;

I just watched it come and go.
Jokes on you I‚Äôm already here.
Have you heard about options? ;D
May I interest you in exquisite shitcoins?
Turning 1 million into 1k is way easier. This is the way
Now see here's the trick,I think I can but I invested my 1k in 2016 üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞
Finally, someone spills the secret. $1000 on CumElonDoge it is! Now to get to Robinhood, do a market buy, and hold it on the exchange! I'm gonna be set for life!
Weird ass post ngl
I'll just ride it up like last time, take profits along the way, and then when it goes down again start accumulating
How dare you describing me 3 years ago!
well, to be fair-  they can, just not with the retirement funds - BTC/ETH
I turned 2k into 20k with shib the end of 2021. Now granted I pulled it out and put it into ethereum and solana near their peak, sooooooo‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ take that how you want to.
With enough time, they might. Will $1 mil be worth anything by then tho?
We need people who can turn 1000 into 10
But you can be a millionaire with 1K
Stop them? Those are the people that early investors get to dumb on to sell their profits. This is what makes more informed crypto investors see larger ROIs. Evil but true.
Buy high sell low, got it. Thanks!
The more, the merrier
My $1k into Kishu last bull run got me a huge Eth, BTC and Link stack that'll hopefully push me into 7figs this coming bull run. It's posssible
So 1k its not enough anymore to become millionaire ?

What are we talking about,like 1.5k or 2 k.?
Emotions make weak traders. That's who's money I'm taking when their emotions win with me.
Well... you can and you can't be a millionaire to be honest. You just have to be stupid enough to do it and lucky enough to succeed... if you fail you will be considered an idiot and if you win you will be considered smart.

There's been a lot of both cases (more on the fail side) on every bull-run, with even less and more investment I might add
So your telling me there‚Äôs a chance
You‚Äôre speaking from experience huh‚Ä¶ ü§î
"It's easy. Three 10x trades. 1k to 10k to 100 to a million. Boom."

"You're just saying higher numbers."
And thus a tiny tiny portion of their 1k becomes my money as I hodl.

&#x200B;

That market cap value has to come from somewhere!
Just 100x once, then do it again, boom you have 10 million.
My favorite is when they see a top 10 token at less than $1 and think it‚Äôs going to go to $45,000 like BTC. No idea of the price relationship to ‚Äúmarket cap‚Äù
You feel that? The way the shit clings to the air.. it‚Äôs already begun‚Ä¶ a shit blizzard
That‚Äôs you approach investing today, than many losing money and give up.. someone will study üìö
lol I‚Äôm still 18% down on my crypto investments.  I hope it comes up enough so those guys will get me to even!
I thought you had to get a rib removed before you could post something like this.
I got like tree fiddy. Doing my part tho
It is immoral to prevent a fool and his money from parting from one another.
I turned $1,000 to $92!
Losers buy Lambos ...... I'll order my Ferrari soon. üíØ%
The more the merrier. I'd happily welcome a billion of them
Oh dear
Ssshhhhhh‚Ä¶ we need exit liquidity.
Pamp it
Hey you never know!
Ill be happy if my 5k becomes 150k. I realize that wont happen, but if it does itll pay for my mortgage. But I'll also be happy with 20k to pay for a remodel of a few rooms lol
All in RcketCumElon
so a dump is coming. got it
What a loser‚Ä¶ CumElonDoge Inu was the right investment. Enjoy staying poor
At ICO, 2000 ETH cost $500.
sure ok, but still you should all be welcoming 
 
and for fucks sake don‚Äôt call them exit liquidity 

somebody has to buy our bags
Invest 5k - get the 1m sooner and sell, leaving bag holders in your wake.
u/simplifyextension
my wallet 11/2021 was over $2K.  with the recent bitcoin activity it's up to $600 from a $325 low.  i also tried $ca for a while and just kept watching my valuation flush down the toilet.  i've left it alone now since 2/2022 just waiting for it to come back up.  hope i live that long.
Bitcoin bout to 1000x bro
Holy fuck this is giving me flashbacks from certain shit coin subs last bullrun.
Pffft lucky them I don‚Äôt even have $1k to invest
Wait what it's 1k now? What happened to the $100 - $200 dollar Investors who were complaining about not having Lambos after a few months? üòÇ
Lol I'm here for it
I invested $1,000 last year where lambo?
It can be done
They can. If they wait long enough.
You want to stop them? And have them invest in what? I don‚Äôt think this sub should be stopping anyone to give financial advice. Most of the people here are still under water on their great investments.
These same people will think they are millionaires with $12,000
Ah yes, the time of the cycle where all these random coins come out of the woodwork. Where friends I haven‚Äôt talked to in years start soliciting advice from me as the group veteran.

‚ÄúYo Jeff said I should put all my money into DOGE, right now! What do you think bro, it gonna moon?‚Äù

‚ÄúI been following this dude bitboy on YouTube and he seems to know what he‚Äôs talking about, what‚Äôs your take on him?‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople saying tron is on the comeup and the movie was lit too. This one gotta be a winner, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúAyy bro I heard Logan Paul making something where you can like‚Ä¶. Evolve fake pok√© things as an EFT. That lit?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis dude Do Kwon say he planning something big, you gotta get in on that!‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you hear Elon is bringing his‚Ä¶. DOGE on the next rocket launch? Will this make my SpaceDoge moon?!??,!‚Äù

And EVERY F‚Äôing time I just tell them to buy ETH and BTC. And EVERY time, those who listened eventually write back thanks. The ones who didn‚Äôt listen, I never hear from again.

All we can do is try to help and educate, because a whole lotta people are about to lose a ton of money on scamcoins.
Within a year, no less.
But maybe I could.....
Ah yes, monopoly money will lead to millions. It's a high risk fucking asset. It's not real money until you pull out.
Exit liquidity! Yay!
All you need is $100.  Stupid‚Ä¶
I got 100$ on it. Lambo bitches
I won‚Äôt?  Damn.
I‚Äôm not buying yet. Waiting until 69K then I‚Äôm going balls deep. I‚Äôll hodl until 420K. I‚Äôm not just buying a Lambo. I‚Äôm buying the whole Lambo factory!!!
I was great at finding entries last run, but no discipline to sell... lost my shirt
Not gon lie. I invested 1k and it turned to 7k. Now I'm investing 7k. If math serves right. 7mil soon. Why stop there. I'm going for 7 billion!
Wanna make a million in crypto? Start with a billion.
They‚Äôll be the ones stuck with the bag at ATH üòÇ
Stop them? I am planning to sell them some stinky, shit filled bags from years ago. At a premium of course. LET THEM COME!
Imma wait for the crash. It should be bigger this time
Imma wait for the crash. It should be bigger this time. Something inside me feels like this is a setup
Wat happened wit Shiba Inu is obnoxiously rare. It‚Äôs a shame ppl don‚Äôt realize that.
I don't know what you're talking about, but would you like my seed phrase?
Bitcoin used to be $44. Now it has increased 1000 fold. Surely I should buy now so I can get that 1000x return, right? Right?
I've been in this sub long enough to understand this. Makes me happy I've grown.
I can feel it crashing in the air tonight,....oh hell.  Oh crap.
If you're smart, you'll give me $500. I can quadruple that for you at no cost. You can trust *me*.
What is this? A school for ants? Investment needs to be at least 3 times that size.
Right? Why are we dissuading our exit liquidity? 

‚ÄúCome one, come all, make a million dollars in 2024 with this one easy trick!‚Äù
Yeah but if my 2k made me a million it can easily make me 2 million. I think I'll hodl a little longer.
You need to invest $500,000 to become a millionaire, then pay 50% capital gains tax
Also make sure you don't miss out on all those not sketchy airdrops!
I have just invested 100; wen lambo?
I'm okay with becoming a small person millionaire
I did the math. You are correct.
10000x is the only logical way to make money in this market. Anything else is peasant crumbs.
This.
I was gonna say 3k but your plan sounds more intriguing.
I can guarantee that the only way I'll be able to make a million dollars will be to invest $1.5 million.
Obviously
I can do it with 2 million
It totally works, you  just have to wait 500 years to cash out.
How to become a millionaire: already be a millionaire so you can afford to invest 100k.
I'm up 98% on HUAHUA
in this space, hate makes weight
True that, I was once very lucky and a one-time investment of 1k turned into 500k, BUUUUT... I was still a newb and held onto the bag for the long run, dreaming big... even when it started to fall. ü§¶

After a while I was still in the green, but instead of 500k it's was only about 8k.

So not a loss at all and a nice ROI, but man... üòû

I'll never make that mistake again.
BONK has entered the chat.
"Some" is doing some work here. :D It is one in couple million tops. Chances are maybe better than a lottery jackpot but not by much.
Looks up Rich Quack coin
OP thinks he knows shit about fuck
You lived long enough to see yourself become the very villain you hated.
[deleted]
OP is clueless, just look at a bunch of coins in the top100, alot of them are up 2-400% in the past month, these have hundreds of millions in marketcap, and we are far from peak bull market.

Now take that 1000$ in a 50k marketcap coin, get lucky and watch it go up 50000%, if there is any market you can become a millionare in with a small investment its crypto, why the fuck are you in this market if thats not what youre aiming for?

Edit: OPs post history is filled with similar posts, shocking.
Relatable
Oh man, my dirty secret is that I evaporated 20k playing options on quarterly reports. 

I'll never do that again.
You bought LRC too? Same‚Ä¶
Finally had to scroll all the way down to see someone who's doin it right.
The trick to trading isn't catching the highs.  
You make your money when you buy, not when you sell.  
I made sure to deploy capital into ETH and BTC a year ago because I didn't want to miss the bottom again.
I‚Äôm still unconvinced the bull market has started. Not that I‚Äôm particularly bearish, but‚Ä¶ halving hasn‚Äôt happened yet so
Someone got very lucky with a megaleveraged position on something?
All they had to do was press a button in the app when some special AI trading program told them to
What's the secretüëÄ
only the **pump** is real
I‚Äôd be happy just to get the same amount of money back that I put in in 2021 before it all came crashing down.
Look at Mister money bags over here
Woah not gonna lie that's a cool avatar that you got there.
Depends on your timeline. You can invest tens of thousands over a few years even if you don‚Äôt make that much. And who knows what the return on that might be a decade from now. The best time to plant a tree is 15 years ago. The second best time is today.
This is honestly one of the worst ways to look at investing in this space.

This subreddit is a great example of why this type of thinking is horrible.  Most people here are in the red because they follow this type of advice.

The point isn't to hit a super lucky 1000x that has a .1% of happening and 99.9% of going bust.  

Might as well just go to a casino.

The point is to grow your wealth.
I wonder even with Alts the ‚Äúgolden days‚Äù are gone
Yeah, people have been saying that ever since bitcoin hit $100. I call bullshit.
You just need to 10x six times
Where were you 13 yrs ago?
You don't say


This coin is resilient AF
Lol
Dont forget to take some profit.
lol you don‚Äôt deserve more money for holding onto volatile assets‚Ä¶ you need to sell.
OP is just trying to make himself feel smart, he doesn't realize he just sounds like a dickhead.
I was genuinely confused by this post. What is it accomplishing exactly
People want only one bull run. Nobody wants to do the hard work of going through multiple bull runs and bear markets. Everyone wants to gamble on winning lottery tickets and have the winnings yesterday.
The moment I enter the market. The law of probability goes out the door. I'm sorry.
This is the way
How did you hear about shib initially?
Guide him properly & tell him not to have unrealistic expectations.
Ding ding ding. Got people owing 34% plus out here and not knowing it.
Mine's already left with Celcius
Ah.. my long lost cousin he told me he would ship gold bricks to me & made me pay $100 for shipping. Haven't heard from him since. This Nigerian cousins are cheeky bastards.
Same here, dropped a $500 into badger coin because it has a low supply and mc. If it ever gains traction it could be easily a 10x
I started swapping everything into SOL after RENDR voted to migrate. 

That was my final confirmation that despite common sense thinking it should and would die a slow death, what didn't kill it only made it stronger

Now you can throw ten darts at random sol ecosystem tokens and come with 7-10 winners(until overdue retrace spoils the party)

But there's a big influx farming on margin fi and kamino chasing the next JTO. Practically all the lending and a lot of liquidity pools are maxed or near capacity
Bold statement lol.
I think you should start yr comment with yr last sentence 1st coz I just lost my $1 doin 20x leverage. 

Pliz be mindful not everyone here is smart like you.
I was told my 1 Million SHIB would reach a dollar any day now

Feels good man. We did make it. Took our licks, educated ourselves, stuck it out and DCA‚Äôd down for years. Now we‚Äôre finally back in profit and these guys pop up like new survivors released into the walking dead. 

If you like that analogy, we‚Äôre like the Georgia cast after the season 2 timeskip, we don‚Äôt even need words, we‚Äôre just making bird noises at each other while we run through zombies like seal team six, knowing these poor bastards are out in the open and doomed.
Guys don't fear. This guy is trustworthy. 

I can confirm this as I'm the trust he's talking about.
ugh those youtube comments. 

commenter #1: Faisal's course on investments helped me get rich!

commenter #2: Yes, Mr. Faizul is the best! He helped me 10x my investment!!!

$250k of net profit is nothing to sneeze at üëÄ
Please. Everyone knows to get a million in crypto, you need to put in a billion.
Once you have this sort of money you stop paying tax. Tax is for us poors
Turns out that if you never sell you never have to pay taxes
lol my homie was up to 1.3 million on a 10k investment. Some shitcoin or other. Held till he went below his initial investment. I can‚Äôt even begin to fathom how shitty that must feel.
I went up to $67,000 with Safemoon, kept holding because I thought for sure it was going up more. Ended up selling off after it crashed for like $11,000. Not as big of a situation as yours, but I can definitely relate and feel your pain. Never again.
Lmao I feel ya. Invested like $350 into that saitama crap. When it hit ATH I was holding about $20k and my friend had close to $35k. We were like ‚Äúnah long term bro‚Äù. Sold it all a few months ago to buy $35 worth of sushi lmfao
Heads up from a tax perspective for anyone in this situation:

Like this poster, you invest $1k in a meme coin. That coin goes to $500k. You‚Äôre over the moon and super happy. You SELL that meme coin and invest that $500k into a bunch of other meme coins. You just created TAXABLE EVENTS.

If those new meme coins go to $0 ‚Ä¶ you STILL owe taxes on the initial payout of half a fucking million. You‚Äôre on the hook to pay takes on $500,000 that you now do not have. 

So keep that in mind. Hope things work out for you guys but be careful with your tax situations.
You were so close to sleeping with my wife.
Im very sorry for your loss... 500küò≠
A lesson learned and still in the green... win win..

One other positive is the tax man...
300k to 3k here also, it hurts, but that's just how it goes I guess
Hopefully you even get the chance to make that mistake again.
PEPE has left the chat.
BONK definitely has entered the chat.

crypto way better odds, that's why fun to degen

just wait until poor people learn this
Not gonna lie but I bought $11 of this coin & it's the only thing that's green in my portfolio. Everything else is Red as River Nile.
I know fuck about shit.
You stare long enough into the abyss, the abyss stares back.
Nice.
I was in the game back crypto was just a great alternative to PayPal and nobody imagined it as an investment. 

Sold it all when it was worth less than 200 USD in October 2013 as I assumed the Silk Road issues meant it would become worthless.
Imagination: ride $1k to $1mil

Reality: ride $1k to $2k, sell and watch it go to $1mil on the sidelines.
Live and learn. All the best to you.
LUNA
Me also skeptical, this price action will be corrected though probably only minimally in 2024. What I am sure of is the next bull is going to be insane and surpass all previous expectations
No leverage. Just AVAX and SOL meme tokens. 

Simply bet 500 USD at 20K mcap and recheck after few days to discover mcap is 5M+
We are COMFY in alts lands right now /u/ProxyV0ID
No AI involved. Just catching a memeplay early.
Catch a meme early. Easy as that. Trick is finding a legit one that wont rug you.
Risk vs reward and living the YOLO life
Good call-out.
Yeah I was saying the returns on tens of thousands could be really good. Over the next 10 years I wouldn't be surprised if BTC hit half a mil per coin. But even at the recent lows that would have cost you $15k.

Nobody gonna put 1k into BTC and get rich.

Also there are probably a lot similar to me. I see huge growth potential in crypto and I see a possibility where I can achieve enough wealth to stop working.

Ultimately that's what I want. I hate work
You think people here with couple thousand to invest are gonna put it into BTC and wait till they‚Äôre dead to take it out? People are investing in crypto because it‚Äôs risky and big gains to be made.
I think you misunderstood my post. I'm not investing in shit coins hoping they moon. I'm investing in ecosystems I truly believe have the potential to transform finance.

Think of me like someone that has found a company they absolutely believe in and is putting a big investment down hoping for life changing money.

I make very good money but I hate working. I truly believe my investments will pay off but if they don't well whatever I'll still live a fairly comfortable life.

I don't need crypto to have a secure retirement I'll have that without it.
I mean even the big alts have already returned way more than BTC. Solana is almost 10x in the last few months. Hivemapper is a cool project on Solana and has 10x for me in the last few weeks
In my tummy‚Äôs mother
OP didn't touch on this but I think it's important that people understand marketcap.  

If you think your coin will go to XXX amount but that will put it above Bitcoin's marketcap then you're in for a disappointment.
exactly
Pretty much.  

I started in 2015 and I'm STILL holding.
You at stage 3 yet? I‚Äôve got this great investment into a brand new coin called HarrypottersonicInuCumfart v3.
Lol thanks!
But he didn't say "bro" - not sure if we can actually trust them....
He trimmed my armor
This reminds me of those bot comment chains on YouTube, that you'll find on most financial channels.
He's on reddit, he's gotta be trustworthy
You can trust in the trust of this guy. I saw him comment on a YouTube financial channel too. 100 percent trust.
WHEW! For a second there I thought a rando on the internet might be full of BS. But I think it‚Äôs legit.
Thank you binglelemon for changing my life and investing on my behalf to make me a millionaire. #binglelemoninvestments #cryptojesus #fire

Wait, THE Mr. Faisal!?
Yup. The fist stage
I ain‚Äôt no Ben Dover.
sure sure 0,1 ist huuuge
What happens when blockreward cannot pay electric bills and dont bullshit me with transaction fee paying electric bills.
Bitcoin is at risk its an experiment.
It failed as currency (value drops 80% because 40% supply is in few wallets and dont bullshit me that those are exchange wallets because when there were no exchanges those wallets had such supply)

It failed as store of Value ( network is at risk http://gavinandresen.ninja/a-possible-btc-future )
People hate Gavin but he is smarter than moon pigs.


Only thing it  is good at is make you rich..
Thanks for pumping my bags though.
Holy shit how fast did it go down? I just can‚Äôt imagine watching it go from 1.3 mill to less than 10k like that‚Äôs a long time to watch it

But I also get it, been nowhere near that close but have held just like that, always thinking and wishing and hoping it would go back up

But obviously there shouldn‚Äôt be any emotions involved in trading and hope isn‚Äôt a strategy! Sigh, but that‚Äôs also why I haven‚Äôt trade in like a year LOL
Jesus. After taxes he would‚Äôve cleared like $800,000. With proper slow and traditional investments (IRAs, bonds, mutual funds) after that he would‚Äôve been comfy for life. Not super rich but definitely comfy.
Greed is a hell of a drug.
Also need to keep in mind the liquidity in some of those shitcoins. Sure, at the current price the bag may be worth 1.3 million, but as soon as you start selling large amounts, you run down the order book wiping out the buy prices pretty fast and may get nowhere near that in reality, or possibly not even have enough buyers to liquidate the whole bag. Either way, that's one hell of a gain!!
What are the new plays this time around? üëÄ
If it's a good project, then holding long-term (and through bear markets) can actually be very lucrative.

But if you need the money before that, or the project does not really do anything that would merit its value (i.e. highly overvalued), then you better sell during the bull market, as these kinds of projects rarely make it through a bear market.
Washing crypto is still legal IIRC, in most places at least. Still requires you to be proactive.

Whenever you're sitting on $500,000 capital gains but holding onto a coin at a $500,000 loss, just swap out and back into the same asset to create a new taxable event and lock in that loss. Now you can use the loss to offset the gain. Or else you will be filling your pants for the next year evading jail and a ~$150K tax bill.

Any time you're sitting on gains and it is possible anywhere in your portfolio to lock in a loss, you are able to mitigate your taxes another year.
Or just don't like in America. Where I live there are no events just net gains in a sad year in your tax report. And no one monitors is anyway. If you are smart and dont drop a mil$ out of nowhere into your account no one would find out.
100%

And since there are so many useful crypto tax guides out there by now, it's really no excuse to be slacking in that department. And those guides are usually really easy to understand, so no dry law babble, but a lot of examples and easy to digest paragraphs for anyone.

To conquer the enemy you gotta know the enemy. üòã
Well, it's not really a loss, more like an opportunity that slipped through my fingers.

But yeah, it still hurt for a time, thinking about what could've been. \^\^

Anyways, I appreciate the compassion. :)
Your math is a bit wrong. Lets say you compare 1k in power ball vs. 1k in a small, volatile, low cap coin.  
For 1k you get 500 Tickets. So the chances are much higher with 500 in 275 million. You also get some money back from the lower brackets. It is still a bad idea, but so is putting 1k in a coin that can go down 90% in minutes. You can be the lucky one, but the chances are not good.
Still a lot better than riding to zero.
You have described my investing strategy.
Oh I certainly learned. I pulled that money out of stocks and had I left it in those stocks until today I'd be 30+%

And good luck to you!
Disgusting, lol
Ah yeah ive heard of this sol meme coin. And BTC meme coin
Yeah, then you try and cash out and realize there's no liquidity, so you learn. That you can only make one sell before crashing the price. In the moment you learned you were supposed to just rugpull everyone with your own token of you were trying to be a millionaire
If you would've bought $20k BONK in October 2023, you'd now be sitting on $1M USD. Bonk is currently ranked 80th by market cap. If it has a trajectory like SHIB, you could be looking at a peak market cap of $30B. It's currently $700M. 

This is my hot tip of 2024 bull run. Be fking careful and don't do anything stupid.
How do you search through and find those?
Simple
Do they have liquidity to exit though, lol?
lol, I‚Äôm only up 52% in sol lol but my position is nothing to ‚Äúget rich about‚Äù unless I hold long enough lol.
what platform would one use to buy memeplays
Gonna get rugged 20-100 times before one hits also
You‚Äôll probably get rugged eventually. You have to pull out before it. I‚Äôve been in the game a while and dropped $500 in safemoon for shits and giggles. It DID actually skyrocket temporarily but I didn‚Äôt sell and it‚Äôs now worth probably a couple pennies, if that. A lot of meme coin holders do get rugged. Just a matter of getting out before other people. Still kind of a bullshit strategy though.
How would you even go about trying to find one?
That's my whole reason too. To stop working would be the ultimate dream come true. But I just can't find the time to get informed enough about the projects which are currently promising. That's why I don't really believe I will get anywhere close to that goal.
I'm hoping to make enough off the next two cycles to pull my retirement age closer by 20 years. 

Dumping the profits from each cycle into tradfi (retirement accounts). And then DCA through the bear market to repeat.

I'd like to retire at 45, not 65 (I'm thirty).
A lot of people are looking to achieve the same thing. I don‚Äôt like going to work either. But everybody can‚Äôt retire, or who would make me coffee in the morning?  So you have to separate yourself into the top X% of wealth to manage it. It‚Äôs highly competitive is my point. Kind of like saying in 2003 you want to make Britney Spears your girlfriend. In order to actually achieve that, you have to do what most people won‚Äôt do because they don‚Äôt have the diligence, patience, ability to delay gratification or something.
They should invest and hold for 10+ years.

Literally that is how people get wealthy.  They hold assets for decades.

The broke and poor gamble and try and strike it rich.  Some do but most fail.
> I think you misunderstood my post. I'm not investing in shit coins hoping they moon. I'm investing in ecosystems I truly believe have the potential to transform finance.

I do understand this is what you believe.

I just belive something else.  I think 99.9% of this space are shitcoins including practically all the coins this subreddit loves.  I don't think there is a bright future for them.

> I make very good money but I hate working. I truly believe my investments will pay off but if they don't well whatever I'll still live a fairly comfortable life.

I'm the same way.
it‚Äôs not so much the content of the post ‚Ä¶ more of the tone. Felt a bit condescending
2014 here. Lots of mistakes have been made along the way too‚Ä¶
Then why not volunteer yourself to be this dude's quintessential "bro" autocorrect substitute
Bro trust me. Bro you can‚Äôt loose! Bro, where you going? Come back here bro? Guess what, you suck, bro! You‚Äôre never gonna lambo! Bro!!! b  r  o ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
The secret word is "brah". Bro means he/she's scammer.
r/unexpectedrunescape
Nice
He cut my gems for free, still waiting for him to give em back tho
Thanks to binglelemon my DogeElonCum coin went up 367% in just a 3 weeks! You should definitely check out his onlyfans to see for yourself
I've been taking investment advice from Heather Blondbux and I've tripled my money in the last 30 days.
Not only youtube now, they found my skype and are now spamming me with group invites and whole group consists only of those bots lmao.
I think it plummeted in a matter of hours maybe days. I believe it was called guardian token. Look at the chart if you want to get an idea huge pump and dump.
Except this assumes there is liquidity in the market to cash out, which is almost never the reality with most of crypto. All the stories of 10000x gains are largely people making a few thousand while rugging and the rest losing everything.
If he was young enough an $800k nest egg in a diversified equity index fund could easily mean retiring early and rich, provides he's also contributing through working for a while.
Whatever someone's gonna tell you, they're holding bags of it and have an interest in having it go up by you buying in. \^\^

And by the time you hear something blowing up, it's usually too late for life-changing gains. You gotta find something that's not even out yet, but where you think the project is going to take off. And then you have to take a chance with it.

(That is, of course, if you don't want to make your money via trading, but via investing.)
MOZ
Exactly. Yes, you can swap it back to the original coin, if possible. Unless they‚Äôve changed the law (and always research first, based on location like you mentioned) wash rules should still apply to crypto (but not to stocks ‚Ä¶ I think?). But yeah, good point.

Basically I was just saying be careful or the irs can screw things up really bad for you.

Also, you still need to have an accounting of these transactions (there‚Äôs tons of web sites that‚Äôll do this). You can‚Äôt just go ‚ÄúI made / lost X amount of money.‚Äù All the trades have to be accounted for.
Loss write off... otherwise the tax will write you off anyways. A decent crypto tax calculator helps a lot... in these scenarios
No it‚Äôs 500 x 1/275,000,000. 500 rolls of the same probability
That was the optimistic scenario :)

Usually it goes like...

Ride $1k to $2k, sell and watch it go to $1mil on the sidelines, regret, buy back in, lose it all.
Do you still mess with stocks or strictly crypto only?
Rug pulling is such bullshit.
Bonk is insane. Rocketed from top 1000 to top 80 under a month. 

I still can't figure out where did it get the volume for this. üòÇ
Lots of joining telegram groups and guessing if they're a group that are full of bots trying to steal your money.
Coinmarketcap (which is a shit site) does list all the new scams, I mean new projects.
Asking the real questions. 

The ones he caught were legit and with enough liq and he didn't dump all at once.
The meme platform.
You dont, its a gamble.
Cone is up like 320% this month. I got my first 100k cones over 400 days ago. Total meme coin spawned out of reddit nft injokes. Now it‚Äôs the 3rd reddit crypto related win I‚Äôve had lol
Stuck in the same boat‚Ä¶ thats what they want. They want you busy wasting time with a job. Instead of making real money
ETH, GNS, PENDLE, GAMMA.  You can thank me later.
Everybody won't retire if crypto goes up a lot lol. Only a tiny number of people are in it
So many opportunities each cycle and this is probably the last bull run for a good while. No-one is buying now to hold for 10 years. Get in and get out next year.
That's just a fundamental disagreement then. I think DeFi is going to transform finance. BTC will change the way countries transact. I'm positive in the next 10 years countries that hate the USA will use either BTC or XMR to trade (not exclusively but I believe it will happen to some degree).
Are you on profit?
Bruh, you‚Äôre never gunna LamBruh‚Ä¶
You mean OnlyFinancial
Does it trade on Bitconnnnnnnnect?
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/guardian/ chart, click All
if a value changes from millions of dollars to 10 grand in a matter of hours who do you think is actually willing to pay you millions of dollars for it?

The price of Bictoin is high because it's consistently high.

Nobody will buy your shitcoin for 10 thousand dollars because green arrow said its worth 10 thousand the same reason why nobody but idiots bought monkey pictures supposedly worth half a million dollars with nothing to back it
No, I don't think wash rules generally apply to crypto.
>(but not to stocks ‚Ä¶ I think?).

Yeah I believe in equities this is called a wash sale and is not allowed. 

When people do their tax lost harvesting they have to wait 30 days I think before they can buy into the same fund.
You can't deduct scams as losses in most places so DYOR. In my region the scam transfer out would be considered a sale at fair market value.

Otherwise anyone could send crypto to a friend or self then claim they were scammed, to avoid paying taxes.

It's an unfortunate consequence for those who actually are scammed.
I am not an American, but i think you can make sure not to get the same combination twice, so it would not be 500 x 1/275,000,000 and should add up. At least that is how lottery in Europe works.  
If you are rolling a dice and it is not possible to roll the same number twice, your chances to get a 6 are higher with every roll. The same is true with large combinations.
>500 x 1/275,000,000

500 x 1/275,000,000 IS 500/275,000,000  
And 500/275,000,00 can be expressed as  1/550,000  
You are literally agreeing with me.
Not specific to Bonk but...

It's usually all manipulated by the already-rich people that founded it.  Spend 1 million to get 100 million.

Don't ever trust a coin that somehow has money to put up billboards in Times Square.  And especially one that says the founders get 0%.  Biggest lie in crypto.
And lots of researching with tools to check if the newly deployed contract is a honeypot or rug. 

tokensniffer.is bubblenauts are some tools one can use to check the legitimacy of said contract
Coinmarketcap is very late. Only lists tokens after they have reason certain milestones. You need to be in the trenches to find stuff truly early.
It's all a gamble
Same, should I sell or wait for 1 billion marketcap?
Fellow coner. Literally didnt expect it was up like x7 in span of week. Been holding more than a year as well.
And the mcap of cone is still relatively low when compared to other meme coins
Lololol
I was one of these financial bros I would 100% be stealing that name...
If he started selling off at a million, he might not have gotten that, but I‚Äôll bet he would have made fuck ton nonetheless.
No but I was referring to writing a loss off... as in. Lost value. I still hold the coin. But sell at a loss and you write it off that way.
Unless you‚Äôre buying MILLIONS of tickets, the probability is functionally the same
Check yourself before you wreck yourself, or your finances. I beg you. Please take your meds or read a book about probability
bonk is the sol meme coin they are likely talking about, and it's been on CMC and coingecko for almost a year
You know the answer. Do you want a lambo or French fries?
I‚Äôm up 4000% on cone.

Only put $50 in, taken $200 out already.

Put $100 into plunger, taken $150 out and sitting on $400 plunger. Plunger is a low cap potential gem, but risky as hell due to low liquidity.

Set targets for profits and enjoy the ride!
Oh, crap lol. I thought you replied to a different post I made. So my reply doesn't make sense.

Cheers for clarifying and not being a dbag :)
But it is not. That's not how math works. It is still a very low probability and a bad idea to play but it is getting higher with every ticket. 1 in 275 million is definitely not the same as 2 in 275 million because the second number is literally twice as high.
You still wouldn't win anything major most likely but 500 tickets have a substantially higher chance of winning if compared to one ticket.
You are confusing multiplying a fractional number by itself and multiplying it by an integer on top of confusing the probability of one event with the probability of multiple independent events.The difference is, I checked my math before posting in the first place, which took a minute. You didn't.
Yeah, no shit. It also got airdropped, to projects and individuals. Bonk hit 2b, it‚Äôs not some hidden ‚Äònew gem‚Äô lmao.
Both sound pretty good tbh
Any suggestion where best place to buy plunger? The cone i got is from airdrop.
Plunger is the way! It's only a few months since it started and yet it's growing faster than cone did. I regret not buying cone when I could have bought 1B cones for 1k usd.
Maaaaaaaaaaaaaate‚Ä¶.come on.

You buy 500 tickets on a jack pot with probability at 275,000,000 to 1 for your number. You don‚Äôt increase your probability to win by 500. You have 500 rolls/chances at a 274,999,500 to 1 odds gamble.

That‚Äôs the maths.
Yes 2 in 275 million is technically better odds than 1 in 275 million.

But in reality.... Ita functionally the same. Every additional ticket purchased has such a negligible effect on your chances of winning (because they're so low per ticket), that it might as well be the same odds.

It's only when your buying ridiculous amounts of tickets (thousands? Millions?)does the needle move in any meaningful way on probability.
>  You need to be in the trenches to find stuff truly early.

bonk was listed for 10 months before doing a 50x in 50 days

You're the one who said something stupid, not me.
The real play is to take a pic of you in your lambo eating fries.
I bought it on quickswap!
It is not 274,99,500 to 1. It's 250,000,000 to 1 + 250,000,000 to 1 and so on. You are making a logic error. There is only ONE lottery drawing. If for every separate ticket you buy there is a separate drawing, you would be right, but there is only one drawing.
Out of 250 million possible permutations, you are trying 500 at once. The winning permutation does not change every time you try one, it stays the same and you don't try the same one twice.
With 500 tickets you have a 0,0002% chance of winning the jackpot. So still miniscule but definitely higher. And we are ignoring lower brackets.
Some lotteries were actually exploitable and people figured it out. It is surprising that sometimes lowering the needed winning numbers by one or two was enough to make it worth buying huge amounts of tickets because it was extremely likely to get more out than you put in.
Bonk ran to like 100m in the first week. 50x is hardly impressive considering it did like 1000x!

Do you know how many tokens are launched every day? Yesterday $bear ran from 500 mcap to 5m, the day before $coq went from 6k to 7m, now sitting at 15m. 

And guess what? If you‚Äôre looking on coin market cap, you wouldn‚Äôt have seen them. If you‚Äôre seriously recommending people to find early gems on cmc, you are literally the definition of exit liquidity. 

In the good old days cmc listings would provide a nice final burst of exit liquidity, nowadays it barely does anything. Now I know why that final cmc pump would happen, lol
Just found out it its available on metamask on polygon network.
7 years in government. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. ($490k net worth)
TL;DR: I followed this sub in college, decided fuck PA, and started in the federal government in 2017 straight out of college. Work is reasonable. Life is great. My net worth has gone from -$20k at graduation to $490k. My fianc√©e‚Äôs (elementary teacher) net worth has grown to $244.5k, giving us a household net worth of $734.5k for the year ended 12/31/23. We‚Äôre both 30. Government jobs might not pay as much as PA and industry, but there's still plenty of room for success.

**Career:**
 
I work as a financial auditor for the federal government. My OPM career code is 0511 for those interested. My day-to-day work is exactly the same as PA audit work. I have 7 years of experience now. I will always be grateful to this sub for lifting the curtain on the nature of PA work and for pointing me towards a government job. Around 9 years ago in a thread about internships someone commented that government internships are often overlooked. On a whim I went over to USAJOBS.gov to see what federal internships were available, applied to several, and the rest is history. This post is partially to be that for the next generation of students.
 
I started out making $60k. Last year my salary was $104k, however my final pay stub for 2023 showed $114k grossed due to overtime pay and student loan repayment benefits. For 2024 my salary has increased to $112.5k. I don‚Äôt have a masters or a CPA. I considered becoming a CPA after I started working but quickly decided against it. I spent my free time after work as actual free time and met my now fianc√©e instead :). I am VERY content with my job. 
 
$112.5k for 7 years‚Äô experience in a HCOL is nothing special. My peers who went PA are certainly leaps and bounds ahead of me in salary and title. However, it‚Äôs more than good enough for me. When I picked accounting, my goal was a career that paid me ‚Äòenough‚Äô to live well, while giving me the best work-life-balance possible. A federal career has absolutely provided that. Any large increase in salary would probably come with a decrease in work-life balance, and that‚Äôs simply not worth it to me.

**Work-Life balance:**
 
Excellent. I work 40-hour weeks nearly year-round. I earn 4 weeks PTO and 2.5 weeks sick leave each year, in addition to 10 federal holidays. This past busy season I had about 4 weeks again where I needed to work 60-hour weeks. I‚Äôm really not a fan of having to work OT, but the short-ish duration and 1.5x pay makes it bearable. It also helps that the job, improving the quality of federal financial reporting, actually provides some level of public good. 
 
I have been 100% work-from-home since March 2020. My agency is going to reclassify my position to remote. We‚Äôll be able to live anywhere in the US. This is honestly life-changing. Pay will of course be adjusted accordingly, but the DC pay scale doesn‚Äôt come anywhere close to making up for the cost of housing. My fianc√©e is a teacher so we plan to move out of the DMV this summer to a MCOL area. The specific city is still TBD. 
 
**Personal Finance:**
 
I found the /r/financialindependence sub in college too and decided I wanted to retire early. I made retirement contributions a priority and have maxed out my TSP (gov 401K), IRA, and HSA every year since 2017. It took quite a bit of effort the first couple years but my salary grew quickly. Those first few years of contributions set us up for life. If I dropped my TSP contributions to 5% and we stopped all other contributions, our combined retirement savings are on track to still grow to ~$4.9M (all projections in inflation-adjusted, 2024 dollars) by the time we hit age 57. 
 
We don't feel like those contributions currently hold us back though, so we still make them. With our current savings rate we‚Äôre on track to have ~$3.7M by age 45, though we‚Äôll probably back off on our savings well before that due to lifestyle changes like kids. Halving our savings rate starting today would put us at ~$2.7M at 45, which should still be more than enough for us to retire if wanted.
 
The biggest factor (beyond making enough money TO invest, which we‚Äôre grateful we do) is investing early. Investing $1k/mo from age 25-35, then nothing from age 35-65 results in more money (~$1.4M) than investing $1k/mo from age 35-65 (~$1.2M). 
 
**Net Worth:**
 
The S&P500 was up ~24% in 2023, so my net worth jumped to $490k. My fianc√©e's net worth jumped to $244.5k to give us a combined net worth of $734.5k at year-end. With the continued market growth, we‚Äôve since crested $750k!
  
We‚Äôre going to get married this year, but I plan to continue posting annual updates outlining my accounts (to demonstrate how I‚Äôm progressing with a federal accounting career). We plan to keep our accounts mostly separate, which will make record keeping easier.
 
Here is my updated net worth tracker. (Note that in the past I was unsure how to value my pension, so I always just left it out. It‚Äôs become sizeable at this point though, so I decided to add a line item for the refundable cash value of my pension contributions. I went through my leave statements to add the historical value for each year)

**FAQs:**
Did you live at home? In community college, yes. After that, no. After moving to DC I split a 2br/1ba apartment with a co-worker to save $$$. A few years later my fianc√©e and I moved into a 1br apartment together.

Did you parents support you financially? Yes. I was given a car (98-02 accord) in HS which I kept until 2020. My parents also paid for my first year of rent when I moved away for college. After graduating (with $23k in student loans), the only ongoing financial support I received was staying on the family phone and Netflix plan for several years. I would have lived at home if I could, but a several-hundred-mile commute would have been a bit much.

Did you gamble in crypto, meme stocks, etc? No. VTSAX and chill. (shoutout to /u/ALL_IN_VTSAX)

How did your traditional IRA go from $0 in 2018 to $12,538 in 2019? The IRS allows IRA contributions for the PY until approximately April 15th. For 2016 through 2018 I was always a year behind on contributions. By 2019 my salary had grown enough to catch up and I made 2 years of contributions (2018 and 2019) in 2019.

You don‚Äôt have kids, do you? Nope, not yet.
A rare r/accounting success story. Congratulations on your success so far.
I thought this was /r/financialindependence for a second
how the heck did you put $20k+ into retirement in year 1? i made 52k starting out in 2013, living on my own in a new city. I lived pretty frugally and had so little left over at the end of each month and that was barely contributing to retirement
I‚Äôm about 2 years into my bachelors degree and I really appreciate this post. I don‚Äôt really want to go public and give up all my free time either, your route sounds perfect to me.
Congrats, this is a great post if you were secretly an IRS recruiter trying to snag those burn out tax accountants this year lol.

Congrats all the same. When you look to move I‚Äôll throw out Oregon is not bad if you live almost anywhere on the I-5 corridor you‚Äôll be in the Portland metro locality pay or close to it without living in a major metro. 

Highly recommend this state for level headed and decent folk.
Plot twist- the Fed Gov marketing Dept at work.
Can you break out the GS level/step increases you‚Äôve gone through since starting? Looking to move to move to Fed specifically as an auditor myself
Come over and join /r/bogleheads if you're into the VTSAX and chill lifestyle!
This reads very close to a friend of mine who went to the State Auditors of Texas, slow grind to  max tier and their collective network is probably about 200k above yours after some yolo throws at the Game Stop meme stonks.   


We need more higher quality breakdowns like this.
OP thanks for sharing this - I went the non-public route into industry and transitioned into an accounting analytics focused track. It's very cool / interesting to see how other people approached their careers and nice to see a gov. success story. Do you get a pension with this work too?
Take note PA folks!

Slow is smooth as in: little here, little there is GOOD PROGRESS. it's not radical, but it is so subtle, you won't notice until you look back. 

Smooth is Fast - Enough time goes by soo fast. Smooth beats Erratic ups & downs. Life is a marathon, not a sprint. 

Congratulations to you. Got wedding invites? Lol
I‚Äôm getting out of public in around 3 weeks (boss doesn‚Äôt know it yet) and will be going into governmental. Taking a few thousand dollar a year pay cut, but I‚Äôll be working around 300 less hours a year, so I feel like that‚Äôs a good trade off. That and the bennies are what really sold me.
The lady who cuts my hair told me her daughter is a government accountant for a DOT in a city that partners with uber. The pay is like 90k and the benefits are amazing. Government benefits plus free uber, and I believe she even said an "unlimited PTO" program they had too, where you can take a pay cut for a bit and go work remote on vacation if you need a break. Very, very solid in my opinion.
yes thank you as i struggle due to my first layoff after only being a staff accountant for 8 months and being a new grad for also 8 months. Also looking forward to meeting my future spouse as well! ü§£ time for me to go government as well.
The fed job + TSP is working out great for ya

Congrats on the engagement
Congrats OP! As a personal finance nerd, this breakdown was amazing. Also love to see these increases without a home as a source of your net worth.

  
Curious to understand the source of your brokerage deposit from 2019-2020. Was that a bonus of some sorts or just savings?
At what point in your schooling did you begin to apply for internships? If anyone else knows when you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to I‚Äôd appreciate it too
Just wait for the paternity benefits.  My grand babies love having a dad who is present.
Based 0511 gang gang represent
I recruited for a CPA federal contractor in the dc area before making the move to a top 10. Once you retire from the Gov, you‚Äôll be able to have a pick at any role you want, including remote. We used to just throw money at any Gov auditor because of the limited pool, especially if you have a clearance. This is the exact plan I shared with my sister who is currently on the accounting route. Love to see it!
As an 0501 myself, I concur that the government route is great. Obviously less pay than PA/industry but the work-life balance and benefits are awesome. Also covered a good chunk of my masters degree so I was able to graduate with no debt
There is no way you can go from -20k to $490k on a government salary (gs 12 no less) in 7 years. You say you did the max TSP and IRA each year since 2017. Idk what you started as,  but from the comments it was $60k and calculated at $26,900 savings.  And with taxes you make far less than $60k, especially living in DMV. With $850 in rent monthly, that leaves very very little leftover. I‚Äôm calling bullshit on this. You had to have gotten money to start out otherwise this is way way too easy. 

This isnt adding up. I‚Äôm at $140k salary saving the max in TSP, IRA, and contributing $500 weekly to mutual funds and all my accounts don‚Äôt add up to $490k. I‚Äôm 9 years in the government. My shit didn‚Äôt grow at 23% yoy like yours did even tho we‚Äôre in the same tsp (I‚Äôve been 100% C fund since 2017 also). 

C‚Äômon who is buying this????

$40k net worth swing in the first year making $60k and paying $850 in monthly rent lmao GTFO
Math doesn‚Äôt really make sense. You‚Äôre managing to save >75% of your post tax income every year?
Congrats, this is the path I wish I could‚Äôve taken but didn‚Äôt get my citizenship till recently so I was never eligible. I‚Äôm now trying to get a federal job while somehow not eating too big a pay cut (also have 7 YOE) but seems nearly impossible to land a GS 13 position as a first time fed or negotiate starting step at a lower grade.

Question. Based on your salary it sounds like you‚Äôre a 12 step 4 or 5. How come you haven‚Äôt pushed for a 13? From what I understand there are plenty of 13s openings in the DMV (I also live here). Are you just not looking for additional work/responsibility?

Also kinda sounds like you work for the DCAA. I interviewed with them a couple weeks ago and waiting to hear back lol.
Any advice for people in their 40s who want to go to gov accounting and who have little experience?
Yes to not looking down on federal government work.  Steady, stable, excellent quality of life, great benefits.
Congrats - I'm doing something very similar in government, but as a single person!
Thank you so much for sharing this. It was a much needed experience to read. I am just now venturing into accounting, looking into schools to complete the remaining credits to finish. I mostly see a lot of posts on the negatives of being an accountant, and a lot has to do with PA, which I really have no interest in. Congrats and keep up the great work
I'm with you. Not federal government but I work for a municipality. 2.5 years in I'm at $75k. No masters or CPA. Great work/life balance. I'm always busy which can get old but it's great experience if ever want to move on
Saving this for inspiration. I‚Äôm 30 but no where near where you‚Äôre at.
Im from an hcol area 120k is barely getting by out here a person making under 110k is considered low income public accounting kinda seems like the only way to make a livable salary in the Bay Area and 60k is poverty salary out here most public firms paying close to 90k starting out here. I got friends in fast food who making 55k-70k in the Bay Area. Idk how u afforded to live in hcol on 60k that‚Äôs insane
Ehh not too interested in obtaining as much net worth as possible, very interested in the work from home with 6 figure pay though! That would be life changing, especially in raising a family. Congrats.
[deleted]
Congratulations and great story, so inspiring! I just got into Fed govt in early 30's and wish I was able to do so sooner, but I am grateful for every minute after leaving private sector.
Working a 9-5 govt job is so great.  So many holidays, weekends and time off available.  Not to mention great retirement and healthcare plans.
This is a great success story. Great financial and quality of life situation for the both of you. You guys are setup for success.
I‚Äôm in college right now and while I‚Äôve been thoroughly convinced that PA isn‚Äôt for me, this is EXACTLY my idea of a career. I‚Äôm not an ambitious person, and I simply want to give myself and hopefully a family a good life. What kinds of grades did you have in college? What did your resume look like? Any advice for a college sophomore?
Nice. I‚Äôm looking to go too in a year. Obviously it‚Äôs late at 36 but whatever.
+1 for ‚Äúdecided fuck PA‚Äù LOL
It's a testament to your ability to save and financial acumen. 

Kids will run you a good chunk of change. $2,400 per month for daycare full time. We have two now.... Our savings potential will increase significantly when that falls off soon. 

Keep at it! are you using a tracker anywhere? I run most our stuff through Quicken.
Good for you man! I‚Äôm also slowly adopting the financial independence life. Just can‚Äôt shake the feeling of being trapped by having to work all week. Also adds a lot of confidence so we don‚Äôt feel like slaves to our employers when we have 5 or 10 years of expenses saved up. 

I‚Äôve always debated government at the local level but we‚Äôll see. 

Also would love to just get into the trades for fun to be able to just work on houses and stack up some rentals. Office work is mental torture.
Hey man, thanks for sharing. Just wondering why you chose to prioritize retirement over paying off student loans? I'm in a similar boat and will have about 40k and not sure if I should throw all my savings at it right away when I graduate. Appreciate it!
Thank you for sharing this!
This is nice content. I am in a similar position, but have two kids already, less income (LCOL area though), and did do the PA grind to start. When my wife and I met in 2017 we had a combined net worth of about negative $70k. Now 6 and a half years later we have a net worth of around $400k and are on track to be able to retire by the time we are mid to late fifties. 

The nicest part of this is that the career path I am on now is enjoyable for the most part and the thought of being here until I am fifty five doesn‚Äôt seem so bad!
Happy for you op!
Do you happen to know if there‚Äôs an advantage to working for the Federal government as opposed to a state government? I assume it depends on the state but on average, which path offers better compensation?
Congratulations. I worked federal government for 6 1/2 years and hated it but I‚Äôm glad it is working out for you. I also appreciate it when we have someone that hasn‚Äôt job hopped a ton. It seems that is all Reddit is obsessed with.
A lot of people can't comprehend saving this much money. Everyone's situation is different, but this is a perfect example of the progress you can make if you prioritize saving. Excellent job.
I love this so much. Thank you for sharing!
I really hope you make it out of the DMV to your dream of living in TBD. 

Also proud of your 700k net worth you have accumulated while still paying student loans off as of last year.

Also tl;dr.
Does the fed have a pension?
Living the dream. Hope to join you soon.
Hey congrats OP, I‚Äôm seeing this from the popular page but love to see the success. 

If you‚Äôre looking for a MCOL area, I‚Äôve personally loved the twin cities in Minnesota. Biggest factor is the winter, but if that‚Äôs not a dealbreaker then I think we have some of the best amenities for the cost. 

I‚Äôm not even three years out of college and make around 65k salary but have about 60k saved up and am looking to buy a house in the next year or so. 

Good luck on your journey!
holy shit dude! amazing!!
I feel like this an important thing (even moreso than financial support) you didn't bring up: did either of you utilize connections or were your promotions purely based on merit?
time well spent meeting SO, good job OP!
Good for you! My wife and I make more, and also have a lower net worth than you do. Way to diligently save and not allow lifestyle creep to get in the way.
I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how you started at 60k out of the gate 7 years ago. 

I interviewed for a staff accountant role last week and at 04-20 it starts at like 41k. I‚Äôll probably end up as an accounting technician and it starts at 35k lol.
>¬†My fianc√©e is a teacher so we plan to move out of the DMV this summer to a MCOL area. The specific city is still TBD.

Just putting my pitch in for ABQ, NM or Lad Cruces, NM.¬†

Come on out here. Plenty of government auditing work, and a good MCOL without yet having the city too big to be able to leave / explore the outdoors from.¬†
Love to hear it in this sub! Gives me hope for my own future despite being a fair bit behind at 6 years into my career
Sounds like me but in Aus, might take me a little longer but I hope to get there!
Damn dude, you're my fucking hero. Having a good wlb is the only reason why I put up with how boring accounting is. Once I'm done with school I want to work for the IRS or any federal agency that'll take me. Thanks for the inspiration, you a real one!¬†
You know what you want, have a plan that you track and stick to, and are accomplishing your goals. Awesome job!
Congrats on the success! I‚Äôm mostly commenting bc we almost twinning on the usernames ü§£
What‚Äôs your TSP investment strategy like?
Congrats! Awesome to hear a success story! 

My wife and I have a similar story. (32M, 700k net worth, skipped PA and went straight to industry). Totally possible for everyone!
Sounds awesome. Remote is true freedom
Congrats bud! Well done.
I am in college rn, and have been looking at internships, will definitely check out government now
That‚Äôs the only trick in this game.
Dang, I‚Äôm an 0512. Would love to get out of that type of auditing though.
OP tripled his brokerage in 3 years lol this shit is so fake. He has over quadruple his salary in assets in 7 years despite starting at 60k. GS 12S5 is $112k. Which means he‚Äôs been making $100k for only a couple years. How can anyone believe this? I‚Äôm also in VTSAX for way over 3 years; my wife and I contribute ~~$1500~~ $3000 monthly and we‚Äôre sitting at $100k. TSP gains $40-80k a year! In what world? You can only contribute 22500 with 5% match. Starts out with $24k with 1000% returns to make it to $240k in 6 years. Bro. 

Fuck outta here with this bullshit. None of this adds up.

EDIT: I checked my vanguard. I started in 2019 VTSAX. I have 10% gains all time (20k). Somehow this dude starts with $29k and nearly triples his account in 3 years despite us being in the same account and by looking at the comments, our contributions are similar!
To reinforce this person's account, I have a similar success story in government work. Unfortunately, I didn't start in my current job out of college. I was an AP/AR clerk for a couple of years first. My short account:

Job:

My job in government only requires a financial related degree with 6 to 9 hours of accounting credit hours. I only hold a bachelors degree in accounting with a minor in finance. I am not a CPA. All hard skills that are needed are provided by on the job training. I had zero work or school experience for the industry that I regulate in my job. There are a series of tests that are needed to be complete to be 'certified' in my role, but again, training is provided on the job that contains this knowledge.

Pay:

I am now 5.5 years in and gross $89 thousand a year and have an already approved bump to $93 thousand starting in September this year. I expect to hit about $115 thousand at my 7.5 year mark. The current entry-level salary is $61 thousand, with an approved 5% bump in September.

Work-Life Balance:

I work maybe 25 to 30 ***true*** work hours each week, as I am efficient in completing my deliverables of good quality. There are times when I'll need to work 45 to 50 hours in a week, but that only happens a few times a year and only for a week (perhaps some of a second week) at a time. 

My office works on a flex schedule. Monday through Thursday, we are scheduled to work 9 hours. Then on Fridays, we alternate working 8 hours and having the Friday off. I currently get 13 vacation days and about 10 days worth of sick leave a year. Sick leave never expires and rolls year to year. Vacation days don't expire, but they do convert to sick leave after a ceiling that increases with tenure. Due to the flex Fridays, I use a lot less vacation time than my spouse does. This is the first year I'm projecting to lose vacation time to sick time (I'm not going to use enough to not let it happen).

There is a lot of overnight travel. Never on weekends, but usually one to two weeks out of the month, depending on the schedule. Over the last 12 months, I've stayed in a hotel about 55 nights. Our work from home ability is still generous but in flux right now. When not onsite, we are allowed to WFH except for one core day in the office. New hires are 100% in the office for the first year, with it loosening up throughout the second year.
Going reliably remote is a big benefit for a GS job, IMO.  The locality adjustments do NOT cover the increased cost for most areas.

I'm amazed you managed to start at GS 10 out of school without a CPA.  The IRS wouldn't even look at me when I was applying for GS-7 jobs *with* a CPA.
I left accounting. PA is a cancer mainly for management.
True wealth is built on those that discipline themselves every day on a slow and steady approach.

Thank you for sharing your story.
Congrats, my guy!  To your continued health and success!
Thanks for the share, friend!
This is awesome. You make a great living but you‚Äôre clearly staying within your means too. Love hearing this stuff
Your lifestyle, in terms of making enough money to live off of, is exactly what I‚Äôm aiming for. Seeing posts like these are what I need to fuel the fire. Definitely saving this post in one of my folders to look back on whenever I get unmotivated. I wish you continued success in your life.
I sounds like your net worth is more related to living below your means and investing reasonably than career choice or work-life balance. Congrats on job well done.¬†
You don‚Äôt have kids, yet, you say, is that why you have so much in your HSA?

Do you own a house?  Do you have equity in that?
[deleted]
Dude, currently interning for a public company and this post convinced me what I‚Äôve been thinking the whole time. Federal all the way, applying for summer internships with the government right now. I was honestly feeling kinda worried about my future if I stuck with public but this post gives me new hopes. Thanks for sharing man.
I would like to thank you for keeping this tradition going. It really motivates me to switch to government and will be doing so this year. I felt like I was losing out if I didn't stay but honestly would rather have that amazing work-life balance. The Pay is reasonable and hour are more managable.
OP definitely leaving some key details out here lol. But ok great for you.
Good LARP OP. I make similar salary to you in a not VHCOL city and there is a zero % chance you have a ~750k net worth at 30 years old with the things you described. Math doesn‚Äôt math. I don‚Äôt know why more people aren‚Äôt saying this.
Sounds like promoted advertising. Maybe it‚Äôs just for me.
That‚Äôs amazing! Good for you!
This is exactly what I want. A comfortable WLB and decent enough salary and job security..100% remote would be great too. How often do these positions come open? I‚Äôm contemplating what to get a degree in for a career change
Hey OP, I‚Äôm going to start looking at government jobs. Industry is taking its toll after 8 years.  I don‚Äôt like the politics game and feel like I‚Äôm underpaid so it‚Äôs time to jump ship.  

Any advice?
I didn't read anything past your first statement why would you put your net worth down? That gives away your insecurity your stupidity the fact that you're an unconscious incompetent you have no idea that you have no idea and money cannot change that
This is a great write up and I couldn‚Äôt be happier for you. I am starting my federal government job next week Monday and am so excited. I wish more colleges/universities would explain to students what government work is like instead of pushing students to go work in Big 4 or public accounting or making it seem like they need to work in a F500 or better company to be successful (or maybe that was just my university). Had I known then what I knew now I would‚Äôve went straight to the federal government when I graduated instead of doing it now at almost 40 years old.

Edit: and I just remembered that when I was taking my government accounting class the teacher specifically said that what we are learning is useful only if we wanted to work for the government which he didn‚Äôt recommend because it didn‚Äôt pay well and it wouldn‚Äôt look good on our resumes if we wanted to eventually work for a public accounting firm or for an industry company. I feel like a fool for listening and believing what he was saying and I have a feeling that the rest of my peers did as well since none of us are in or even considered government work.
I‚Äôm about to lap this networth in one crypto bullrun cycle lolz

Imagine slaving in a cubicle for a decade only to get lapped by a bum with no bachelors degree by trading shyt coins on pancake swap while laying and sunning his ballz on a balcony
7 years in and only making $114 in a VHCOL...I couldn't do it.
Step 1: Have a job that pays a fuck ton. Thanks. Lol
How much are you saving as a percentage and dollar amount? Curious to what‚Äôs contributions and market growth.
What agency do you work for?
I‚Äôve been thinking of going into government. ¬†Do you have any advice on how to get my foot in the door? ¬†I‚Äôm a CPA with about 7 years of experience working for a local firm.
Hello I know you‚Äôre being bombarded by other comments as this blew up but are you able to simply choose to work more? I mean overtime would be great if for example there‚Äôs nothing special happening in the day
Last 10 years of historic stock market growth is the story, but good savings discipline.
Can I DM you?
Refer me please ü•πü•πü•πü•πüòÇ
Going to guess no kids.
This is the way
Is Federal better than State?
Questions out of curiosity. I'm too far into my career now but I considered federal government a year or two out of school and kind of wish I had taken that path.


Do you feel like the technology is completely outdated?¬†


Is there room for future growth, or do you have to wait decades for someone to retire?¬†


Have you ever been affected by a government shutdown?



Do you feel like your work has some level of impact and you contribute? (I mean in public and Industry it doesn't feel super meaningful, but at least I get to see the project to completion and the entity keeps its financing and keeps paying my check)
Thanks for your story.¬† This stuff is the best thing about this sub...telling your story and giving guidance on how others can do it.


One question on the pension--so you contribute to it?¬† I thought that was something you just vest in and work towards full vesting after ~20 years?¬† Never worked anywhere that offered a pension, so really not familiar with how it works.
Thanks for the report
I wanted an 0511 job, but couldn‚Äôt get in. I have internal audit experience, but I guess that‚Äôs not enough. I‚Äôm starting as a revenue agent soon. 

My current plan is to either become a supervisor, or switch to an 1811 position.
What kind of background check did you need to go through for a government job?
How much do you pay each year for health insurance working for the feds? My guess is almost nothing. That‚Äôs where you are likely making it compared to us corporate folks.
ü´°
2.2m networth liquid at 22
*as of 12/31/2023
Any tips on how to get an accounting job in the federal government? I graduate in the summer and would like to go this route over any other! TIA
I was a 0511 code, what agency are you with?
nice. I'm at 94k net worth with 1 year 2 month exp.
Have you posted this before? I feel like I recognize it for some reason.

Edit:
I was digging through my saved posts, nice to get an update on the net worth and future plans for your career and life. I actually started looking at Federal Government Jobs in my state after I read your post but I am keeping it on the backend since PA is alright as of now for me. Great career none the less.
TSP is no joke. Just got my annual statement from my TSP I left behind when I transitioned out of fed and into industry and I‚Äôm up 23% for the year‚Ä¶I believe im 100% in invested in L. I wish I could contribute to it still but once you leave fed apparently you can‚Äôt add to your TSP.
Do you plan on purchasing a home?
I'm reading this and blown away

How can someone with 7 years of experience in data analytics / engineering get involved in this?
how do you manage to go away or do things with such a massive chunk of your income going to savings? Do you pay rent?
At gs 12 you ot pays straight time, not 1.5
The main thing is how to get in for people that dont start in government. Also, do they match your  pay if your coming for public. Im four months in PA and i know it wasnt for me when i joined. Im waiting to hit my one year anniversary before looking into government. My biggest concern is the pay cut.
what does PA mean?
Thanks!
Was there a lot of training for your position? Just wondering if it's similar process as revenue agent where they train you from a to z.
Who cares
This is a great post. Congratulations. Do you ever feel like you have too much cash on hand? In other words, what wins between keeping $40k+ cash on hand available or even in a 5% HYSA (which does come with more withdrawal restrictions) versus putting it to work in a taxable account or buying real estate or whatever?
I thought you were saying fuck Pennsylvania, and was gonna jump on it. Never mind.
>Did you parents support you financially? Yes. I was given a car (98-02 accord) in HS which I kept until 2020. My parents also paid for my first year of rent when I moved away for college. After graduating (with $23k in student loans), the only ongoing financial support I received was staying on the family phone and Netflix plan for several years. I would have lived at home if I could, but a several-hundred-mile commute would have been a bit much.

This to me is not what people mean by "did your parents support you".  They sound like loving caring parents but you really didn't "take" much tbh.
Fed post telling you to be a slave and never better yourself.
So is your main investment strategy for your Roth IRA VTSAX and Chill?
Thank you! This sub can get pretty down, so I want to show that a good accounting career and work-life-balance is achievable. You don't have to grind out your 20s in PA to land a sweet gig.
It's not rare.

Most people don't share.

Complainers get the most airtime.
dude, that's survivorship bias. /r accounting is like yahoo questions. folks complain about a problem until they figure out how to fix it and then you never hear from them again.

congratulations to OP, but success around here isn't rare. i would posit that the vast majority of accountants here have a better quality of life than people in most other job fields.
That did stand out to me, but I did look back and I was renting a place for $800 then so I guess it's not completely out of the question when making $60k and some very frugal living.

Edit: Actually it says they live in the DMV so I'm guessing either roommate or splitting rent with girlfriend.
The first year was absolutely not easy and took a LOT of planning. I would not do it again today lol. I just looked at my pay stubs for 2017 and my take-home pay (after maxing TSP and HSA) was $897.20 bi-weekly. IIRC my rent (which included all utilities) was about $850/mo (split a 2br/1ba with a coworker). That left me with about $944/mo left to cover everything else. 

I took metro to work (covered by a work benefit), so no transport costs, and I also got a large discount on auto insurance since my car was leisure only. Parking at the apartment was free. I very rarely ate out and brown bagged all my work lunches. I meal prepped most of my dinners as well. I rarely drank. I would either walk to the grocery store a few blocks away or drive to ALDIs with my roommate for super cheap groceries. For that first year I mostly just hungout with my roommate and or friends at their apartments or free things like DC museums or parks or hikes.

I probably could have taken it wayyy easier and still been close to where I am today, but I was determined to hit my goal of maxing out all retirement accounts.

By early 2018 my bi-weekly takehome pay had risen to $1,263.48 but my fixed costs remained low, so I had way more ($1,676) income to spend.
I also graduated in 2013, at the time I was only making $35k a year from two part-time jobs. I think I saved like $3,600 that year and even that felt like a major accomplishment. Frugal living only gets you so far, at some point you just need to increase your income.
It‚Äôs possible, I made around $60k my first year and paid $500/month living with 5 housemates. Sounds terrible but in reality they were all my friends so I actually really enjoyed it at the time while investing the majority of my money so win-win
I‚Äôve been maxing out my 401k and IRA deferrals since going full time in 2017. ¬†Starting salary was $51.5k. ¬†It‚Äôs absolutely doable. ¬†It helps that I don‚Äôt have student loans. ¬†My mortgage payment at the time was about $1,100/month.
Yea this post really gives me hope, I graduated two years ago but signed a 4-year post college Army contract so I wouldn‚Äôt have as much student loans. It can truly be hell here and idk if I would want to have to repeat going through something grueling (like public) again for an extra few years just to earn $50k more than gov work. But knowing in just a couple years I‚Äôll be able to start paving my own way gives me immeasurable solace and gets me thru the week
I feel like college makes it seem like that‚Äôs the only option. Not necessary anymore, there are tons of routes you can take.
Start looking into those fed internships like OP did!üëç Or at least be familiar that it's there. Usajobs.gov 
Reading through the entire post, maybe your state government does something similar too.
Nah, I'm a gs-14 in job series code 0512 and echo OPs sentiments. Unfortunately, I didn't arrive until I was 31. Wished I found it sooner.
No such thing lol
I basically rode a GS 10 to GS 12 ladder for my first 2 years. I'm at GS12, step 5, today.
There is nothing to discuss on that sub LOL. Its either VT or VTSAX and chill.
Nice, State Auditor's offices are also great examples of solid government jobs. I've had co-workers come and go to SAOs. And with the GME, sometimes it's better to be lucky than good lol. Congrats to him!
Yup, we pay 4.4% of our salary towards the pension. The payout formula is basically: 1% X years worked X final 3-years average salary.
Government jobs really are fantastic. I‚Äôm currently an accounting major, but I‚Äôm also a veteran. The benefits and work life balance really are on another level. I‚Äôm doing ROTC while in school so I‚Äôll be going back into the military as an officer, but if for whatever reason that didn‚Äôt work, there‚Äôs 0 chance I would do anything but government work.
Sorry to hear that man, wishing you the best of luck. 2-player mode makes everything easier.
Thanks! I like reading other people's detailed breakdown charts so I decided I'd maintain one myself from day 1. The jump from 2019 to 2020 was due to the pandemic drop. I had been meaning to start a taxable brokerage for a while, then when the market was in freefall due to covid I jumped in. I transferred a large amount of my cash in and started automatic investments. By the end of the year my brokerage account had grown to $30k with the rebound and my cash had gotten back up to $20k.
I applied my junior year for a summer internship.
I don't know what to tell you man, my TSP annual account statement literally came in the mail yesterday. My "Personal Rate of Return" is listed as 24.93%.

I did not receive any money. I was extremely frugal and aggressive with my investments and tax planning.

All my accounts have their individual balances listed and all of them are achievable. I grossed $61,850 in 2017 (tiny bit of OT pay) and only paid $3,723 in federal income taxes for 2017, a 6% effective tax rate. Maxing my TSP, IRA, and HSA only 'cost' me $26,900 that year and the market grew 21% that year + my cash balance grew about $4k.

I'll be the first to say my savings were extremely aggressive the first couple years, but there's nothing impossible about what I did.

Someone else was questioning the growth of my taxable brokerage balances but it's right in line with the market. Here's the breakdown I gave them. You can do this for all my accounts.

>**2021:** I started with nearly $30k in the brokerage and in 2021 VTSAX returned 25.71%. That's about $7.7k in returns, not considering the returns earned on contributions through the year. I just went back to look at my brokerage history and for 2021 I contributed $14,750 (It looks like I was still DCA'ing some cash above my set $200/week).

>$29,868 (starting) + $7,679 (gains on starting) + $14,750 (contributions) = $52,297. Basically what I arrived at in real life.

>**2022:** VTSAX returned -19.53%, that's about a $10k loss and I contributed $10,860. My balance stayed flat, as you can see in the table.

>**2023:** VTSAX returned 26.01% (about $14k return on starting amount) and I contributed $9,400. That puts me right at $77k. Add a little more for gains on contributions during the year and you're there.
Nah, I think I'm at about 40-45% savings rate. You're missing the market growth. 2023 returned 24% and I started the year with $350k in assets. That's approximately $84k in growth. Most of that return came in the final couple months too, so I had most of my TSP / IRA / HSA contributions already made for the year which means market growth accounted for even more.

Edit: VTSAX was actually up 26% for 2023, so that would be $91k in growth.
You're correct, I'm a GS 12 step 5 right now. If I switched agencies I could probably land a 13, but I'm comfortable where I'm at. At some point I'll make 13 here. Good luck with DCAA!
I'd say be open to federal, state, and local jobs - anything to get your foot in the door and get some experience. Federal will probably be challenging to get in without much experience since there are usually a lot of qualified applicants. All federal jobs are posted to USAJOBS.gov. For state and local, I don't know where they get posted.
Great, this is what I was hoping to hear. Good luck with finishing your degree!
Luckily DC rents are (and were) significantly cheaper than the bay area. My rent was $850/mo IIRC to split a 2br/1ba with a co-worker. My car was paid off and I took the metro to work (paid for via a work travel stipend). My fixed costs were very low.
Wow, congrats!
Thanks, best of luck with your career!
I am only pissed I didn‚Äôt go straight to government. I did public accounting first and then private industry. I am 50 and have staff who can retire super young making $140k a year in pension for life.
I was a B student in my accounting classes. My final GPA was around 3.2. As a sophomore you may still qualify for some internships, so it's worth looking around.
Ugh, the childcare is a savings-killer. We just have the one, but the cost is similar to what you referenced. It's basically like adding a second mortgage, but the alternative is for one of us to not work. As long as neither of us is making less than the monthly cost of childcare, we're still ultimately making more money having our kid in preschool than not. Besides the cost, we also feel like there's a lot of educational and social benefit to being in preschool, that our child simply wouldn't get at home.

Still, Kindergarten starts in September and we couldn't be more excited to get rid of that monthly expense.
Thanks! Luckily I didn't have to figure too much stuff out myself, I followed those who came before me on /r/financialindependence. For tracking, I just use good ole excel. If I'm curious I'll do an ad-hoc sum, but the only set schedule I follow is logging the balance of everything on 12/31 into a sheet. It's a fun new years tradition for me at this point.
Yes, I try to learn physical skills on the side. Every time something breaks its an opportunity to learn. I had an old Samsung flat screen that broke due to a known issue with a capacitor going bad. I bought a replacement cap and a soldering iron online. I had never soldered before, but it was an opportunity to learn. Same thing when a window motor broke on my old car.
Any 'public service' job gets their loans paid off after 10 years so I'm guessing that's the reason.
Good question! Federal agencies have a student loan repayment program (SLRP). When I ran the numbers (years ago) it looked to be more efficient to pay the standard amount on my loans and get as much out of the SLRP as possible.

Also, with $40k you should consider public service loan forgiveness. After 10 years of government work your remaining federal student loans are forgiven. Keeping your payments as low as possible for 10 years might even be more beneficial.
I couldn't tell you. Depends on what you want, each state will be slightly different too. State Auditor's Offices are usually a good bet too though. I've had co-workers leave for and come from State Auditors.
Yes, they take 4.4% of your salary to fund it. The payout formula is basically 1% x years worked x average of final 3 years salary.
The popular page? And thanks for the recommendation. Best of luck on your journey too!
Good question, but I've never been promoted like you're thinking. I've gone from GS-10 to GS-12 for meeting performance expectations, but promoting to GS-13 is competitive and I haven't been selected for that yet. Nepotism in the federal government is a huge no-no too.

My fianc√©e is a public school teacher and teachers don't get promotions.
Cheers!
I did 72% C / 18% S / 10% F for a while, but eventually decided to drop F and just go 80% C / 20% S on all new contributions. F fund only makes up 5% of my TSP now.
Good luck making the switch if that's what you want.
I don't know why this seems unreasonable. 

2021: I started with nearly $30k in the brokerage and in 2021 VTSAX returned 25.71%. That's about $7.7k in returns, not considering the returns earned on contributions through the year. I just went back to look at my brokerage history and for 2021 I contributed $14,750 (It looks like I was still DCA'ing some cash above my set $200/week).

$29,868 (starting) + $7,679 (gains on starting) + $14,750 (contributions) = $52,297. Basically what I arrived at in real life.

2022: VTSAX returned -19.53%, that's about a $10k loss and I contributed $10,860. My balance stayed flat, as you can see in the table.

2023: VTSAX returned 26.01% (about $14k return on starting amount) and I contributed $9,400. That puts me right at $77k. Add a little more for gains on contributions during the year and you're there.
I started at what was equivalent to GS-10 as I had another offer for the same amount.
Wishing you the best of luck!
HSAs are triple tax advantaged. In a way they're actually an S-tier retirement account, so I treat mine that way. I still have had medical expenses on my own, but I never withdraw from my HSA. I pay all medical bills out of pocket.

We don't own a house, we're still renters.
The same way anyone does. A person can *always* contribute to a traditional IRA. What you can't always do is deduct those contributions.

I think might also be assuming that being covered by a retirement plan via work (like Feds are) makes you ineligible to deduct the contributions to a traditional IRA, but that's not the case. The actual rule is that if a person is covered by a retirement plan at work, they are subject to a phase out on how much of the IRA maximum contribution they can deduct. The phaseout is based on your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) which gives you a lot of wiggle room.

The phaseout for single filers 2023 started at $73k MAGI, which means if a person maxes out their TSP ($23k), HSA (we'll say $3k), and pays $1,800 in health insurance premiums - they could gross $100,800 and still wind up with a MAGI of $73,000 allowing them to take the full traditional IRA deduction. (Further reducing their AGI to $66,000 - talk about major tax savings!)

See: https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/2023-ira-deduction-limits-effect-of-modified-agi-on-deduction-if-you-are-covered-by-a-retirement-plan-at-work
Could you explain, I‚Äôm wondering what the catch is.

I started out in DC metro and I'm having a difficult time believing this as well.  Granted when I started, the GS-7 was around $36k a year.  Unless OP was living in the literal ghetto, I don't know where he could have lived where a 2br apartment split was $800 a month while still having access to metro.  I had to live off my credit cards for years because of how crappy the pay was compared to the absurd cost of living in DC area.
Thanks, and it's hard to say. Best advice is to check USAJOBS.gov often if you're interested in federal options. Jobs come and go all the time.
USAJOBS.gov is where all federal jobs are posted. There are lots of guides online about creating a resume for it. Jobs come and go all the time, so you'll want to check often.

For state and local, it's going to depend on the state or locality where the post their jobs.

Best of luck in your job search.
To your edit, I think your professor's sentiment is a big contributor of why there's such little student interest in government internships / jobs. I've gone to career fairs and it's a challenge to overcome these biases and get students to apply.

If it weren't for discussions on this sub I wouldn't have considered government either.
>I wish more colleges/universities would explain to students what government work is like instead of pushing students to go work in Big 4 or public accounting or making it seem like they need to work in a F500 or better company to be successful (or maybe that was just my university)

In my experience, many university accounting departments are basically set up to convince students that B4 and public accounting are the desirable endgames. Many profs at my university were Big 4 alumni, and while there are some who openly admit how horrible it was, most of them distribute the kool-aid quite effectively. The propaganda was so overwhelming, that kids would discount or even openly mock the warnings from our profs who were like "B4 isn't all it's cracked up to be". Furthermore, B4 firms contribute a lot to universities in the form of donations and sponsorships, just to keep the meat grinder pipeline full. It is in the university's (or more specifically, the accounting department's) interest to keep that money flowing, so of course they will not give an honest and accurate assessment of what life in PA is like beyond empty platitudes like "work hard, play hard". 

Frankly, I am not at all surprised that universities don't encourage government jobs, or even actively discourage students from going into them. The whole thing is set up to make government jobs feel like the "loser option" and for PA to feel like "what successful students strive for".
Let's goo
I contribute the IRS maximum to my TSP ($23,000) + 5% match ($5,700) + IRA ($7,000) + HSA ($4,150). That's $39,850. I also contribute around $10k/year to a taxable brokerage but that's variable. That comes to about $50k/year, which is about 44% of my new salary (39% from me, 5% from employer). 

My cash balance is continuing to grow too, so I am saving more than that, but it's not at a set rate.
For those with experience already the IRS is probably your bet shot, simply because they have the most openings. You should qualify for almost any accounting job on USAJOBS though, so I'd just check regularly.
As a CPA with 10 years experience in a tiny firm that I'm finally leaving due to succession problems, if you write a decent resume you should get GS-12 & 13 offers for Revenue Agent.  Use the USAJobs tool to make a resume, put in some fair detail on exactly what your work mix is, and attend some online events at [https://www.jobs.irs.gov/find-job/irs-events](https://www.jobs.irs.gov/find-job/irs-events) to get the recruiting email addresses.  Apply to both the USAJobs postings and export the resume to email it to them. Each major division (LB&I, SBSE, Exempt, and the weird unit that does excise/vehicle taxes) has their own email address.

Note that the jobs that deal with the excise & vehicle taxes have a lot of travel as compared to the others.  I'm not sure if that is the W&I division or not though as that doesn't quite fit what I remember.  W&I seems to be very unusual as that division isn't included in the Agent positions on USAJobs, or honestly *any* of the jobs I looked at over the last year from what I remember.

I found email gets a faster response.  It took basically 6-7 months to get interview requests by applying on USAJobs, but only 3-4 for the emails.  

LB&I is all GS-13 jobs, but the other divisions are getting some 13 positions that are non-manager when the past they tended to top out at 12.  

I went into a lot of detail on what return types I did, what attest engagements I did, what % of my time was on each, research skills, training experience, software implementation experience, etc.  You do have a character limit though.

There are other positions in appeals and such that can be found on the website, but I never heard back from them.  I guess even the 'open to the public' positions require some IRS experience for that or something.
No, in the federal government overtime is very strict. There must be a time-sensitive work requirement to justify paid overtime. There is another form, where you earn 1 hour of PTO per hour of OT. It's less paperwork, but your supervisor must still deem it necessary.
Absolutely, the resilience of the US stock market / economy is what got me here.
sure. Prefer PMs to Chats. I use old.reddit and chats can be buggy and not show notifications.
I couldn't tell you. Depends on what you want, each state will be slightly different too. State Auditor's Offices are usually a good bet too though. I've had co-workers leave for and come from State Auditors.
The technology isn't completely outdated, just moderately outdated. With a switch to Office 365 though, at least we can't fall behind with Excel anymore.

There is some room for growth, but nowhere near what it's like in public or industry. Uber achievers can still advance quickly, but for most people you're waiting for retirements to happen if you want to break into management level.

Yes, I have been through government shutdowns. It's one of the reasons I keep so much cash on hand.

Yes, I think we have an impact and that makes the job better. When we find errors in payments to vendors the government gets refunded and that's an actual savings to taxpayers. Controls are updated and the future risk drops.
There is a mandatory 4.4% contribution for the pension. I cannot raise or lower this amount. If you leave the federal government before retirement you have the option to forfeit the pension benefit and be refunded that 4.4%.
Congrats on the revenue agent job at least! /r/1811 is pretty active if you want to make that switch too.
I pay $71.45/paycheck ($1,857 annual) for a self-only high-deductible plan. Self plus one would cost ~$4k/year.
An internship or "Pathways" student / recent graduate job is usually the easiest way in. All federal jobs are posted to USAJOBS.gov. Postings come and go all the time, so it's good to check weekly.
Prefer not to say since I'm sharing so much info.
Wow, that's incredible! The first $100k is the hardest, enjoy the ride.
Yup, I‚Äôve done annual updates for the past several years. Hoping to continue making them. I hope PA continues to treat you well!
Eventually, which is why we plan to move to a MCOL area. Buying a house in the DMV doesn‚Äôt make financial sense for us.
If you‚Äôre talking about the work-life balance, USAJOBS is the way to a federal career. 

If you‚Äôre talking about the net worth, living below your means and investing the difference will get you there. Maximize the use of tax advantages accounts wherever possible.
We have a gross household income of around $184k now, of which about $77k goes to investments (Max both 401k, both IRA, HSA, and around $10k brokerage). That leaves plenty of cash flow for everything else.

We pay our own rent on a 2br/2ba townhouse.
Oh, sorry to hear that man. The government used to pay match, however that policy just ended around a month go.
Public Accounting (think Deloitte, EY, PWC, KPMG, etc.)
A good mix of formal training and on-the-job training.
Thanks, and yes. Ideally my cash position would be way less than the nearly 10% it is now. It's that way for a few reasons though:

1) Upcoming wedding. We're expecting to pay the vast majority ourselves.

2) Government shutdowns. I started cashing up even more than normal last year with all the recent shutdown close-calls. There is another shutdown risk coming on March 1st / March 8th.

3) House down-payment. We want to eventually buy a house, probably sometime in the next 3 years. I know this will be a big chunk of change, so I let my cash balance continue to grow. My retirement and brokerage accounts aren't exactly starved.

Lastly, most of the cash is earning 5.27% interest in the Vanguard settlement fund. There are no withdrawal restrictions. So having the cash doesn't hurt *as* bad.
I agree, however if I don't disclose that up front some people will treat it as a got-you. Living at home in community college and having my first year of university rent paid for is an advantage that not everyone gets.
Yup
Just turned in my two-weeks notice at at Big4 firm, and I‚Äôve been really stressing about my future. This post has definitely helped me out a little, so thanks :)
Is it ok to ask that where do you invest ypur money, I mean do you invest in etfs or any individual stocks?
thank you for sharing your story! Congratulations!
Dude, is there anyway I can connect with you? Be it formal or through social media. It‚Äôs refreshing to hear someone with a positive outlook in this profession.

I‚Äôm 25, changing careers, doing school while working as a project manager at a real estate firm. Ty!
I was being a bit facetious.
Yes, split a 2br/1ba with a co-worker for several years. My half of rent was $850/mo IIRC. Later on moved into a 1br with my GF.
Having roommates early on is an absolute game changer
Yeah, I agree I‚Äôm working on researching more of the available options right now
Already got my account on the site since I saw this post
How was it arriving later in the game?
I'm just starting out at GS 7! Currently 22.
What starting salary can you get working for fed? I have CPA with about 10 years of industry experience. No PA.
What‚Äôs vacation flexibility like? Are you able to take multiple weeks off?
Just started a GS-12 2210 series at 27 years old, I hope I'm doing everything right! I bumped my TSP contributions up to 10%, maxed out my Roth IRA two years in a row, throw 200$ a month in a brokerage account, have a CD but that's only at like 3%, and a bunch in savings, I feel like I'm missing some sort of investment opportunity though...
Was gs10 what you started out as fresh out of school? Mind if I shoot you a message later?
There's also VTI/VXUS and chill. Throw in some BND and chill too. Or VOO and relax. Or FZROX and....

Or asset and account allocation and planning etc. it's mostly VT/VTSAX/VTI/VXUS and chill though.
Well , job security + if you can deal with the bs - you are "guaranteed" to progress vs what I see as a total cluster fuck in other routes that never sound positive.   


At the end of the day, a job is a job - and I don't think people connect with the guaranteed XX amt at level XX.   


Personally, having worked at and with CPA firms - there is no security in the end unless you get your own CPA and work for yourself or if you plan to never work for yourself , the government jobs probably are ideal vs just bitching about how the partners make 10x off the work you do for them , because they hold the CPA license and you do not.
Ah I see it in the chart now, thanks for sharing
thank you! üòÉ trying to hang in there for the job search
Amazing stuff. Great timing on your part. How'd you invest that in brokerage if you don't mind me asking? All VTSAX or other vehicles?
I‚Äôm currently a junior in college, who has a internship lined up for a government position in public utilities. Im an Economics major, but this post has still made my day
So you saved 350k over 7 years where you made between 60 and 100k?

You realize that‚Äôs 50k per year right? You realize after taxes that‚Äôs well over 70% even considering gains?

I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick at all, I‚Äôm genuinely confused as to how you are coming out with 50k per year on 60k salary as 40% savings rate. That‚Äôs like 120% post tax lol
Thank you
I can only dream brother haha wish I was born like 10 years earlier 850 is less than what I‚Äôm paying in Pennsylvania not sure I‚Äôm gonna move back to the Bay Area after college cuz of the cost of living.
Tysm for the response!
Totally! It's wild I would love to see the financials of the daycare group we're paying. I doubt they're laughing to the bank but I still have trouble understanding all the costs that warrant such a tuition.
Nice. I reconcile our credit cards and accounts monthly and use Quicken to project our checking balance so it's always pushing to HYSA as much as possible. While also having enough to settle (sometimes large) credit card balances and other direct ACH's, like daycare and mortgage.
How competitive is the slrp application process. Recently started a new job with IRS but everyone in my group is to old to have first hand experience with loan repayment.¬†
Thank you for the answer! You‚Äôve definitely made me seriously consider government work. I graduate next year so I‚Äôve got a lot to think about.
Yeah I‚Äôm not subscribed to this subreddit but saw this post on the popular page of the Reddit app
Thank you for your answer!
Thank you for sharing! I was in life cycle funds for the first few years but changed to a C, S, I breakdown. I will consider adjusting again based on your success.

Well how would I know?  Lol
Can confirm, such places exist, in nice areas even. Mine back in 2014ish was $860 per month split for 2BR and walking distance to metro. The key is finding an older style apartment vs expensive fancy new construction AND with an existing lease so that you are replacing one departing roommate (so that 1 or more original leaseholders still there), so that a lease from years back (with 4% or so annual increase) is continued/amended vs inking a fresh lease for previously 100% vacated apartment at current market price. When my roommate and I both finally moved out, our leasing office must have been jumping for joy cause the lease with base rent from like 10 yrs ago was finally over since no one else stepped in to replace us.
Thanks! I‚Äôve been on there constantly looking at various positions for experience requirements
We gonna run the scoreboard on these humble braggers and weird flexers lol
Wow that‚Äôs impressive slow and steady seems to work. The doubling of the net worth YOY is very impressive I hope that happens I‚Äôm only 3 years into working and saving though so numbers are much lower
How do you fix your resume for a federal accounting position? üôÉ
I appreciate the advice.  Saving your comment.
Thanks! I'm in California but started out at 48k lol. Going to get bumped up to 62k next month but still pretty low. If I promote one more time and max out I'll be around 6 figures but federal does seem like it's pretty similar in terms of pay. They want us back into the office twice a week but if your position is moving to fully remote it seems like the way to go
Thanks! I‚Äôve checked it out before and will go back to it in the future. Once I finish the 3 yr incentive I was offered I‚Äôll look at other jobs
Yep I‚Äôm about $9k behind you assuming you are healthy when it comes to health insurance although my salary may be higher. Family plan (spouse + kids) runs about $6k in premiums plus $5k deductible which we hit every year (generally healthy but medically complex kids). 

If you move to a MCOL area you will want to do some research if your fianc√© wants to continue to work as a teacher as the teacher pay varies. In our area it‚Äôs really not worth it financially for someone to work as a teacher if you have 2 or more kids in daycare.
Okay, I‚Äôll go take a look/ monitor. Any advice on the resume?
Fair. I was in DoD but the bureaucracy of trying to get a 13 for a technical specialist or even AM because I was specialized in IT audit was stupid. I was at the cliff point to stay in or leave. I left to IA in corporate and it treated me well, definitely not crushed like a lot of other functions or public is. Enjoy the path friend
How much opportunity is there for an 0511 to get an overseas assignment and get housing paid for?
How much opportunity is there for an 0511 to get an overseas assignment and get housing paid for?
That‚Äôs awesome! Thanks for the response. I figured you had a good reason. I‚Äôll be honest I read your post like three times looking to see if you guys had bought a house, and figured part of it may be saving for a down payment. I wish you the best of luck!
My brokerage, IRAs, and HSA are all invested in total stock market index funds. (VTSAX wherever possible). I bought 1 share of GME but that was just me being silly. Everything else is total stock market index funds.

My TSP is 80% C fund and 20% S fund, which also approximates the total stock market.
OP wisely invests across the entire market. I do stock picking now and then to remind myself that I‚Äôm an idiot.
You're welcome to message me if you want.
This is giving me hope.

Will soon be on my own without financial support in my first PA job making 56/year, 1k~ish month rent, but I may have to pay additional costs in the form of having to buy a beater car and having 40k in student loans.

I have a saving grace though, my grandmother, a woman who worked up from a stay at home mother to a secretary taking night classes to a damn *CFO,* **back when it was still hard as shit for women no less‚Äî** left me a *huge* nest egg to the tune of roughly 100k in a retirement account. 

I‚Äôm wondering if I should take it all out, pay the taxes, pay my loans, re-invest the rest now in a Roth or something
It appears to be some kind of lost knowledge in this subreddit.
It was fine. I envision OP retiring at a young age and that sounds fantastic. Haha. 

In hindsight, everything happened just as it should have in order for me to flourish.
Fantastic. I know people here that started as GS5s that are now moving into GS14s now. Maybe that will be you someday.
I'm seeing most new hires (even with a CPA or decades of state auditor experience) come in at GS-13s from a job posting such as this one that is currently open:
Read more about Internal Revenue Agent (Examiner) - DIRECT HIRE (12 Month Register) AMENDED at https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/759198000

Please note, though, the GS-13 pay is different based on where you are applying to. Chicago costs more to live in than Indy, so gs-13 step 1 pays more in 
Chicago https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/24Tables/html/CHI.aspx

Than Indy
https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/24Tables/html/IND.aspx

All tables here
https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2024/general-schedule

It's important to note that the first three steps up to GS-13 Step 4 are "automatic" as long as your meeting the annual appraisal requirements. No need to apply, it just updates after each 12 month anniversary.  


I have zero knowledge about agencies outside of the IRS.
easily a GS-13 with that background
If you're saving in the CD and for expected upcoming expenses, like a car down-payment, then that's fine. Otherwise, I'd recommend throwing that money into the TSP. The tax savings are huge (probably ~22% to 30% savings on contributions for you) and the market growth dwarfs that interest rate (last year the market returned 26% vs your 3% CD rate). Overtime those bonuses really stack up.
Sure, prefer PM to Chats though. I use old.reddit so chats can be buggy and not show notifications.
Yeah but it seems it all just boils down to hold in the most diversified fund ever and go enjoy life
All VTSAX (except for 1 share of GME, which I lost money on)
My first year (2017) I saved the TSP limit ($18,000) + the IRA limit ($5,500) + the HSA limit ($3,400). That's $26,900, which is 44.8% of my $60k starting salary. My employer also tosses in a 5% TSP match, but that doesn't cost me anything.

Growth plays a huge role too. The HSA cap on contributions from 2017 to 2023 sums to $25,000 exactly, but I ended 2023 with $35.5k in my HSA. I wasn't very diligent with my HSA either, I left a lot in cash for a while and it wasn't until 2023 that I finally setup an auto investment. If I had done that from day 1 my HSA would be a good bit higher.
Building on what OP posted to you, I would pull up you state's .gov Web page, and find the link regarding job opportunities. Somewhere in that page would be a link specifically for state government jobs that are open to the public. Then do the same for the next government level down (county, for me) then local level. I'm doing this now myself, good luck to youüëç
$850 was my half of rent, sharing a 2br with a roommate. The same place is about $1200 per person now for a 2br apartment.
I don't have a ton of insight but in our case, my wife temporarily worked as a teacher at the daycare center our child attends. Her previous job paid more but she needed this experience as an "internship" to finish her degree, and they told her she was the highest paid teacher at the center at like...$18 an hour? Or something like that. This is in a HCOL area.

State law requires that for each classroom, there must be at least one teacher for every 10 kids. That means even with 11 kids, you need two teachers. Each kid presumably represents roughly the same monthly tuition of ~$2,200 so for every 10 kids, they're pulling in ~$22,000, or $264,000 annually. If your teachers are making $18/hr on the top end, that's $37,440 annually. After paying the teacher's annual salary, you're left with $226,560 to cover other things like rent, supplies, admin salary, etc. I'm sure a daycare has plenty of state related expenses for licensing and what not. However, every classroom of 10 kids is contributing to that with tuition.

So if a center had, for example, 85 kids, that means:

**Tuition**: $2,244,000
**Teacher Salary**: 9 X ~$38,000 = $342,000
**Assumed Admin Salary**: Maybe Director and Assistant Director, combined salary of...$250,000? I think that's probably generous

Leaving around $1.6mil a year for overhead and other direct costs that I have no way of knowing (since this is all very rough estimate). They could pay their teachers double and still have $1.3mil to play with. But ultimately you never really know without seeing the books, and I'd be curious where all the money goes. I've always felt like childcare is outrageously expensive and I don't know how anyone affords it. We make a combined salary that I once thought was a respectable number but we're borderline paycheck to paycheck because of childcare costs.

ETA: A big perk of working at one of these centers is that (at least in the case of the one we use) teachers get heavily discounted tuition for their kids. It was something like $450 a month for your kid if you worked there. This wouldn't change the numbers above significantly, since obviously there are far more kids there whose parents don't work for the center.
It's up to your agency how they handle that. For us, anyone meeting performance expectations is approved.
Oh, I‚Äôm sorry. An IRA has to be opened on your own with a brokerage like Vanguard or Fidelity. You cannot contribute to an IRA via payroll. 

All Ira contributions are done with post-tax dollars from your paycheck. When you contribute to a traditional IRA, you just report it when you file your taxes and your taxes owed are reduced, exactly as if those dollars had been pretax.

Yes I'm betting on ai coins. How about you
A few other things I learned along the way.

Each step along the way really can take a month or several.  Goes application, grading, referral to agency/division, interview, possible referral to hiring manager (I don't think this always happens), tentative offer w/onboarding & background check, firm/final offer.  I did initial applications back in July/August, and sent in my resume by email 2-3 times after that.  For the website applications grading didn't happen for like 3 months, referral for 5, and I saw interview requests in Jan/Feb.  The IRS did heavily revise all the USAJobs postings during that time though so maybe it will be faster (or slower) now.  I think all the Revenue Agent jobs are under one set of job postings now, i.e. 1 for the 7-12 escalator, 1 for the 13s, and 1 for the 14s.

1st interview was off the email in Sep or Oct, TJO in December, FJO like 2 weeks ago. 2nd interview was also probably from an email application, happened in November, referral to hiring manager this week.  Both are with LB&I, but different sections.

You may get multiple referrals and multiple interview requests, as each division and sometimes each section of a division does their own interviews.

Eventually they'll ask for your transcripts & license, even if they are present in your USAJobs resume 'cause government.  When this happens varies.  One job wanted it before the referral to hiring manager, one with the tentative offer.

When you get the tentative offer you get access to the onboarding site, the process for setting up fingerprinting, and sometime after that you get an invite to the background check site.

If you want to negotiate compensation or leave, you have to do it before you accept the final offer.  You usually can't get a whole grade, but supposedly you can get steps.  Normally you start at step 1, and steps are your raises while in a grade, at 1 year for 2-4, 2 years for 5-7, and 3 years for 8-10.  I've read it is easier to get better leave, as after 3 years of service your annual paid vacation goes from 4 hours per 2 weeks to 6 hours.  The next improvement is at 10 years service, to 8 hours.  They will put the final offer on hold for the negotiation.  I haven't had my negotiation yet.

All 3 interviews I had were really basic, 30m 4 question types.  Tell me about a tax return relevant to the division/section that's interviewing you, how would you handle a disagreement between direct reports or co-workers, how have you used tech/software/time management, how would you handle a combative taxpayer, things like that.  Questions were really similar between the interviews.
If you can handle 1811 work, it's definitely a faster track to govfire.   The cost is work-life balance getting there, not great for most 1811s (although there are exceptions) 

Recommend starting 1811 by age 30, then you can govfire a 20 year career and get pensioned 
 34% of your high3 including LEAP (25% on top of base GS salary). Most 1811s are noncompetitive to GS13, so you would be looking at near cap by 20 years, assuming 13 step 8 plus LEAP.

What this means is you don't have to save $2M for the 4% rule.  Your pension covers a huge part of that, so you may only need half or less at age 50, supplemented by whatever TSP you have.

Other perks to 1811:
- geographic availability of the job
- FERS Social Security Supplement (no earnings test applied)
- Access to TSP penalty free soon as you retire
- take home GOV for many agencies
- TSP 100% match up to 5% of gross takes LEAP into account
-  High 3 calculation includes LEAP
- Pension is calculated on 1.7% per year of high3 vs 1% per year
- Many agencies have chiropractor/massage/mental health programs for LE jobs with low copays (or none in some cases)

Again, it's not for everyone, but if you're willing to lose some typical federal work-life balance and added stress in exchange for a shorter career and higher pension, might be worth a second look.


I said age 30 because any earlier and you have to work more years before retirement eligibility.
Most job postings will have specific KSAs (knowledge, skills, abilities) they're looking for. Write your resume to how how your experiences meet those KSAs.
Yeah, I can understand that. I'm still trying to get 13 myself. Glad you landed well in IA.
I think it probably exists, but I'm not personally aware of any.
Hello.  You did not give a good value for the pension.  That may be the biggest game changer on your finances.  I too am a civil servant and will have a pretty big pension.  My pension statement shows a pretty big amount...but the actual pension payments will be better than the amount shown.  

Defined benefit pension is usually calculated something like this - Years service x highest annual pay x age factor.  So, lets say if you retire at 55, the age factor for might be 2%. Lets say you have 33 years in at 55 and your highest annual pay is 150K.  You would get $99K per year until you die.  There are also 'normally' COLA adjustments to that pension.  Plus at my organization, I get lifetime healthcare for me and the spouse for life (after being employed for 20 years).

The 99K is 'unadjusted'.  You can take less and cover your spouse for the spouse's lifetime.  So, (just an example - made up numbers) instead of taking the 99K, you take adjusted $85K a year until you die.  The spouse might get $75K until he/she dies.  This is all based upon life expectancies and age differences between the spouses.  Government work is indeed great!
You‚Äôre going to do extremely well in your 40s and 50s. Keep it up my man.
Great, you made it, enjoy your success champ!
the most important thing is living within your means so that you have excess to invest.  So many start their careers living like an influencer and then complain that they don‚Äôt get paid enough to save.  

You can change your allocation at anytime but if you spent that money on material consumption you wouldn‚Äôt be getting it back.
I'm sorry for your loss, your grandmother sounds like she was a tenacious woman. You should look into the new SAVE student loan repayment plan. Your payments will likely be very manageable. I wouldn't cash out a retirement account like that to pay student loans.

You should hire a flat fee fiduciary (key word, if they're not a fiduciary they're a salesman) to walk you through the tax rules. It's worth spending a little money to be more efficient with how you handle this money. $100k invested properly in your 20s could nearly cover your retirement at 65 all on it's own.
Wait until r/accounting unlock the secret power of living with your parents.
That‚Äôs awesome thank you! I‚Äôm about to be 31 and wanting to make the jump to govt. just nervous about it.
TBH, most of us are goldenhancuffed to 57, even the young guys.  

Hard to not want those MRA benefits.
Are these jobs remote or 100% office
Sound advice, thank you! Yeah I'll probably need a car down payment soon, still driving a hand-me-down 2000 Camry, but I'll definitely think about pulling out of the CD when it matures and putting it and a good chuck of my savings into my TSP. Thanks again, very helpful post
Fair enough ok. Seems savings rate is typically based on pre tax income. That‚Äôs mostly where my confusion is coming from.

I don‚Äôt know a soul who could save >75% of their post tax income, so kudos to you for doing so. My girlfriend would not support.
Thank you
Damn fr ?? Even in my mcol city it‚Äôs hard to find stuff under 1200 and back in my hometown it‚Äôs 2500 a month minimum
Yes I've gone through the same analysis. They probably have 20-30% occupancy costs. Don't forget labor burden which can add quite a bit. I'm sure there's some IT costs too. 

Other similar daycares are charging comparable rates. It's unlikely they're all corroborating to raise rates. 

Shit is just expensive...
So you waited until you had a performance review or did you submit your application immediately after starting¬†
[deleted]
Yea bullish on AI.
Is it more rare for 0511? It seems like the best way to save money
The Federal pension is years of service * high-3 average salary * 1%

A 30 year career is worth 30% of the highest 3 years of your salary averaged. If you do 30 years and are at least age 62, it goes to 1.1%, so it would be worth 33%.
May I ask why you used 2% and not 1.1%?
That‚Äôs a great idea for me to start at. Thank you.

And yeah, my grandmother was the most put-together person in the family. Went through hell and came out strong. Smart, wise, kind, loving, interesting. 

Wish I had spoken to her and appreciated her more while she was still around.
Do it!

Minimum retirement age for an immediate pension is 57. If you have 30 years and wait till age 62, you get a 10% kicker in your pension.

At 31 years old, you could get hired between now and your birthday, do the normal 30 year government career and retire with a 33% pension at 62 - plus your investments.
Go for it.
50% in office.
It's a hybrid of remote and in the office.

The hiring manager would provide more specifics on that. The sentiment at the IRS seems to be that if we can't match private on salary, we can offer remote work and flexibility. It'll be available asap upon arrival with some exceptions. I'm not a manager, so I'm not going to get into any more detail in that area.
Because I saved so much in pre-tax retirement accounts, I only paid $3,723 in federal income tax in 2017. 6% of my gross earnings for the year. So, that would have been 50% savings rate of income after accounting for federal income tax + FICA taxes. State taxes would have been another couple %, but I don't have that info on hand.

Edit: I haven't filed 2023 yet, but for 2022 my effective federal income tax rate was 9.3% despite grossing $105k that year. I save a TON on taxes by maxing out pre-tax retirement accounts wherever possible.
I'm talking about rent per person. There are $2,400 2br apartments in downtown DC, Philly, Pittsburg, Atlanta, etc. That's $1,200 per person if you split it with a roommate.
Applications required you to have a set period of service already completed, something like 8 months iirc.
> He also said his parents paid a year of rent after he graduated.

They paid my first year of rent when I transferred from community college to a 4-year college to get my bachelors (which I was very grateful for). I didn't receive any financial assistance beyond cellphone / Netflix plan after graduating with my bachelors.

Are you including your FERS FRAE refundable contributions in your $350K? It's listed on your paystub as "Ret Deductions This Appointment" if you use MyEPP. Our balance should basically be the same.

I still rent, which means I didn't have to save up for a down-payment and closing costs.

If you maxed your HSA every year since 2017 like me then our balances should pretty much be the same. Same for total IRA balance. I got my TSP statement in the mail yesterday and my contribution basis is $137,500 - the sum of the contribution limit from 2017 to 2023. How far off is your contribution basis?

All my accounts are listed out individually so we should be able to see which accounts match and which don't.

Edit: Actually, for IRAs it would match if you maxed from 2016-2023 (instead of 2017-2023) since I also filled my 2016 IRA, just not until 2017. If that makes sense.
What are your picks? You can dm me to discuss further
There are just very few positions like that in general. If overseas is really what you want, you'd want to try for the foreign service.
I am a state employee.  For my particular pension, the age factor goes from 2% to 2.4% (max).  I do not have a max (I can technically have a higher pension than my working base pay).  My buddy retired after 50 years.  His pension was 120% of his base salary.  His wife died.  So I think he was working out of boredom. 

I work a lot of OT, so I will take a pay cut when I retire.

For my particular pension, they calculate the pension on the one highest year (12 month period).  I know it is even better for law enforcement and EMS in my state.  Depends on the jurisdiction...but I think most of them get a 3% age factor, but I think they max at 90%.  Many of them retire at 55 with a 90% pension. 

I did not know that the federal pension was so bad (compared to my state pension).
I am a state employee.  Depending on the jurisdiction...Pensions in my state range from 1.5 to 3% (estimate).  My particular employer maxes out at 2.4%.  The 3% age factor is usually for police and EMS in my state.

I did not know there was such a big difference between state and federal age factors.
If it‚Äôs in a retirement account and you just inherited it - you will be required to take the value of the entire account over a period of 10 years.  Depending on your current income it may not be advantageous to withdrawing it in one shot to avoid paying the highest amount of taxes
Yes and also a 5% match on TSP
Holy shit that effective rate is insane
[deleted]
It was 2% up to a max of 75% prior to 1987, they also didn't pay social security tax and weren't covered by it. The new system was a major spending cut. We also used to only pay 0.8% into the system, employees hired after 2015 pay 4.4% into it.

My parents were NYC employees and both had better pensions. Dad got the LEO 50% at 20 years and mom got 50% at 25 years.

But I still consider myself lucky since so few get a pension.

My wife is an accountant. Got a job with one of the financial regulation agencies with special salary rates to compete with wall street. In those jobs a staff accountant can pull in over $200k a year. 30% of $200k is a pretty sweet pension.
Yep. In general it‚Äôs 1% x high-3 average salary x years of service. I gasped at 2%
See I‚Äôve seen this but I‚Äôve also seen that it‚Äôs either

1. 10% a year for 10 years 

OR

2. Doesn‚Äôt matter how you take it as long as it‚Äôs all gone by that 10 year mark
>I‚Äôm vested so even if I leave I can‚Äôt withdraw them.

That's actually not true. See this NIH FAQ on separating after vesting in FERS: https://hr.nih.gov/benefits/retirement/fers-separation-non-retirement

I'm not counting an estimated pension payout, I'm only counting the amount I'd be refunded on separation. I think counting the cash-out value is the most conservative way I can treat them. If I quit tomorrow I would get that $26k returned to me. I felt the same way as you for a long time about not including anything related to the pension, but after the cash value crossed $25k it felt silly to not include that in my net worth.

I can't cash out my social security so it's an apples and oranges thing, but I understand your point.

No worries on the skepticism. It is a professional requirement after all. This is my 4th year posting annual updates so I'm used to it.
Anyone who gets a pension at retirement is very fortunate.  I just didn't know how low the federal pension was.  In my state, some civil jobs pay into Social Security some do not.  I think my pension will be in the 80% or so range.  I will also qualify for SS but I will encounter the windfall elimination provision/reduction.
LOL!  It is up to 3% for some people in my state!  I am pretty stoked with 2.4%!
It‚Äôs option 2 but you really want to understand the ramifications of your selection before you do it because once you elect to take the distribution there is no do-over.  So choose wisely.

You guys are really underselling the profession tbh
Been on this sub since I was still a baby accountant. I think you guys are scaring students from a really solid path tbh. Everyone just wants to be tiktok famous, Andrew Tate, digital marketing or be a software engineer nowadays (those "industries" are about to get saturated t. Following the hype train while sollid paths like accounting + CPA get left behind in the dust. Hell, my welder brother mocked accountants out of nowhere at a family gathering, right in front of me, the other day even though I make more than him. People shit on us but this is a "GOOD" and VERY underrated path. It's an opportunity for average people to pull themselves up into making a good living without needing to be smart. the successful ones can make half a million by 40. Boring work is where the opportunity is guys. Remember that. The multi millionaire who owns a concrete company didn't get into the business because he's passionate about concrete. 

  
End of my ted talk.
What I noticed at least in college was that most of the students there came from middle class backgrounds or upper middle class backgrounds. I always felt like the brokest one there. A lot of the students there had not experienced a full time job yet and have only worked part-time, many didn‚Äôt even work during the school year and only did part time in the summer. PA is demanding and if it‚Äôs your first job the I can see how it‚Äôs overwhelming.

For someone who was raised lower middle class with single mom this profession has been god send. I had a job lined up as soon as I graduated college while many graduates struggle to find jobs, I make a decent living. I no longer have to work at restaurants, all those hours in restaurants dealing with shitty managers and sometimes bad customers and busy days are over and paid off. Those summers I worked construction are now gone. 

I have the opportunity to work from home, everyone is super chill, nobody is on your ass at anytime, literally as long as you finish your tasks then no one has a problem with you. I make more money now than I‚Äôve ever made and I do way less. For all of us who grow up poor and studied accounting we love this profession. Being in the comfortable AC while working, not having to come home smelly from cooking and serving  food, not having to drive 1 hour to the construction site. I couldn‚Äôt be happier.
Welcome to the profession. We maintain pay and job security by pretending it‚Äôs harder than it actually is. Now do you want to delete this post or do we need to have a talk?
That‚Äôs funny. I‚Äôm a welder now and I‚Äôm about to start school for accounting. Id much rather be worried about my ass hurting from sitting all day than losing a finger due to working with idiots or equipment malfunction
I think the reason there's so much opportunity for accountants these days is because they are often overlooked. Great for future accountants since low supply high demand is economics 101 for market opportunity. Glad it's not as competitive as engineering/finance since in any profession you have to go through bs at the beginning when you're first learning.

HOWEVER, I would 100% say stay away from Big
4 but often accountants tend to be risk adverse and seek stability in these firms. The WLB is non-existent and the money is terrible for the hours worked. In my opinion the best route is working for smaller PA firms  that have small business clients. Wide variety of work since you prepare the financial statements and tax return for each business and get to see what kind of sneaky companies make a killing which is very intellectually stimulating in my experience. Plus the work life balance is usually much better, I'm talking 45 hour busy season for two months in personal tax season with 37.5 hours the rest of the year focused on corporate work. Stay away from audit though, unless that is your passion. The work is mind numbing box ticking and you are often working on non for profit organizations, which personally is not my cup of tea. 

But then again, no one tell you these things in school,  they don't prepare you for the real world at all. That's why I believe this subreddit is one of the best resources for people entering the profession.
I've been in PA for over a year now.

Pros: Stable income, great prospects, I'm doing better than probably 50% or more of people my age.

Cons: Insomnia, I've gained 10lbs, my soul has been drained
This sub, like many subreddits, doesn‚Äôt truly represent what the accounting profession can offer. Many accountants don‚Äôt use Reddit. Even fewer actively participate in this sub. And if they do, it‚Äôs usually the same opinion they know will get upvotes. Accounting is not a perfect job, but it is a good one.
Some days are great. Days like I had today make me want to be a squirrel instead. See ya, sucker's. I'll be in the trees.
I agree with OP.

Honestly, your career is what you make it. I have had a very fulfilling and lucrative career in accounting (tax) for almost 30 years now.  In general, I would say I have never been bored with my job.  I didn't have to sell my soul to a firm or work 90 hours a week to get where I am.  I just had to advocate for myself and what I wanted out of my career.  If you settle for sitting in a cube doing PPE reconciliations for your whole career, that's on you.  There are many exciting and interesting paths to take in this field but you can't wait for them to come to you.  

I would encourage anyone to join the profession.  I have no regrets and it has given me and my family an amazing life.
I didn't try in school and fell into accounting and glad I did. ¬†


People don't appreciate how easy a stable accounting job allows you to enjoy your hobbies and take care of your family.¬†


¬†I'm easily able to afford my coke habit and pay child support every month! All while sitting on my ass indoors!
For real, I used to work as a cashier, standing all the time and pushing carts outside the store to bring them in during a hot or very cold weather. Now I work for the government, and I prolly work for maybe 30 mins to 1 hr everyday lol while making good money. I sit all day, could browse reddit and listen to music anytime while making good money.

Id rather have this "boring" work than be busy ü§£ and oh yeah I get to WFH!
I think brothers mocking brothers is just something that brothers do.
Agree with you, I think the bulk of those in here who bitch and moan about the profession would have the same struggles in any field. It‚Äôs a personality thing, not a profession thing. 

Opportunities are out there for those not afraid of a bit of a OT (and no I‚Äôm not talking Big 4, I left that meat grinder as soon as I got my letters). Everyone I did the CPA program is earning 6 figures, most with solid work life balance. A high % are $250K plus per year. It is a great time to be an accountant
It's just that the negative people are louder. Those of us that like our jobs are less likely to post about it.
It fucking sucks here!

...

See ya, Monday
Big agree! I am 26 and my wife is 25, we have both been in PA for a few years. Very stable income, reliable and steady career progression, very confident with my prospects applying for new roles. Both of salaries above the median for our province in Canada. Household income almost twice the median for our area. Cannot complain. Not many couples our age can say that.

Is it sexy? No. Does it oay the bills better than most other paths? Yes.

All my cost of living complaints are due to Canada being stupid as hell, not the accounting profession.
Yeah I‚Äôm a self employed CPA and in my late twenties making $250K a year, but they never told me about people like me when I was in college. The profession is great if you know what you‚Äôre doing.
Most people on this sub are just here to groan about their failures in life so it‚Äôs pretty skewed on here. IRL CPA‚Äôs always hype up my career choice and give me great advice.
It's not us, it's the university posted salaries for recent graduates that scares students off of the accounting profession. Median pay stagnated for 20 years and students made the rational choice to pursue other degrees within the business department. Students are also rationally realizing that the accounting industry is rapidly offshoring (like BPOs did in the '90s, who wants to get into being a call center manager today?). 

Supposedly, accounting jobs are at risk from AI, but that's not proven yet. Compared to AI, the destructive power of offshoring is well known. It eliminated the textile industry, carved out the manufacturing industry, and has removed much of the BPO sectors, payroll, CS call centers, etc. Within the next 20 years most accounting functions will be offshored with only a thin layer of upper management left local to deal with customers and some boutique shops providing premium service, such as the call center industry is today.
Preach.

It isn't easy, specifically the first couple years, but people bitch just by having to work.

In all fairness there is good culture at a ton of the mid tier size firms.

Seems like the top 10 are the killers of the industry.
The thing that I‚Äôm noticing is, the **majority** of senior accountants (especially CPAs) are set to retire within the next 10 years(if I‚Äôm stating the stats correctly)‚Ä¶

Those that are choosing this path, will have very good prospects if they apply great work ethic.

Lots of opportunities will abound.
As someone who‚Äôs interested in doing accounting but sucks at math, can i still do it? Lol
It IS a really good field, but only if it works for your personality I think. But then, there are so many different fields of accounting, that there is probably something for everyone.   
My family was absolutely broke after the Great Recession and never recovered. I am very grateful for the stable job and relatively high income for my age.
Claiming that accounting is a great profession because there‚Äôs low supply for the demand is paradoxical. Even economic theory tries to avoid it!
People have no idea what it‚Äôs actually like to have zero job security and have to grind through an actual shit job with shit pay and benefits to make a living. People scoff at close to $80k starting pay and ~8-10% minimum raises every year like they‚Äôre gonna get anything better anywhere else. PA isn‚Äôt anywhere close to perfect and partners exploit the fuck out of their employees for their own benefit but there is sooooo much worse out there people just have no idea
Story of my life:
- I'm so jealous, you can rent an apartment in a big city, you travel the world
- Yes and I love my job
- So what you do!?
- Accounting
- Yyy, cool... üòê
The matrix is trying to sell us the dream. Bring it down.
I feel like Peter in Office Space going to and from work, just need to find me a more chaotic coworker to burn the place down.
Honestly, it‚Äôs not even that boring if you lean towards certain specialties‚Ä¶not more boring than any other job anyways.

For example- modeling/assessment of some funky derivatives that aren‚Äôt plain vanilla‚Ä¶seeing some wacky ass or innovative start ups..or just understanding the meat and bones of how businesses or capital markets operate.

To each their own, but I have some wild stories.
half a mill by 40? bruh üòÇ
Wouldn't accounting just end up being just as oversaturated if we make it more attractive to students? Similar to the professions you mentioned? 

I'm an incoming freshman in my late twenties currently aiming to be an accountant not only to escape the service industry but also because I'm a particular brand of nerd who needs spreadsheets and tracking systems for every detail of my life to scratch the brain correctly... So getting paid to do what I already do seems neat.

But yeah stop telling people the jobs underrated don't let out the secrets üôÉ
Accounting is way overpaid for how easy and safe the profession is. The long-term benefits are also absolutely nuts (in a good way).

Most people are just too dumb, entitled, lazy, and/or short-term oriented to realize the rewards. Every successful accountant will tell you how great and rewarding the profession is. Only the quitters settlers shit on it.

They'll hide behind excuses like "no social life" or "mental stress" as if those consequences are a result of the job rather than their own shortcoming.

Reviewed a bunch of tax returns this week, got paid again.  üôå
Guys. We may have to take OP out for revealing state secrets.
I work with my older brother and sister, we have a small accounting firm.  We‚Äôve had many retirements in our area and there aren‚Äôt tax preparers coming up to take on the business. HR Block is around but that‚Äôs about it. It‚Äôs been wild the last couple years. Never in a million years did I think I would ever get involved in learning tax preparation, but here I am. Tax season is like Black Friday everyday for 2.5 months. Outside of that I work part time, paid very well, and take whatever time off I need. Bonus points my sister owns the firm and she‚Äôs a great boss. It‚Äôs great not having a potential lay off floating over my head and I don‚Äôt have to deal with a shit manager or supervisor. I‚Äôve encouraged all kinds of folks looking for other or new work to consider learning accounting to consider tax prep. We need more people and there is plenty of business to go around!
Yeah I'm about to go back to school for accounting and was almost scared away from the profession by this sub. But after talking with some older professionals IRL I took the plunge. Starting school Monday!
As someone coming from a soul sucking manufacturing lead position that involves a lot of labor in very dirty, hot conditions, I can‚Äôt freaking wait to sit at a desk all day in the air conditioning not destroying my body on the concrete all day. Give me that ‚Äúboring‚Äù job any day. 

Accounting is a GREAT path, but let‚Äôs keep that on the low as to not oversaturated the job market lol. 

And yes, welcome to Reddit. Where everyone is extremely negative about everything. It does not reflect real life!
I never thought I would be an accountant in a million years. I went to school for finance & hated my accounting classes. Post graduation I had slim opportunities & the best was an internship at a tax firm. I fell in love. I was making $60k when I was full time & in 5 years I‚Äôve doubled my salary. I have incredible benefits, on pace to FIRE & have decent job security. It fills my business & analytical itch that I have. I don‚Äôt mind the hours or being busy because sitting around is so much worse. I am working towards my CPA now. The people on this sub shit on accounting but I think it‚Äôs one of the best professions to enter.
Is selling every waking hour of your life for like 100K really worth it to you?
Cost center. Every CFOs dream is to get rid of their accounting department. Engineeres create stuff, tiktokers and other marketers sell those stuff. Bankers finance the production of these stuff. This is all in the value chain to create shareholder value. The accountant accounts for it, limited to negative shareholder value in most cases.
If a student is scared from accounting because of a subreddit then they (1) don‚Äôt have critical thinking skills and (2) have a very thin skin.

Ppl who have negative experiences are going to post and rant and get engagement, ppl who have positive experiences will not. I like my job, I‚Äôm not making posts about it on reddit.
Thank you for validating my choice OP, now please delete this to keep competition lower. Thanks.
How do you recommend getting into it as an ex- marketer-turned-retail man? I have a bachelor‚Äôs but it‚Äôs in psychology. Do I have to commit to another four year degree?
Op you're 65 and had it easy as partner so you are in no condition to talk. You might have had "lower starting pay" than the current rate but inflation adjusted, you made leaps more. Not only that you get over paid to the detriment of everyone else. It also isn't as easy as you had it where u get your cpa and work 10 years you get partner. Now it's hyper competitive¬†
Aiming to become an artist (freelancer now) but I'm doing a degree in accounting right now for this exact reason.¬†


Idk if it's truly solid path here where i live though since the job market is fucked with the amount of population we have.¬†
Software engineering, computer science, and IT in general is already saturated. The boom was like 10 years ago, now everyone is scrambling for scraps and withering away in helpdesk (basically low level customer service). Accounting is where the stability and money is- the worst thing about the field is the management you may encounter, but thats a matter of finding a different company to work for.
I think you need to be very smart to be an accountant- I was been struggling for a couple year and just now am beginning to grasp something‚Äôs not everything,  but one day I will!!
Fuck Andrew Tate. Don't give him any mention. Wtf
Anyone looking here for genuine advice deserves to not be an accountant. Speak to your teachers or other accountants in real life. Salty people who are super burnt out are all up in here. Accounting is a great career. It‚Äôs stable, pays pretty well, has a wide range of job responsibility/work-life balance options. Don‚Äôt go into it if you want to be rich, but if you want a stable career that is recession/layoff resistant, do it.
Why do you want a reserve army of labour?
Anyone who knows anything about life knows people with good jobs don‚Äôt hang out here as much as people with bad jobs
I‚Äôm coast fired at 31. Half a million in the bank and am fully remote.

This sub always cracks me up - because there is so much fucking opportunity in this profession but so many people shit on it. Fine by me as long as I keep cashing in I suppose
Dont tell them, we need scarcity to keep this racket going
Me(a 1month expirience intern) seeing all you guys say this is an easy job that doesn‚Äôt require you to be that smart üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Listen, it isn't a bash on accounting. I switched from public relations to accounting and had been very stable. The problems aren't necessarily with the profession (some are and I will explain) but with the people, bosses, and overall toxic work environment. It is also the mundane that could possibly be hurtful for people who wish to make a difference. For your cpa route that is one of the largest barriers. 150 credit hours plus 4 exams 5 if your state has an ethics test. This is compounded if you have a family... I am a cpa candidate and taking it I'm August and going to fail. Would rather move to finance now and I am more interested in a CFA even though that is possibly a harder test. 

The profession generally has longer hours and lower pay. Yes, you can find a job easier and more stable but at the expense of those things. All I am saying is the profession is good and stable but represent why people are underselling it. It is the reality of the profession.
>Boring work is where the opportunity is guys. Remember that. The multi millionaire who owns a concrete company didn't get into the business because he's passionate about concrete.

  
I absolutely love this. I am a student. I am scared of making the wrong decision. But I am also a boring person so this is so comforting. THANK YOU.
You gotta be a mega loser to want to be Andrew Tate lol
Honestly, I would argue it isn't as "boring" as it seems. An accounting degree doesn't automatically mean you'll be doing auditing or staff accounting.  There's lots of directions you can take it, from IT accounting, to fraud investigation, to financial analysis, etc.  

I started doing balance sheet accounting, but my company tapped me for an analyst position focused on continuous improvement and database development.  It's very interesting, with very few repeated tasks and a lot of flexibility to improve how the company does things.  And they gave me a hefty raise too, and a yearly raise to boot (even though I technically didn't qualify based on start date).

Accounting degrees open so many more doors than people give them credit for.  It's worth considering for anyone interested in a business or finance path.
yes you people scared me into law school :)
Supply and demand I guess, if everyone wanna be an accountant in college, how much salary do you think those companies will paid for their employees?üòÇ But if you guy successfully scared the hell out of people by saying how boring, hard or depressed the job will be, ‚Äú we‚Äù will become an important ‚Äú Assets‚Äù wasn‚Äôt it?
You lost me at Andrew Tate
   I think the problem is actually the new generation. My generation (the newer generation, 20yo etc.) do not want to do anything that requires time, effort, or hard work. It‚Äôs very hard to find someone my age that wants to pursue something like a CPA etc. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs due to ‚Äúscaring us off‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs due to parenting and our society beliefs rubbing off on young minds.
   
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to go to college to make money‚Äù is what I was told growing up but there is only so many jobs for trade school graduates.
   
Our generation has also never experienced hard times. The last major economy crash was in what 2008? We were toddlers. At the end of the day, if in a normal middle class family, most of my generation did not see our parents hit rock bottom with an economy crash. We‚Äôve only seen the growth and been given things our entire lives. Where do you get a work ethic if you‚Äôve never had to work hard for something?
Yeah I‚Äôm like a month into my industry job. I‚Äôm a disabled veteran and have had many blue collar jobs busting my ass for way less than I‚Äôm making now. 

I absolutely love this job so much. This last week I finally got a project straight from my Controller, which by the way I think is awesome since I‚Äôm so new. I‚Äôm gathering source date for a greenhouse gas emissions audit. Again I think this is so cool to be involved in this project. But when he gave me the work he apologized because the work is boring, tedious, and in his words ‚Äúshitty‚Äù. But I honestly think it is awesome to be involved as such a new employee. Of course my being new is why it was assigned to me because honestly if I showed my 7 year old son what to look for he could also find the information. But the complexity isn‚Äôt the point to me it‚Äôs the overall experience of being involved in the sustainability audit process. 


Anyways I love this profession so much. For the first time in year I haven‚Äôt had to DoorDash in a month or so. I have been able to consistently have food in the house and not worry about how I was going to provide for my family.
This career will bring the worst out of you
Counterpoint: I quit after 3 years in the profession and it was the greatest decision of my life. The money isn‚Äôt worth going to a job you hate everyday. And the money really isn‚Äôt that great, it‚Äôs just stable.
The less accountant the more important we become and the more we get paid.
I went to a rural high school and can't stand talking to dudes who went blue collar. They love to talk total comp but when it comes to hourly they're at $19 while my INTERNSHIP is $31.
How do you explain working 80hours for 42k (first year) with a bachelor and a graduate study. We are not underselling, the market values the profession as such.
Maybe all these negative posts are to reduce the supply of accountants to ensure job security for existing accountants.
your wrong, boring work is where people go to die young

having a soul is better then "making a good living"
I don‚Äôt want to work where people call themselves ‚Äúbaby accountants‚Äù.

That‚Äôs just ‚Äúseems like somebody has a cas of the Mondays‚Äù type shit.
sandbagging expectations is in our blood
Can you explain the logic your brother employed that would even allow him to mock you? Real curious on that one especially since you make more than him. Or was it just the classic ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a pencil pushing dork and I‚Äôm a real man‚Äù kind of mocking?
"Without needing to be smart." References getting CPA. Lol.
It‚Äôs Reddit. The place where mental illness comes to shine.
Coming from a concrete former, be grateful to be an accountant. 50-60 hour weeks are much better long term in an office than out in the hot sun on scaffolding. I could never do accounting and I don‚Äôt want to, doesn‚Äôt suit my temperament, but if I were cut out for it I‚Äôd do it in a heart beat. Far more stable and better paying than most construction jobs.

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the injuries and the toxic work environment.
Thank you for this because I so agree with you , everyone just wanna make it out the trenches by doing TikTok and YT like please be for real! Nothing wrong with that but stop putting so much negative comment on this degree . Starting soon in October and honestly I‚Äôm just excited to literally learn and climb up the ladder
Without being smart? Good luck passing the CPA exam. 

Other than that agree for the most part.
Thank you for breathing life into this.
As someone who is making a career change at 30, Accounting is one of the careers on my list.

I posted a question on my profile about boring vs engulfing careers if you are interested in the responses.

Boring businesses make money.

Periodt.
Interesting you mentioned concrete company, I've been researching getting degree in construction management, if I choose accounting path, I don't believe I will have enough determination to pursue cpa.
As long as you‚Äôre honest about how boring, cyclical and unimpactful  accounting is (unless you‚Äôre in cost accounting)


Engineering has many disciplines btw not just software engineering
I wouldn't want to be deciding a career now. Jobs vanishing left and right from AI. This very well could be one of them.
>Boring work is where the opportunity is guys. Remember that.¬†

I would rather be homeless than be used as a cog in the machine of people who hate me.
#### Isn‚Äôt that a good thing? Last thing you want is your industry to get saturated with a bunch of amateurs like with software development.
You make a great point young buck. Keep in mind Reddit is a vocal minority of this path. Majority would say, Reddit? I barely know what that is. Or intentionally stay off of it for these reasons. 

You‚Äôre gonna carve a nice path in life. You trust yourself. Ignore the mouth breathing complainers who use this forum as their therapy.
People should not be taking career advice from Reddit.
Computer Science major here and I sometimes think about accounting still. CS is very competitive and the industry goes through big ups and downs. üò≠
i dont know who is underselling the profession when op claims you dont have to be smart in the profession üòÇ
It‚Äôs so there is high demand and low supply of accountants. Great for consulting firms. Keep up the good job everyone.
You either "get" accounting or you "don't get it"  It's not good or bad it's just a fact.   This place seems to be geared towards those that didn't get it and were in the wrong job.
I didn‚Äôt like classes much but I like my accounting job. I like it to the point that I keep thinking about what ways I could be better at it - every day. Constant reflection. Whenever I beat my own records, it feels so damn good. 

It depends which industry and company you work for. Accounting is a stable and decent profession to be in.
Your welder brother made fun of accountant? Thats funny as fuck since welders don‚Äôt make much money. LOL only the top 1% welder makes money and that‚Äôs from working more than 40 hours a week.
Is that you, Kevin?
Is it really that easy as a profession? I just completed my masters and the difficulty with such tight deadlines for dozens of assignments made me wanna kms (although all I could do was keep working on the assignments and diverting myself from the thought üò≠)
Thing is that this sector of work is and has been stable for pay etc. 

The future seems bleak to the context that business leaders are harping on about AI and cost efficiencies, cutting audit budgets but expecting much higher levels of documentation. 

Our firm sometimes just doesnt have the mental capacity to engage fully because they are constantly at 140% for about 10 months of the year. 

The interesting thing is that physical labour/blue collar roles are now making a decent amount because its a specialist skill which isnt meeting supply
As a student ‚ÄîTHANK YOU for this post ! üò≠
Everyone should learn basic personal accounting, once you understand a balance sheet, you can make a personal balance sheet.
A lot of people think my job must be boring AF. Yeah sometimes it is, and sometimes it's not. But I make good money so I really don't care. A job is a job.
I couldn‚Äôt agree more with OP. I make more than any other member of my family. I am able to afford my lifestyle. Yes, I might not be rich, but hey I‚Äôm able to afford a house, two cars, and one vacation per year. 

Btw I‚Äôm a senior tax accountant making $80k in South Florida. My wife makes half of what I make.
üíØ
To be fair it‚Äôs not like it requires much training. 

I used to do it as a kid all the time, sitting on the sidewalk. 

A count ants. A count sheep. A count my fingers. A count all sorts of different tings.
I am currently in an intermediate role in IT but have no passion for tech. I noticed this when I was simultaneously studying for a tech certification while attending accounting classes. I noticed that I enjoyed accounting and finance a lot more and that I had a passion for it. I am blessed to have discovered this, and I want nothing more than to work as an accountant and develop myself, and grow in my career as an accountant.
Go to work, get what I need to get done, go home when I accomplish that, and enjoy my life. No one breathing down my neck, and I get paid pretty well all things considered. I'll take it. Pretty solid career with plenty of opportunity. There is always something to complain about. No matter how good one has it.
Stop telling our secrets! /s 

I do wonder what AI will do in the future for entry level accounting positions but at a senior level and up there is a lot of judgement that takes place that will persist for a long time. Also knowing the basics of accounting is very valuable for business. 

When starting my career I wanted to work in the finance sector but ended up finding myself in Manufacturing and now Ag Manufacturing which would‚Äôve sounded like the most boring industry. But the technology is here now and it‚Äôs a ton of fun. Not to mention a growing profitable industry. 

All that to say if you like business I think accounting is the way.
I think a lot of people talk shit about accountants because they are insecure and know they can't do a job like ours. However, in the business world, a CPA is very valuable and respected.
Yes we do undersell that‚Äôs how we keep it the way that it is. Now you should take this down before the cats outta the bag
Accounting is the best! I didn‚Äôt do public‚Ä¶I did credit analysis and then internal financial and process control work before I became a professor. I love my job now, but it was so much more fun getting into the nuts and bolts of how companies work. I always take the last day of class to hype up a career in accounting.
Accounting is hard though
Here you go. 

I'm a film producer and I hire accountants and turn them into movie producers. 

It's easier to teach accountant how to be creative than it is to teach creatives how to math...
I warn everyone about this career because it has serious issues that get swept under the rug by our own accounting professors.
We are average and not smart??
My mother is an accountant and all her stress and anxiety is sourced from being constantly over worked. Rarely does she have a true vacation. She's worked on almost every vacation we've been on.

She's a partner now and it's even worse.

Sure, you can make good money, but it's at the expense of work life balance and the ability to pursue your other interests.
You never admit the existence of this thing of ours
How do you guys feel about ai taking accounting jobs? I see some people say it‚Äôs going to happen then some people say it won‚Äôt
As someone who has two degrees, psychology and computer science, and is having a lot of trouble breaking into the tech world, accounting does seem like a good choice. 

If I were to want to make the move to be an accountant, how would I go about it with what I have now?
Dude, we're tired.
Love TED talks - I've seen two. As an accounting / tax professor, I don't undersell it. I tell it exactly like it is and you told it differently than I would have.

As my first degree was in philosophy, you begged an inordinate amount of questions, which had assumptions that nobody should assume.

1. Not everyone wants to be TikTok famous, but I only wish them the best. Why not? Shit, if my student makes 1M a year talking about LLCs and G-Wagons, I hope they have me over.

2. Accounting isn't "boring work." I don't want any student grinding away so they can retire and die a year later. In fact, if I actually help students who have social media channels to monetize them, because it's a job and there is a demand. I consider myself boring (49-year old Dad and CPA) but with 15+ tattoos, an extroverted personality and a decent intellect, nah. 

3. Needing to be smart. What does that mean to you? I have done everything from audit to tax prep to law enforcement. Each semester I teach one course in Intro to Accounting. Week 3 is debits/credits. Biggest drop-out week for any University because you need to be SMART to grasp accrual accountancy / GAAP / Accounting equation. Nobody hires a CPA because of their "average" self.,

4. The "concrete millionaire" DID, in fact, have a passion for concrete. A business degree, while mostly worthless for practical application (and I have a couple), should have enlightened you to the fact that nearly all business start with a passion - whether for the product, service, or simply to employ. 

Some of us like to prep taxes or balance books. Others enjoy being a cop or mortician or trash collector. Some people enjoy their shit. I don't want ANY student dreading to go to work because they will be happy 2x in their lives: payday (for 13 minutes) and retirement. 

5. Take the temperature. I lose accounting students to finance all the time. Why? Well you could make millions doing crypto, planning high wealth strategies, seeing the future. OR, you could get turned and burned at any firm, plan for people's past (taxes) and not see your family for 3 months out of the year. Both have risks, but seriously, what the fuck excites a 19 year old student?
So what are you actually doing at every days work? U consider it boring but easy?
Honestly same. Majoring in Accounting was my gateway out of poverty and I make so much more now than I could ever imagine.

I landed a big4 audit job right before I graduated. Worked my ass off there and then jumped to industry after two busy seasons. I work an average of 50 hours weekly but atleast I get paid hourly so it‚Äôs great for my savings and current goals :)
This profession will literally drain your ballsack/ovaries. My ballsack had nearly disappeared along with all passion for life. I can‚Äôt even whack it anymore PLEASE LISTEN TO ME AND DONT BECOME AN ACCOUNTANT GOD PLEASE
Yea idk I got an internship rn and I‚Äôm willing to do what it takes to get a ft return offer. It‚Äôs at Deloitte and I‚Äôm fr loving it so far. Albeit I do have a great team that is like an actual team. We eat lunch together whenever we‚Äôre in the office, communication is great. Really chill team but we‚Äôre also in our busy season so even still while some things are hectic it‚Äôs enjoyable. I feel comfortable in it
I'm kind of happy about this post. I'm thinking about getting my business degree and going into accounting, and I'm glad someone is upvoting it.
Great post!! Glad to hear it‚Äôs a solid profession. I will be going back to school next year to pursue an accounting degree at 49. This is after 20 plus years as a chefüò©üò©‚Ä¶.Time for a change
Fantastic profession. ¬†
I appreciate this! I‚Äôm still in school but seeing some posts sometimes can be discouraging! Thank you ü§ó
I forgotten my half a million!
This guy doesn‚Äôt understand blockchain technology + AI. Oh well.
"It's an opportunity for average people to pull themselves up into making a good living without needing to be smart."

LOL way to sell it bruh
THIS PROFESSION MADE ME ANOREXIC  consider your self + othera people in this profession are mean, unhelpful!

the most help you will get is 

SEE LAST YEAR , SALY , DILLY
Shhhh! let the kids quit school and trade binary options while the boomers retire. Buying cheap firms and outsourcing to countries with twice the work ethic of a 24 year old American is the ultimate millennial retirement plan. Don‚Äôt fuck it up!

u/Lumpy-Cantaloupe1439  Living the dream!! I love reading these positive stories about folks who gets into the accounting professions. Did you go to P.A. or industry when you graduated?
Re-routed my career from hospitality to accounting.  Even the worst day I ever have will still be better than my life before I went back to school.
I have worked a full time job from the time I was 16. I worked 70 hrs a week for 3 years straight as an emt (I swear not a brag). I recently did an internship in PA, and they let me get unlimited overtime. It was great. Honestly, I don't understand all the complaints. I was able to earn enough for a downpayment on a house.
As an aspiring CPA with the same background as you who has been getting freaked out by this sub a little, I appreciate your words
Bunch of nerds trying to find where OP lives.
Gonna put OP on PIP for this post
> omg! I hate math, that must be so hard

Every time I tell someone I'm an accountant.
The Accountant Mafia won‚Äôt appreciate the snitching
It‚Äôs incredibly difficult to do this job. I was at the office and between whippings they made us repair the brick retaining wall across the street where the partners like to park their Ferraris. I had to suck a cock once and it wasn‚Äôt even the partner‚Äôs. He‚Äôll just point at a random hobo and say ‚Äúsuck that guy‚Äôs dick or your fired‚Äù and I‚Äôm not proud to say this but, I sucked that dirty anaconda to completion. I then got an ‚Äúunderperform‚Äù rating on the engagement with comments like ‚Äúcradle the balls more‚Äù and ‚Äúat least pretend like you‚Äôre enjoying it‚Äù.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ LOVE this response. 100% agree with you
accounting inst hard! its the people that are from hell!
I just watched the accountant. Send me in, boys.
Shhhhhhhh
Yaaa boooy
Kek, this is the way
RIGHT!!!
If it was easy then AI would have passed the CPA exam but it didnt.
Also welder here, also going to school to get out of it. I just got my degree in business admin and was also looking into accounting. Don‚Äôt forget about the daily burns, not being able to work in climate control, and depending on what you do, breaking your body down over the years from hard manual labor. 

After my time in the field, a job up front doesn‚Äôt look too bad anymore.
Former concrete finisher who went back to school. Did an 2 internships and a PT tax gig during busy season and am starting FT in August.

This shit is so much better it‚Äôs wild bro, ppl are eventually gunna to try to scare you about the hours and CPA studying but like‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs nothing compared to the bs you deal with in the trades/construction.

I lowkey think anyone who switches from a tough job has a huge leg up because you know what hard work is. All you do is do what‚Äôs asked of you, do your best, and you‚Äôre fine. Worst someone is gunna do is write a nasty review note or say not so nice things.

Doesn‚Äôt compare to psychos yelling motherfucker cocksucker at you all day and the injuries/deaths and potential fights and all the wild shit that happens out there. 

My favorite part - no one dies in accounting.
Started my degree while a welder. No more 100+ degree days and back breaking jig setups.


Way less overtime. I get that some people in PA work what they consider long hours, but welding 12-hours Mon-Fri and 8-hours Sat-Sun, with every third Sunday off gives me a bit more perspective of what actually sucks for work/life balance.¬†


Mentally, there's more stress, but it's not as bad as the physical toll if you learn how to handle it.¬†
I went from dog grooming to accounting--carpal tunnel, bites,¬† scratches, back injuries. Accounting has been harder on my body. Sitting is truly terrible for your health. Not saying don't do it, I think I still prefer accounting over grooming, but also don't get blind sided by thinking you'll be better off physically.
You say that, my neighbour lost a finger due to idiots malfunctioning equipment. 

And while my ass hurts it's not from sitting on it too much
Become a Nuclear Welder. Your ass will hurt from sitting  all day.
Also a journyman welder in my second year of accounting. Same idea came to me when I looked around and saw the older guys I worked with. They messed up their bodies, and decided I didn't want to do that. It has been an awesome way to pay for school though. 4 months of plant shut down work over the summer afford me my schooling over the the year.
As someone who's still a student all i see is people praying to land a big 4 job
Staying away from Big 4 is not the best advice depending on what your career goals are.  I can't even begin to tell you how many top-end companies prefer or require people with big four accounting background on their job descriptions.  If you go the audit route at a big 4 then leave for corporate, you'll often get hired  at a higher level position than you could have achieved in the same time frame had you started at that same corporation right out of school.
Don‚Äôt most of those smaller places only want already trained accountants?
Audit manager for small PA firm here - I 100% agree with you on everything except the boring audit work AFTER staff level. Staff level work is boring and not that interesting. Luckily that only lasts a couple of years. Once I became a senior and more so manager, it‚Äôs honestly great. I‚Äôve learned how so many organizations, for-profit, non-profit, and so many industries within each work. I never imagined I‚Äôd have as much knowledge about all types of businesses when I was in school.
I actually wanted to work for a small firm but was concerned about exit opportunities. I've heard they're not the best any thoughts on that? For what it's worth I don't mind staying in P.A.
I love the idea of doing work for small business clients. I never wanted to work big 4 or 80+ hour weeks so I never got my CPA. I thought that was basically mandatory. Maybe I‚Äôll go for the CPA‚Ä¶
One of the main reasons many want to start their career off at a Big 4 is because of the exit opportunities. Once companies see that you have Big 4 experience they figure you're capable enough to do any work assigned to you (yes it's a bias and no it doesn't mean you're not capable if you didn't go to a Big 4). But the reality is it sets you up for anything else you want to do in your career. Many people go from Big 4 to various finance positions and essentially jump from the accounting industry to the finance industry because financial firms look at the prestige and a CPA.  It's similar to students wanting to get internships at a top 5 tech company (MSFT, Apple, Tesla, NVDA, etc.). They understand that prestige carries weight.
Whoa. Only gained 10 lbs? My bro, you didn‚Äôt need to brag.
I‚Äôve gained 10 lbs in each ass cheek
Only 10lbs?

Must be lucky.
Bro just go to industry and live the good life
Same! I‚Äôve been in PA for 1.5 years and I‚Äôm trying to exit to industry to regain my soul and fix the new bags under my eyes.
The weight gain isn‚Äôt all PA. Hate how this sub blames their poor habits on the profession.
Stable income and great prospects puts you - at a minimum - in the top 10% of your peer group.

What privileged upbringing do you people have to make you think that half of young people are on a stable income with great prospects?
And the bias will always be towards people complaining about negative experiences rather than good ones.  They either want to rant or just get attention.
As someone who is switching careers at 35, this is pretty inspiring. Thanks.

Worked my ass off for 8 years in the entertainment/production industry and have nothing to show for it. I have no problem applying that same ethic towards something that will actually reward me
Did you ever work in public?
Off topic. I know a tax partner who invested in a business with one of his clients‚Ä¶ So it seems like there are great opportunities in this profession‚Ä¶ but like you said, it‚Äôs what you make of it.
Mind if I dm you a question about something?
I‚Äôm 30 and switching careers‚Ä¶

If not, no worries, and thanks for sharing your experience in this field.
How did you break into tax? I am in industry accounting as a staff accountant and looking to break into tax but i don‚Äôt know how. Any advice? Also can you tell me about your experience in day to day life doing tax accounting? I‚Äôm just curious because I loved my tax accounting courses and tax preparation so i‚Äôm interested in it.
That's it I'm becoming an accountant
What‚Äôs your job role if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?
Thise makine 200k and up...hows the work life balance??
Lol. Literally me üò≠.
I'm assuming youre in LCOL part of Canada? Few years in PA is like 65k. Definitely not easy to get by with this wage in HCOL.
How did you become a self employed CPA?
Yea this sub is full of Debbie downers
Trust me, most accountants aren't great at mental math's either. If you can user a calculator, you can do accounting
Idk where the fuck you‚Äôre getting $80k to start but otherwise yeh
Nah you see, Milton probably burned the place down because the scam wasn‚Äôt discovered and he could loot the travelers checks to get back at the people who mistreated him. Where‚Äôs the money in your plan?
People say it‚Äôs easy and then more than half the people you meet are absolutely terrible at their jobs though üòÇ
Only cuckolds and exploiters themselves would think that the market wages of a strictly necessary profession are overpaid. Since you are on reddit, I presume yourself in the camp of the former.
What is an example of a fulfilling career? Honest question, because I can think of a thousand reasons why other seemingly ‚Äòfulfilling‚Äô careers can be soul-sucking for many/most people.
> think we need to differentiate between going into a career for financial reasons versus being passionate about it.

That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt think some people realize. You have to have some passion for anything you do as a profession. Not full passion but some. If you do not then even if you make a lot of money, you end up being miserable. People forget how much that shit rolls downhill onto others you care about.

I‚Äôll also make the hot take that accountants are routinely gaslit about their worth and how much they‚Äôll earn because only a few firms and high risk-reward industries control most of the salaries (which have barely risen in the past 10 years).
I might be talking out of my ass here, but I'm guessing most middle-class professions are different shades of boring / pointless.
Very nice explanation. I would also add that generally speaking, the pay isn‚Äôt guaranteed to be good until you‚Äôre a CPA. And even with being licensed (assuming you get it at entry level), you still need 4-5 years of experience until you‚Äôre pulling in decent $. 

There‚Äôs less barriers to entry with higher starting pay in fields like IT, Computer Science, Engineering, etc. That is why we‚Äôre seeing a decade long trend of less accounting graduates year over year.
It‚Äôs not the most fulfilling thing in the world, I will admit that. But for those that work to live rather than live to work, it can be great. I‚Äôm a tax partner at a top 10 firm at 35, making great money which should only increase. Travel all the time, have a great house, no financial stress whatsoever. I‚Äôll trade ‚Äúfulfillment‚Äù for that personally.
I'm a student still, but I'm a small business owner and non-traditional. I'm hoping to go into public and help other small businesses manage their books, do taxes, and get off the ground. I already manage my own books and crunch profit margins and find it stimulating to see where things could be improved.
I mean it depends what is fulfilling to you. I find a lot of fulfillment in doing a job well and finding ways to do it better/quicker/more efficiently. Accounting gives me tons of opportunities for that, so I'm pretty happy overall.
[deleted]
>And you‚Äôre trying to oversell the profession as if it‚Äôs not the most boring way to a middle class lifestyle. 

Lol? People work shit jobs to not starve to death and here you're dragging a well-paying career for being "boring." You're not supposed to find passion and fulfilment from your job and the only people that say you should are grifters or lost souls.
Fuck your fulfillment I‚Äôll find that through family, friends, and hobbies. It‚Äôs hilarious how many people sit on this moral high ground about a means to an end. I‚Äôll take the money and job security.

Next.
I've been doing passion work for most of my life. I chose biology as my major and can't even afford the housing here in Washington. 


I'm back in school for accounting. My friend is a finance director and has a CPA. He's very successful and even has his own online business. In this world, financial success is a guarantee towards fulfilment
[deleted]
Sounds like my expectations as a student. I don't want to make big money, just enough to pay the bills.
You‚Äôre just on the wrong team. I‚Äôm in Tax at a big firm and only work 40-45 hrs a week all year with the occasional weekend work before a deadline.
Making over $100k, working like 25 actual hours a week. No CPA. Not every job out there in this field has awful or demanding WLB.
That‚Äôs only 2/1-4/15.  And after ur first 2-5 years of being a decently paid indentured servant, u r making 100k by 4/15.
Yeah, but accounting students opening this sub and seeing consistent posts from accountants shitting on their job is valid for some concern.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go into it if you want to be rich‚Äù

No job is guaranteed to make a person rich but didn‚Äôt Dave Ramsey did a study of top five jobs of millionaires?

https://www.ramseysolutions.com/retirement/the-national-study-of-millionaires-research

One of them is accounting so‚Ä¶
I'm glad you're happy with the profesison
And the more we get. Fewer accountants means bigger workloads.
In a perfect world, that‚Äôs how it works.

In the world of outsourcing and AI (i.e., factors aside from workforce size) your value is dwindling.
My friend is an electrician and classes 100k at age 25 in MCOL
Took my first job in industry nearly 9 years ago straight out of college with just an undergrad then and made a little more than that working 40-45 hours. Most everyone in my program was opting to head to public accounting while I focused on jumping straight into industry. 

Not interested in being a partner, or even CFO. Worked up to manager and would be happy to land a controller eventually as that‚Äôs about as much company liability and stress I want on my hands. 

If you‚Äôre in public, don‚Äôt get me wrong if definitely grabs the attention of hiring managers in industry and will pretty much almost always secure an interview. But there‚Äôs lots of knowledge capable accountants out there that didn‚Äôt go into public and don‚Äôt have a CPA, and honestly the roles I hire for, don‚Äôt ‚Äúrequire‚Äù CPA. No staff or senior is signing off on in any capacity when it comes to the financials, particularly in a large or midsized established company. 

Lastly, I‚Äôve also worked places where CPA‚Äôs and former public accountants were hired for industry roles and man oh man, there are some questionable individuals out there lacking a lot of common knowledge, some as simple as debits and credits, and critical thinking skills. It‚Äôs a mixed bag no matter which route people opted for.

My little sister mentioned that she wanted to study business when she went to university. But she specified that she didn't want to do accounting like me. My brother then jumped in and said that it would be embarrassing to graduate university and become an accountant (very uncalled for). No idea what his logic was but I just sat there and didn't say anything.
Underrated comment. Although I'm also in film so I may be biased.

In my world (episodic TV), I work a job that sounds very cool and interesting when I tell people what I do. Yet, the majority of my colleagues over the years complain just as voraciously about their jobs as anyone on this sub.

It's the nature of work that a lot of people will find discontent in it. Ameliorating that is on the individual. Accounting can open just as many doors as any other discipline.
CPA, with an accounting/tax masters degree i believe
Your job being outsourced to Rajeesh is a bigger problem than college students. But sure.
My interviewer at EY visibly made a face when I related one of her questions back to my experience as a server at Cracker Barrel. It made me too afraid to even discuss my past experience at subsequent interviews. My current firm luckily values my experience & has never made me feel less than for not coming from the same background as the rich folks
Too bad the country won't. (Should be nationwide forgiveness) Student loan forgiveness is basically. Job training should be paid by anyone other than the worker.

I am a CPA now. Never got an accounting degree. CS, FINA and MBA though. (No one told me that finance was only for kids with Rich family members that they could convince to invest...). No wonder it was the lowest GPA business major at UGA. S o I had to become an accountant... Because that was who was hiring. With no degree at first.
I prefer the person who clearly had to work their way through college with a 2.8 gpa+ to the 4.0 student who never held any kind of job/internship. If you made me fill one position for staff and you gave me two candidates that interview similarly and the only difference is this, I‚Äôll take the one who has worked. There‚Äôs to many hours involved with public accounting to take a gamble on a potential work ethic.
Glad to see you're still on Reddit, I used to see you post here like 6 years ago... Time flies.
Same.
My first job was fast food.
‚ÄúNobody is on your ass‚Äù would indicate industry.
Same here nobody pissed at me because there eggs weren‚Äôt cooked precise.
Lee County, Flawda. Come at me. Fr Myers representing
Lmao, I burst out laughing at this response!
And no more pizza parties for OP
lol meanwhile your friend who is an engineer is like no one ever says to me and I had to calculate the melting point of a metal accelerated around a curve.
Haha this gave me a chuckle to see how bad your boss treats you‚Ä¶
Oh this needs like way more votes!
My arms are full of burn scars with new ones being added at least 3x a month. I wonder if my arm will ever be one shade again tbh
Just a heads up. If you wanna get your CPA down the line you can get the required credits you need from community college
Yup. I‚Äôm almost certain I‚Äôm going to get reported to HR when I have a job for using obscene language like ‚Äúdamn‚Äù or ‚Äúshit‚Äù lol. Everytime I hear long hours about PA, I ask for clarification and it‚Äôs something like 60 hours or so‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs about 4 days of working in the trades in shitty conditions lol

I mean... get a standing desk then.
Maybe if you don‚Äôt do any exercise outside of the job. My body has been much better off working from home, lifting a few times a week, and taking a 2mile walk every day than it was when I was doing merchandising and on my feet for 12 hours lifting cases of energy drinks.
Oh I def plan on staying active even while accounting. I still like welding and that‚Äôll just be a hobby instead of a job. It‚Äôll keep me active other than working out
How are you getting bitten accounting? None of our accountants ever get bit.
The vast majority of this would be preventable if you worked out
I‚Äôm going from groomer to accounting too! A sedentary life isn‚Äôt healthy but also grooming doesn‚Äôt allow any energy to even do any type of exercise after 8-10 hours.
Big 4 pays very well though IMO, and being part of a big company has perks
As a non-trad about to go into my Jr year, the younger students are aiming for big 4, and most of my fellow non-trads just want public and secure. There are a decent number of us. Most of us are in our thirties and have some management experience and / or a small business on the side.
Completely over rated. Everyone thinks must go big 4 because the professors (who generally never worked a day in PA) say Big4. Little known fact, the Big4 very often sponsor professor research projects, donate money to the business school to put their name on rooms etc etc. The professors push Big4, guidance counselors don‚Äôt have a clue, and Big4 spends the most time and money recruiting on campus. Take it for what it‚Äôs worth, but imo Big 4 you really don‚Äôt learn squat about the profession or businesses you serve. Much more opportunity to grow as a professional at regional or even local. Local can be a lot of non-profit and govt work though so consider that and ask when you interview what type of clients they actually serve‚Ä¶not just what they have listed on their website.
This.  B4 experience puts a shiny halo on your resume for the rest of your career.  It‚Äôs not that they teach you what Meh Inc won‚Äôt.  (Though often it is the case.)  It signals that you can survive a baptism by fire.  Insane deadlines, long hours, multiple partners and managers and clients all wanting something from you at once, and you handling it.  When a horrible boss or a recession rolls around, and they will during your career, B4 experience can make a huge difference in how quickly you can land a new job.  

There are very few employers that hire a large crop of students annually and give them that experience.   Even fewer who will hire Joe Blow from rando state school with little but good grades, a modicum of people skills, and  maybe a bit of work experience.  

Sure, there are more lucrative and prestigious careers, but they hire far fewer new graduates.  And they only recruit at top schools.  Even then, you need extraordinary charm, connections, and/or top notch intellect.  Anyone with those isn‚Äôt getting a degree in accounting.
It‚Äôs easy to gain when you eat your hours. ü•Å

Not having time to go to the gym thanks to busy season is definitely because of the profession
It‚Äôs absolutely the profession when you don‚Äôt have time to cook or workout
Despite the downvotes, I kind of agree. Weight gain is literally just calories in vs. calories out. It‚Äôs not an issue if you avoid the stress eating and find other ways to cope with it. As for the gym, it‚Äôs a bit harder during busy season, but it‚Äôs very doable if you make it a priority; I know IB guys who work far more hours and have far more bitchy higher-ups who still manage to make it 3-4 times a week. If you make it clear to your teams that exercising is a non-negotiable and say some bullshit like it being pertinent to your best performance on the job, they‚Äôll usually understand.

I bill 50-55 year-round with 70-75 in billable on my ‚Äúbad‚Äù weeks and still haven‚Äôt gained any significant amounts of weight aside from the ¬±5-10lb fluctuations from the holidays.

Downvotes for speaking the truth. Guess it‚Äôs hard to hear for some
I actually had a pretty unpleasant upbringing tbh. I'm just autistic and live under a rock.
Same at 30, only from a different industry.
Let‚Äôs do this brotha (or sista ;)
I've been a waitress since the age of 17. Now I'm studying accounting at 22 , im so excited to work somewhere with Upwards mobility ! I love money and organizing too
Yep! That‚Äôs where I started my career. Big 4
Sure
He said government so it‚Äôs definitely the IRS
Budget analyst, but my program is for recent grads employed by the government So its kinda like an internship maybe thats why I hardly work. But based on my observation the budget analysts in my office doesnt work too much. They chill most of the time.
I am in a HCOL area, a suburb of Vancouver. We both make 80K right now before bonuses. Like I said, judging from what others make our age we are doing good, not doing good given general Canadian economic climate...
Sorry just seeing this. Long story short I got my credentials and experience 2-3 years in public accounting (big 4 then mid size firm) and then when I felt I was competent enough to serve average small business clients, I quit my job and went all in on chasing clientele in any way I could and building my processes etc. It sounds simpler and easier on paper but it was a journey of hard work and faith forsure.
Why do you think they will share that with you? 



Those making tonnes of money tend to gatekeepe information
Agreed, Reddit is like a magnet for those people. 

I think a lot of people who say they cannot find success in Accounting on this sub also just have generally poor soft skills / interviewing skills.
Thank you üò≠ i think im more scared taking math classes than the actual job. What was the hardest class for you?
Bruh. I slept through High School and got a 3.7 GPA. I'm an honors/AP student.

The average high school GPA is 3.0, meaning more than half the students can't even get a B average. Trust me, it's not because getting a B average in high school is hard. And no, it's not always some terrible family condition. I tried "regular" classes in my Junior year and realized just how low of a standard all my new classmates placed upon themselves. They're all nice people that I hung out with... just with zero ambition and care.

Same with college. The average GPA is 3.1, meaning almost half the students can't maintain a B average. I got a 3.5 GPA while only showing up for test days for most of my classes. I played League of Legends most of the time.

No, I'm not a genius. Most people just underperform. There's a reason why low-IQ activities like... drinking and doing nothing... are vastly more popular than high-IQ activities. People don't like to work and prefer to shut off their brains. You still have people in accounting manually linking their Excel workbooks (or worse, hardcoding), when you can complete the job in a fraction of the time with an Excel formula.

"But some people aren't taught Excel". How hard is it to go "There must be a better way, let me ask someone or Google something to see how I can do my job more effectively and efficiently. Oh shit, this xlookup formula takes like 2 minutes to learn and only has 3 steps. Let me try that!".

People struggle in accounting (and everything else) not necessarily because they're mentally incapable. Most of the time, they simply have no drive or sense of pride in their work. They intentionally choose to turn off their brains and live like a dumbass. You just need to care a little bit to see some resemblance of success in accounting. It's not rocket science.
That should tell you everything you need to know about how overpaid this profession is lol.
Why does work need to be fulfilling, wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to find meaning in hobbies? Seems like the fulfilling careers end up being crazy hours and low pay: fashion, video game design, chef, etc
Farming cute animals üê∑üêÆüêênature üêìü¶âüê§ üå¥and plants üå± üçÖ

I started gardening in my yard  and it‚Äôs so fulfilling
Differs for everyone but‚Ä¶

Social work, medical, saving lives, protecting people, protecting nature, I mean I can pull a ton more if this is a genuine question
Sure. No denying that. But unlike accounting, a lot of those careers actually produce tangible benefits as a result of the work done. Accounting is largely meaningless work.
[I think you under-estimate how many low paid CPA‚Äôs there are. Most aren‚Äôt cracking 6 figures until later in their career and most top out around $120K.](https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/picks/top-certified-public-accountants-make-120k-per-yearheres-how-to-work-toward-a-certification-01614108285)

Not to mention not all CPA‚Äôs end up becoming supervisor, manager, director, etc.
u/DeadForTaxPurposes  Can you give us a timeline of how you made it to the top as a partner? Tax partner at age 35 is pretty darn good!
Would you be willing to share a ballpark estimate of how much you make? I‚Äôm a student right now and this is what I‚Äôm planning on doing (CPA -> tax partner), so knowing salary prospects would be helpful
[deleted]
Same, I enjoy finding ways to work smarter not harder by automating tasks or improving previously manual processes and leveraging our ERP system. It's fulfilling to know that without me the company literally wouldn't know how they're doing as a business. Makes me feel like I bring value to something in the world in some small way.
Accounting/CPA industry wont be left in the dust when firms can offshore and with more advances in AI who knows what jobs will be available.
[deleted]
I'm in the same boat but w a CPA, so a lot of my disdain is from my years in public honestly, but that's a significant part of the profession, and for most graduates the entryway to these chill positions.  

You getting there without a CPA just makes me annoyed I could've saved my time, because that shit was so boring.  Respect you making it there without it.
So you think ppl should be banned from venting about their jobs because we should ‚Äúthink of the children‚Äù? Why don‚Äôt we cover them in bubble wrap as well?
I‚Äôve met a lot of accountants and none have gotten rich being an accountant. Maybe if you push to CFO of a large company. Also, including net worth in the term rich isn‚Äôt exactly being genuine. Plenty of people have a lot of money in 401K, but they can‚Äôt touch it without penalties, so when I say rich, I mean bringing home a few hundred K or more every year after deductions and such.
They dont outsource cpa/regulations work they outsource bookeeping and basic stuff, same with AI it aint replacing us anytime soon
Same, a friend of mine is a commercial plumber at my age (mid 30‚Äôs), and is making a solid six figures. Some days are tough for sure but sounds like a cake walk compared to apparently residential.
whats the link?

no one does well in dating without a soul
I worry about people who go for Business Administration and expect the same job opportunities and stability is having a BS in Accounting.  Accountants come out of school with more practical knowledge.  Firms/corporations know what they‚Äôre getting and have a somewhat homogenous ‚Äútraining path‚Äù for thier org.  Business Admin doesn‚Äôt guarantee a job out of school, requires some real world experience (opportunity) to get in to door, and even then, you have to prove that you have talent to add to your framework to be considered productive.

I don‚Äôt remember ever being looked-down on for being an accoutant.  Most people just think accounting is boring and that I might be able to give tax advice (I‚Äôm not a CPA).

I tell people I do accounting for an ecological conservation not for profit.  Usually my friends then say, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let her down-play it, she‚Äôs CFO and she‚Äôs running the place‚Äù.  I say ‚Äúyep, I‚Äôm saving the world one journal entry at a time‚Äù.  Of course, people want to hear more about our org‚Äôs mission than about accounting.  And I‚Äôm able to share some little-known, but nonproprietary, news which gives some hopeful impacts that we‚Äôre making globally.  

The work is good. The pay is very good.  I‚Äôm making an impact.  I work with people who are talented scientists, educators, fundraisers and those people respect what I bring to the table to help make their work translate into sustainable financial support (grant & organizational budgeting, resource planning and of course normal stuff:  accounting infrastructure final reporting, and audit liaison).
I'm in the same boat! I majored in accounting but spent most of my career so far in film production. Now I'm starting to study for my CPA. Cheers to having similar career paths, glad to see there are other of us out there.
true!! lol
Yoooo i love in bonita springs, im an accounting student fgcu
If anyone rolls up, I can be there to back you up in an hour fifteen...you know, because the goddam interchange construction on Colonial. üò≠
JAX here!
Getting flashbacks now.
Well, you do have Sanibel Island, so there is that.
im glad you resonate. 

my coworkers + seniors are the worst back stabbing ass holes! 

im unemployed and refuse to work at any firm where " their clique" works
Right? I have so many burn scars on my arms/hands/wrists I can‚Äôt keep track anymore
So do I have to have a certain amount of credits in accounting if I don‚Äôt major in it? I know I need 150 but if I did something that had some accounting classes but not all would that still work?
I had gone to college for a lot of credits but kept switching majors and never finished any. I have 70ish rn at a CC but only 21 of them transferred over to my new school so I should be well over 150Credits by the time I have my bachelors in accounting
Yeah bro we already had to do those hours in horrible conditions.

People swear at the firm I got into but it‚Äôs more of like people muttering ‚Äúoh fuck‚Äù or ‚Äúgoddamn it‚Äù as you walk by their cubicle/office. As long as you don‚Äôt swear like real loud or in a meeting or worst with a client, it‚Äôs all good but every firm is prob different.

Good luck tho. You‚Äôre making a great decision and you‚Äôll be living such a better life in no time.
Maybe you could get back in contact with that prof? It would be good to have somebody you know help you out.
Standing desks are honestly amazing.
Was just thinking this‚Ä¶
I have one, does not compare to actually having a job where you *move*. You're still stuck in a static position. I groomed on my feet. I could groom on my feet for 12 hours more easily than stand at a desk for 2. This is experience talking here.
Yeah going from physical labor to accounting allowed me the chance to get into the best shape of my life because I was actually craving to do something physical after sitting instead of being constantly worn out and beat up.
Sure there's days where you're so bored and it's so long, you feel tired from doing nothing, but generally you're able to put more into lifting and cardio since your body isn't prefatigued. Just remember to stretch throughout the day, walk around during your breaks and if your office allows it stand for a little bit of the day while working.
Are the perks in the room with us?
I joined a smaller firm out of college with a higher offer than my big 4 bound colleagues. Also annual raises have averaged 10% and promotions 25% which I think is great for my 30-35 hours of real work a week.
i have to agree with this. it's been a 5 Month in Big4 Tax in my country and honestly starting to regret leave local firm that i worked for 3 years. the reason:

1. they don't include the junior/senior to meet the client or join the group dissccusion. these meant a lack of experience/learning to understand progress of the project

2. Jealousy: I got hired as senior. I just can't stand with their junior and supervisor jealousy that i got hired without restart my career back to the junior. they even don't want talk to me. even when i am asking the example working paper, they just told me that "just calculate it, you can do it right" and than i got yelled because they thought i don't follow their own procedure.
why don't you hit the gym after work?
I bet you are fun at parties
I go to the gym to gain weight and mass .... i lost weight during busy season
[deleted]
Transitioning from college to the professional world is tough for most people. Most are much more active in college. Then once you get a more professional job the activity typically decreases.¬†

Tons of people I went to school with gained weight immediately after college. they worked in office and jobs that were more active.¬†

I agree it‚Äôs tough to exercise and work out when you don‚Äôt have time or energy though.¬†
And unless you live in a tiny little cramped apartment, you can buy a decent bench and a decent set of adjustable dumbells for cheap. It's not going to let you do every workout under the sun, but it'll let you get most of them. And if you have a little more room, get a treadmill or a stationary bike (the latter might actually be more space efficient) and you have 99% of everything you need for decent workouts.
I‚Äôm good with it. There is always time. And there always healthier than other options. Been in PA 12 years. I yo yo a bit at times. 

The point I was making if you don‚Äôt or won‚Äôt develop the good habits ANY job can and will get in the way
what line of tax did you specialize in?
There is also state accounting too. I work as an accountant for my states Parks and Trails department. Pretty much every state department is going to need a fiscal team so there‚Äôs probably a solid hundred thousand state accountants across the U.S.
Potentially social security administration or dept of foreign affairs, as well.
Not necessarily. Most state, federal, and local government agencies need accountants. All 50 states also have government audit shops that audit the state's financials. Many cities and counties also have audit shops, though they are often more about performance audits than financial.  Pay is less than what you can get in a firm, but the benefits and WLB are good.
I graduated with my accounting degree in December and was offered a work study program as part of my VR&E, but I was already working full time at a PA firm.
Awesome thank you!
cause i dont stereotype people? not just because they make money they gatekeep. if they do, it's not my problem. 



maybe fix your spelling and you might get a better job.
Double entry book keeping. It's something entirely different best of luck buddy, I took accounting so I could break out of the poverty cycle. I'm also the first person in I think 4 generations to make it into college even if I dropped out due to financial difficulties. So it's definitely a good path forward!
Tldr
Tbf I think that‚Äôs the same across the board for most industries.
Why are you a cuckold?

Lol "pay me less so I work harder boss!!'
> Why does work need to be fulfilling

yeah you're right, i should be totally fine spending the peak 8 hours of 5/7 of my days totally miserable.
I come from a family of nurses and everyone is burnt out. It‚Äôs basically working in retail but with blood, piss, and shit and angrier patients. The ones that do bedside eventually swap to something else but that‚Äôs the general jist I‚Äôve witnessed growing up with them.

We‚Äôre not saving lives in accounting, but we can still find fulfillment through other measures like family and hobbies. Having a six figure hybrid job where I can support my family and splurge my disposal income  on travel, gaming, and whatever I want is a blessing.

Accounting is great
It is different for everyone, and no offense but people in those careers burn out just as much, if not more than us because they expected to help people. Doctors have hours upon hours of paperwork each week

My brother in law is a doctor and Covid absolutely destroyed him. He has literal PTSD from the emergency rooms and the death he was around.
You‚Äôre talking to a lot of copesters right now (but thanks for putting up the good fight in the comments).
[deleted]
No thanks. I‚Äôm not suited to save anything
Why does every business require one then?
Well firstly, that article you linked is 3 years old (i.e. little outdated). The $120k figure from that article was based on 103 salary data points, which is not a sufficient sample size to come up with an average when there‚Äôs millions of us in the workforce.

 [Becker](https://www.becker.com/blog/career/cpa-salary-insights) has a better article on this from 2023, which shows that CPAs can earn up to $190k as they approach management level experience (ofc depending on COL area). But generally speaking, CPA are going to earn more than a non-CPA, so it‚Äôs all a moot point anyways
Pretty negative perspective but I guess we‚Äôll see. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[deleted]
You must be new here.
...You quite literally said it was a boring way to a middle-class lifestyle.
Hey it‚Äôs all good. Colleges really push not only big 4 but any public accounting. No professor I had promoted anything about the potential or option to go straight into industry. Many make it seem like it‚Äôs not even possible honestly. Shame on them for not guiding students better but guess they have to promote since most get some sort of funding from them.

Can I ask how long it took you to get there? COL might have something to do with it too but honestly public usually makes it there sooner than us industry folk.
Did I say that? No.
Keep telling yourself that.
Everyone I know is in that 80-110 range BUT they're in the 65-80s in terms of weekly hours. Although they're neither electricians or plumbers.

Yup, Jamie Dimon specifically recommended accounting in the same breath as finance for college students looking to start a career in banking.

Edit: He actually specifically mentions accounting as the main degree.

> ‚ÄúI do think in business you should learn the language of business which is accounting‚Äîa little basic business,‚Äù Dimon said. ‚ÄúI think it would help to do accounting, finance, [or] markets. Something like that.‚Äù

I‚Äôll fly down there and we can force him to eat bananas until he pukes
I am lucky to work with good apples only  few bad ones
that‚Äôs right, but it depends on state by state. id highly recommend taking classes that are relevant to accounting even if not necessary, because it will prepare you for the cpa exams
Depending on state you might beed 24 accounting credits once you finish your bachelors with 120 credits apply for cpa evaluation they‚Äôll tell you exactly how many more do you need for each category. From there if you need more credits from
Particular category get those from community college  and remaining credits could literally be any random classes take the easiest ones.
I believe you should be able to transfer all of your credits back to the CC and then send the transcripts from there. You would need to double check though.
Thanks man. I‚Äôll probably be done within a year for the bachelors and I can‚Äôt wait
Yeah I would like to workout more often now but it‚Äôs kinda pointless if I do it after work since I won‚Äôt be able to put much effort into it and if I did do it before work, I‚Äôd be up at 1am and then have a very exhausting day that I won‚Äôt be able to workout the next day.
No but the perps are‚Ä¶
You could possibly go back to the other firm and possibly even make more than you would be if you‚Äôd stayed loyal to them rather than leaving. I work with several people who left and came back.
You have an after work?
I ask myself this everyday
True, but it doesn‚Äôt help when you have unanticipated late nights and need to order in since you‚Äôre stuck in the office.
Yeah. I don‚Äôt get this stereotype. I‚Äôm a big linebacker looking guy, and I managed to work out loose weight and gain muscle while working in accounting. Gained it all back during the divorce though!
Mostly corporate and partnerships. I‚Äôve done planning, provision, compliance, and controversy at various times over my career.  I head a tax department for a large multinational now so my role encompasses a lot of things in the tax sphere.  I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúno‚Äù to too much as a young accountant so my background is pretty broad. I consider myself more of a generalist these days with a focus on the particular industry in which I work.
Ohh this sounds really cool! I‚Äôm not in accounting, but have been considering the switch, so I apologize for the ignorance of this question, but what sort of accounting work is needed in a department like that?
No it‚Äôs definitely the IRS
Maybe work on your grammar before pointing out an obvious typo as your only comeback
That‚Äôs very good to hear!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Our education and technical knowledge standards for most things in our lives, including our jobs, are relatively low. Most people who struggle with their jobs aren't struggling because they have insufficient abilities or are oppressed by their employers. Most people struggle because they choose to be lazy and do only the bare minimum (or less).
I actually have zero clue how you arrived at your comment here lol.

What part of anything I said implied that?
Right that‚Äôs all great but we‚Äôre talking about passion and fulfillment in careers not passion and fulfillment in hobbies.
I‚Äôm working at a church right now. A lot of the work is fulfilling, but the expectations people put on me have been ridiculous. It‚Äôs actually not all that fulfilling when people think you care because that‚Äôs just your job.
No need for the cope (or the whataboutism).

The comment is about fulfillment.

Doctors actually see tangible results of their work and impact people on a daily basis.
I literally just said it‚Äôs different for everyone. Actually the first thing there.

Those careers are indeed expected to help people, that‚Äôs their job, you would assume that many of the people in those jobs find fulfillment because for a lot of them it‚Äôs not the pay that‚Äôs attracting them.

Usually reading before drafting the rebuttal is helpful when you‚Äôre trying to make a case.
Of course. It would be like going on r/drake and saying drake isn‚Äôt the best rapper. These responses are normal.

Edit: the sub for Drake the rapper is actually r/drizzy

Lol drizz
You clearly can‚Äôt read. The  commenter above asked for more fulfilling careers not careers where every single person is fulfilled.

Willing to bet I can find studies that show Accounting is less fulfilling than plenty of jobs.
Kayak instructor, tour guide, librarian, media preservation

Like I said, different for everyone

3 years of big 4 audit and then 3 years of industry.  Each year inflation eats away at any gains though.
Same I make over 100k and I didn't get my CPA. I didn't even have an accounting degree when I first started, but eventually went back for a masters in accounting. I live in a HCOL area and bought my own home right before the pandemic. I'm enjoy my job, I get to wfh and I have always had autonomy in my work. My bosses have always valued and trusted me so overall I feel successful and fulfilled in my career.
not rly, no
I would warn most folks off of Finance as well, unless they are going to a prestigious college or have really influential contacts to get them ‚Äúin the door‚Äù.
I'm currently a freelance production coordinator in a medium sized city, mostly working on commercials. Things have just been slowing down ever since COVID... Freelance is tough, especially on commercials - really prefer to have a regular routine with a 401k!

Every state department needs to manage their budget, but it works a bit differently than a typical business. Instead of using your excess earning to try out some new venture you are limited to whatever your Governor‚Äôs appropriation is (basically think of it as how much of your own money you could spend). Some departments are just a pure drain as they do not earn revenue (which is completely valid why should, let‚Äôs say, the department of economic security earn money when the entire point is helping impoverished individuals through programs that give them money). State Parks is a revenue generating department, and at least at the state of Arizona, earns much more than it spends, however we are still hit with relatively strict appropriations. This is in case of a rainy day (like Covid) and sometimes funds are siphoned back to the state, especially if it is in a deficit like Arizona‚Äôs current fiscal year (which ends on July 1st). Part of our job for Parks and Trails is to help create a fair and balanced budget for all the parks operating budgets. We do not want to ever spend more than our appropriated amount per year (this could make the CFO and our director lose their job, plus all kinds of extra oversight would be added to the department), so we divvy up an expected average for how much each park will spend, and then allow a certain amount for extra projects if the years budget is more generous than usual (it hasn‚Äôt been these past two fiscal years unfortunately). Next up is revenue. Since this department actually earns more than it spends our job as accountants is to track the revenue so we can have a better argument when we create the budget to be approved by the Governor on why we should have a larger appropriation. We also can use that data to see what parks are excelling or struggling compared to prior years and hopefully come up with ideas to improve them (unlike a business a State will not just get rid of a park even if all it does is drain money, after all, the whole point is for people to enjoy the outdoors lol). A lot of the creativity is from our Park managers on ideas, but I think that is a good thing since we have a strong working relationships with our park managers (apparently a couple decades back Fiscal just lorded over them, since we do control their budgets, but our past few directors have wanted central office to be a  more supportive role than pure administrative, which I think has helped tremendously with the central staff and park rangers working relationships, after all, the department is more about them, our job is just to make sure they don‚Äôt overspend so we don‚Äôt get in trouble). Finally, we also have our Grants management to work on. A grant, in case you didn‚Äôt know, is Federal money given to us to be spent for a particular project. This is meticulously tracked as every cent needs to be accounted for (we can‚Äôt just pool the funds into some other project), and is where the majority of our maintenance and development funds come from. You would be surprised, but development spends about double what our operating budget does per year, and about 90% of that is using federal grant money. Grants can also be used for heritage projects, like helping a native American reservation maintain culturally significant buildings, even if they aren‚Äôt related to a park specifically. There‚Äôs also other stuff we do, but this is a general breakdown of what a state accountant for Parks and Trails does. Hope that provides some insight!
Sorry i cant tell if its an obvious typo or not. Not sure who hurt you to be this salty
Doctors also sometimes accidentally kill people or at least watch them die while their loved ones suffer. The consequences for mistakes are literally life and death. It‚Äôs not all good feels. Physicians have a very high suicide rate, for women I think it might be the most common profession for it.
I feel more gratitude for what I do as a bookkeeper than anything I did in previous occupations. I have a solo practice for small businesses. They are all happy that I know what I‚Äôm doing and keep them audit proof. Obviously not saving anyones life but tangible results abound.
Sounds like you work for an organization you don't care for, which is fine, but the great thing about accounting is the versatility. I'm not amazing at supervising people but I will give myself credit that I'm good at helping junior employees understand the impact they have and how things cannot happen if they didn't do their job. It's going to be different in every position and organization, but that's what's great about this career, if you don't like it, find somewhere else to work where you are part of something of substance you believe in.
Please, please, don't believe that. There are a lot of people who went into medicine or nursing for the money. There's a lot of threads on "why do you love nursing". "Because I like having a house and I grew up poor." 

And, honestly, putting the "working for love and altruistism" thing on them is really unfair. It's that thinking that leads to "don't call out when not well, what about the patients", "you need to work overtime, what about the patients", "you need to work unsafe and understaffed. And not fight for raises. What about the patients."

As I implied in my post, the career paths that you highlighted as fulfilling tend to be highly associated with burnout and difficult working conditions. They are often as much draining as they are fulfilling. 

Especially in anything medical that involves saving lives. You‚Äôre very often interacting with people that are having one of the worst days of their lives. Many of the sickest patients that you are saving may have significant co-morbidities that are not going to be cured, but instead managed from medical emergency to medical emergency.
Pretty confident about someone‚Äôs life that you know nothing about‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs it for me, best of luck to you and I hope things turn around for you.

You must‚Äôve grew up very privileged. I grew up very low income and my 1st job post graduation paid me more than anything my parents ever made
Are you really arguing that a job that can support a middle-class lifestyle in 2024 shouldn't be described as well-paying? Or am I just being trolled?
I think Dimon was more saying he thinks a Finance degree would prep you for banking but otherwise it‚Äôs more about the person and degrees don‚Äôt matter all that much. But pursuing a career in investment banking is another story and you are 100% correct.
I can tell you what my plan is.

So, I never came to film production wanting to be a film-maker. I wanted to be a full time scout, no more, no less. So while I loved my job it was always that, a job. My social life outside of work has always been centered around contemporary art. That world has a lot of rich people and a lot of small business owners in it and those are the connections I plan to work after I pass my exams. Through them I hope to connect with whatever small firms they're using and try to get in that way. I think people in other creative industries have a better understanding of how hard our jobs are in film; hoping that understanding carries over to whoever is doing their taxes.

Yes I worked in a bank in accounting for a 13 years.  They did have a sub group for Finance/Q/K.  While I was there I was also on the Conversion team and we acquired and merged 10 banks, which eliminated finance departments in 10 banks üôÅ.  What was always  in need was a Tax Professional.
I mean 24 credit hrs
Please say sike rn
HR has noted your complaint, and filed it under ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù
One more thing. Were the hours at Big 4 ‚Äúbad‚Äù with the work that you did? I imagine they are a lot better now that you work for a private company.
Come on both..we can do better here.
I worked as an office manager where I learned general bookkeeping really out of necessity. I was mentored by a guy helping the owner build the company. We were a young bunch running a screen printing business. I switched jobs and became an IT project manager but along the way a career counselor planted this idea of becoming a freelance bookkeeper. I took a general accounting night course and started watching loads of QBO tutorials on youtube. I asked around my social circle, got one friend of a friend who needed help with bookkeeping. Got a couple of small referrals from there. Got laid off from PM job, hated it anyway. I took a temp job at a CPA office and kind of saw a ‚Äúformal‚Äù bookkeeping procedure. After that I pretty much understood what these small businesses needed, and how much I could get away with charging. I kept learning based on the clients‚Äô industry and business scenarios. Been doing this about 10 years now with a pretty slow build but it has been solid for the last 5-6 years. Money wise, I make what I need to make and have headroom to take on more work when needed. I live in NYC and am comfortable financially. This is different for everyone but I am more interested in flexibility for travel and lifestyle overall. I am growing each year but not just taking loads and loads of clients and burning out. I go to the Intuit Connect conferences and get some enrichment/motivation/new ideas. I‚Äôm getting into advisory/cash flow planning. That‚Äôs the story more or less. Not always easy but with some foresight it‚Äôs as stable as any traditional job.
You did even if you didn't realize it. Hope everything works out better for you in the future.
I'm just adding some color, that's all.

Don‚Äôt get your panties in a knot now your comments say enough about you
Well, at least you seemed to have found your passion - making a fool of yourself. 

If only you got paid for it...
I‚Äôm in NY, apparently 150 hours is needed O.o
That's literally the job, especially in Financial Services where every PA firm is shoving in new hires. 

You'll have some windows when you aren't as busy, but if you are logging off every night at a decent hour during busy-season, you are cooked my boy.
When in public, I did a lot of hours from about 2/1 - 4/15. Maybe had a few weeks of longer hours around 10/15. 

Industry has its busier periods too but, in general, the workload is spread more evenly throughout the year. 

Life is a lot different now in terms of work being that I‚Äôm at the top as opposed to earlier in my career.  My role is a lot more strategic and transaction focused. I oversee the deadline-driven aspects of the tax department but I‚Äôm not in the weeds of it if that makes sense.
Stress and job satisfaction are not mutually exclusive by any means. How is this relevant?
Nah I read your original post and no part did it mention offshoring. Try again.

Backtest Results for a Simple Reversal Strategy
Hello, I'm testing another strategy - this time a reversal type of setup with minimal rules, making it easy to automate.

**Concept:**

Strategy concept is quite simple: If today‚Äôs candle has a lower low AND and lower high than yesterday‚Äôs candle, then it indicates market weakness. Doesn‚Äôt matter if the candle itself is red or green (more on this later). If the next day breaks above this candle, then it may indicate a short or long term reversal.

**Setup steps are:**

Step 1: After the market has closed, check if today‚Äôs candle had a lower low AND a lower high than yesterday.

https://preview.redd.it/ac0jhgrn1tmd1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dff19fc34a77a1189f9888d1350de2f0dacc48b

Step 2: Place BUY order at the high waiting for a reversal

https://preview.redd.it/z1zgwfdo1tmd1.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=3397520ce8f9a0542c2b9f2fc6152ac123f554e9

Step 3: If the next day triggers the buy order, then hold until the end of the day and exit at (or as close as possible to) the day‚Äôs close.

https://preview.redd.it/f6gkunyo1tmd1.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a93422ae7316808c4e80fdd9ac5c88da3fbe4be

**Analysis**

To test this theory I ran a backtest in python over 20 years of S&P500 data, from 2000 to 2020. I also tested a buy and hold strategy to give me a benchmark to compare with. This is the resulting equity chart:

https://preview.redd.it/ej5nbklp1tmd1.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=6aef5fd2d49d96fe7c9704968999e58ca4967b9f

**Results**

Going by the equity chart, the strategy seemed to perform really well, not only did it outperform buy and hold, it was also quite steady and consistent, but it was when I looked in detail at the metrics that the strategy really stood out - see table below.

* The annualised return from this strategy was more than double that of buy and hold, but importantly, that was achieved with it only being in the market **15%** of the time! So the remaining 85% of the time, the money is free to be used on other strategies.
* If I adjust the return based on the time in market (return / exposure), the strategy comes out miles ahead of buy and hold.
* The drawdown is also much lower, so it protects the capital better and mentally is far easier to stomach.
* Win rate and R:R are also better for the strategy vs buy and hold.
* I wanted to pull together the key metrics (in my opinion), which are annual return, time in the market and drawdown, and I combined them into one metric called ‚ÄúRBE / Drawdown‚Äù. This gives me an overall ‚Äúscore‚Äù for the strategy that I can directly compare with buy and hold.

https://preview.redd.it/d3h157qq1tmd1.png?width=1683&format=png&auto=webp&s=20199c9b1b959ed11943984df3df14c7b2e8fa53

**Improvements**

This gave me a solid start point, so then I tested two variations:

Variation 1: ‚ÄúDown reversal‚Äù: Rules same as above, BUT the candle must be red. Reasoning for this is that it indicates even more significant market weakness.

Variation 2: ‚ÄúMomentum‚Äù: Instead of looking for a lower low and lower high, I check for a higher low and higher high. Then enter at the break of that high. The reasoning here is to check whether this can be traded as a momentum breakout

The chart below shows the result of the updated test.

https://preview.redd.it/uac02nkr1tmd1.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca84df5268eded664125db9e4ee6ab3570bfe8c3

**Results**

At first glance, it looks like not much has changed. The reversal strategy is still the best and the two new variations are good, not great. But again, the equity chart doesn‚Äôt show the full picture. The table below shows the same set of metrics as before, but now it includes all 4 tested methods.

https://preview.redd.it/e3dqxy2s1tmd1.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f1fe9dd5f06fac5e4cd0e76579f3766a9b36d74

Going by the equity chart, the ‚ÄúDown reversal‚Äù strategy barely outperformed buy and hold, but the metrics show why. It was only in the market 9% of the time. It also had the lowest drawdown out of all of the tested methods. This strategy generates the fewest trade signals, but the ones that it does generate tend to be higher quality and more profitable. And when looking at the blended metric of ‚Äúreturn by exposure/drawdown‚Äù, this strategy outperforms the rest.

EDIT: Added "out of sample testing" section below on 04/09:

**Out of Sample Testing**

All of the results in the sections above were done on the "in-sample" data from 2000 to 2020. I then ran the test from 2020 to today to show the results of the "out-of-sample" test. Equity chart below

https://preview.redd.it/m9m7hls3aumd1.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41f594fd35aca945c3180a7ee91fe1ed1d108bb

The equity chart only shows half the picture though, the metrics below show that the system performance has held on well, especially the drawdown, which has been minimal considering the market shocks over the last 4 years:

https://preview.redd.it/rlao1yibaumd1.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc066c8a925a437ee3f551e789aa4c0628bdaa5f

**Overfitting**

When testing on historic data, it is easy to introduce biases and fit the strategy to the data. These are some steps I took to limit this:

* I kept the strategy rules very simple and minimal.
* I also limited my data set up until 2020. This left me with 4.5 years worth of out of sample data. I ran my backtest on this out of sample dataset and got very similar results with ‚Äúreversal‚Äù and ‚Äúdown reversal‚Äù continuing to outperform buy and hold when adjusted for the time in the market.
* I tested the strategy on other indices to get a broader range of markets. The results were similar. Some better, some worse, but the general performance held up.

**Caveats:**

The results look really good to me, but there are some things that I did not account for in the backtest:

1. The test was done on the S&P 500 index, which can‚Äôt be traded directly. There are many ways to trade it (ETF, Futures, CFD, etc.) each with their own pros/cons, therefore I did the test on the underlying index.
2. Trading fees - these will vary depending on how the trader chooses to trade the S&P500 index (as mentioned in point 1). So i didn‚Äôt model these and it‚Äôs up to each trader to account for their own expected fees.
3. Tax implications - These vary from country to country. Not considered in the backtest.
4. Dividend payments from S&P500. Not considered in the backtest.
5. And of course - historic results don‚Äôt guarantee future returns :)

**Code**

The code for this backtest can be found on my github: [https://github.com/russs123/reversal\_strategy](https://github.com/russs123/reversal_strategy)

**More info**

This post is even longer than my previous backtest posts, so for a more detailed explanation I have linked a vide below. In that video I explain the setup steps, show a few examples of trades, and explain my code. So if you want to find out more or learn how to tweak the parameters of the system to test other indices and other markets, then take a look at the video here:

**Video:** [https://youtu.be/-FYu\_1e\_kIA](https://youtu.be/-FYu_1e_kIA)

What do you all think about these results? Does anyone have experience trading a similar reversal strategy?

Looking forward to some constructive discussions :)
Nice research and presentation! I wonder what it would look like with some position sizing!
Man i wanted this to work... sadly no dice.
Barely moved over 20 years.


Here is a link to the [interactive backtest](https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/processCache?request=embedded_backtest_596a79f402447849fe5142b7e88f25ed.html) (with code), and a link to the [detailed report](https://www.quantconnect.com/reports/596a79f402447849fe5142b7e88f25ed).

Implementation details:

* Two minutes after open, i compare yesterday's candle to the previous day's. If conditions are favorable, I trade the break of yesterdays high.
* Rather than use a buy stop, i am manually checking every minute to see if price foes above the previous high
* I hold till the morning, and exit at the first minute after open (i tried exiting at the close of the same day but it was even worse.

Love your posts keep them coming :)
You are basically testing ‚ÄúThe Strat by Rob Smith‚Äù
Great read and really nice presentation. I have yet to look at the code but I am interested in how this would perform with a shorter (or longer) time frame. It might be interesting to combine multiple time frames to help with risk management. For example: instead of holding till EOD based on an entry, hold until there is a break in momentum or an opposite reversal on a shorter time frame. I could see this helping with the drawdown, although it could result in missing out on potential gains. Keep it pushing
For the 1st variation, you're using current bars high as a trigger on the end-of-day data. If I read your script correctly you are downloading the tickers from yfinance and without specific mention of IEOD, it downloads daily data since you used start and end date in date format and not in datetime format. And with IEOD it only fetches 3 months data.

How are you backtesting it with EOD data? With this, It will take the current day's high as a trigger when it crosses above the previous day's high, but then you want to close the position on the same day. It need IEOD data to backtest.   
For EOD data you have to write

""    
(data.high.shift(1) < data.high.shift(2)) and (data.low.shift(1) < data.low.shift(2))

""

then

""

 high > high.shift(1)

""

- that will satisfy your trigger and you will get entry on the next bar's open and then you can close on the day close not on day high, because trading live you never know when HOD gonna end up.
New algo trader, so my opinion matters much less, but it seems like the down reversal is a good start, and obv returns more consistent profitability, so perhaps it could be used as a boiler plate strategy, whilst refining the actual conditions for the "more significant market weakness". I was actually looking at testing a very similar strategy, so this is insightful, thank you.
Awesome read, like last time, but again I see that it has been underperforming buy-n-hold in the last few years. Which could be a sign that algorithms, against which this is competing, have become better. Or it could be a sign that this strategy is simply broken? Not saying this is so, but just want to understand it.
Love concrete research and presentations like this. Keep it coming!
I ran your code on a bunch of different symbols. I couldn't replicate any results as good as \^GSPC or \^SPX. Note that when you use \^GSPC it uses adjusted data. This may not be ideal as we are doing intra-day trading in this strategy.

Here are a bunch of different backtests using adjusted and nonadjusted data for various symbols:

As I've pointed out in similar threads, all you've discovered is that equities indices go up more than they go down.

There are any number of long-only strategies that can work with these markets, and many will be much more profitable (with less drawdown) than this one.
This is pretty cool, thanks for sharing. Might test this myself, I was also about to try a similar strategy to overcome basic timing of buy and hold or trying to time the market.

Did you buy this historical daily data from a reliable vendor? I have kinetick data feed and 10 years of data but I know for sure they are accurate, just curious because im looking into data feeds for minute data etc. which I don‚Äôt have past 2 years
Very nice job!  I wonder if you could identify points in time where one of your three strategies would be a better choice for that day/week/time period based on some other broader trends?  e.g. closing price above/below 10, 30, 60, 100, etc. day moving averages.

I also agree with others on choosing something tradeable, like SPY, QQQ, etc.  I assume I can test those on my own by replacing the symbol in your code.  Will give it a try.

So, in practice, would you get signals at the end of each trading day (for action the next day)?  Does yfinance provide data fast enough to run that in the evenings after close?  Have you already created the code to spit out signals for current data based on your parameters of the backtests?

Edit:  Yep, unfortunately, it looks like Buy & Hold is the best strategy when testing SPY and QQQ.
I was unable to repeat your results with a backtest in WealthLab. There may be an error in your code
Very interesting results and a lot of nice work here. Couple quick questions:

1. It would be very interesting to pull the historical E-mini futures and run the statistics there. I think part of the lack of response to these simple approaches is as you mentioned the difficulty of trading the index. Time to equilibration in a more liquid derivative I think *may* diminish these results a good bit (not to be a downer).

2. Is all of the data on returns here presented from the 4.5 years of oot/oos data?
It will work while in a bull run. You may want to run it and just keep an eye on when markets become bearish.

Otherwise, if you want a bulletproof strategy, you should backtest it doing only shorts and see how it performs.

But it is also true that s&p500 in the long run it can only go up.

One thing I didn't understand is at which point do you set the order? How do you know that there is a wick long enough that doesn't open the buy with current volatility?
where can I get 20y of SP500 data?
Well written post. Inspiring stuff
Great job. The strat really is timing the bottom and then selling at the top. What I don‚Äôt fully understand is the take profit point; that is, are you closing same day or swinging there trade just like you showed on the chart? If the take profit is purely same day then I‚Äôm more curious how the strat outperforms simple buy and hold. However, if the trade is allowed more time, that is swinging the trade, then I am curious when you know to take profit while swinging. This is not completely clear to me. Great job tho
Do you mind if I ask: Are you using any platforms or software for these automated trading strats / backtests? Or are you simply using Python on your local machine? Where are yiu getting your historical prices? Thank you in advance for the insight! You've earned a new YT subscriber. Looking forward to more content!
Looking at your out-of-sample data. Looks like the reversal does really well when the market is flat or doing exceptionally poorly. But it seems to struggle when the market is on a strong bull run. Looking at your basic strategy of following only a few simple rules, do you think there are another set of rules that would not alter the performance during crashes but also allow the reversal to perform well during a bull run?
Great and professional testing! Only thing I don't understand: your Buy&Hold shows a quite different %% than the market research shows: "Based on historical data, the annualized return of the S&P 500 from 2000 to 2020 was approximately 5.9% " versus your Buy&Hold of 4.07% Now that might look minor because it's about the B&H, but it makes me wonder what is different in the calculation method of how you calculate your results (because it might effect your strategy results also). If the explanation is in the not calculating for the dividends, that is something you need to make an assumption for in the B&H then, because it's a very substantial amount especially over such long time frame and especially with the re-investment of the dividends in buying more of the stock.

Another point: your tested time interval includes two of the three major economic crisis in the last 100 years ((2007/8 and COVID), plus the dot-com bubble pop. It might be interesting to see how your different strategies performed over these crisis years and outside these years. Only looking at such a long time frame, doesn't tell you all about the differencs in"weather resistance" of your strategies.

But again, good work!
Why do you think it works? And have you tested it on a different index/ETF?
Simple strategy yet nicely presented!
Very cool
Bloody hell! This is what i want to see. I need to follow this sub (and maybe you in particular)
[deleted]
I am a beginner and your research is very helpful. Thank you!
I think trading fees have a really large impact on this sort of strategy and if your strategy will probably become unprofitable after you incorporate them.
Cool! What‚Äôs the SL?
what platform was used to backtest?
Is it really only 10% maximum drawdown? Is open trade considered too ?
Looking through your code. Did you set up your entry price to mimic an overnight limit order?
[deleted]
Awesome post OP, if I may just add one more interesting input is that we can also check the timing of these trades: for example generally speaking September is not the best time to be long, I know it is an over simplification but it's just an example pls bear with me, so I'm curious to see would the results be better if some more rules regarding timing are included (September, Friday, 13th, just to name a few). Keep up the good work!
This looks very similar to one of Ali Casey's recent videos. You might find some additional ideas there.

Hey, where‚Äôd you get the data from and how do we know it‚Äôs reliable? Love this work
Great research. Is it fair to say that if I had implemented this algorithm in 2020 based on the backtest from 2000-2019, I would have lost (portfolio value) against the B&H strategy by now? Probably even more including trading costs?
Nice work. I haven‚Äôt read the other comments yet but what did you use for a stop loss, if any? Or did you exit at the end of the next day regardless?
Great research, kudos!

In the future could you add the number of trades and expected profit per trade for each strategy to your backtest results? That would help us understand their effectiveness better.
Here's results over Jan2016 - Jan2024 on Daily: [https://imgur.com/a/AWVwuoB](https://imgur.com/a/AWVwuoB)  
\^Disregard that it was 30min.
You gotta look at the sortino and expectancy of the trades.  They are much more straitforward metrics and easy to interpret, and people use them a lot, so it's an easy comparison for the community. They are basically different forms of avg profit per dollar risked on each trade.

My guess is fees & slippage are going to have a huge effect here. Only based on my own experience playing with a similar idea

This is just a personal problem, but I would pull my hair out placing only 1 trade a month for 20 years, but that might be something you're good with. Just pointing it out. 

Clever idea. Seems like there's potential here if you had an ensemble of strategies you wanted to include it with.
So, I saved this post quite a while back and finally got a chance to test it in Indian markets. Specially ^NSEI NIFTY 50 index 

I was really surprised that the results are quite a polar opposite. The buy and hold was the only thing that was profitable, I wonder why this is the reason ü§î

I understand no strategy is good for all markets, but why such a stark difference, I am pretty sure it's not Because of overfitting, as the strategy itself is very fundamental and does not use complex indicators
Great job. Looking forward if you test it in E-Mini to solve the issue of not being able to trade the index.
Very interesting - how did you learn coding? Chat GPT produced a code based on my questions from a profitable strategy but i have no idea how to translate that into my charts!
[deleted]
Ok got it, buying puts on QQQ
Thanks! There's definitely scope to expand the backtest to cover position sizing. I also haven't looked at different hold periods and exit on the same day as the trade opens. So with more time I can make the backtest more detailed.
For those that are wondering, it doesn't work with SPY: [https://i.imgur.com/uKek7bi.png](https://i.imgur.com/uKek7bi.png)
This looks like it's making a lot more trades than OP's testing. You're running the check at the day's open -- is it possible you're comparing today's 2-minute old data to yesterday's data (rather than yesterday's to two days ago)?

And this could be easier to loop through and tally, rather than simulate (I say this not having done anything about it). For each sequence of 3 days (where day\[2\] would represent "today")...  
`if day[0].max>day[1].max and day[0].min>day[1].min and day[2].max>day[1].max:`  
`gainz += day[2].close - day[1].max`

This would obviously be optimal conditions., but it should pretty quickly provide either a proof or rejection of the concept.
So I did a simplified formula for this in a spreadsheet. This does **not** compound or take dividends or slippage into account. Removing compounding de-emphasizes the specific dates used to test the strategy.  
Again, this is simplified to test the signal/strategy. If your money is only in the market for a total of 3000 hours over 25 years, you can find something else to do with it for the other 216000 hours.

This trades SPY and runs from 1/3/2000 - 9/4/2024, which I think are the dates you used.

Column Explanations:  
STRATEGY GAIN: This is based on the "Reversal" strategy described by OP. BUY at yesterday's high and sell at close if the signal is given and it reaches yesterday's high at some point that day. This buys $10,000 worth of shares each time.  
DAILY (HOLD): Every day, this buys $10,000 worth of shares at yesterday's close and sells them at today's close. It is effectively a daily, non-compounding measure of SPY gain/loss. It's in the market 100% of the time.  
SPY NO SIGNAL: If there is no initial signal from the "Reversal" strategy, buys $10,000 worth of shares at yesterday's close and sells them at today's close. This is like a practicable inverse of the strategy.  
SPY NO BUY: If the "Reversal" strategy does *not buy*, buys $10,000 worth of shares at yesterday's close and sells them at today's close. This is a non-practicable inverse of the strategy, because it incorporates foreknowledge of the high. These last two columns are here to reinforce that the trades made by the Reversal strategy tend to be better than those *not* made by the strategy.

|SPY|STRATEGY GAIN|DAILY (HOLD)|SPY NO SIGNAL|SPY NO BUY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Average Change|0.201%|0.036%|0.004%|-0.107%|
|Number of BUYs|1016|6207|4022|5191|
|Winning trades|619|3373|2175|2565|
|Losing trades|390|2814|1833|2608|
|Win %|60.93%|54.34%|54.08%|49.41%|

As I mentioned in an earlier comment, this is a proof of concept under ideal conditions. I think it's an intriguing result.
Thank you :)
Ah cool, thanks. I'll read up on the details of it. Have you traded this strategy previously?
When was rob smith trading this strat?
Thank you! Good suggestions, there's definitely room for improvement in the backtest. It gets more challenging when dropping below daily candles because free historic data isn't as readily available for that. If I can get a decent source of hourly data, then I'd be curious to test the strategy on that and see how it performs.
60-minute test with no changes looks like this:  
[https://imgur.com/hxqzk6H](https://imgur.com/hxqzk6H)

Setting it to trade only during market open makes it slightly less terrible, but still very negative.
Yep exactly this is the correct strategy code. OP's code is incorrect and has lookahead bias because the trigger uses today's high/low compared to yesterday's high/low (data.high < data.high.shift(1)) instead of yesterday and the day before yesterday's high (data.high.shift(1) < data.high.shift(2)).

This is a glaring mistake as you can never use today's high and low to determine today's entry or exit since you don't know what today's high or close is until today has finished. The candle is fully known once the day has ended so the only price you are allowed to trade at for backtests is today's open and close. For signals, you can only use today's open and any data before.
It can be with EOD data because all that really matters here is the OHLC price points. I have my entry based on yesterday's high. So if today's high is above that value then it means at some point during the day, the entry was hit. It doesn't matter when that happened, that's why intra day isn't needed.
Thanks! Yea I think it can be refined quite a bit. I was weary of doing too much refining at this stage and making it too overfitted but there are probably some simple rules that can be tested to see if they help improve it
Thank you! It's a good point, so for this strategy I did actually do an in-sample and out-of-sample test. The initial test was to 2020, but I have also ran a test from 2020 to today and the results are still decent. The equity curve doesn't look particularly impressive but when you look at all the metrics together, the out of sample test holds up really well. 

I have edited my main post with out of sample data, take a look :)
Thank you! Hopefully more to come as long as I can find more strategies that give decent results
Was just wondering how this strategy works with other indexes... thanks for sharing your research!

Now I thinking how this would work if we monitor all indexes. For example whenever one of the index triggers the signal we open a position. That would radically increase no of trades, improve capital utilization and diversify.
Ah damn, some of those results are really bad, although some are probably not as bad as they first look because the equity chart doesn‚Äôt consider the risk adjusted returns and time in market.

I‚Äôm not sure about the adjusted data, what do you mean by that? Are you referring to the adjusted close?

I know yahoo finance data gives the close as well as the adjusted close. But I always use the unadjusted close because the open,high and low are unadjusted. So if you mix the adjusted close with unadjusted data then it screws up the calculations. 
Did you use a different data source that had adjusted values for all columns?
I'll need to add that as a caveat to my next post :P . My point is that it beats buy and hold and that's my own personal aim. 

Do you have some recommendations for the other strategies you mention? Would be curious to test them out
Great, can you share a few?
Thanks! That's also my goal, if I can find something that beats buy and hold then that would be great.

For my data I am using yahoo finance. It's free and as far as I know it is fairly accurate for bigger indices like S&P 500. The limitation is that for long time periods you can only get daily data. I'm quite happy trading on a daily time period though, it would fit around my job etc as I wouldn't be able to sit and watch charts during the day.

I haven't heard of kinetick, did you have to pay for that data?
It's not the code; just doesn't work with individual stocks or tradeable securities.  Results are not the same for SPY or QQQ either.  Buy & Hold performs the best with those.
I don't have too much experience with E-mini futures (i.e. none) so didn't want to test it in case there's some underlying features of it that you need to be aware of. You may well be right though that when used on something that can actually be traded, the results are not as good.

The data above is all on the 20 years of in sample data. I didn't include the out of sample stuff as the post was just getting too long! But with minimal python knowledge, my code can be tweaked to test any time period that data is available for.
It did seem to hold out quite well during the bearish periods like in 2008, when it continued to show good results. But backtest isn't the same as live trading so still need to see how it holds up.

The entry order would be the high of the previous day after that day has closed, so you wouldn't trigger the trade until the next day. So if the next day hits the previous day, then I would enter. It may be that it just touches it and then goes back down and closes for a loss, but those are also counted in the backtest.
I get historic data from yahoo finance and if you are happy working with daily data then you can go back much more than 20 years. But if you need more granular data like hourly periods then you're more limited unless you pay for it. I've never bought data though, just stuck with daily data from yahoo
Thanks!
Thank you. Yes in this backtest the strat takes profit on the same day at the close. I think the reason it outperforms buy and hold with that is simply the trade selection. Waiting for the previous day's high to be broken seems to result in a higher likelihood of a profitable trade. It also means on days when the market just continues going down all day, the strat sits on the sidelines hence the lower drawdowns.

I think potentially using these setups to enter and then hold for a few days or setting exits based on some kind of R:R could be quite profitable, at least from the trades I looked at on the chart. I just didn't get round to testing the various take profit methods. It would open up more downside risk though and potentially higher drawdown if it ends up holding onto a losing trade for longer. So some kind of stop loss may be needed to cut losses quickly.

The backtest I presented is the v1.0 that can then be built out with different variations to see what works and what doesn't.
Hi, just replied to your comment on the YT video then saw this comment :) so i'll paste the response:

Yes I just use python on my local machine together with jupyter notebook so I can lay it out logically.

The historic prices all come from yahoo finance and are downloaded within the python script with a 3rd party library. The limitation is that if you want long term data, you are limited to daily data at best. But for my backtests this works just fine.

If I was to try testing these on faster time frames like hourly for example then I'd probably need to look into paying for historic data.
That's always the challenge, getting a strategy to work well in all market conditions. It's possible that the exit conditions in this strategy are what is limiting the upside and why it doesn't perform as well in a bull run as buy and hold. Since I exit at the end of the daily candle, I can miss out on a nice upward run.

So an interesting change to the strategy could be to hold onto trades for a defined number of days instead of exiting on the same day. Or perhaps using an exit signal (like a reversal in the opposite direction) to get back out. The danger here is that it also increases the risk because you could hold a losing trade for longer.

There's definitely some improvements that could be made to the strategy, so what I've presented here can be taken and built out further.
Thank you. Two very good points. Yes you're quite right about the dividends. It was a bit of an afterthought so I didn't include it in the test but for comparison purposes I should have accounted for them. Something I'll look to include in future backtests.

Also an interesting point about splitting out the crisis and non crisis periods. I'm developing my "metrics" function with each backtest, so I've calculated a lot more info on the strategies on this backtest compared to my previous backtests. It should be possible to "group" the data into individual years or sets of multi-year periods and compare the performance across the different groups.

Appreciate the suggestions, gives me some things to think about :)
it doesn't work on etfs. not sure why it only works on spx index
Thanks!
Thanks!
Haha thanks! I'm still just testing things to see what sticks. This one looks promising though.
No problem! Each day the setup resets. So if the trade doesn‚Äôt get triggered today then the system moves onto the next day and does its checks again. So in the scenario you described, there would be no trade as the high wasn‚Äôt triggered. There would also not be a new setup the next day because it didn‚Äôt make a lower low. So the previous trade setup is forgotten about entirely.
No probs! I‚Äôm also a beginner, haven‚Äôt actually traded any of these strategies yet, so take my results with a pinch of salt üòÖ. But hopefully soon I‚Äôll test them live, just want to get a few strategies put together first and then deploy them together
True, but trading fees vary massively depending on broker and trading instrument (CFD, ETF, futures, etc).

Also the amount of capital will have an impact since the trading fee is often fixed, so the bigger the capital, the smaller impact a trading fee has.

That's why I don't model trading fees in these backtests, it's up to each trader to do their own modelling based on their own personal circuimstance.
No SL, you just hold the trade until the end of the day. It could be tested with a stop loss though to see what impact it has. But for this back test I didn‚Äôt use an SL
OP used a custom python script that they linked in the post
I prefer coding my own backtests so I have full visibility of what it's doing. I wrote the backtest in python.
Yes that‚Äôs right
Thanks for the link, I just watched it now and it‚Äôs interesting how similar the concept is! It‚Äôs probably quite a common strategy and the results he showed are quite impressive. The win rate was very high but at the risk of a big loss. 
The fundamental concept of the method is what matters though. The stop loss/take profit can be done in many different ways
Hello. I get the data from yahoo finance. I can‚Äôt vouch for its reliability but as far as free data sources go it‚Äôs probably the most used one.
Thanks! 
Yes in terms of portfolio value, buy and hold outperformed since 2020, but at the same time there was a 34% drawdown to endure.
So it depends on how the strategies are compared. Looking at the risk adjusted return as well as the return adjusted for time in the market, the strategy beat buy and hold.
It comes down to personal risk tolerance. For example you could trade the strategy with leverage, increasing the reward so it outperforms buy and hold but also increasing the risk.
Thanks. Yea I exit at the end of the day but that was more for simplicity. Quite a few trades look like they could turn into runners so the stop loss and take profit can be improved I‚Äôm sure.
Thanks! Good point, I have that data but only included it in the screenshot for the out of sample test. You can see the number of trades, avg win/loss etc in that screenshot but it only covers 2020 to today.
Thanks! Will take a look at sortino for future backtests
Asset choice is a highly overlooked form of overfitting.
I accounted for the gap in the backtest, so if the price gaps above the high then the entry is automatically adjusted to the new day's open. That filters out the inflated results from impossible entries to an extent. You are right about not being able to get the exact open and close price, but over time those should even out since sometimes you will get a price above the close and sometimes below.
Neat strategy. How about adding all 3 strategies into one?
Thanks for sharing. Please share additional metrics for a more helpful comparison: drawdown, starting balance, ending balance, Sharpe.
Why did you did 'out of sample' testing? I don't see how this is helpful outside of machine learning.
Always has been, died few months ago
How are you assuming that you will get a fill at yesterday's high? 

I tried mentioning to you in another thread, this is literally the definition of lookahead bias.

You take information from the future and apply a trade in the past. If anything you should be modeling a fill at the open price.

I understood what you were saying in all these comments. I agree with what you are saying 'You will know that signal was triggered at some point "yesterday" and you are ready to buy reversal at crossover "today" ' and it's fine if the process is manual or data is IEOD.

But you backtested it with EOD data which simulates the process automatically, so how algo will know when it has only a day's OHLC data? Algo will only know that it crossed the trigger when the current bar's high or close crosses above. That would have also worked but in your code, you didn't shift the max lookback period 2 days back to satisfy lower low, lower high i.e. df.shift(2), instead, the lookback period is just one i.e. shift(1), so your system when executing the entry it is using lookahead information. This is what everyone is saying.
Yeah you can't just assume you'll get a fill at yesterday's high. This is especially the case if you're allowing for "green" second candles. Any time the market gaps up relative to the previous close (i.e. it opens 0.1% higher or 1% higher), you magically give yourself a fill at the previous close price. This is where all your edge is.
What were you thinking of?
Thanks!
good idea, but it only seems to work on spx
I mispoke before. I SPX or \^GSPC is unadjusted on yfinance. However it's confusing because it gives you an 'adjusted close' column. This however, is unadjusted by the nature of the index.

the backtests are on both unadjusted and adjusted versions. i figured i'd include both because my mind was a little fuzzy at the time. The yfinance ones are all unadjusted and should be correct. The alpaca are adjusted (where stated) and are likely erroneous. so ignore those.

Sorry for the mixup. I'll edit my post above for clarity.
I‚Äôm very new here but one factor I try to consider in my algo‚Äôs is volume. There‚Äôs a reason we have a VWAP indicator: prices are more/less meaningful depending on how many people are transacting. I‚Äôd love to see you include that in one of your theories. For example, price increase on high volume is a great sign more gains are coming.
!RemindMe 1 day
Yeah that makes sense I also don‚Äôt like staring at charts hence the automation, I did indeed pay for my data. Kinetick data feed is well known to be used with NinjaTrader, which is what I use. I get the live data of most futures and stocks from them so I can run my automated C# strategies all in ninja trader which is convenient (I only have 2 main strategies right now on ES/NQ).

I pay around $70 a month right now, and I get 2 years of minute data + 10 years of bar data in addition to the live data feeds. I found my backtests to be drastically different once I started using them (more accurate)
Hmm really would be interesting to include the out of apple data, as this is really what matters (even if instead of the current data).

The only real idiosyncracy of the futures is dealing with the roll which is easy.
Ah ok clear, backtest it with mt5, it's a quite simple code, and then you could also forward test it on demo for like 1 month woth mt5, then put a small amount like 1k USD, and double it on every green month. Until you reach the maximum amount you want to risk. 

If you cap, let's say 5% drawdown a day by sizing lower and max 10% drawdown, you could go with a prop firm, at the end you risk 1.4k usd for a 200k usd.

Actually, DM me I can do it in mt5 and let you know the results.
I am still unclear as to whether you are only testing on the current s&p500 constituents‚Ä¶
Welcome. Always happy to make good research maybe even a tiny bit better. One more point: adjusting the results for the percentage of time used of the capital, is just not realistic in real life: If you (or the investor) wants to use the money in the mean time, then good options need to be available for that; then the alternatives need to get sold immediately, regardless of their results at the moment you need the capital afain; possible negative results diminish the capital available etc. Maybe better forget about that and focus more on your main strategy. I think with expanding the rule (so not more rules) to e.g. the total move should be at least x% of the price before entering, you avoid a lot of whip saws that many strategies suffer from results wise.
Hmm interesting. Even not SPY?
I haven't found a good strategy that when tested over many years and different stocks, actually produces a reliable profit. You are giving me hope üôÇüëç
[deleted]
It is true that fees vary, but I don't think ignoring fees is the best way to deal with this. In my opinion, it would have been better to find a range of reasonable transaction cost values then have a graph showing multiple equity curves at different fixed transaction cost values.
Right. This was just a proof of concept for finding a fairly robust entry/exit without the use of indicators, which helps avoid overfit. Better SL/TP management and perhaps a market regime filter could help.

I might suggest testing a stronger mean reversion exit. Just exiting in profit is a consistent exit, but a weak one. Maybe try exiting when the Close is higher than the previous day's High.

I do a lot of mean reversion strategies, and that is usually one of the strongest options, especially when paired with a good stop loss strategy (counting max hold days in that).
That is very true. Also interesting to note is that in the years 2020-2021, B&H significantly outperformed after its dramatic fall, did poorly in 2022 and then again very well in 2023-2024. Would be nice to know that in advance :-) so it doesn't look like rolling the dice.
You should test it. I probably will. And I would test options on SPX because they can be setup to have a tailored risk/reward.

I‚Äôll have to go back and look at your post, but was there a win rate? If it‚Äôs above about 55% there are ways to trade it as a binary outcome where the P&L doesn‚Äôt depend on the size of the move, just which direction it takes by end of day.
Okay, so I see the win rates were between 57% and 67%. That‚Äôs awesome. The problem then is the entry and whether it can happen a finite amount of time after the open on gap days. Assuming you‚Äôll get the exact open price is a problem. Especially with options.
Well said, but do strategies that work on all asset classes even exist? I am not considering arbitrage and other market inaccuracies

I'll work on getting those formulas in the spreadsheet, but I don't have anything for those metrics as it is. I'm just wondering about the mismatch in our counts. I notice you have fees calculated, although I'm not sure why. And did yours complete more trades? Why is that?
It‚Äôs to help prevent curve fitting the strategy. You keep some data aside as a second test. If your strategy works on the main test data but then falls apart on the out of sample data then it could mean you‚Äôve just tailored the strategy to that specific period 
If it works on out of sample data then it gives some extra verification
yeah i don't see any need for this cause there's no parameters to fit "in sample"
Wait... Rob died, or the strat died?
Let me explain. The high from yesterday is the target entry. So today you know what yesterday's high is. If today's price increases and hits that high, then you buy, otherwise you skip the trade. There's no lookahead bias there.

I've also filtered gaps. So if today gaps up above yesterday's high, then the entry price is taken as today's open.
Typically not even possible to get filled at open price. Slippages are there
I have that covered in my code.

The trade entry price is calculated with an if/else type of formula:

"np.where(price.Open > price.High.shift(1), price.Open, price.High.shift(1))"

This is saying that if today's open is above yesterday's high, i.e. there's a gap, then the entry price is updated to today's open, not yesterday's high.
Nothing specific but possibly something simple like a moving average to get the direction of the trend or look for trade signals that occur close to the ma, sort of like a pullback. Haven‚Äôt tested these ideas though so can‚Äôt say if they make a difference
Interesting, I haven't really considered any strategies based around volume. I've got a long list of ideas that I want to test out, all based around some kind of price pattern or statistical outlier. Will add volume and VWAP to my notes to look into at some stage too.

Thanks for the suggestion.
You're right, that's an important part of the overall picture so I've ran the backtest for 2020 to today's date and updated my main post above to show the results. The equity chart doesn't look particularly impressive but when you look deeper at the various metrics, it holds up well and is similar to the in-sample results from 2000 to 2020
Are you thinking about survivorship bias? i.e. the composition of the s&p has changed over time as companies come and go.

That thankfully isn't an issue when testing the entire index since the price is a reflection of the composition at that time, but it would be an issue if you were backtesting the individual companies that make up the s&p as you would need to account for those companies that were added/dropped over the years.
Good question, I never actually filtered that in my testing so the first candle doesn‚Äôt matter. 
But that would be an interesting filter to add and see what happens to the results
Yea that‚Äôs one of the limitations with this one because the assumption of getting a fill on the open is probably not accurate. But I would need better resolution data to check that properly. 
I‚Äôm not home just now but I could filter out the gap days later and see what different it makes because if the strat holds up without the gap days then it may still be worthwhile.
Besides what you mentioned you're not considering (But not sure why) no (probably!) not. But strategies/ideas based on a broad behavior should work on similar assets, for example as you believed for the NIFTY 50. If they don't and only work in a single case it's likely you've just stumbled upon that 1 in a million pattern that has currently lead the asset but that could change at any moment. Nothing wrong with trading that, but should always be aware of the fact.
That's where futures come in handy. The leverage allows you to run multiple strategies in unison with less capital requirements.
perhaps he didn't include SPY results because it doesn't work:

Thanks. I never understood out of sample data either.
Rob
I think there's still a bit of an issue here with replication in live trading. Because you're essentially buying on a break of yesterday's high you need to use a buy stop order rather than a limit order. A buy stop order won't enter the market until the high is hit. Now in terms of the OPEN price, you do not know what the OPEN is until after the fact, and because it's a buy stop order entry you will not have a live order in the order book until after the OPEN. You really need tick data or 1 minute data to backtest this idea. Attempting to enter at yesterday's HIGH price also has the same issue. I would bet money on your live trading results significantly underperforming backtest results, live trading might even possibly be breakeven or loss making. It's hard to hear after putting in so much work but I've been down this road myself before and now exclusively backtest using tick data only.
[deleted]
Oh awesome I'll check it out once I get home. 

One other confusion I was having though. Your plots show the returns all throughout the timeline. If your back tested strategy is deterministic and only in the market 9-25% of the time, the plots don't quite make sense to me. Your returns should be horizontal for a lot of the plot, shouldn't they? Unless I'm misinterpreting how you're defining time in market.
I see, I thought you were testing on the constituents. Thanks for clarifying.
Or you only get in on pullbacks from the gap. Tons of possibilities that might work.

Edit: I mean pullbacks into the gap.
[deleted]
Ah, maybe a buy stop is what I meant and mixed up my terminology. But you understand the intention. Once I have a high from yesterday's "signal candle", then that's where I want to enter.

If it gaps up above, then it does become trickier and assuming a fill at the open is always possible may be optimistic. The gap days made up a decent % of the overall trades but I wouldn't discount them entirely. It may be that a fill at the open doesn't happen, but you get in a few points above instead. It would eat into profitability but I'd need to tweak the backtest to see the impact.
By the end of today‚Äôs candle you will know what the open,high,low and close were. So if the high went above the entry price then that means the trade triggered at some point during the day.
That is true. The strategy looks simple and promising enough for me to backtest it on ES data when I have the time. I imagine results should be relatively similar.
I'm new to this, just trying to understand. But if your back test determines whether or not you bought during that day based on what the close price is, then is there a scenario where your buy was triggered at the daily high and then the price fell before close (and you lost money) even though the close price might be higher than yesterday?
[deleted]
If I have a candle with a lower low and lower high, then lets call that the "signal candle". The high of that signal candle becomes my target entry point.

The day after the signal candle is where my entry happens, so I am waiting for today's price to go above the **high** of yesterday's signal candle.

From that, there are then two separate things happening in the backtest:

1. I check if today's high at any point went above yesterday's high. If it did, then it means that the entry must have been triggered at some point during the day (unless there was a gap, that's handled separately - see below). It isn't important at what point during the day this happened, all that matters is that at some point, yesterday's high was broken and a trade entered.

2. I then check today's close and compare it with the entry price at yesterday's high. The difference between the two is the profit or loss. So if the day's high triggers the signal but the price then goes back down and closes low then the strategy makes a loss. If today's close is above yesterday's high, then the strategy makes a profit.

**Caveat about gaps**: If today gaps up above the high of the signal candle then that messes up the entry, so you can't enter at yesterday's high anymore and instead the entry is taken as the open of today's candle.
It‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs just a little confusing because he wrote a np.where() inside of another np.where()
[deleted]
Haven‚Äôt yet had the time either. I‚Äôll get around to it and circle back. OP said that he tested against several other benchmarks and said the results were some somewhere so I suspect it would work for spy. Also, my pretty much mimics SPX so I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt work. Certainly the volume is there.
What have been your breakthrough/aha moments in algotrading?
I'll go first.

First and foremost, I am certainly not an expert or professional, but I have learned a thing or two in my couple years of learning. The number one thing so far that has transformed my strategy development is creating my own **market and volatility regime filters**. I won't get into specifics, but in essence these filters segment the market into different "regimes", such as extreme bull, neutral, bear, high vol, medium vol, low vol, etc. 

**Example**:

Here I've imported a simple intraday breakout strategy onto the ES that I originally developed on gold futures

[As you can see, not the greatest system but it is profitable.](https://preview.redd.it/3yhtrov7brcd1.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f766551009350413b0f46d015f0b438618a5f4c)

**Note: I did not change any settings so this is far from being the most "optimized" version.**

Now, using my volatilty filter, I can see what it looks like only trading in certain regimes.

**Example**:

Trading only in **high volatility** conditions

[From this, we can see that this system generally doesn't do well in high volatility conditions](https://preview.redd.it/dau0k109crcd1.png?width=1611&format=png&auto=webp&s=050428057fdf27dda31cb6b497ae526f4b027df5)

Trading only in **medium volatility** conditions

[Much better, but certainly not the greatest on its own](https://preview.redd.it/e59dw14icrcd1.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=19efdef346ef66ad2d9c6f59e48eecb4e36b5198)

Trading only in **low volatility** conditions

[Again, much better but not something I would trade on its own](https://preview.redd.it/84ov2bq1drcd1.png?width=1605&format=png&auto=webp&s=b29a0c30e081e0903cf0db1cab62fe1e2010b182)

From this quick analysis, we can see that the system doesn't perform well in high volatility, so lets just not trade in those conditions. Doing so would look something like this.

[By simply removing the ability for the system to trade in high volatility conditions, we've improved the net profit and the drawdown, making a better looking equity curve.](https://preview.redd.it/zypb0z3kdrcd1.png?width=1611&format=png&auto=webp&s=35af40bf729325928410610e5d80a5ee3d6ba47a)

Now, diving into different **market regimes**, we can see that the strategy doesn't perform all that well in extreme bear or bull conditions.

[Trading only in extreme bear conditions + not trading in high volatility](https://preview.redd.it/xord6azefrcd1.png?width=1599&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fd01acf20778470823951276683ca3935581866)

[Trading only in extreme bull conditions + not trading in high volatility](https://preview.redd.it/ragfy5plfrcd1.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8619ea766624359e332141e04d2ecb5e8c8979c)

**Note: Without adding in the volatility filter, the strategy does worse in these conditions, so it is not doing poorly just because it's not getting to trade in volatile conditions.**

So, by filtering out extreme bear market regimes, extreme bull market regimes, and high volatility regimes, we are left with an equity curve that looks like this.

[A much better looking equity curve that produces much more profit and significantly reduces the drawdown.](https://preview.redd.it/pt6eludagrcd1.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaff473d98b208e2c469675e48d464a9e26353fc)

**Final Thoughts**

Keep in mind that I have not altered any values on anything here. The variables for the entry and exit are the exact same as what I had for my gold strategy (tweaking the values I can get slightly better results so this is certainly not overoptimized, and there is a large stable range for these values that produce similar profits and drawdowns). The variables for the regime filters have not changed, and I don't ever tweak them when using them on different markets or timeframes. 

This was a more high level approach to filters. What I normally do is create a matrix in excel for each different permutation (ex. bull & low vol, bull & high vol, etc.) to further weed out unfavourable market conditions. Getting into the nitty gritty would hace created a very long post, hence why I went with a more high level approach as I believe it still gets the point across.

For those newer to algotrading, I hope this helps! And for those with more experience, what else have you found to be instrumental in your strategy development? Any breakthrough or "aha" discoveries?
Fantastic post, would upvote thrice if I could.

As someone with a stats background, something of an "aha" moment was realizing my brain is a pretty damn smart pattern-recognizing machine that I should rely on more heavily when designing either rules for rule-based strategies, or features for ML strategies. 

Basically I originally tended to look at various metrics (returns, Sharpe, R-squared, drawdown, trading frequency etc etc) to tell me what was going on. Instead, I started plotting everything visually and realized there was a ton of complexity that was being completely missed by the simple original metrics. 

Make graphs of everything and really study what's going on. I started implementing a practice where I would say "no coding allowed for several days" and during that time, I would \*only\* make visuals of the data (classic data inspection kind of stuff) and make notes/observations.

Plotting not just strategy performance, but relationship of strategy to the underlying market, regime-based stuff like what OP suggested, volatility etc. just to try to understand my market from as many different angles as possible. Became a lot more easy to design strategies and test hypotheses.
I'm in the small caps market and my goal is to catch intraday momentum both long and short. I have done well in the past trading manually with simple data and my current semi-automated system is all about automated risk management in position sizing during entry and setting up automated stop loss orders. I pick the direction and entry level of the trade though. It has eliminated my erratic bad days. The automated risk management is based on intraday volatility of that stock on that day.  
The idea to focus only on risk management came by looking through the data of successful months in the past where I don't really win more than 50% of trades. I saw the kind of analysis that people were doing, and then tried a bunch of my own and decided it is a fool's errand to predict the direction of a stock on a given day. So, decided to stick to that which I can control and let go of those which I cannot control.
Great post! My ‚Äùaha‚Äù moment was probably when I discovered how correlation worked in a portfolio environment, that even a negative yielding strategy could improve the performance of a portfolio. From there I started to focus on building and optimize my portfolio with simple strategies rather than a single optimized strategy. The real trading journey started after that moment.
Questions:

* Do you use Pinescript as your main dev env?
* By filters do you mean controlling if the strategy takes trade based on additional market information example VIX ?
Love that moment when people goes from ¬´I‚Äôm gonna be a billiooooooonere¬ª too ¬´‚Ä¶..oh shit¬ª and they realize it‚Äôs a lot of hard work and failures until one starts turning a profit based on learnings
Interesting!

One of my ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments was managing to add exits in my vectorised backtest framework.
Great post! I agree completely with the separation of 'market conditions' or regimes. Many algos seem profitable over a section of the market, when you look deeper it is often in specific market conditions before it changes to another condition where it loses money. Filtering out those conditions using indicators helped my algo trading immensely.
9 years experience my biggest piece of advice to anyone who wants to be serious. Less is more always.
How do you identify bear/bull high/low vol without looking ahead?
AHA #1 --> fees are killer. absolutely need to account for this + slippage.

AHA #2 --> my best strategy is ridiculously simple and intuitive.
Was the volatility regime filter trained out of sample? I suspect the answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù based on your comment about keeping the regime filter variables fixed, but just wanted to check. Great post, thank you!
This is really helpful, I really want to create such filters to find the right market climate for my current strategies. 

It is great to know this filtering has been done, good job! any recommendations on how to go about volatility calculations for intraday strategies? 

I‚Äôve tried basic directional indicators like ADX etc. Im fairly new to algo development for context but I am a programmer so have picked up some concepts at a decent pace
1. For some reason, I had been thinking that the entry signal had to be generated by the same logic as the exit signal. What I have changed is that I have two fully independent algorithms for entry and exit. 

2. Additionally, as my live strategy is trying to catch big moves, I skipped take profit at all. Exiting position is fully managed by a custom-made trailing stop logic.

3. I start the position at, say, M30 view, but while managing the position the algorithm can also utilize H12 data frame. So, not sticking to one data frame. My algorithm performs well on starting with M15, but also with starting at H4.
This could eventually work if the performance remain similar in out-of-sample data, I don't want to ruin the party, but this seems a lot curve fitting to me.
What aspects of the market / underlying did you look at in order to create the filters? 

Not asking for the exact formulas/info but wondering if looking at things like (all daily/weekly) relative VIX/Dollar index returns, option-implied volatility, distance from EMA/SMA are in the ballpark or if it took more advanced tinkering.

Edit: Asking because this could be aha momentü§£.  I have my own ML filter I‚Äôve been working on but instead of market regime filtering it filters for the top x% percentile of risky days/trades (last 30-100 days by drawdown or avg loss using formulas based on previous days OHLC). Something over top could be the extra sauce I‚Äôm looking for
One of the ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments for me was the realization that a strategy should be profitable on at least 50% of similar assets without any parameter adjustments. If the strategy is for crypto, I apply it to 100+ coins to confirm that it‚Äôs still profitable and not overfitted
linreg is good actually.
My aha moments have more to do with data and programming.

Make it work, make it right, make it fast.

If it makes sense for your strategy/time horizon, use adjusted prices. What I've captured in dividends has offset all of my TC to date.

Abstraction can be applied to your trading. Abstract your risk management so that it is monitor-able and observable. Abstract your execution so you can constantly improve getting better prices. Abstract your signals so that you can thoroughly research the model, and compare them against other models so that your coverage is diverse.

Also, if you feel comfortable in pinescript, python is not hard to switch to. Started in pinescript last year because TV made it super easy to prototype. Occasionally I'll jump into TV to visualize an idea really quickly to see if it's worth my time to build out in my stack.
nice, I have question:

- How far do you backtest your strategy?

- Is there any case your result not consistent in some period? For example, you see your strategy has consistent profit with low volatility in 2020-2021 but failed in 2015-2016.
Fantastic explainer and real screenshots.  Thanks for taking the time to create and share this. This could be a highly rated Medium post too.
Finally a good post.
Has anyone tried using Hidden Markov models to establish market regimes? Has it been successful? I want to try that way but I don't know if it might be too complex or even useful to use to establish when to trade with some systems.
Thank you very much for this post. I am only a very beginner to this topic (started to read up on this topic just weeks ago), so would you mind to share
1. Which source do you use to get historic data?
2. Which tool did you use to generate these charts? Is it a backtesting tool?
3. Which tool do you run your algorithms on?
4. Which broker do you use to plug in your trading bot?

I will most likely be able to figure it out from there, but it is quite overwhelming to know which sources to start from as there is so much out there.
My biggest ‚Äûaha‚Äú moment was when I realized that no manual/discretionary strategy works sustainable for several years. 

I traded retail, SMC, liquidity inducement, range etc. but nothing worked for more than some months. 

I digged into algotrading, learned mql5 and saw the beauty of data and its possibilities.
This singular post lead me to my own AHA moment. Great post! Cheers

When my features (ML algo) gave me high enough r2 I thought I had "aha" moment. Later on, I realized I still need a strategy to use Ml signals as my signals can only explain a certain percentage of market movement. That's my aha moment
in essence what you found is that: in high vol times you have a low sharpe ratio and in low vol times a higher sharpe. this is basically by definition.

on the "exteeme bull/bear market" performance : you have found that your algo works badly in the tails, so usually it's a bad sign. also this is very overfitting already (less time to react than with spikes in vol) and how much "overfitted" depends on whether this filter is forward or backward looking. if its backward looking it's not that bad but still you are by definition going to be the last one to trade out.

if i am to guess this is some form of trend following because it doesnt work well when direction  changes often (high vol) or when it abruptly changes (big absolute change) but worls "in the middle" which is fine as long as you understand it.

so good work but I dont see anything profound here.

as for my "aha" moment: when I started to  "see through" and analyse results like this one.
I'm a total noob. What is this application you are screenshotting and how do I get it?
Great post @OP. What time frame do you anchor your strategy/trading in?
This is a superb post and much appreciated üôè

I note the use of TV which I use for analysis but have found backtesting really confusing. Consequently have been building out algo strats using cTrader which has superb backtesting and optimisations. 

Some questions:

- Am I missing a trick with TV or is it just not great when it comes to automation?

- any strong opinions on cTrader?
I‚Äôm a work in progress trying to find an algo strat I‚Äôd trust with real funds, but my base journey to date:

- as with trading I‚Äôm finding focussing on the process helps a lot with the algo breakdown

- as another person pointed out - working to optimise each area as an ongoing ‚Äúproject‚Äù: entries, exits. 

The top level market movement as a determinant of which algo to deploy as discussed by OP is a must.
Great post! Im currently in the making of a filter similar to this. There is one question I have for you since it is something I'm wondering myself.

The regimes you identify. Are they treated like areas on the chart with vertical start and end points? Thus if a entry signal occurring inside of this area the entry condition might be denied due to it occurring inside the filter area

Or are the filters instead just formulas applied directly to the entry conditions itself? Hopefully you understand what I mean. In any case, thanks.
‚ÄúAha‚Äù was understanding why I should be paid to trade
Great post !!!
Is this prospective or all retrospective back testing, which is flawed.¬†
For what it‚Äôs worth, do not rely on Trading View back-tester for strategies involving lower time frames. I am talking about 5m and below. With a good strategy, you will see phenomenal returns on TV that are more modest in reality.

That said, your time will almost always be better spent on improving your risk management than anywhere else.
Hey! What software or how do you conduct these analysis? I do have a good idea on how to build a relatively robust algo but have no capabilities in executing the testings
my own¬†**market and volatility regime filters**

  
Can you go into specifics? would love to integrate this into my script to see how it performs.
My mini aha moment was filtering trades for specific conditions before entering (that are unrelated to my main trading strategy). Before this every time the alert came I would enter trades and by reducing the number of trades taken a day my profits improved and variance reduced.
When I first started out, I tried hunting for patterns and optimal parameters, such as optimizing MACD params and even counting the number of increasing/decreasing bars etc. I realized that I should just leave the params as-is and just look at other TA factors to confirm the movement/trend. The ability to change params and code up custom indicators is sometimes more of a curse than a blessing
For me. At one moment, 6 month after starting to code my own backtester, It happend that backtester and coding started to teach me some thing that i would never figure at my own.
So i encourage all people to code their own backtestet
Now iam the number 30-35 in collective2, and gaining a good money in my own account.
good post, had the same insights. also charting algos are infinitely more profitable than algos that dont use geometry, meaning trend lines
My breakthrough moment is defined as KISS, Keep It Simple, Stupid
Holy shit weird timing, just got my regime strategy up and running still working out the kinks. Not familiar with pinescript Is this based off of Gaussian HMM?
Variable parameters changed everything for me. And I don't just mean variable position sizes and TPs/SLs.

Let's for example use an RSI (I don't use this but easy example because everyone knows it)

Let's say you have:
Length
Overbought level 
Oversold level

Have the market decide what these parameters are. Nothing static. Completely changed the game for me. The two trickiest parts are
- so how are you going to let the market decide these?
- make sure backtester correctly uses this, otherwise there's no way to know if its any good.
This may sound basic but sticking to the rules of my systems was my aha moment. I kept over riding my system, making excuses to take a quick profit, or not take this trade because i feared something etc etc.
Congratulations for this work, very informative post!
I also build my strategies on Pinescript/TV and trade with IBKR.

That I‚Äôm really bad at this
great post
Education background, I double that intuitively understanding the what you're looking at is super important.

A lot of people are taught math by memorization, but that's really only the first step of learning anything. It's not until you have an intuitive understanding of the content, that it really starts to click and you really start to use that understanding in novel ways!
I also have a background in stats, and have been interested in going a similar route. Where could I find data to analyze/graph? Noob question, and I have done some research but thought I would ask someone- I am thinking of using TOS is this a good platform?
Simpson's paradox says Hi!

Well, with your background and with this experience you have gone through, I think you'll find a book pretty interesting to read - The Book of Why by Judea Pearl. 

Domain knowledge + human intuition + statistics makes a much better combo than statistics in silo.

Kudos on your journey. And yes, human beings are still the best pattern recognition machines as far as visual representation is concerned.
Yes, this! That is exactly what I had done as well. It helps in gamifying the objective.
I, along with everyone in this discussion, do not consider predicting price direction to be a foolish task.

However, I strongly believe in your approach, especially when applied after finding a reasonably successful predictive model. You trade the model using your risk management approach.

Could you please explain your risk management approach so that we can implement it?
1. Yes. I know it isn't the greatest as it lacks some features (like combining different strategies into a portfolio), but it allows me to execute these strategies live, something other common platforms can't do since I'm in Canada. I also do some additional analysis in excel by downloading the backtesting data.

2. Yes that is the basic jist of a filter. I generally follow a "formula" so to speak of basic entry and exit + filter. VIX levels could be an example of a way to filter volatility but is not what I personally use.
I'm a month into not making a lot of money!

...I mean yesterday I made ¬£4.88 by mistake, didn't even realise a cBot was active and it closed up and couldn't re-open due to a lack of margin, but I have technically made some Algo money, so it can only improve from here. :-)
Dude, THIS! Any luck yourself? Been trying for close to 1.5 yr now. No breakthrough, but steady learning and skills so far.
I was playing with an idea of precomputing an extra column to my back testing data, which would say "that would be the P/L if you take the trade at next Open". Is this what you mean? What benefits does that approach provide (other than perf)? Do you run some heavy optimizations where it helps?
Ideally, you'd need tick data to properly backtest Stops (take profits and stop losses) or is there another way? Been trying to figure that out in python
Would filtering based on VIX or even a SMA10>SMA50>SMA200 work or we need something more solid?
You have profitable strategies that are *really* simple?
Because of GARCH, you can actuall look ahead for vola. High vola tends to be followed by high vola.

I developed both regimes outside of any strategy to prevent over fitting for one specific strategy. The way I determined the variable values was a mixture of intuition and an eye test - seeing if the variables led to results that I would agree with by just looking at the chart.
I'd recommend focusing on ATR and building off of that. By itself, it has limitations as each market and each time frame have vastly ranges so you'll need to figure out a way to normalize it.
There are some prominent algo trading authors/instructors who suggest initially testing a signal symmetrically. As I started by trading stocks & indices, I \*never\* had the inclination that this was a good idea, because stocks tend to take the escalator up and the elevator down.

Turns out this is often true in commodities, and in some forex pairs, e.g., JPY pairs for the past few years.

I also never believed in fixed TP. It can work passably in a scalping algo, but given the random/chaotic nature of the market, more often than not, with a fixed TP, you're either leaving money on the table or worse, falling just short of your target when it reverses on you.

There are a lot of different exit techniques I consider. I've generally found certain ones to work better for mean reversion, others to work better for trend. My favorites, though, are when I'm doing a ranked rotation strategy, and can exit when one asset just becomes "less strong" than another.
This wasn't meant to be a comprehensive post about how to backtest nor is this a finished and complete strategy. You are correct that you run the risk of curve fitting, but simply dividing your data into in and out of sample data and doing this sort of analysis you can reduce that risk.
The filters I made are really not all that complicated. My market regime filter involves linear regression to help determine if it's bull/bear/chop. My volatility regime is a little more complicated, but is based on ATR as it works for any market, while something like VIX is only really relevant for trading things like ES or NQ.

Then from those 100 coins would you pick the most profitable ones? How would you evaluate which ones to trade without a hindsight bias?¬†
What inputs do you usually use? A generic answer would be totally fine.
I have tried python in the past but always found pinescript to be so much faster to as you said verify an idea. It also has a bonus of being able to connect to my broker through webhooks so I can trade strategies live. That said, I am fully aware of the limitations of pinescript haha. What backtesting library do you use in python?
I like to backtest at least 10 years. There will likely always be periods where a strategy stagnates or even performs poorly - there is no one holy grail trading strategy. The way you mitigate drawdowns is by running a portfolio of different algorithms that have low or maybe even negative correlations.
what's the point of a highly rated medium post? job resume? (curious)
I've tried it, didn't find too much success. Was simpler to just use rule-based regime "detection" imo
Dm me
I‚Äôm learning smc right now, do you think algotrading would be more worth my time?
Maybe you need a few more AHAs, since NQ made 1100% in these 18 years.
That‚Äôs trading view, and he‚Äôs looking at the back tester to test strategies that are made in pine script
I tend not to go below 4H bars as it decreases how far back I can backtest.
TV doesn't have any optimization features so everything has to be done manually. I use it because I'm familiar with it and can test out an idea very quickly. It also allows for fully automated trading through my broker. I've never heard of cTrader before.
Not sure I understand what ur getting at here. You can imagine that the regimes are like areas on the chart with vertical lines, in fact I do add that to the code to double check that the logic is working. As for the actual logic, it looks something like this:

LongCond = entry trigger + filter (ex. not in high vol regime)
The are several ways to measure market regime whether it be MAs, lin reg, etc. And within each option you can do different things like crossovers or slope to determine if you are in a bull/bear/neutral market. For volatility, I've found that range bound ATR based oscillators make for easy ways of dividing markets into low/med/high vol as it's normalised and thus transferable to other markets and time frames.
I developed my own backtesting tool because I couldn't find the specific features I needed in off-the-shelf platforms. However, I'm struggling to see how it helps with my algorithm development. Could you elaborate on its potential benefits and provide some examples?
Yes a combination of intuition, to lead you to the right questions and algo can return a viable edge in the market.
Sure, it works fine. The screener in ToS allows for export of data in various formats too which you might find useful
As for me, the data to analyze is the results of my own backtests.

The platform depends on what exactly you want to do.
Simpson's paradox is one that always blew my mind :) Thanks for the recommendation!
Have you ever tried ninja trader.. I find pinescript and trading view environment was so finicky to backtest (but so nice for visualisation when actively trading) and it seemed to have no end game since you can't execute your strategy live. 

Ninjatrader despite some flaws is a breath of fresh air for back testing.
Not sure if we are talking about the same thing.

What I mean is the calculation of entry and exit signals. This is quite simple to accomplish through vector if the exit is pre-defined at time of entry. Example: entry when fast MA crosses upwards the slower MA; exit when fast MA crosses downwards the slower MA. 

But what if you enter the trade and stop is triggered before the fast MA crosses downwards the slower MA? You would need to iterate your vector calculation, as you may generate another entry after your stop (which you wouldn‚Äôt have found without the iteration).

This could be easily accomplished using for loops, of course. That‚Äôs where performance plays a big role, exactly as you said.

It‚Äôs a bit complicated to explain but let me know if still unclear.
You are correct. The method above has its pitfalls if compared with tick data backtesting.
I tend to use Moving Average change (slope) for direction and also tight bollinger bands to see if it is inside or outside.
Yes. Relatively simple compared to some strategies in my earlier years or some I see on these forums. People tend to always prefer a complicated system as they think they are inherently better. I‚Äôve often found the opposite to be true.
My best is about 80 lines. 5000%+ CR backtested to 1/1/2015 w a handful of unlevered assets
Probably a total n00b question... but doesn't "looking ahead" mean taking data from the future that doesn't exist yet?
36.18% over the past 4 months since I went live. Mind you, the market has been gangbusters during the past 3 months. I definitely don't expect these types of returns long term.
What additional steps would you consider before you consider this a finished and complete strategy? A complete beginner here, thank you for the brilliant post!
Absolutely, yes. Thank you for the post!
I think people who are interested can build on something fairly simple like computing the average ATR over x period, and if current ATR is higher than the average by some %, it's a high volatility regime (and lower by some % would be low volatility)
Is your market regime a longer long time frame than your strat? The same?
Ahhh ok thank you for that. Definitely good info that I‚Äôm going to look into for my own strategies
#TIL
I just trade most of them :) you never know which one would perform better or worse than in the test
Pinescript is faster because all of the tools are built for you. But there's a trap, in that, development in python is only slower because you don't enough yet. Goes back to that, make it work, make it right, make it fast. Also started with TV webhooks -> server-> broker this time last year, a year later, I'm all in-house.

I wrote my own backtesting tools. Vectorized operations with pandas mostly. The reason I built my own over existing libraries is because the strats I was testing weren't plug and play (and doing it myself wasn't very difficult). Time Series momentum, Stat Arb, Derivatives, Portfolio optimizations... existing libraries didn't fit my use case lol.
one problem I've found with pinescript is that you can only trade one symbol at a time. You can't build a strategy that picks and chooses among multiple symbols or interprets the price action of an underlying and then buys the corresponding option.
thanks for answers, can I know what algorithm you use to determine different "regimes"?
Wider audience. Share the wealth. 
And like you suggest, if you go job hunting it‚Äôs nice to have passion projects like this documented.  It shows both your analytical and communication skills. As someone who hires Data Scientists and AI researchers it‚Äôs huge bonus points if your resume points to a GitHub and/or blog. Helps you stand out.
Oh lordüòÖ stop this bs please asapüôèüèº

I made the whole learn circle as well:
1. Retail Trading
2. SMC
3. Liquidity Inducements
4. Range Trading

Nothing worked for more than 2 years. Why are reatil funds or hedge funds not trading just price action? Because it doesn‚Äòt worküíÄ

If you really really wanna trade price action you MUST trade orderflow with futures on footprint charts. That‚Äòs the only way to go with price action tradingüíØ

Algo trading is on a different level:
1. Algos execute without emotions
2. Building an algo portfolio is key! You can trade several assets in several timeframes and diversify your portfolio.
3. Proper Risk Management: With ML you can improve your risk management and your algos are becoming ‚Äûintelligent‚Äú. They open the proper lot size according to the setup they wanna trade.
4. An algo can process thousands of data every second. Can you too? No, obviously not. And with data I mean using tick charts, volume, volatility, orderbook, etc.

There is no reason why someone shouldn‚Äòt get into algo tradingüòäStart and learn with python. If you can‚Äòt code then check codecademy.com to learn python and using ML/AI. 

DON‚ÄòT start with PineScript or MQL5 because they are very limited. In addition, you write the code only for Tradingview and Metatrader5. With your python code you can just connect to the APIs and use the same code for different softwares.

Cheers buddyü§ùüèº
The point of it wasn't the amount of profits it made. Also, I believe this was USDCAD, not NQ
I‚Äôm still working through cTrader but it seems pretty good (have a friend who has worked with it extensively). You can run optimisations on strats to see the best backfit, speeds things up but can also encourage you to overfit. 

I‚Äôve also been playing with a plugin called algobuilderx (I have no connection or affiliation whatsoever) which lets you programmatically design strats with drag and drop and have to say it seems pretty excellent‚Ä¶ I now feel like I have all the tools I could want, any lack of results is down with me :))
There is a workaround through alerts and webhooks that I use from TV to execute live strategies. I don't trade any high freq strategies and all my signals get executed and filled within 10 seconds so it works for what I'm doing rn, but yes definitely missing some features like portfolio building or optimization. As for Ninjatrader, as far as I'm aware it's not available in Canada.
It's because of overfitting, right?
please share!
Great. Any advice for how one would go about finding simple yet effective strategies?
yeah, as u/swinghodler said. Make an ATR oscillator. In fact, TV has a bunch of these. Set your thresholds to > 80 and < 20, etc. Something like that.
Hey, I am currently also built my own trading robot in python and mainly trading in cryptos. Previously I  am still using the vectorized backtester to optimize the weight for multiple strategies and instruments, but I realized there is an "aha" problem in the backtester.  The daily return we got assuming we only buy and hold for each time. if we want to top up or reduce the position, we can only use event based back tester. Recently, when I back test again the very simple trend following strategies on crypto intra day data, it is so real to see the SR is only 0.002-0.001. I am still thinking going deeper into statistic arb or the ML way to general signal/filter signal. I do appreciate if someone can give some tips on above
That‚Äôs awesome I really appreciate the response! Yea the smc stuff only seems to work some time, and if it doesn‚Äôt there‚Äôs always some random reason as to why it didn‚Äôt. Any good setups I should be playing around with? Just made the move to full time trading after a great consistent few years and ofcourse everything started going sideways so I gotta figure something out lol
which broker are you using in Canada?
Well I live in Canada and use ninja so they must have released it for Canada at some point. Even had a guy from NT call me to ask how I was enjoying it.
There‚Äôs many reasons, In all design not just markets a robust system will always thrive over a complex one. Now of course this is within reason the system still needs to hold an edge. But the more complex the more room for error in testing, the more likely something will fail & generally speaking the less robust the system will be. Read about Ockhams Razor theory the belief is the more steps it takes to get to your goal the more likely things will go wrong. Simplicity & robustness are key elements in successful trading systems & in my experience are almost ALWAYS overlooked.
Read lots and do a bunch of backtesting. Try using leverage and see how it relates to market conditions, like volatility, just as the OP noted. Verify with multiple sources to make sure your strategy holds up.
Create a column to track when you're in a position, calculate equity on those rows. Figure out however you want to balance for cash then cumsum for the result. You can get your drawdown stats using a similar method!
from what i know algo trading to retail trader is not possible with canadian brokers. I want to do it.
IBKR
Are you able to trade live through Ninja trader in Canada tho? I seem to recall that I wasn't able to at the time I was looking into it but maybe that's changed.
KISS.

btw, to keep it pythonic, complexity is OK. complicated is not.
Thanks.   
  
So IBKR canada allow to place orders using code/API?

Is your program in python or some other language. 

Which IBKR library are you using?
Note I get for leaving PA to Industry
A really nice industry role fell in my lap, and I put my three weeks in last week.  This is the note I came back to today at my desk.  This is NOT a joke.
That's 3 weeks of billing unassigned now.
That would make me feel better about leaving
Whoever wrote that sounds like a turd
That's great, I'd frame it and hang it in my (home) office!
Da faq? If I got that note I'd just quit on the spot.
Bro I would turn this into HR and say you don‚Äôt feel comfortable or safe coming in anymore. They can pay you the last 2 weeks staying at home or give you a nice severance package for workplace harassment. Turn the tables on this kinda shit
Someone‚Äôs bitter they didn‚Äôt get promoted and/or get their CPA as quick as you, OP. Fuck ‚Äòem.
I know you're all laughing at this but just remember that the person who typed this up, printed and left it on OP's desk is a full adult who is able to vote, drive a car and drink alcohol. Let that sink in. And we have to share a planet with this person. Fuck me.
thankfully you got out of there!
That‚Äôs a w for me
*Laughs in turd*
[deleted]
If it were me I‚Äôd be so petty and have HR find out who did it
If leaving PA for better opportunity makes you a turd, then call me Mr. Hankey
They aren‚Äôt worth you remaining two weeks
I hope whoever left that message for you wasn't stupid enough to print it out from a company printer. Their fate is in your hands if they did.
Wow. I think it's time to change your last day to today
Don‚Äôt think twice about leaving
looks like you ~~have~~ had a coworker who struggles to use scissors correctly.
Lol it's funny thinking someone took the time to type this, print, cut it out, and put on your desk all while fuming. Congrats on the new gig. Clearly you're making the right move.
Wtf üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I‚Äôd hand that right to HR
‚ÄúI dOn‚ÄôT uNdErStAnD wHy We KeEp LoSiNg PeOpLe‚Äù
lol
Nice use of a semi-colon, though.
Audibly laugh and go to the person and just be like wow sorry man I'm a turd, you guys chewed me up and shit me out
cool fortune cookie
When I see posts like this‚Ä¶ I always ask myself. Do you hate the firm/company or do you hate your coworkers? 

Are your coworkers determining your pay, your hours, your clients? Everyone always says, ‚Äúyour company has its best interest‚Äù‚Ä¶ to me that says, you, your coworkers all the up until the partners (maybe senior managers) are not the company. So why this resent to your colleagues, they‚Äôre here to help you.

That being said, this note ain‚Äôt it. That sucks he feels that way about you.
Replace turd with ‚Äúfucking legend‚Äù. Signed off
How big is the company you work for? That's not a fun note to receive, I am glad you're getting out of there! That person sounds miserable
If they used a company printer IT should be able to trace it pretty easily lol

I‚Äôd just take it as a compliment via jealousy. Congrats on the career moves!
Three weeks notice is pretty good for an accounting role. \~4 - 6 would be very nice, but 3 weeks isn't bad assuming you are pretty jr.
What a turd they are
What kind of coward leaves anonymous, printed out hate letters on someone‚Äôs desk?

In case you needed any more reinforcement as to why you need to leave that place, here you go.
if this was real you‚Äôd raise it to leadership and use it as leverage
Frame that.
The good news is you don‚Äôt have to do anything to get revenge because they are about to feel a different type of pain! Or you can send a glitter bomb if you really want to.
Are they seven years old?
Sounds like a hostile workplace to me‚Ä¶
This looks staged ü´§
*Ready to eat a turd sandwich?*
Lmao. I think you know you made the right decision.
I wouldn‚Äôt do a second of billable work üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Leave a turd on your desk the last day. It can be your replacement.
They‚Äôre just bitter with their own choices to stay with a company that overworks them. They‚Äôre taking it out on you, but those feelings all come from a place of their own regret.
Crab mentality
Looks like you were proven to be correct.
There is no such thing as corporate loyalty. Remember that! They can fire or lay off staff at anytime and find a replacement.
Hahahaha.
This proves you‚Äôre on the right track‚Ä¶frame it and cherish it‚Ä¶job well done.
Deff print this picture out and pin it to your wall for all to see now and after you leave
It‚Äôs a wonder why public account struggles with retention.  One of the great mysteries of the universe.
I dunno, turd is usually a joke insult.
I would frame it and hang it up in your new workspace.  I think it's awesome.
go on Amazon, buy a mic. drop it.gtfo today. no fucks given.
You shouldn‚Äôt be telling us of this event and posting pictures of it. 

You should be telling your lawyer.
Looks like it was cutout with scissors, who has scissors in your office at their desk?
Well time departure ü´°
Well, after you collect 3 weeks of pay doing basically nothing, you should make sure to leave this in your Glass Door review
You made the right call
You made the right choice. Congrats!
Hand that right to HR and get whatever jackass wrote that in deep shit. Plus get a decent severance package lol
Don‚Äôt ever feel guilty for making the decision that‚Äôs ultimately best for you.
Did you report it to HR? Please tell me you did.
someone is a good slave and drinking the company Kool-Aid
Wow you turd. Way to be a team player
That right there is confirmation that you made the right decision.
1. That‚Äôs pathetic
2. Why give 3 weeks?
I think you are able to know who did this. I don't think many people would do such a thing, they have to stand out.
Theoretically it would be relatively easy for IT to find out who sent this document to the printer.
I‚Äôd be changing that three weeks to two weeks real quick
You put a three-week notice and this is what they do? Talk about ungrateful

Be sure to report it to HR.
Go around to everyone who might have left it and say ‚ÄúGet a load of this‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt it hilarious, what a fucking loser right?‚Äù  When you say the last part make sure to make good eye contact.

This note would make my day.
Wear it as a badge of honor
Shouldn't be hard to suss out who in the office regularly over-uses the word *turd*.
Yea I had a manager call me a traitor when I left my first PA job lol

Fuck em, I make more money and work less now. Who cares, I hope he has fun getting passed over for partner again this year
I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúsue them!‚Äù kind of person but I would absolutely take that to HR and get something out of it
Obviously you made the right decision getting the fuck out of there. Congratulations!

Whoever wrote that note is a fucking asshole.
Yo, if this is real, then walk the fuck out. Drop this off to HR on your way out the door. Talk about toxic and drinking the kool-aid. Sorry this happened to you.
Weirdest.
Fortune cookie.
EVER.
Leave it right where it is, and write under it "Have a good busy season"
You gave your three week notice last week. Got this note, then updated it to a two week notice MLK day off
Couldn‚Äôt be a reflection on management.  Never.
Aside from the message itself, two things really bug me about this note. 

1. The uneven cuts just does not sit right with me.
2. Why the fuck is it cut on top AND bottom?
‚ÄúHi HR department. Just thought you might like to see who is leaving harassing messages on people‚Äôs desks, especially they are using company materials like the printer so you can see which toxic employee should be held accountable.‚Äù
Straight to HR and demand action.
Ok that‚Äôs hilarious. I‚Äôd frame it as a badge of honor!
Leave a turd on the desk next to that note.
Go look at the job history on the printer and see if it will reprint it from suspicious people and then sneak that print job onto their desk saying ‚ÄúI know you printed this‚Äù
I love that this is in writing. You now have a case for constructive dismissal.
There's a rough cut on the top and bottom of that note.

What could that imply?...

They won't give you your own sheet of paper for such a shitty note?

They've printed many shitty notes and used scissors to cut them out?
I would absolutely bring this shit to HR. Fuck whoever this is, people like this don't deserve to have a job in my books.
Keep being and doing good for you but dont forget to pay it forward.
The author probably
- didn't finish the CPA exam yet
- didn't get promoted
- didn't get good recommendations
Sounds like someone had a case of the Monday‚Äôs
I hope this is satire
Knew a partner at previous firm who I can imagine doing this.
I‚Äôd frame it on my desk while i do no work for 3 weeks before leaving
The fact he has a history of this type of behavior and it‚Äôs tolerated tells me everything I would need to know. I left my last firm due to a terrible partner that has his behavior accepted by leadership.
It's reasonable.

You did them dirty, but if you're good with that then this is the smallest nuisance to you.

Seriously. Grow up dude.

It's not a big deal.
"wHy Can'T wE fInD AnY nEW pEoPLE?"
POST IT SOMEWHERE PUBLIC. So the little goblin that wrote it is embarrased and witchhunt at the firm ensues. 

When you shine light on the goblins they scatter.
I kinda secretly hope he had a full pages of those cut up and keeps them to put anybody thats quits desk.
 I love old fucks üòÖ
Made the same switch 21 years ago as a Sr. Mgr at a big 4 firm. Still at same company (although it has changed a lot).  No timesheets, no billing, no collecting, no selling and no chargeable hour requirements.  Maybe 1 or 2 weekend days per year.  Definitely a great move that allowed me to spend way more time with my kids as they grew up.
[Print this and put it in your desk facing the office](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/484137028689617811/) with the note above it
I left after 4 months of 100% paid paternity leave as a 2nd year staff. There are levels to this shit.
Had something similar to this happen to me when I left the firm, except I knew exactly who did it. I looked them dead in the eyes in the audit room, in front of the rest of the team and gave them a piece of my mind. The partner on the team told the person what they did was uncalled for
I‚Äôd frame this
Why the fuck is he so protective over Pennsylvania?
They used you while you were unqualified with cheap labour and are now shocked that you used them to get your qualification and now can leave for greener pastures? Lol. It's the Spider man meme.
I would frame this and put it up at my desk for the remaining time but thats just me
Just ask HR and IT who printed it when you turn it in for harassment‚Ä¶ you turd.
Frame it
That‚Äôs pretty crappy
Translation: they are jealous.

Put yourself first.
This is one reason why I left too.
Seems like a skill issue.
This would just re-assure me that I did the right decision of leaving.  
Also, the professional (with a hint of evil) way of dealing with it is to submit it to the HR, copying the partners.   


You'll get some joy seeing their reaction to that and maybe see them do some witch hunt on who left the note or be nicer to you in your last few weeks, making sure you don't show that to your peers.
I‚Äôd ‚Äújokingly‚Äù show that letter to every acquaintance I have at the firm and see who fesses up or who rats someone out lol. Then I would judge the person who did it cause clearly they acoustic
What firm and office?!
Lmao. They‚Äôre jealous and a partner is pissed. Time to hire ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
If there are cameras, you may be able to find out who left you the note. Not implying that you deserve the note.. by chance are you in Audit? Did you leave at the start of busy season?
Probably a partner
Respond on the note, and say, " So doing what is best for me and my family makes me a turd? Wow, I didn't feel this way before, but guess I am glad I am leaving...", and leave it in the same place you found it when you leave (on time today.)
Fuck it. Don‚Äôt take it as personally as the person who wrote it. Once when I handed in my notice for one company - about 70% stopped talking to me, gave me some dog shit work to do that even unqualified assistants were doing and loved me over near the IT team. Understandably the work was fairly confidential so I get that (but with a 3 month notice they could of easily got 1 or 2 extra months of a fully qualified if they wanted). But the point really for me was that these people who bang on about the place being a family and once you‚Äôre leaving because of career advancement or more money (again if the company in the first place then I‚Äôd stay) - they basically disown you. 

OP don‚Äôt take it personally. Read it with a smile on your face - it will only kiss off the person more seeing you smile while reading it in the office :))))
I mean quitting before busy season is a scumbag thing to do
Such red velvet cupcake is that writer. That's part of life. Tell them sugar cakes to get used to it. People leave PA before busy season, just like bankers leave IB jobs right after they get their fat annual bonus. Wtf is wrong with people these days?
Total turd behavior to post a note from your ex company on Reddit
The note is definitely not warranted. However‚Ä¶if the firm was otherwise a good firm and helped in your progress, some consideration of exit timing should have been taken- it‚Äôs just the right thing to do. Quit after 9/15, or some other better time than right before tax season ‚Ä¶.
This is funny tbh
Make today ur last day
LMAO
I had a colleague print out a picture of a bus once & set it on my desk, as in I threw them under the bus.  I did not.  But I signed their name on it, framed it, and hung it up in my cubicle above my monitors for all to see.  I treated it as a work of art.
Ca‚Äôt believe someone dumped this on your desk
Report the anonymous harassment to HR in writing.  Document any response in writing including every phone call and face to face meeting. They must investigate harassment, likely to find nothing but if it continues you can point at it should they try to fire you in the future.

People who take protected leave may face retaliation when they return.  You should get ahead of any potential future retaliation by documenting and reporting this.
Am I the only one bothered by the fact it‚Äôs clearly cut from the middle of a sheet? Like, why not just leave an entire page? And if not leave an entire page, why not start from the top and just cut the bottom?
You're a turd!

A big poopy turd!
I‚Äôd make a scene over that one. Ask whoever left the note to come forward so we could really talk about we all feel.
Fun fact. My middle name is Turd during my university and high school time every one calls me the turd dude because I‚Äôm full of shit.
Find the printer logs to see who printed it
Scan it, make copies, tape on everyone‚Äôs wall, don‚Äôt say anything.
You should jerk off in the middle of the office and tell your ex coworkers to pick up THAT load
Maybe its me but I would turn in my laptop the same day.
Frame it.
lol pathetic
Looks like you made the right choice
I smell jealousy
This is hilarious but also‚Ä¶ the mentality that it‚Äôs the staff‚Äôs job to make sure there‚Äôs enough staff and not management‚Äôs/HR‚Äôs job is the reason anyone feels guilt over leaving for a different role. And it‚Äôs stupid. This person is hilariously stupid.
Check the printer log for recent jobs named Untitled.docx to narrow down suspects
Congratulations on the new role! Haters gonna hate fuck em
What a turd!
FRAME IT
You made it !!! You should be proud.
Some people are such losers.
They could leave as well, it‚Äôs their choice to stay
Is that workplace harassment?!?!?!?!
lmaaaaacatchthisrkooooooo
my money is on your manager regretting giving you promo lolllll hope the note was printed out from work printer
As if money they pay is enough. It‚Äôs probably partner.
Even more reason to leave and confirmation you are doing the right thing. How long were you at this firm? Audit or tax?
lol why am I not surprised this is typed out printed and left at your desk
Frame it and keep it at your desk until you leave ü•∞
What a fucking loser lmao
Turd
Grosss, immatureüíÄ
Any idea who the culprit is?
Doesn't seem like you were getting a good experience anyways. The cutting of the paper looks sloppy, whoever did this lacks attention to detail
Looks like you made the right decision!
I'd frame this for my next office.
Contact HR, and let them know that if this is the type of harassment you can expect in your final weeks, you'll be taking leave (at their expense) until they can identify and culprit and ensure your final weeks can be worked out safely, and peacefully.
Definitely a boomer
I mean, we had a manager quit once in early February because "she couldn't handle it" but was hired as a direct manager hire, so she knew what she was getting into. At least that's what I was told by a few managers I was close to as a senior associate. Anyways, one day she writes up an email to the head tax partner, leaves her laptop, and walks out...that was all the notice she gave.¬†


It really did mess with the schedules and people had to pick up slack everywhere to cover for that sudden departure. So, I get the frustration, there are better ways to communicate, but I do get it since I've been on the other side of it.¬†
Looks like a 3 week notice just turned into a no-call no-show.
What's the difference between CPA and PA? Just stumbled upon this subreddit and was wondering.
fake
Made me lol won't lie. "What a turd you are"
Congrats! Haters gonna hate.
‚ÄúLove, Mom‚Äù
Wear that badge with honor. Sounds like you did a great job and worked hard
You definitely made a good choice by leaving them. Cannot imagine how toxic that place is.
The firm demanded you work 80 hours a week, paid you peanuts, and gave you pizza parties and THIS is how you repay them?! You TURD!! /s
By turd they mean piece of shit, by piece of shit they mean asshole.
Lmao 

Should‚Äôve said congratulations wtf is wrongwut people these days
If I didn't feel this was a joke from someone I know and was legit hostile. I'd feel obligated to stand on my desk and read this allowed. Telling that the turd who made us going to be stuck here with the work I'm leaving behind for everyone else is on them.¬†
Lmao if you gave notice I would just stop working
You did everything EXACTLY right. Woohoo!
They're taking "We're like a family," way too seriously
Sounds like some ones jealous
Ahahahahahhaha
i get the annoyance of someone leaving before/during busy season, but this is completely unprofessional. on the bright side, at least now you know that you 100% made the right choice.
Laughs in Turdish
Y‚Äôall‚Äôs industry is toxic bro lol
Oh, but we're supposed to give two weeks notice because that's "professional." üôÑ
Just to be a dick I‚Äôd show HR and see if there are cameras that could figure out who wrote it. If it‚Äôs your boss, you got harassment, if it‚Äôs a coworker, maybe get them fired.

Double birds to the whole office and walk out lol

Whoever wrote is such a loser. They're so cowardly that not only can't they say it to your face, they type it up so you can't identify their handwriting. Holy moly. I would blast them in a company email, post that Pic on a slack and caption it "cute farewell messages I got today"
Yea F them. They don‚Äôt deserve you, they are looking out for themselves, so you definitely made a great choice by leaving them behind. Tell them, enjoy the dinners at office.
You turd nugget

Leave the following response note‚Ä¶
‚ÄúRespectfully, fuck you‚Ä¶get gud‚Äù.

Also‚Ä¶don‚Äôt actually do this. Congrats.
Just a reminder that no one you are going to meet in PA are your friends
Oh look confirmation that you made the right decision
I‚Äôd frame that and have it on my desk lol
Dumb question, but what does industry refer to?
I would get that shit framed or put on a plaque
I would find out who wrote this and report them. Trust me, if the shoe were on the other foot, they would do it to you in a heartbeat.
Why are you not happy they are upset at you but youre winning
That is worthy of framing
Name and shame this unprofessional behavior. Or at least put it anonymously on Glassdoor. Part of accountants reestablishing their value is identifying all these shitlist employers
Not even signed lol. I'd frame it.
This note reads like a fortune cookie
Post that on their google review page lmao
Imagine living such a sad life that you felt motivated to leave such a note
Bastards. Haters gonna hate when you're doing better than them lol
You should put that on your business card.  Stretchepants, CPA, TURD
This, if anything, should only affirm your decision, OP.
Goodluck! ü§ç
Scan it and add it to your LinkedIn account.
Hahahahahah this would make me laugh and be so grateful I was leaving. They are just jealous! Lol
frame your strange fortune cookie.
Lol were you working with children?  They can't even cut in a straight line properly.
Well you could probably figure it out easily who did it, who tf uses turd like that
Who left it?
I would have taken a giant hot steaming duke right on top of that note with a side note that said‚Ä¶ ‚Äúno, this is a turd‚Äù
That‚Äôs a manager
Have they tried coping and seething? Oh wait they did.
Pure jealousy
But we‚Äôre family here‚Ä¶  that‚Äôs why we pay like shit.
That‚Äôs an oddly specific fortune cookie message- I‚Äôd consider getting my General Tso‚Äôs Chicken from somewhere else, but definitely play the lucky numbers on the other side of that fortune!
INFO: How would you describe your texture and smell?
Post some names. This is shameworthy.
I would frame it
Sounds like a lifer stuck below sr. manager :)
My senior left in November...I gave her well wishes and told her how glad I was she was getting out after 5 years in lol
If that was writing with Microsoft Word for example, I'm pretty sure IT could find out who wrote that.
Absolutely happened!!
You deserve some criticism that should be in the form of a tense, but productive face to face talk with your peers. This note is cowardly
Can't blame you for leaving ...
This person needs to be fired honestly. Insanely unprofessional
If they printed that on a company computer or printer someone from IT (asked by HR) might be able to track down who printed that for you
would this actually increase anyone's workload THAT much? (-college student) i just feel like this is pretty dramatic
Who knew you worked with Shelly Marsh
I would send that photo to HR after I left and let the witch hunt ensue üòÆ‚Äçüí®
you should write "sucks to suck nerd" on it and then leave it at the water cooler or wherever
Lmao this is hilarious.
Whoever wrote that should quit. 

They clearly are not happy there and do not understand (or at least refuse to acknowledge) the reality of this industry.
They're jealous of you since you now have a life and a job that you don't work 12 hour days.
This note is literally the reason why you feel even better about making the switch.
How dare you refuse to sacrifice yourself for me! Don't you know that other humans aren't sentient beings with their own wants and needs; but merely tools for me to use to further my own objectives?!
If I got this, I would place it on my refrigerator and smile every time I looked at it.
wtf! it's not funny at all. What kind of person is writing this kind of note?

This is not professional and obvious harassment!

I would report this to managers, directors, and HR and so on.
Fuck em. I'd attach a picture of it to an email out to the entire team thanking whoever gave me the note and I wouldn't show up for the final three weeks.
The Canadian Psychiatric Association is cutthroat af.
Why put in three weeks? Seems excessive when most people don‚Äôt even bother putting in two weeks anymore
What a turd you are !
OP they are just sad that you have been in for less time than them and are already more successful
Was this given to you by Shelly marsh?
This is horror - based on a true story‚Ä¶.
Credit rolls 
Main character - CPA
Thriller - partners, managers
"Eren, what a turd you are. We wanted you to work for us for 10 years at least!"
Turd Ferguson?
Gives me Big 4 energy
screw em. You don't owe anything. And they'd do it to you in a heartbeat. 

This is the saying: the bus has 50 seats and the Corvette has 2. Not everyone is your friend at the top.
Well, at least you know you made the right decision of leaving lol
Write "I don't listen to cowards" and leave it
he's complaining about you getting recommendations and then getting a new job. isn't that the whole point of a recommendation
This is called reassurance...
Just reply with another note, "Thank you, you've confirmed that I made the right decision."
Turds leave from assholes so I guess it works.
What is sad is that someone above your pay grade wrote that. Maybe an owner. What a hater. I really dont like haters at all.
On your last day, take a shit on the desk.
Just coast bro. Lmao they need to acclimated to the work.
Passive aggressive bro used the tiniest font, too.
He really showed you, you turd burglar!

(Imagine calling yourself a professional and actually calling somebody a turd in a professional setting)
*turd!*
As a Brit I presumed this was a joke. Wouldn‚Äôt be uncommon here. I was shocked to open the thread and see it‚Äôs a serious note! What the hell?
Was this not like a friendly colleague?
This is so funny. Always blows my mind how people think others are indebted to their job / workplace.
Glad you are getting out of this job.
I thought it was 2 weeks, since when u gotta do 3
Awwww they even cut it out for you. It looks like a fortune from a fortune cookie
This would actually make me feel good about the decisions I made!
Somehow PA has convinced everyone that their cheapness for hiring for the midline and not the busy season is somehow everyone else‚Äôs problem
If only they had paid you enough that you cared what they think.  


Awwwww.
üß¢
A notice period is a courtesy and it doesn't sound like they're appropriately appreciative. Maybe it's best to stay home for 3 weeks.
Make sure you include that on your glass door review.
Wow they‚Äôre JEALOUS
That‚Äôs honestly hilarious
Seriously, hate the system, don‚Äôt hate the players. 

Yea, when my seniors left, I had to handle double the workload with no extra pay cause there wasn‚Äôt any replacement headcount. 

And then I chose to leave too, feeling really bad for my junior who then had to handle triple the workload.

That‚Äôs life for you.
You made the right choice to leave.
Let it go, they are not paying your bills. You do what‚Äôs best for you.
Confirmation letter for making the correct decision
They‚Äôre just jealous
Well, thank you! That's now become three weeks of paid leave due to emotional distress before I am done.
Just write in ‚Äúlol k‚Äù
Fucking hilarious. You're the smartest turd in the toilet.
That would go on my trophy board and a copy to management.
I would get up in front of the whole office, make sure to have everyone's attention, and read the note aloud. Then thank the  ghost writer for being the reason that your decision is wholly justified, and that you're going to frame it and put it up on your new desk and use it as the motivation to keep working hard in your new role, because you don't ever want to return to a toxic environment like the one you are currently leaving.
Ahaha a nice industry role fell in my lap after 6 months in public (1 busy season). 7 years later I‚Äôm still at the same company and make just as much if not more than those who stayed in public but for half the hours & better benefits. When you consider how much more I made early in my career after I made the switch, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm definitely better off financially.
Well, this may be a good sign confirming your decision to leave. Sounds like they were hoping to overwork and underpay you.
I remember when I left PA for a dream job. Literally didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell them where/what I was doing because everyone on my team was miserable
Ngl I get it. Public accounting or no, sounds like you showed up, took from the company, and then when it was time to go through the shit with them, you moved on.

Now I don‚Äôt fault you; but leaving a team right before its busy season is going to make the team feel this way imo.

I wish we weren‚Äôt pressured to all take a turn in Public, even if we want to work in industry. The accounting field has done this to itself by telling us we have to pay our dues at a firm we have no interest of staying with.
This completely tracks.   I got really tired of carrying all the partners on my shoulders and not making much money.   I have a much better life now in a government job with less work and more money.
B.S.
Other than the CPA exam, I think this is a fair criticism but only valid in person and done privately, this is coming from someone who sat through all of busy season with an offer in hand, then left afterwards. Just cowardly to call someone out like this. Good luck OP.
Lawsuit
The IT guy can usually tell you who printed
Commenting to call the writer of this note a turd.
Is your boss 4?
üòÇü§£üòÇ
Partners need to get their insult game up. Definitely not partner material
Wow!  You're lucky you left.

I was an auditor with Grant Thornton and left for a controller role with publicly traded manufacturing company.  

GT took me out to lunch, etc.  They treated me like an alum.  Guess what, I brought them a few engagements.  Sounds like your old firm is not only short staff but also short-sighted.
Somebody is jealous...
Yeah, but you are a happy turd!
Report it to HR, They can see who wrote it and printed as it looks like it was all done at work. Add that this is part of the reason why I should leave.
Sounds like OP got out of a toxic place
Leaving can be emotional. Leaving before a busy season ends can be extra emotional. I had one boss cry, another told me to ‚Äúfuck right off‚Äù, other people said they hated me, others put together a going away gift. This is all a testament that the extra hours are definitely NOT ‚Äúno big deal‚Äù. They actually make people weirder.
Most accountants pretend to capitalists but most are socialist/boomers without realizing it. Boomerism/socialism pretending to be pro free market and then making everything about IOU‚Äôs/silent unspoken rules type methodology. Pretending that government debt doesn‚Äôt destroy society. Pretending that America is a free country. I could go on and on about these boomerism narratives that aren‚Äôt based in reality. And most millennials adopted this mentality without realizing it.
So cowardly to make sure they know your dumb thoughts but to not even show their face when they di
Mother trucker that hurt like a butt cheek on a stick!
If by TURD, you mean I was Taught Under Real Dumps, then, yes.
Send that pic to upper management. See what the tone from the top is
Blah, blah.  They can pound sand.
You have a nice opportunity and took it.
I guarantee they are looking out for themselves first.  Move on in your career.
Good luck üëç
Crazy how people take it so personal, my other co-worker just left too, she told me she feels bad because she knows, I will again pick up the slack, I told her that she have to do what's best for her and don't worry about anything else, she made me her reference and I put in some really good words for her.
if you know anyone who calls people turds (beside your 4 year old son), run the other way. You 100% made the right decision and never look back!
EWWW! I swear some CPA‚Äôs are just the worst. Like actually the worst people I‚Äôve ever met. Good news for you is that if they fire you (some firms do that to be petty and awful) you have concrete proof of harassment. That‚Äôs a slam dunk of a lawsuit.
This doesn't seem to surprise me.  It actually validates my own opinions about some personalities that are rampant throughout the profession. 

Sorry you had to deal with this, but you're probably better off. 
ü´°
You've graduated from turd to maggot!
They typed this, printed it and then used scissors to cut it up. They went through all that just to leave a note instead of just writing it down in not their handwriting.
The passive-aggressor clearly failed to use the guillotine trimmer for otherwise straight edges. Good on you though for moving on.
I‚Äôm the opposite I was fired yesterday from my firm and I got my CPA license the same day. Very surprising
Well, that three weeks just now became immediate
 That two week notice just became a one hour notice
Jealous bastard.
Sounds like you got promoted because your not being a butt and you know how to act around others, keep up the good work üíØ
what is PA?
Wow, I can‚Äôt believe that someone would put that on another person‚Äôs desk.
Accountants sure have a way with words
So they didn't even have the balls to give this to you face to face?
So...IT people LOVE going through the printer's memory....
I believe that's called life in PA.....
I feel like this should be crossed stitched and put on the wall in your office. Or maybe onto a throw pillow.
Write on it:

‚ÄúWhoever wrote this please report to Mr (Boss) Office‚Äù

Then put it on the break room fridge and heat up some popcorn
Fuck em!
Did they put this angry note in a fortune cookie?
Forward that to HR.
And the CEO
Nah, that‚Äôs awesome, I‚Äôd hang it
I‚Äôd frame it and put it in a prominent spot on my desk.
After seeing this, I‚Äôd be glad to leave.
Sounds like the best time to leave, honestly.
You made the right decision
If it were me, I'd keep that note and if I became a manager or business owner, I'd frame it and hang it on the wall.  If newer employees ask about it, I'd shut the door and have a little talk with them about the concept of company loyalty and let them know that I'd never hold it against them if they decide to move on to greener pastures.

You were VERY generous giving them 3 weeks' notice btw.  If I got a note like that, I'd leave immediately and not look back.
Was it preassigned or estimated due to previous workflow loads?
Bro that‚Äôs exactly the play though hahahah. Use them for the experience then gtfo before it gets bad.
I refuse to believe an actual adult wrote that
_<laughs in work/life balance>_
Don‚Äôt feel bad. It‚Äôs obvious who the real turds are.
I‚Äôd frame it.
You put in all the work to land yourself a higher-paying, lower-stress opportunity right as we were about to put you through hell? What a turd.
What a turd
Whoever wrote that, your mom‚Äôs a hoe!
Would be great to get a signed copy
That is exactly right!
Came here to say that!
I'd frame it at my desk for my remaining time there so whoever wrote it would have to see it displayed for all.
I would just do the bare minimum for the next 3 weeks and keep the pay while doing almost no work
Well, with nothing to lose now. Go straight to manager and let them know you have become the target of workplace harassment, which you have zero tolerance for and want repercussions, cc HR.

This is clearly workplace harassment.
That's something a selfish turd would say.
Nah, just show up and do nothing all day and collect the pay check.
What do frequently asked questions have to do with anything?
Petty, cunty, and absolutely unnecessary.

And absolutely delicious.
I did!!! I was very glad I did because they told me who it was, and it was a retired partner.  Everybody else has been so kind/supportive of my decision, so it would have sucked not knowing who the monster lurking was.
I would milk the HELL out of this.  Play the minority card, the whole works!
OP, doing anything other than this makes you a turd.
This!
Topsy turvy that motherfucker.
A peer would never write "you get the CPA exam out of the way early". That's the writing of a bitter employer.
I was a bit bitter I didn't get a promotion, reason being I didn't have my CPA.

Now here I am in my mid 30s back at university to get my cpa at 40... end goal? Run my own bookkeeping / tax prep operation.
They also got a pair of scissors out üò≥
This is the truth.  An adult human‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just so beyond me.  Unless it‚Äôs a joke from a close friend or a prank by OP this note is a too absurd
They could have went with any word, but they settled on turd. Remarkable.
It makes you feel some type of way knowing somebody out there thinks that way.  It is what it is, I guess.
That was my first thought. ‚ÄúLooks like I made the right decision.‚Äù
Whats wrong with people.
[deleted]
*"It's an old reference sir, but it checks out"*
HAHAHA that would be some Sherlock Holmes shit.  Thankfully it didn‚Äôt come to that.
[deleted]
Alright relax buddy I think that‚Äôs a little drastic
Nah. You need to look out for yourself. The firm looks out for itself. I‚Äôve been in the PA game for 13 years now. I‚Äôve seen plenty of ppl leave at plenty of times. If you‚Äôve done good work and are leaving for good opportunity, all the power to you. I‚Äôll give you a good recommendation.
Maybe they had several anonymous notes to leave people, all printed on one piece of paper
If so, there‚Äôs legal gains for u
Sure it was. An adult turd.
There are partners definitely petty and childish enough to write this
>an actual adult

Are we talking physically or mentally?
I‚Äôve had a previous work colleague tell me something similar. He didn‚Äôt call me a turd, but he said something along the lines of ‚Äúoh so you‚Äôre leaving the rest of us with more work‚Äù. I was like sorry my life decisions don‚Äôt revolve around you. The guy was such an a-hole. He would also say so much other weird stuff. He was one of the reasons I left. I should also mention that this happened in industry and we didn‚Äôt have a super busy period like in public accounting
The kind of people that work in public accounting might be capable of writing that
Heart = life - work
A turd; they are.
Whoever wrote that, your mom stinks!
LOL would be hilarious if you just send company wide email requesting a PDF signature on the attached!
Do that, but also pin the note to your desk so it's highly visible for anyone who drops by, making it really obvious why you're doing this. And who is responsible for it.
Better yet, leave a mess behind.
I‚Äôd make sure all the work is wrong too
Do the opposite. Do your best work in the next three weeks and never mention the note. Hug everyone before you leave! :) Be the better person and don't look back.
Hell yea, HR might just pay you severance on top of whatever pay you get for 3 weeks worth of work.  OP you need to do this ASAP!
This is the way. ¬†
I hope the moron wrote it in Word and it synced to 365.

In that case, an EDiscovery could find the author in seconds.
Something tells me this is a very small firm without a professional hr department
Would he get paid the 3 weeks anyway to not file a suit? I would write that note to myself if that‚Äôs the case.
Jeezuz, what the fuck kind of retired partner does this!? Go after the company anyways, bring this turd down, make sure the current staff and partners know this retired fuck, who obviously has no life, is costing the company employees and credibility.
If he retired, why is he still there?
Ah, so its one of those Emeritus partner or some shit 

Ghouls that refuse to retire!! üò≥üôÑ

Congrats on getting the new payraise OP
sounds like a really convenient explanation.
Add in sexual harassment for the turd stuff
The "solid recommendations" part also smells like employer / boss / someone above OP.
I run one with my father; neither of us are CPA‚Äôs. We have a local CPA firm we are close with who pass off smaller fish to us, and help us out if/when any of our clients get audited. Not to say you shouldn‚Äôt go for your CPA, but if your end goal is to run your own bookkeeping/tax prep operation, it is possible to do so without it. We have about 60 business clients and about 300 personal tax clients for context. Hope things work out for you!
Should have used the paper slicer and done a better job!
I can assure you it wasn‚Äôt a joke by one of my coworkers.  I spoke to HR about it, and we found out that it was a retired partner who works part time, on some days, and does nothing.  That‚Äôs the best answer I could have ever gotten because that would have meant that there‚Äôs a fake monster lurking out there.
I found the author, everyone. Let's get him or her
I did take this to HR, and it turned out to be the best possible person for the answer.  He has a ling track history of doing this.  Thankfully, he works with NOBODY, part time, only in mornings, and only on random days.  Retired shareholder.

I posted this because I am still in disbelief that this shit actually happened, and because, let‚Äôs be honest, this is insane.

Had I NOT talked to HR, I would be leaving with the absolute worst taste in my mouth.  Everybody else has been awesome and supportive of my decision.  It would hate to leave with the unknown of some monster lurking out there who is fake.  I rarely speak to this person when they do happen to be in office.
Mr. Hankey
Partners don't care if some random staff quit. The way they run their business encourages turnover.
sometimes the turds we made along the way weren‚Äôt actual friends
So i did the opposite.  had an industry job come up on a client I was working on.  This was just at the beginning of busy season.  I told them I wanted the job but they would need to wait for me until the end of busy season.

Our raises at that time were being processed I was in the office working on Easter Sunday with a partner.  Partner laughed when i asked if I would be receiving a small raise for the portion of time I was continuing through the end of my notice.

Called Manager and let her know my last day was going to be Monday and apologized.  Manager asked if I could give her 24 hours.  She got me my raise and I finished out my notice period.

edited to add:  the raise was not to the industry salary but for the annual cost of living raise the firm doled out at the time.

All at significantly less that what I would be making in industry.  But zero chance a note like that is left on my desk and they see me work another hour.
emotional intelligence is a valuable trait
Heart + work = life
_"Dear coworkers, I received a lovely goodbye-message from one of you reaffirming my decision for a new job. I would like to personally thank the sender, but unfortunately it wasn't signed."_
OP I hope you're taking notes.
Power move right there.
Laminate, shadowbox or plaque, mount on the door of the office or hang next to the cubicle entrance. Big dollar store smiley face sticker for embellishment.
"Sarah, your effort levels have really dropped off since you handed your notice in"

*Taps note with ruler*
Better yet, smear a turd all over your face so you.. become the turd that they want you to be
This is the egalitarian, stoic solution. Emotional control is key.
Its 2024. Fuck being the better person. Stay petty
We found who wrote the note‚Ä¶ ü§°
Just search the printer job log on the web interface for whoever printed Document1.docx
If it's a boss and 2 employees, they're still legally on the hook when the non-boss employee retaliates. 

That's how business works. Your employees represent the business. The boss, having been informed, would be required to take action to prevent future episodes.

The easy action is to give OP the time off. Send them away never to be heard from again. Maybe with some extra cash to keep them from calling a lawyer. 

But the *size* of the company doesn't matter. Law is law, with 3 employees or 300.
HR would throw stupid money at you to avoid a suit.  But there's A LOT of work on your part if you are actually serious about going through with it.
I once got scolded for doing this. They were like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt work for (new company), you work for us.‚Äù I just told them I‚Äôll stay if they‚Äôd like me to but if not, then I understand.
/r/boomersbeingfools
And skid stains
Not sure.  This is a smaller firm (70 total employees), so he probably just doesn‚Äôt have anything better to do.  I believe, but have never seen it myself, that he does litigation work now.  He honestly doesn‚Äôt seem busy whenever he is in office.  No idea why he‚Äôs there.
Retired partners usually get some type of privilege of using the office to prepare their own returns & other similar tasks. My buddy liked to work on Sundays during busy season and he'd run into a retired partner every once and awhile.¬†
Probably because they treat staff poorly and underpay them so no one stays long enough to become partner and take over their book of business. Since the firm doesn't want to lose those clients they beg them to stay on as long as possible. 

At least that is my guess since its happening at my office. They're banking on me turning into a partner to replace one of the ones retiring but no way in hell. Starting pay as partner is under 140k and I already work 2400 hours a year, this is in CA in a HCOL area. Definitely not worth the added sacrifice for such minimal pay in comparison to industry jobs.
"Um... turds don't have anything to do with sex..."  
"They do in my bedroom! Now pay up!"
I‚Äôm thinking you two have an EA instead?
I'm sure that I could open one without CPA. At first I thought I was getting it for job prospects.... which I may be... but really post-covid, and working my side gig, I'm not sure I'll ever be truly happy working for someone else. Always gonna be grunt work I don't wanna do, promotions I'm not gonna get. 

Why not just find a cushy remote job and work my own gig on the side?

I think the CPA might also be for me. I've been stagnant in learning, being at the same job a decade now. It feels good to be back in school tbh, even if it is stressful on top of everything else. 

I also think people will see the designation and be more trusting of my work. I'm not sure where you are, but toronto area, you basically need to be on track to cpa to work an ap desk these days

Changing your behavior, even if its for a "positive" result isn't stoicism. Just doing what they were going to do anyway is.
I'm sure this will be unpopular, but this note doesn't really scream "lawsuit" material. Being rude to a coworker may violate company policy, but it isn't illegal. Even harassment generally isn't illegal unless it's motivated by the victim's protected traits like race, sex, religion, disability, etc. Plus, OP already gave their notice, so it's not like this note harassed them into quitting or had any effect on their job.
To me, it‚Äôs hilarious that he‚Äôs a random partner that you‚Äôve never worked for before.

You have to go out of your way to be offended by someone leaving if it doesn‚Äôt impact you at all lmao
Original partner worked there. Management is blaming it on someone else so you don‚Äôt inquire more.
‚ÄúHe honestly doesn‚Äôt seem busy whenever he is in office.‚Äù Well now it makes sense why he wrote you that note.
Make them ban that bastard from the company
He‚Äôs there because his wife (assuming he‚Äôs married) probably can‚Äôt stand having him in the house all damn day.¬†

Boeing is crashing in 3 hours
BA is going to tank at 1 PM when NASA announces that the Starliner is too unsafe to send home with astronauts on board and the are catching a ride with Space X instead. If you have any ability to get out beforehand, do it. 

I've been following this story for years and NASA has been signaling this for weeks. BA has finally relented and has started signaling that they will be selling out of spaceflight to focus on their main business (unaliving whistleblowers). Potential pump and dump when they do that. 

I have no positions in BA or their competitors, but my dad is a muckity muck in safety at the Cape that was part of the team that snuck a camera on the SRB before Columbia.

You‚Äôre so dead bro lol
Thanks for telling us on a weekend, saved our asses!
Holy hell he wasn‚Äôt lying lol
No one cares that Boeing has a big oops on Starliner. From a financial perspective, if Boeing cancelled it, they staunch the financial bleeding and put this whole thing behind them.
Your dad is so fucked

Nobody tell him ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I‚Äôm jealous that you don‚Äôt know what day it is and somehow you can survive. I miss being a teenager.
They've already lost 1.4 billion on this project. If they cut ties with it, this will likely increase their outlook. My bet is the stock will go up.
You should delete this before the Internet finds out.

Whelp, they're coming home on a SpaceX vehicle....
This person was right too!! (Well about the nasa announcement that is)
OP‚Äôs dad just killed himself and definitely was not murdered
Thanks OP, would have been useful to know this on, you know, a day where the casino is open?
- Everyone knew the NASA press conference was in 3 hours.  
- Everyone knew that it was almost certain Starliner wouldn't be used, as any risk to human life would be catastrophic for future missions.  
- Boeing stock hasn't moved at all in overnight market trading following the news.  
- OP is regarded enough to try their hand at insider trading while also having who they are all over Reddit.
This madlad called it down to the minute. Got any other investment advice?
Came straight here, he was right about the news. Guess they will come after you and your dad now
I'm just commenting because I want to be part of history.
Boeing is going to crash when the markets aren‚Äôt even open, proving that they can crash in any circumstance
Boeing has been losing money on its space division. Investors don't care about it, if anything it'll make the stock go up. 

They are "too big to fail", the US government will continue to bail them out. The company may be a raging dumpster fire, but it will last much longer than you or I.

[Breaking News - Washington Post - NASA picks SpaceX to bring back astronauts stuck on space station](https://wapo.st/472zAoh)

August 24, 2024 at 1:13‚ÄØp.m. ET

NASA announced Saturday that it will use SpaceX‚Äôs Dragon capsule to bring home two astronauts stuck in space for months, because the agency does not have confidence in Boeing‚Äôs troubled Starliner capsule.The highly anticipated decision, one of the most consequential by the space agency in years, is a devastating blow to Boeing, which had argued vehemently that Starliner was safe even though it suffered a series of thruster problems and helium leaks as it brought NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry ‚ÄúButch‚Äù Wilmore to the International Space Station in early June.The decision means that the autonomous Starliner spacecraft will return to Earth without anyone on board and that Williams and Wilmore will have their stay on the space station, originally intended for just eight days, extended to about eight months ‚Äî the next Dragon return flight is scheduled for February.NASA leaders have cast the decision as an agonizing one driven primarily by concerns for the safety of the astronauts. Not only are the astronauts‚Äô lives at stake, but also the reputation of NASA, the world‚Äôs premier space agency, which has witnessed its share of tragedy over its history.
He was right.¬†
They should never been in space travel to begin with. They can‚Äôt even get planes right at this point.
He was right!
Stay away from parking lots OP, you got dis one right
Insane call. News just released announced this exact scenario.

[NASA Decides to Bring Starliner Spacecraft Back to Earth Without Crew ](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cj087pp4e75t)

"Two Nasa astronauts who have been stuck in space for over two months will be returning to Earth in a SpaceX capsule next year.

The American space agency has said Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore - who are on the International Space Station (ISS) - will not return to Earth until February 2025.

It said the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they went into space on would return to Earth un-crewed."
Is your dad okay OP ?
May i suggest that you delete your account and throw away your phone OP
You were right! the news is in üòÇ
Protect this man from Boeing at all cost
Wipe your account fool...
Actually it's too late. They're probably at your door now.

Thanks for your sacrifice. 

Full port BA calls monday 0930
OP is an idiot
SEC, open up!
Shit he was right
Info just got out it‚Äôs true
RIP OP and OP‚Äôs family

don‚Äôt worry you all died for nothing, no one had BA anyway
How does it feel knowing your are dead soon OP? Any last words?
Isn‚Äôt this already a pretty likely event since the news started a few weeks back? It‚Äôs got to be priced in at this point no?
This is the most priced in thing ever. Them going with spacex is the whole reason this even is on a Saturday.
Plot twist. OP is using dial up modem. His post was from yesterday and took a day to upload
"time to get out" my brother, there has not been a good time to be in Boeing for the last 5 years.
The regard was right! NASA turns to SPACEX, Starliner will return empty.
https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/08/24/nasa-boeing-starliner-decision-return-empty-spacex-astronauts-iss.html
Bro was right. Goddammit, your dad should've said something yesterday! That way we could've bought puts!
This guy throws his dad under the bus, for information nobody can use.
Lol you were right!


Good luck to your dad on his search for a new job and the insider trading lawsuit.
Holy shit. Witnessed real time. Looking forward to the follow up articles of your dad being indicted.

Your dad need to buy some puts on his son.
Im sure a few of them are crashing in the next 3 hours
Wow op was right‚Ä¶. He doesn‚Äôt belong here!!
You are an idiot, it‚Äôs a Saturday‚Ä¶ Opening yourself up to litigation for literally nothing except internet points üíÄ

Edit: jk it‚Äôs worse, opening your own dad up to litigation
You couldnt have given us this OBVIOUS INSIDER INFO on a weekday bro‚Ä¶
You are thinking about this backwards.  If Starliner is done and over; they will now need 1.5 billion more dollars in government contracts to get Starliner X2 built!
I tried to get puts but they were all at $0!!!
OP has special weekend trading privileges. He reveled his special level of trading knowledge too
How tf is somebody supposed to sell on a Saturday? You belong here mate
If this wasn‚Äôt a sub about stonks people might think this title was a terrorist threat lmao
And just announced.
He is correct but. Just relesed NASA seeking help from SpaceX
Breaking news, Starliner to return to Earth empty.
damn wtf
lol they called it. Market is still closed though haha
There‚Äôs no way

OP, I hope you get to mend your relationship with your dad before his time in jail ends because this is entirely your fault.
This post is one of the worst ideas I've ever seen on reddit. Prepare for a knock-knock.
Dad just lost his job and probably will be investigated for insider trading thanks to his son giving market advice on a Saturday lmao

It‚Äôs more bad PR but they actually lose money on this
Futures of traders past.
saturday stock crash is insane
Someone tell bro the casino is closed on weekends
My bet: NASA will announce that Starliner is unsafe. The stock price will shrug. Boeing is too big to fail and Starliner being an utter failure is nothing new.
Calls on TSLA it is!

When it comes to Boeing, it can crash anytime ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
"BA is going to tank at 1 PM"

who is going to tell him its saturday??? lay off the coco and get some sleep.
So 176 to 173 is called crash now a days? Or is he talking about actual crash in the sky? Lol
Peak regardation here
Well. Considering it's Saturday and the markets are closed, I don't think BA is going to move either up or down. Come Monday, maybe.

But is the NASA announcement a surprise at all? This has been ongoing drama for many weeks now. I don't think anyone will be shocked that the astronauts might be coming back on a Dragon.

My guess is this likely event has mostly been factored into the price of the stock. I'm sure the market will react, but I don't know that it will be as wild as some people seem to assume. Also, it's been in the news all week that a final plan for the astronauts' return would come today.

I don't understand the surprise. I also don't understand how anyone would sell BA until the news is out if the markets are closed.
stay safe OP
Insider Trading
5000 upvotes? Seriously?

The only really surprising outcome of this day is, that WSB regards apparently don't consume any news at all. 

Guys, this isn't news, that's all known since weeks. Already priced in.
What is the reference about sneaking a camera on SRB before Columbia?
Bro wasn‚Äôt capping lmao Boeing finna fuck this dude up

You're dad is getting fired. Luckily it's Saturday so should avoid jailtime.

Confirmed.
No wonder you smooth brains don‚Äôt make money. This was common knowledge on Wednesday‚Ä¶.
Behold the genius of the WSB poster! 

Posts a comment that could constitute insider trading on a day when the market is closed!
No Dad, you don't understand. I did it for the Reddit karma.
I'm just here for the comments, and I am not disappointed! üòÇ
You could a said all that and left out that part about your pops. So smart and stupid at the same time
I thought OP was some dumb teenager üòÇ looked at his profile and he's some bearded 35 year old man. Why would you post this? At 17 you might not know better. But a grown adult should know not to post dumb shit that could get their father fired.
6 hours later stock up 3% lmao
Aged like milk
OP, you still alive??
But it didn't crash? The stock price remained the same, cool "prediction" tho
Boeing: ‚ÄúExecute Order 66.‚Äù
Yeah this isn‚Äôt really news TBH.
Where crash?
The jokes here are funny, but honestly this is not an amazing prediction. Any post who has been paying attention to the situation knew this was going to happen weeks ago. 

[Here is a comment I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1cy2pii/comment/lgdkckc/) 3 weeks ago predicting exactly what ended up happening. (I wasn‚Äôt the only one, not patting myself on the back)

in the comment, i say:

- NASA is going to do an unmanned return of Starliner
- They‚Äôre going to return the crew on SpaceX‚Äôs Crew Dragon
- Starliner will be tested on the return orbit to see how it would have fared
- It‚Äôs very likely that Starliner is perfectly fine, but the level of engineering analysis needed to quantify the risk cannot be possibly done remotely from space, and therefore they cannot guarantee a 99.7% success likelihood that NASA requires for manned spaceflight.

This is *exactly* why Crew Dragon and Starliner were both developed. Because if one of them became potentially unsafe, they wouldn‚Äôt be stranding astronauts in space. NASA requires a well-quantified risk for manned spaceflight and they could not satisfy their protocol because of the level of root cause analysis needed is impossible to do from orbit. 

This doesn‚Äôt mean that Boeing is going to crumble, really, nor does it mean that Starliner is cooked. 

*However*, if the unmanned return flight goes poorly‚Ä¶ *then* Starliner might be cooked. NASA has indicated they expect it will go fine, but they can‚Äôt hit the 99.7% certainty necessary to qualify it for manned spaceflight without knowing why those thrusters failed. Of course, stocks are reactionary, so who knows what will happen with the stock. Imo it will be a good time to buy if it tanks lol. But I will probably just sit on the sidelines.
Nine hours later and Boeing hasn't budged.
I‚Äôm definitely getting fired‚Ä¶
Bro just assassinated his own father
I don't know what's funnier, op not knowing that markets don't run on Sundays or the fact that he just attempted to kill his dad.

It did not

He accidentally hit send.
Aurora Borealis? At this time of year? At this time of day? In this part of the country? Localized entirely within your kitchen?
It‚Äôs Saturday! Woooooo wooooooooooooooo!
He said today. The infamous black today
No he means all the planes
Now if a plane goes down anywhere in the world the FBI is calling this guy. MMW
Thats why they are making the announcement on a Saturday
I think unemployed is the least of worries when it‚Äôs Boeing we‚Äôre talking about
Yeah, I did a bit of OSINT and found his Facebook profile and home adress in like 5 minutes of googling. He's fucked if his dad broke an NDA or similar, he'll be tracked down instantly

Is it still insider trading if the tip you gave was worthless because it's Saturday?
OPs dad is whistle-blower confirmed¬†
Well damn
There were (public) talks about it for quite some time already after Boeing's failures, it's not very surprising
There‚Äôs articles from a week ago saying nasa would do this.  The kid just wanted karma

Yup just bought some this week. Do you actually think BA will ever disappear?
Buy low¬†
Really belongs to this sub, especially when market is closed.
Precisely.  Boeing must succeed and there are many governmental checks to ensure it succeeds.  As soon as it bombs on this, start buying.
Yeah, the whole reason Boeing has been insistent that Starliner was safe to return the astronauts is so they can create a contract disagreement.

Boeing can't exit the contract without penalties.

But if NASA disagrees with the contract performance then that creates negotiation for exit.

But this is all pretense to get more money.
Probably his dad was already fucked hours ago
the craziest part is that its well known that this corporation kills people they dont like, and its just legal lmao  
we're so fucked as a species
Shit, I'm an adult and never know what day it is.
I often don't know what day of the week it is, but I'm self employed, also self un-employed, depends on the week and month.
Not initially until they fix the cultural issues. With all the failures,  it's a time bomb for sure. The failed Starliner project will just be another nail their coffin. Also, they'll get hit with penalties for pulling out of the program before completion. 

There's a cancer inside Boeing, and unless they get it out, it's going to bring the whole company down.
The Starliner is basically halfway there already
dude said priced in, he knows what he‚Äôs talking about
I don't know why the stocks ever move as it everything in the universe is always priced in. 

Stock goes up. 

It was priced in but not enough. 

Stock goes down. 

It was priced in but not enough.
Literally has pics of himself in his post history
Facebook Marketplace
Show the news to the employees at the desk and ask for a discount, or at least free in-air wifi
Also sometimes when the plane is midflight a door opens - Also Boeing
That's priced in...
Almost to the minute, literally it's 3 hours after the post and they just announced it.
lmao
How they survived all those plane failures and two assassinations on whistleblowers is wild. It feels like lazy storytelling, but it's real.
Told you so.
So do they expect this thing to not survive reentry?
It's honestly held on pretty well
Well, the news just released a few minutes ago that they are not going to be using the Boeing capsule. We'll see if the second part of his story is right in the next several days or so.
Not saying op had dad in boeing 100% could, but many suspected this would happen.


But if op dad is boeing what a fucking idiot.
They were like ... one of the original companies in space travel. They worked on the Saturn V and the Space Shuttle. That's why everyone thought they were going to be the "safe" option for Commercial Crew.
How OP got 13 upvotes in the first 20 min is a fkn doozy
Yea, this has been the expected result since the end of June
Is it insider trading if you can't trade? Lol.
Exactly what OP said so far, we'll see if the price drops
All in the back of the head no less!
Little known fact, the timezone for the moon is GMT+42

Theta gang always wins on Saturdays
They announced this already, that's why they have to wait until February to come back, for the next SpaceX launch
His name is Boeing Boeingson.
Pretty fly for a white guy.
how does tim apple feel about this
Knowing Boeing, Op‚Äôs dad was probably murdered in the last 10 minutes, so he doesn‚Äôt need to worry about going to jail.
If you couldn't read between the lines this was always happening. Starliner has been doomed for years. I'm surprised it even made it up.
As a contractor who has performed work for ULA and NASA at Kennedy and Canaveral. I can assure that NDA's were indeed broken lol.
In case of Boeing it could be worse
lol violating an NDA won‚Äôt land you in jail - it just opens you up to lawsuits.
It's OK, OP's dad already had a car accident due to a rogue piece of space debris falling in front of his moving vehicle. "Act of God" & such..
Security Clearance revoked immediately
Puts on dad
That's literally one of the steps to getting rich here, isn't it?

1. Shitpost Boeing memes to get karma up
2. "accidentally" get your dad killed and get a $2.3M inheritance
3. Lose $1.3M on options
4. Post about your new $1M 7-figure net worth
How else is he gna get his inheritance to pay off his current debts
What a dumbass. This is the kind of shit you post from a library computer in the nearest city on a burner account created with a burner gmail.¬†¬†

Not from your casual everyday Reddit account with enough info to figure out where your ex wife worked 5 years ago.¬†

Edit: oh my god it literally took me one google search to find him. If this guy really did just break a government NDA he‚Äôs fucked.¬†
Truly regarded like actual mental regardation
Just did it. Took me zero seconds to also find his name and address.

Took me another ten seconds to learn that his prediction was a dud.

If passenger aircraft falling out of the sky wasn‚Äôt enough to make Boeing‚Äôs stock tank, I‚Äôm not too worried about glitchy things they put in orbit.
He drives a red Porsche 944. If you can also figure out what area he lives in‚Ä¶
Google "speedtour spirit award" and there's this FB post that comes up.
Can someone explain what he meant by "muck working at the cape?" Or what he's referring to with a camera being snuck on the SRB?
This sounds like business speak for Boeing telling NASA to shut the f* up about their thrusters:  

"No Boeing representatives were present at Saturday‚Äôs news conference. NASA indicated there was ‚Äúa little disagreement in terms of the level of risk‚Äù compared with Boeing‚Äôs assessment, and the space agency did need work on its relationship with the company."
lol he definitely had the information but sounds like he didn‚Äôt trade on it¬†
This is WSB, I can believe anything I damn well please.

Calls on $BA
His heart is in the right place
You probably already know this but, for the sake of those who do not, this post in not insider info if OP has been using only information made public.
Tbf it‚Äôs not like congress and wealthy people didn‚Äôt already have this info last week.
Honestly this should put him in the hall of fame
It is as it should be on WSB. The info is almost always useless with the timing or downright gets people in at the wrong time lol.
[removed]
Bless his heart.
Turns out OPS dad WAS already a whistleblower‚Ä¶.
The writing was on the wall. We didn't need this post to know they're not coming back in the Starliner.
Everyone who follows NASA has known that this would be the eventual result for weeks now. As soon as they announced they were having this meeting today, everyone knew what the outcome was going to be.
Um op post came out at the same time as the official announcement lol
Yeah this outcome was written on the wall a while ago. Not exactly Nostradamus here
It‚Äôs halted already!  Omg! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I thought we already survived the recession of Aug 4th to Aug 6th 2024
It‚Äôll be remembered as being so bad the markets didn‚Äôt even need to be open for people to come in on their day off and jump out of their windows.
Black Saturday.
No one saw it coming‚Ä¶
Space X has stated Starliner space suits are not compatible with Space X systems.
I need this weekend off boss my portfolio died and I have to attend the funeral
Can I see it?
I mean, none of this is groundbreaking. It‚Äôs been postulated for weeks that the astronauts wouldn‚Äôt come home on the Boeing spacecraft.
Can I see it?
Maybe he hates his dad and this is part of the plan.
RIP OPs dad
2 hours later and this dumb fucker still has it all up lol
I also did some basic googling and found OP telling the story about his dad 12 years ago, and also mentioned in the post his dad was three years retired. So dad is probably just repeating what an actual leak on the inside has told him?

Holy shit you weren't joking. Literally 5 mins if even. Michael fucking purge your account you dumbass
Self inflicted gunshot wound to the back of the head
no it‚Äôs only insider trading if you act upon it - otherwise it would be illegal to hear anything

also honestly not even sure it‚Äôs even insider trading anymore once someone posts it on reddit - isn‚Äôt this all public domain?
RIP
I mean, with those statistics about whistle-blowers, i would use fake accounts with extra vpn protection and burner computers
Like literally for over a month
U ratted ur dad out, ur about to lose him too ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)
The guy telling us the market will crash on a Saturday and to sell our stocks on a Saturday doesn‚Äôt understand the market.

Recover to previous levels? maybe.

Will the govt step in and make sure the US has an aerospace manufacturer? Sure. But to think shareholders will definitely be made whole is a hilarious thought
Not when it‚Äôs propped up by the CIA
*Breaks NDA, risks unaliving to give time sensitive valuable insider info*

*Markets don't open for 48 hours*
Boeing may still go down for other reasons, but certainly not because of Starliner.
succeed is a very strong word. "continue to exist" is more appropriate
Doubt it.  They could cut starliner, layoff a ton of people and reiterate their focus on defense and commercial planes.  Sometimes hitting rock bottom makes a company bounce.
The cancer is greedy mbas that don't give a shit about engineering like most corporations
The ISS is about 254 miles above Earth. The moon is an average of 238,855 miles from Earth. Starliner is only 0.1% of the way to the Moon. r/theydidthemath says puts on Boeing based on your DD.
ISS is 254 miles from Earth; the moon is 238,900 miles from Earth. 

Starliner is nowhere near halfway to the moon. It's more like .1% of the way there.
Stocks only react to new or unexpected information... this was a known issue and we‚Äôve heard about it every day for a month. It‚Äôs already priced in.
If you don't understand let me explain. New information is not priced in but you don't know new information the first second you would know the algos already processed and priced everything in before the push to the news happened. Speculation or anticipation before an event is priced in. Once information arrives at the news or here everything relevant already happened by people renting the garbage container next to the exchange for 12M a year.
OP you may want to publicly announce that you do not want to commit acts of self harm
Agent 47 on his way
Was it worth it? Leaking inside info for karma?
Turns out that OP was right
Because it's hilariously stupid the fact that BA's gonna crash on a Saturday
Something something Uranus something GMT+69.

It's early. I need coffee.  There's a joke in there somewhere though.
The best way to win is to not play!
You either confused it with BA themselves saying it's not safe, or came from an alternate timeline. [NASA pending announcement news only came out few hrs ago
](https://www.yahoo.com/news/boeing-starliner-astronauts-limbo-months-093002947.html)
Only in the media. His birth certificate says "Boing Bartholomew Swanson Boeingson"
Don't be ridiculous, that's not a real name. It's Oeingo Boeingo

Dang OP really hates his dad. Must be a big inheritance.
He wasn‚Äôt murdered. 

He fell out of a hospital window‚Ä¶.

I was amazed they put people on that damn thing. SpaceX has a working relationship with nasa that nobody else is even coming close too currently. They should focus on their poor quality planes instead of the spaceships üòÇ
Using a fresh laptop while parked outside a McDonald's that's at least one state over connected to their free wifi sitting in a rental car that you temporarily swapped with a stolen plate that you took off someones parked car at a Spirit Halloween on your way there. And, also, you left your phone at home and use cash only.


Ive been thinking about this a lot...
I mean, he also said a stock is going to crash‚Ä¶.on a Saturday. He‚Äôs not exactly a mental giant from the title alone.
This isn‚Äôt as bad as people leaking classified documents on discord to win arguments about War Thunder. But it‚Äôs still bad.
Well, it's also Saturday.
Lmao, on the one hand, I feel bad for OP potentially ruining his life like this.

On the other hand, I haven't seen someone PWN themselves so hard and so hilariously in a long, long time
Some of his teeth and facial bones may not be though soon
Seriously confused why anyone is thanking or accusing OP. Watching the news ANY night over last 4 weeks would‚Äôve supplied this ‚Äúinsider‚Äù info. Plus‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs BOEING. None of this is shocking.
Sure, nobody *knew* this until now; but the headlines have been pointing to this conclusion for months now.
And I was here in real time
For what? I saw this predicted on reddit a couple days ago.
But he‚Äôs alive?
Before they went up I said that those astronauts had balls of iron covered in stainless steel.
No fucking way I would have even taken the chance in anything Boeing at this point.

If I end up taking a flight I'm making damn sure its not a Boeing plane.
If it costs more I don't care.

Profits come before your safety should be their new motto.
Bingo! A government agency is never going to hold a Saturday presser about something like this, unless it's too protect their contractor from financial fallout of the decision that's bad for them. As soon as NASA announced the 1 PM press conference, which I think was yesterday afternoon, I knew it was over. I just didn't post until this morning because I was busy with dinner and a show with friends.
Hindsight is 20/20, but I read a post yesterday examining different scenarios and outcomes, and it was pretty darn clear there were no ups for astronauts to return on starliner.
No it didn‚Äôt
Quasimodo predicted all of this.
I literally saw a wsb post about this like 3 weeks ago
Yeah this isn‚Äôt news. They‚Äôve been speculating this for weeks
I‚Äôm trying to dump my shares, but I think Schwab froze my account because my orders not going through!!!

Even if they use the Apple lightning cable?
Couldn't  they could bring 2 extra suits if that's the case?
That‚Ä¶.. seems like an oversight that NASA should have thought about and required in the design spec. JFC what‚Äôs the point of having multiple space companies if you are not going to require interopability between critical components. Do the space x doors also not fit the starliner doors!?
No
No

Is this a reference or is that actually his name? Either way insane
So we just need to create a group here and share insider information since it‚Äôs a public group anyway ü§£

Not the worst play, who knows. What‚Äôs your cost basis?
pretty much this. it's not a bad long term hold. but if you're looking for money this year. it ain't it.
Yup. Boeing as an entity can survive while shareholders get wiped out. Just ask GM shareholders from 2009 what that looks like.
I agree that hitting rock bottom and setting a course correction could fix their stock price, as long as they have fixed the cultural issues and don't have any major issues in the near future.
Clowns supervised by monkeys, presumably supervised by these greedy mbas you speak of their crooked executives.
Now do the delta V.

And it barely made it that far.
I mean you can argue there is a distinct difference between knowing something might happen in the future and it actually taking place.

Hundreds of millions of dollars over budget and still not working vs. Already doing flights for 4 years

Boeing is a joke.

Jokes on OP it's all Boeing stock options for 250 a share
Sierra just finished their first Dreamchaser spaceplane, so if nothing major goes wrong with that, it'll probably end up being the other manned spacecraft that NASA uses after its first launch in 2025. Starliner is just going to end up in the scrap heap.


As a bonus, Dreamchaser is partially designed as a space station "lifeboat" that can stay on orbit for long periods of time and return on short notice with extremely high reliability.
Good luck avoiding every single camera along the way.
He's also ignoring that Boeing is also a multi billion dollar US defense contractor and sole American manufacturer of airliners. Uncle Sam will not let anything happen to Boeing.
Ha ha, Hes in danger!
we all knew it was coming eventually, but no one knew exactly when (which tends to be the most important thing if you're an options degenerate)

to pinpoint with accuracy the date and time is what will get the SEC on your side of the wendys dumpster
And wasn't the 1pm call because they had a press conference scheduled.
Yeah there were already leaks before this
He's in the witness protection program, why do you think he went out to buy milk and never came back?

I saw Apollo 13, they just need to get the square thing and connect it to the round thing with some duct tape and some random hoses and filters that are just laying around the ship. 

Then they‚Äôll be good.
That should go well with the $40 PS5 hand held game controller that Boeing uses in their space capsule.
Literally impossible. For reasons.

I guess they just gonna die
Yeah, the odds on favorite solution at this point is a Crew Dragon flies up on Sep 24, light on crew so two extra seats are available for the return in Feb., and a pair of spare suits.
Spaceflight is very big on avoiding common failure modes and arriving at "dissimilar redundancy".

If they had come up with some standard and forced both SpaceX and Boeing to follow it, and then there were an issue found with that standard, the U.S. loses its manned spaceflight capability until the issue is resolved.

If they let the companies come up with their own designs, then it's less likely that a failure of one requires grounding the other.

That's why Starliner exists in the first place. If all NASA wanted was redundancy, they could just contract SpaceX to keep another Crew Dragon on standby at all times. Or build twice as many capsules. But they want *dissimilar* redundancy. So they need another company that does their own design from scratch.

And it's not like this was a hard problem to overcome. NASA has the measurements for all the astronauts. They just asked SpaceX to whip up some suits and they're sending them up on the Dragon capsule that will bring the astronauts home.
The solution is rather easy. They're just going to fly up new suits for them. The suits don't even have to fit perfectly because the astronauts won't be moving much. Forcing different companies to agree on the same design for the suits isn't necessarily a winning move if the fix is that simple.¬†
Gee. It‚Äôs almost like the space program shouldn‚Äôt have been farmed out¬†

You need about 7800m/s delta-v to get to a LEO orbit and then another 100-500m/s depending on where in orbit the ISS is at any given time. 

Doing a translunar injection to get to the moon from earth requires a bit over 11200m/s.

Kinetic energy is 1/2\*mv\^2. At a nominal weight of 13000kg, Starliner would need \~208GJ to get to the ISS vs. 407GJ to get to the moon. However, this does not account for crew weight, which if it includes op's mom, would not make it to the moon at all.
Ya it‚Äôs basically probabilities- like the likelihood of this happening was maybe 50% when we first heard about the problem, last week it was 97%, now it‚Äôs like 99%. Nothing substantial has changed between the last time the stock was traded and now.

The Air Force once used like 2k PS3s to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper then buying the parts. Soo...
It's always been farmed out to contractors.   Grumman built the LEM.  Rockwell built the CSM.   Boeing, IIRC, was involved in the Saturn 5 booster.

NASA needed to apply more oversight in the design review, that's the issue.   They might have forseen that putting all the thrusters in an enclosure where they couldn't radiate heat well as a problem.  Heat management in a vacuum is Rocket Science 101.
So we could just start randomly posting nonsense predictions then when someone posts it eith back up after the initial posting we're scot free!

Update: I am done/ I quit!!!
Hey guys, here's the link to my orignal post, that I posted yesterday. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/s/jG61o74kaG

Hello All! 

Here's the update on how my resignation went.

I reached my office tower at 8am, and I scheduled a check in with my direct reporting Partner, at 830. Generally at 10am, we have our workflow call to go over project updates, hence I wanted to get it done before that call. Anyways, I went in his office, and told him my intention to resign.

At first, he didn't believe and told me to go away. I assured him I was serious and I was seriously resigning. His face dropped! He literally acted like my concerns were a non issue, saying stuff like this normal part of public practice, and that sometimes work increases and its fine. Basically, normalizing the situation. He asked if this was about money or if this a threat. It was quite embarrassing.

I told him, I do not wish to continue at this firm, and I am officially resigning today and I will serve a two week notice period. I thanked him for his time and support and walked out to my desk. Literally, 20 mins later, I get an invite on my teams, titled "Senior Leadership discussion". I chuckled.

So at noon I logged into teams, and had my meeting with the four most senior partners of my department, including the managing partner. They mentioned, how they care about my mental health and they are willing to up my salary by 15K, and they are offering me to take 2 weeks starting today. Side point, they also mentioned if I do take this offer, I will have to sign a agreement not to mention this to anyone, basically a NDA.  I said no thank you and I am done. They couldn't believe it, I felt them getting mad at me. I retorted saying, I had asked you a raise in December last year, why the fuck did you say no at that point. They said, we were not in that position at that point to agree, but now since they have more budget they can offer me now. I again mentioned why did it take to me resigning, you could have offered it to me last week. They had no answer, so they apologized and asked me not to leave, even mentioning they would make me Director in our next promotion cycle. Finally adding they saw me as family, and how disappointed they are in me. I smiled and said thank you üòä. 

Though I am not the best Senior Manager in my department, I do have the largest portfolio, and losing me would cause absolute havoc on one of my larger client, which is a disgusting client. I reiterated, I will stay on board to ensure smooth handover but I am done.

They scheduled another meeting at 3pm, to offer me another bump, but honestly I didn't even looks at it. I kindly and respectfully said no, and left the office at 330PM. So I can get home to watch the Bills play.

Honestly the best decision of my life. I feel so much at peace ‚úåÔ∏è.  And looking forward to my time off. I am getting all my dental check ups before they cancel my insurance. It has been a funny day! Anyways, loved all your comments and replies. I will be taking on teaching  Accounting classes and CPA prep classes at a public university nearby, I always did it part time, but now might take on some more load. I love teaching accounting. Thank you all !!!
15k here and 20k there...practically rounding errors in what the partners make.
That's some hard core 'i quit' erotica right there.
I think, on reflection, that a big part of burnout is holding everything together without being appreciated. Take a long break and find someone who is going to appreciate your work IMO. Good luck.
This whole thing made my day

It‚Äôs pretty nauseating how predictable these fucks are. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have budget a few weeks ago, but now we do!‚Äù Such bullshit, and they freaked because it‚Äôs going to make them work more. Good for you for sticking to your guns.
We might not be unionized, but posts like this help us to collectively be informed and know how to defend ourselves in these situations!
It‚Äôs always, ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt have budget before, we do now.‚Äù What changed in 24 hours that resulted in a budget surplus? Happy for you!!
That‚Äôs amazing.  I am a tax partner at a pa firm and do not blame you one bit.  Good luck with your future, I am sure you will be just fine
Classic leadership trying to nickel and dime and it backfiring haha them cheap ass fucks
As an FP&A guy, not having budget is always a lie. They are unwilling to blow their own budget, have no favors to burn, or are unwilling to push for more budget (this especially if you asked in December, they just had to roll it into the ‚Äò24 budget, lazy and zero interest in protecting their direct reports)

CONGRATS!
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a good slave, master. I work hardd master. Look, feel my biceps master. I‚Äôm a loyal slave too, master. You can give me an extra 30hrs of work pw and I‚Äôll do it master. Even though you make millions at the expense of my personal and familial life and I haven‚Äôt started a family yet at 33yo I‚Äôll never ask for more of anything apart from more work master. When god asks me what I did with my life like whitney houston ..I will say I spent it with you master‚Äù

Partner: ‚Äútoo many instances of ‚Äòmaster‚Äô, bad optics. fix pls‚Äù
>promised a promotion at the next review cycle¬†


Do people actually fall for this shit?¬†
This even made me feel so relieved and I have no idea who you are, congrats on your next chapter!
I got a contact power trip just by reading this. Good on your bro. I am glad you didn't cave and get back into that shit show. I am happy for you.
It always feels good to leave the stress behind.

15K isn't a big bump in today's market imo and it always feels weird getting a raise after trying to resign. The relationship just doesn't feel normal after that.
Literally ripped a hole in my underwear reading this. Good job
Now, if they call you at all after your 2 weeks is up to ask questions or anything, tell them that you will gladly sign them up as a client if your and that you charge $700 an hour with a minimum 10 hours. And that this is to be paid up front.
CPA here in the US, 30 years of accounting, what a brutal profession that has only gotten worse with the PCAOB, 404b SOX, SEC regulations etc. but I have been in Private for 25 years now.  Big 4 doesn't care at all about their people or even in Private industry for that matter.  I think I am finally witnessing a quiet revolution amongst accountants to not take this sh@t anymore.  I am truly proud of you, good for you, feel good about your decisions.  I am too old to start over but you are not.   Best of luck to you, truly.
Good for you!  Screw those miserable bastards.  They say it‚Äôs normal because their view is totally screwed up.
Congratulations! I hope they learn their lesson in valuing and rewarding people who works hard and deserves it. I hope your next adventure will be rewarding. Best of luck!
Fuck yeah! 

Thanks for sharing your story. You're going to be so much happier!
No job is more important than watching football. You did the right thing
$15K raise?!?!  That's pathetic, try doubling that and then maybe entertain the idea.  Regardless, you're out, good on ya!
MashAllah brother
I‚Äôve never respected a manager that just wished me well in my next job more than after I had a similar hour long grilling about my next job like you wrote up. Managers who can move past personal feelings and understand that jobs are just jobs and wish you well are goats
This is so wholesome. If I don‚Äôt get the promotion that I‚Äôm after mid year, imma pull this exact same thing. Thanks for sharing OPü´°
Just resigned too today! Congratz bud
This is awesome - best of luck in everything!
üëç
Love it love it love it
2 weeks? That‚Äôd be 3 or 6 months in UK
Public Accounting Partners are a whole different breed of greedy. They just keep "finding more budget"
As a tip for the hiring process, from someone who also quit without a job lined up. Most F500 companies take weeks to respond to applications. The first few weeks of applying I got nothing and got really worried I screwed up big. After 1.5 months I had a good offer, and I started asking for expediting the interview process. Some companies won‚Äôt do it. This was right before covid October-December 2019. 

The next few days at work are going to be so sweet knowing you‚Äôre done, you coworkers will look at you with jealousy.
Stop I can only get so hard.

Seriously. Well. Fucking. Done.

Any associates, seniors, managers reading this, take note.

There are firms out there who will treat you well. Fuck these clowns.
You are our hero. Enjoy your time off.
Offered to up your salary by 15k? You can work in industry for prob get a 40K increase and less work easy. That is laughable and shows how out of touch the partners are.

Also fuck them for guilting you for leaving to better yourself. If they ‚Äúsaw you as family‚Äù they would have looked out for your best interest.
Wow congratulations on getting this done, are you done with public accounting for good? What is your next move? I am thinking about transitioning into public accounting but hearing stories like this make me very hesitant.
This is a post for the ages. You must feel so great considering how great I feel just reading it!!

>why did it take to me resigning, you could have offered it to me last week. They had no answer

I nearly fell off my couch

Edit: Go Bill's! What a day
üëèüëèüëèüëè
Are you in WNY?
What a guy. I‚Äôm so glad you followed up with this and explains everything in depth. This was a joy to read through, thank you for sharing that feeling with everyone.
and Buffalo won that game, cherry on top!
You did the right thing. And I‚Äôm sure you know this, but they were lying to you. They might give you the raise for busy season, but they would fire your ass on April 16th. I‚Äôve seen this done on a few occasions and that‚Äôs what always happens. 

These partners were a toxic bunch. And cheap SOBs too. 

But hey‚Ä¶.they fucked around and found out thanks to you. 

I have 35 years into accounting, 18 years of that in PA. And today, you are my accounting hero. ü§©

Finally. One of the good guys stickin it to The Man. üòÇ
Loved the original post, but LOVE this one even more! Good for you!!
I am so fucking proud of you! Enjoy your much deserved break!
Loved your story! I too was a Senior Manager who resigned from a CPA firm. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt even matter the firm, this kind of behavior is all too common. 

I didn‚Äôt resign over money, I was actually being very well paid. Very similar to your story I resigned to claim my life back. They were stealing so much of my free time that I felt like a slave. I was extremely burnt out, ignoring my health, and on a path of destruction. So I, without any notice, walked in there and resigned. They did not see it coming and scrambled to get me to stay. I simply told them under no circumstances am I staying. They didn‚Äôt care about me, they cared about all the business I brought in. 

It‚Äôs been two years now and it‚Äôs been the best decision I ever made! I‚Äôm in such a better place with my physical and mental health now. I‚Äôve created a life that values my personal free time. People like you and I are the true winners!
Hey give us an update on how the two weeks play out.  Cannot wait to hear.
Good luck, sometimes it takes huge load of ball to say "fuck it, i'm done".
Good for you, awesome
lmao it‚Äôs exactly how we all thought it would go down. more money. more time off. it‚Äôs hilarious. good on ya. onward and upward.
Woot Woot
Congratulations üéâ. Stick to your decision.  They might offer you the stars right now but I promise you will have a target on your back. They had the money all along, they just assumed they could push you and you would accept.  Take care and enjoy the season without anxiety and stress.
Congrats


You offer your services when you want to whom you want


You don't want to work in Public Accting, no big deal. Your firm should thank yoy for the years of service you gave them and be happy your moving onto another stage in your career.¬†


A good firm which is desirable would have a large lunch/dinner for you with any of your closest work friends. Thank you for your service and see you move on


Senior Manager is very tenured and you mentioned your handling big projects with hellish clients


At the firm I am currently at, a manager is quitting and leaves in a few weeks. There is a dinner to celebrate his time with the firm before he leaves
I also love teaching accounting, I also went into academia for awhile, but the politics of education are also heartbreaking, good luck
$15k, lmfao. I would have said, you forgot a zero. To the right. Not in the cents column.
Happy you stuck to your principles!
All anger aside, offer to work remotely as a consultant part-time at double your current hourly
This has made my day  and I wish every accountants would have the gut to say no to these cheap selfish bastards like op did.
Them: "We see you as family"

"Your family must hate you"
I was also offered more money and told that I would need to sign an NDA. Guess it goes around. Congratulations and enjoy life.
Genuinely happy you held strong. This profession isn‚Äôt sexy. We‚Äôre not curing cancer or changing humanity. But goddammit, we‚Äôre helping keep a financial market stable and we‚Äôre grinding our souls down to stumps in the process. Having a shitty management team like this is just a donkey-kick to the nut sack on a cold morning. Fuck that. 

Congratu-fuking-lations!! Good luck ü´°
\*Slow Clap\*

Congrats dude, happy for you.
Congrats,  we need an update on the update regarding how your 2 weeks go
Nothing like the feeling of quitting public tbh. Congrats.
This might be a stupid question but hear me out. What if you made them fire you? Hypothetically, let‚Äôs say you point blank refused to take on more work unless they provide you additional workforce to manage it; you refused to work a single hour more than what is stipulated in your contract; you continue to work just well enough so they can‚Äôt fire you for anything but you not working like a donkey for them? Would you get a good severance package? 
Just sort of thinking out loud because I want to be a CPA. Thanks.
Nice ending! Good luck with teaching!
Whoooo!!! Freedom! After last busy season man you are going to love this one ü•≥ thank you for the update!
Yet another article will come out about the accounting profession and the lack of workers, with interviews from partners who are just so dumbfounded on what is going on and how to solve it..  so much of the accounting industry is a shit. What the F is wrong with these people. Firms can lose half their work force, with employees all saying the same thing about work life and pay when they quit, but the partners will be scratching their ass saying, "huuuur derp I don't get what's going on. Nobody wants to work anymore!"
It's crazy how satisfying this is even though I don't know anyone involved.

Or do we all kind of, in a way, know everyone involved.
There isn‚Äôt a better feeling in the world when you quit a miserable job. It feels like 100 pounds is taken off your back and the uncertainty of the future doesn‚Äôt seem so burdensome anymore
You need to give us a Day 2 update. Moar ‚ÄúI quit‚Äù drama nom nom nom.
Good.
Lol people are actually believing in this story?
Legit, why is this story the rinse was repeat for every freaking accounting firm? The only way to get a raise after putting in the work for years is the breaking point.   


So common, and amazingly I have witnessed many persons in your position - 180 and accept the 25k + meaningless tittle - over and over again.   


Massive respect for leaving and going CPA.
Side question, you reached senior manager without a CPA?
Losing you won‚Äôt cause havoc they will just hire someone else. Don‚Äôt think your that important and next time resign without all the theatre of this post is indeed real.
I loved every word of this post.
On your way out, be sure to tell your underpaid colleagues that there is now money in the budget for raises when there wasn't 24 hours ago.
Is this real?
Embarrassing fake shitpost. You were probably as good an accountant as you are a writer.
you are the man, screw these loser partners who want indentured slaves
Congratulations!
Proud of you!
I love you
Well done OP! 

a lesson that's painful is more likely to be learned.
Interesting. All the best for your next journey!
You the real MVP!
YEAH!!!!!!
Sounds like you‚Äôre dodging a massive bullet ‚Ä¶ a bullet covered in dog shit‚Ä¶ congrats! You probably saved a few years of your life
Hero.
Huge balls. Congrats!!!
Love to see this. Enjoy your new life
This is keno.
Not all heroes wear capes üôå
Do you think the $15,000 raise, and promotion to director whenever, were legitimate? Or just delaying action for them? 

Because to me, it sounds like they trying to buy time before they fire you themselves because they‚Äôve secured your replacement.
6 years and you made it to Senior Manager at Big 4?! Well done,
    
GO BILLS!
These partners are dumb.
Fact is, it is a negotiation. When you ask for a raise they have no incentive to go outside the normal bands. But when you threaten to quit or have a competing offer then you have leverage.
They‚Äôll give you that salary bump but also give you a load more of work ü§£
I'm a dolphins fan but still glad the bills won for you to end a stressful day on a high note!
Respect for doing what you want but not even looking at the second bump is so foreign to me
Good for you for sticking to your guns and setting personal boundaries. We need more people like you so partners learn to respect their employees and compensate them fairly *before they quit.*
Just don't come back because it's common to get frustrated in the industry or don't have an opportunity and come back with tails tucked between legs.
Congrats!!! I hope you make it into teaching and follow your heart. It takes a lot of courage to give up a steady stream of income.
I love this. Thanks for sharing and standing your ground. The new job sounds amazing!
[deleted]
Good for you!!!  I think this is so many people‚Äôs dream right here and I love that you were sticking to the man!!
Go bills!!!
Ngl this is the coldest work story I have heard in long time, I hope I can leave my job in the same fashion.
thanks for sharing your experience.  I love it when they swoop in with a lowball bump to try to fix the dam breech, but it doesn't take. They have to learn somehow.....
And the Bills won! What a day for you! Go Bills Mafia!
Absolute Ledgend
I appreciate you doing it day 1. You won't have me annoy you for 3 months! üòÇ
They deserved that. You can‚Äôt just put more work on people with no additional pay and expect loyalty.
Was this in New York State? KPMG?
On the way out, inform your coworkers management now has the budget to give raises.
Kudos to you champ!! Wish you the absolute best! üíØ 

One day, I‚Äôll be next lol
Wow I felt at peace from reading this post. Congratulations!!
Fuck yes
The students are lucky to have you.
Love these stories.
Work isn‚Äôt personal you guys are clueless. You just walked away from a position of power
Wow good for you!
Congratulations on your emancipation!
Congrats!
More people need to do this, until firms understand that they need to pay people before they resign, not after.  Good on you OP for doing it right.
Congrats on getting out of that situation. And thanks for the followup, it was juicy and delicious.
If you can, make your last day on Feb 1st, this way you can utilize your health insurance for the rest of the month.
Man the 15k increase tho you hsould have stayed (if someone says that they are insane considering your first post of course) good on you dude! Wish you the best moving forward!
This is an amazing post! Congrats to you! I always tell people you have to look out for number one and that's you. If you feel a sense of peace after resigning you know damn well you made a good decision. 
Enjoy the three month break. Travel a bit, reconnect with family and/or friends and just give yourself that much deserved R&R. Whenever I resigned I was always happy and had no regrets. Good on you! I hope your next career chapter is better and less stressful, whatever you end up deciding. :)
I would love to do this. I feel I would struggle to get another role somewhere else and lose a job im fine with.
My mentor always kept saying that public accounting is like a legalized prostitution.
Legend!
The only part I don‚Äôt believe is how you immediately just got a job at the university part time. I hope the rest is real.
Well done.  If it helps, I did something like this years ago and switched up careers (went from private equity to equipment sales!!!) and have been relatively happy with work life for many decades now.
You‚Äôre a goddam legend! This is what everyone should be doing in our industry! They are why we have a fucking shortage.

They try to buy you, promise you things, and later‚Ä¶.not come thru. Everyone knows it yet many fall for it or think it‚Äôll be different for them! Not you!

I hope they feel the shortage! They will regret not treating their ‚Äúfamily‚Äù better.
Public accounting in cancer. Glad to see another get out.
Oh the joy this post brings me. Good on you for staying strong.
Happy for you OP. Get some clarity, and good luck for the future!
This great. Well done. The whole ‚Äúwe‚Äôre family‚Äù notion is such garbage. They‚Äôd fire you in a second if you slipped up or stopped performing
Good for you! Now live off the fraud of the banks while you can. Go on strike against the US dollar with me which gives that firm and those assholes the strength the strangle their employees 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/196axdi/are_you_ready/?rdt=62089
Wait?‚Ä¶can you tell me why the client is disgusting? That sentence hit me so viscerally. I‚Äôd like more info if you don‚Äôt mind
 Bruh, I don‚Äôt even know you and feel proud for you. Good sht sticking to your decision and not folding. I‚Äôm sure it will work out for you in the long run.
Honestly, this is a great story. The huge salary bumps offered after resignation would have made me personally more mad about the situation and resolute in the decision. Because it would have confirmed that they are trying to pay me as little as possible. It's telling on yourself.
Family? OMG.

I did "a little teaching" and ended up doing 28 years of teaching.
Good luck on your future endeavors!
Congrats and enjoy your time off.
Great story! Thanks for the updatem Im glad you choose YOU!
I am proud of you and hope you will find a better job after break !!
Awesome, I am happy for you.
Good going, OP and glad to hear your update.  Good luck with the teaching!
A senior manager quit, they didn't replace them and instead gave their work to you. That's, what, 140K+? So they removed 140K from payroll, lost zero clients, but yes, they definitely didn't have the money to increase your pay until they got that new client.
[deleted]
Congrats my friend! You made the move that I always want to make haha.

If you dont mind me asking, how did you feel about the pay (compare to industry/other firms) with the firm before? The hourly rate is def a joke - I'm still a B4 slave myself but feel like the total comp I'm getting is honestly at or above what the industry can offer me rn. I tried to abandon the ship before the busy season but the offers I got were mostly below the current salary
When they need you and you quit: We are like a family, You can't do this.

When you need them and they laid you off: hey nothing personal, it's all business.
Woohoo!!! Congratulations! I wanna party with you.
I just can't fathom how when you are already working 60-70 hours a week that it's considered just a normal thing to sometimes add 10-20 additional hours of work. Family my ass! They need to hire more people.
Congrats!
I'll take the job lol
You‚Äôre on your way!  Hold onto your ethics and principles.  You are the rare bird that cannot be bought by the allure of a B4 Partnership.  It is not all its made out to be.  Cheering for you!!!!
You are my hero!!
They‚Äôll now blame you for their own business model.

If it makes you feel any better, literally nobody outside of those delusional partners will give a shit
YOU-THE-MAN !
Congratulations for quitting & taking care of your mental & emotional health! I would recommennd you join Never Search Alone - it‚Äôs a free volunteer service that pairs job seekers together so you make sure your next job is a good one. I joined one & wish I joined this back in the day when I got laid off & furloughed! It‚Äôs been helpful being in a community surrounded by like minded professionals. You can sign up at phyl.org. & no, this is not a scam.
Woohoo!!! I am in cpa program now! Don‚Äôt be surprised if I DM with questions :) congrats on this good luck for an amazing future!!!
The budget argument was insane, they tried to justified by saying they got a new client after the holidays. What BS!
This couldn't be more truer!
And they would have found a way to fuck him over there once he signed the NDA.
It's only a little more than 1k a month for the business. Hardly noticeable especially if they are growing.
Please stop, my work paper can only get so hard
quitterotica I believe
True "stroke me to completion" text here.
Literally, what dreams are made of!!!

Best comment ever üòÇ
üòÜü´°
For reals.
Good for you!  Best of luck to you in your future career.
This is the nicest thing, ever said to me by a Habs fan üòÖüòÖüòÖ! Leafs fan here!
Hahahahha loved this comment! I think I need to get some self help books for these partners!
balls of steel.
I‚Äôm not even an Accountant, but it‚Äôs 1:48 AM, and I have tears in my eyes from laughing at this comment. Thank you for your service!
I truly believe Partners desensitize themselves, when they reach that level. Where they do not give two shits about people under them. I have had times, where I sat late or over the weekends to review a file, which was supposed to be super urgent. And a week later it has not been reviewed.
It‚Äôs like when people say ‚Äúsorry, the system was down‚Äù no the fuck it wasn‚Äôt, or when McDonalds hits you with the ‚Äúsorry the ice cream machine isn‚Äôt working right now‚Äù. They all pathetic attempts at lying lmao.
Managers willing to set the world on fire once faced with the threat of having to work
The budget appeared out of nowhere like magic! ü•¥üôÑ
Rule of thumb! If they offer you money only when you resign, they are assoles!
Well apparently, they got a new client, and now they can justify it!
Hey man what‚Äôs up? Do most partners truly not give a fuck about improving the profession and are just trying to make as much money as they can because they know public accounting is a house of cards and will likely implode in the next few decades?
They tried to justify it saying, they got a new client and now can add additional 15K to my salary. Go figure, cos I'm stumped.
He would also get shortchanged in future pay raises and bonuses. They would slowly carve that extra raise back.
The other senior manager left, they didn't hire a replacement, and the budget surplus magically disappeared. Those partners are wizards.
THIS! This is the truth! Budget cuts are actually a lie!
In prior job boss made sure to give as little in promotions as possible his first few years to show how he can turn this department into a more cost effective group. Budget was there but he purposely undercut it to make himself look good and get a better promotion himself.
Omg!! This is actually eerie. My God these partners are cut from reality!
Apparently it was going to be given to be contractually, with conditions obviously. It's really emotional abuse!
I did for several years.
Happens in industry just as much as in public.
Sometimes there are truths behind this line. I have a strong team, unfortunately not everyone gets in during the same year.
Thanks alot! Just another cog in the trenches of public accountancy.
Sure I would have gotten a nice pay bump, but my mental health would go to hell!
This. I‚Äôve never done it, but I‚Äôve seen it happen. A former boss once told me ‚Äúyou can do that [threaten to leave, then stay for more money] one time.‚Äù She was talking about a coworker, not me, but I understand it.
lmao
Loved this comment!!
This is literally one of the nicest messages ever! Thank you so much for this! Honestly I feel people are fighting back against the establishment of partners. I hope and pray that I find my way in the days ahead.
I believe they are truly desensitized. The way they explained to me, was actually enticing for a minute. Thank God I snapped out of it.
Now that the team is short staffed, let's seem them roll up their sleeves and do the "normal" work.
They didn‚Äôt haha
They never will! The poor manager who works under me, she will now get the absolute brunt of it.
I truly hope so! I value my mental health above all! The pay would have gotten me temporary happiness, but I would have killed myself over the extra hours!
Alhamdulilah üòÑ
If they do offer it to you, get in writing! They're was another example where they promised promotion to a friend of mine and took it back citing budgetary reasons!
üòáüòá
Yikes! How come?
I think when you get to that level, being an assole is a power trip!
Great advice this! Good to know, if they some companies aren't getting back to me. Looking forward to next steps, hope it works out!
I swear to God! These blokes literally take you for granted. Underpaid and over worked! It's a sad state of affairs.
Don‚Äôt do it lol, so many better options outside of public accounting . So grateful I left
You had to be there. There was not an ounce of shame! It was anger or irritation that I wasn't falling in line or whoring out for the money. It's amazing how high these blokes think of themselves.
This literally made my day. I actually screenshotted the message. It did cross my mind, that they would be petty enough to fire me after busy season. I truly believe these partners were completely desensitized to the ones who worked under them.

The way they framed the extra work to me, was super easy. A bit of this and a bit of that. I'm glad I'm out!
I think I will, do weekly updates. I just got to my desk! And have people walking over asking where I am going next. It's quite funny!
Shoot! Let's hope for the best!
I know right! But they probably won't have the budget!
It's really not that hard especially when your dealing with assoles!
That's exactly what they are selfish bastards! That budget argument is actually insane!
I wanted to barf when they said Family!
Oh wow! Embarrassing !
I feel mentally physically emotionally spiritually healthier already! üôè
I will probably put weekly updates! 

I took a sick leave today btw! I was to hyped after the Bills won last night!
üòá
Thank you and I wish you well!
Believe me! I have people tell me I'm a fool for quitting, and not taking the money. But I have never felt so undervalued. They will only pay me to stop me for leaving, because their life will become slightly difficult.
 I have my CPA! I will be teaching CPA prep classes at my University! I always taught part time!
This. I am so confused
I don‚Äôt get this either.
I am a shit accountant! Thank you üòä!
They're actually not! They're assoles!
It's actually quite frustrating! If I as an employee am being a team player and taking on 30 percent more work, is it so insane to ask for more money!
I truly believe Partners desensitize themselves, when they reach that level. Where they do not give two shits about people under them. I have had times, where I sat late or over the weekends to review a file, which was supposed to be super urgent. And a week later it has not been reviewed.
YES! If they go all the way, this actually maybe my best busy season!
Well, I had an idea because I know people who have looked and most likely caved. So the increase is generally the same, but they add a pretty decent signing bonus. But that bonus generally has conditions!
I truly believe Partners desensitize themselves, when they reach that level. Where they do not give two shits about people under them. I have had times, where I sat late or over the weekends to review a file, which was supposed to be super urgent. And a week later it has not been reviewed.
That would literally be the worst!
I agree! It was a tough call, but it had to be done!
Thanks a bunch! It's actually quite sad how things went down. üòï
Thank you for such a wonderful message!'God Bless you!
Thank you so much for this lovely message! Hope to bounce back quickly!
I know right! Probably my best busy season day ever.
Thank youüòáüòá
üòÖüòÖüòÖ
Welcome to the Big Four!
KPMG Yes! Not NY State though.
I was gonna say "YouR'E liKe fAmilY hEre" but they actually said that themselves.
For sure !
Thanks alot! They actually made it really easy for me to stay strong!
Thanks alot üòáüòá. No money is worth anyone's mental health. And I was scared for mine!
Thanks alot üòáüòá! Absolutely üíØ! The pay rise coming in when it did, insulted me to the core.
Thanks alot üòáüòá
Thank you so much üòáüòá
God bless you üôè
Such liars. But the OP saw right thru their bullshit. Saw their mouths moving and only heard lie, lie, lie. 

It makes me so happy that someone stood up to these goons.
Well this the Partners greed! They will not accept their margins to he hurt at all, if they see a way to gain 140K in their pockets somehow. It's all about recoverability. If they make a profit on an engagement, it will enbale to get bigger bonuses. It's not about losing money, by paying me more. It's can we get two people's work out of me, and dangle a carrot of a future promotion or raise.
üòÖüòÖüòÖ
For me it wasn't really about the number, but the hours I want putting in as compared to my salary. I was working 10-12 hours 6 days a week, round the clock as most my clients had quarterly reporting. If you looked at my salary in a vacuum, you think it would be great. But against the hours I put in, totally different story!
üíØ!!!! This summarizes corporate greed! Public Accountants need to Unionize!
Lets Go!!!!
Because it's never framed as 60-70 hours. Busy Season expectation is 55 hours anyways. But it never ends. You leave your office at 7-8Pm, but your mind dosent shut off. You open your laptop, because we get so obsessed, and end up working another hour or so. I have taken sick leaves, just to work. So it dosent affect out budget.
Thanks!!!
Go for it!!
Thanks alot! B4 partnership is not worth it. I refuse to be a soul sucking narcissist!!
Hahahaha! Oh cmon! After you have been treated like crap for over 6 years, you get perspective.
Yeah, a new client they probably added to your portfolio anyway.
They are greedy self-serving liars. Don't believe them for a minute. Also, take time to relax and good luck!
They offer you 15% of the previous manager salary to cover 100% of his work, lmao.
It's honestly the most used argument. People have not made promotions because of budget cuts!
You're all accountants and they're going to try and bullshit you about budget numbers?? LOL
Always the sign of a well-run practice when you're adding new audit clients in between the holidays and the start of busy season. I am sure that first year audit will be smooth and high realization. /s
Was the client Claus & Co, LLC?
I find the budget argument the most insulting.

_"You hire us to audit companies and analyze finances. Every cycle we discuss the billables for my clients, and our salary house is transparent. What makes you think I'm clueless on our margins?"_

A coworker and I always made it a sport to see who could predict the firm's EBITDA most accurately before the financials were released. We typically nailed it to within 10%.
Let them know exactly how insulting what they did was. At the very least maybe prevent it from happening  to someone else
Omggg üòÇ
Lmfaaoaooooo
Public accounting and being a leafs fan?

You are very mentally strong to have survived all this shit ü§£
Leafs? Fate is cruel enough to you already. Take care.
Fellow leafs fan in public accounting? Your story gives me hope for myself one day.
Ouuu, Toronto guy. Very curious what firm it is now as I‚Äôm well acquainted with 3/4 firms.
The ice cream machines actually are broken, the problem is they are designed to break so the franchisee has to pay McDonald‚Äôs to come fix it.
Wait, you people get raises when giving your resignation?
No, they are running a business and trying to maximise their profit
Most partners I work with don't understand why one wouldn't want to give away their free time in exchange for more money.  It really doesn't compute in their brain.
I asked for a pay bump at an old job because my salary was 40% below market and manager gaslit me saying I am not good enough. Showed her what the metrics were and she says ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ummm there are other things‚Äù. Three days later I get a call from HR that they do random salary audits and discovered I was underpaid and offered a 1.5% pay increase, I asked HR how 1.5% helps when I am 40% below market?

Accepted a new position 3 days later and turned in my two weeks.
I‚Äôm always surprised how cheap they are. If you really weee going to ruin their lives by leaving, I would offer at least 50k.
Unless it was a shortfall that had them lay off the other person who left, where exactly did their salary go? Would have been a fun question to ask but I think we know the answer; went to a new car for someone who‚Äôs not you.
Honestly post tax that‚Äôs like a bit more than a hundred a month. Screw them they could have at least offered 40k

You would have magically 'not met one of the conditions' after they'd found your replacement. Good on you for sticking to your guns
They will just push it on a new manager until they have a mental breakdown working 80
Hours a week
Lets hope she leave too.
InshAllah your next job is better brother
Contractual notice period. It goes both ways, so e.g. you have to give 3 months' notice of resignation, but the firm would have to give you 3 months' notice to get rid of you, and would also need a justifiable reason to do so (unless you seriously breached your contact). Protects workers from short notice job loss at the expense of flexibility.
The last firm I was at before I started my own, I worked 300 hours of overtime during busy season (wasn't asked to) and they gave me and our office manager a total of $500 bonus for the season. We both resigned. Lol
Normally I would tell you to not share that information but given that you are going to teach and take some time off its not relevant.  I have known other people who have walked away and taken mental health time and truly they are better for it.  In our field there are always jobs its matter of what you want and where you want to be.  Also not everyone strives to be a director/partner and you lose that perspective working in PA.  Truly step back and regroup and do not listen to anyone who is telling you your choices are wrong.  They do not know what is best for you.
They always have budget. The margin is usually pretty high which is why partners pull in mid-high six figures with 10 charge hours a month. 

If they truly don‚Äôt have budget, they need to raise fees.
Hah and by that luck you managed to avoid the day 2 drama. First they are in denial. Then they offers you ‚Äúthe world‚Äù. Next they‚Äôll be mean to you. I‚Äôm sorry ‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm really excited to see what shenanigans they come up with next!
Well done.
Well, at that point they are just bribing you to stay long enough for them to replace you as well.   


Unless its a lump sum wired to you, its not worth the extra couple thousand - and even if it were wired.   


Time to move on and go CPA yourself.   


Best of luck!
Oh gotcha! I didn‚Äôt see the teaching part of your sentence!
They teach the class not a student in the class
Heck, I'm a leafs fan so I feel like my leafs homes are mainly bills  fans so I'd be happy for them. But who stops Baltimore unless 8 goes down?
I hate that "as long as I get mine" attitude, probably why I have no ambitions of making partner one day
I went through something similar and everyone is different. I had some dark moments which led me to regretting my decision of quitting my job, but it passes soon when you look at the big picture. If you happen to go through that, just be cool and trust your decision...my 2cents.  Cheers
Oh gosh you‚Äôve got this!!  
I was in finance for years and hated it!!  I learned sql and other analytic tools and took a slight pay cut and then started doing something I love. I am now the manager of an analytics department for a large insurance MGA. 
People are always impressed with an accounting background so I know you will have no trouble bouncing back. Enjoy your break :)
Lol I had a really bad experience working in KPMG and the people were really nasty also. That‚Äôs why I asked. So you‚Äôll teach accounting for now? Any other plans? I mean sr manager at a big 4 you can pretty much go and do so much. I‚Äôm just a senior. Good luck with everything! :)
I have to he honest, when you have been burned so many times, you see through their greed and lies. I have seen people get promoted and fired in the coming months. I have seen promises broken. So you do learn. I have worked hours, that I didn't need to, thinking the entire firm was on my back. But it wasn't. I could have gone home earlier, and it wouldn't have made a difference. But I fell for their toxic lies.
Oh no, I totally get it. I was more just thinking out loud, specifically about "oh we got a new client so now we can pay you" even though the money was there from the start.
totally understand - enjoy the hiatus & gl with the future endeavor!
Man I should have said this! But they framed it as 30 percent of his work. Which was misleading.
If I had to review the controls, processes and WCGWs, I would have lost my shit!
I want to do a post on our Whatsapp group! On how everything went down! Waiting for my last couple of days!
You have no idea! It's generational failure are this point!
As you can see why I had to quit, too many heart breaks and disappointments!
It's a sad state of affairs! I couldn't live with both.
And there‚Äôs only one contractor that can fix them.
It's so Taylor can keep getting repair fees from them. They've been heavily in bed together since the beginning and it will likely always be that way. Johnny Harris did a nice little video on it available on YouTube.
My coworker did. He got a new job by surprise and they offered so much more he had to say yes. He told my boss who told the cfo and they matched and he stayed.

Worked out for him as he didn‚Äôt want to leave but couldn‚Äôt say no to the money. 

We work in healthcare.
I was dumb and took up their offer of normal hours during busy season. They honored it, but it only lasted a year and expectations went back up to busy season hours by 2024.

Not everyone knows they have the ability to walk away.
Most partners I worked with don‚Äôt understand why one wouldn‚Äôt want to give away their free time in exchange for promises of maybe one day making more money while audit quality shat the bed, outsourcing ramped up, and salaries were less than non-college degree work
1.5% increase lmao. That would‚Äôve made me quit faster than no raise.
1.5% ohh lord those are fighting words.
It's one thing to exploit your good emloyee at a 40% discount, it's another to emotionally abuse them into thinking they deserve it - and then slap you in the face with a 1.5% increase in this era. So glad you got the fuck out. These evil scumbags deserve work dropped right in their face with no notice.
Exactly!  How is 15K going to change anyone's mind?  Especially when roughly 25% of that is going to get clawed back in federal taxes?
no no. lol this aint right. 15k bump does not only show $100 more a month in your paychecks. def like 800 - ‚Äúplus‚Äù .  assuming a tax bracket of 22% gets cut to 11,000 and change. divided by 12 months‚Ä¶ i kno theres more nuances to it, but 100 a month. nah def alot more than that. like def enough to cover your car payment and insurance.
Also, if they really wanted it to happen now it can happen now.  There's no laws preventing someone from being promoted off cycle.  The only thing it creates is invonvenience for those that need to get it pushed through.
I hope she does.
InshAllah!!@
The fees argument will never happen! These blokes are charging similar to fees, what they charged in 2016-17. Think of all the inflation that has happened since. They are cut from reality!
I think I might do regular updates until I finally quit!
üòáüòá
I'm a leafs man myself! Baltimore is tough, legit could go all the way. Happy to enjoy the Bills moment today.
Oh my gosh! Thats fantastic to hear! That does sound amazing.
I don't know where my heart lies atm! I love teaching but is it a full time gig, who knows? I plan to cast a wide net and see what's suits me best in the next 3 months.
Oh Yea for sure!

I believe they did not expect I will say no..and when I did, it caught them off guard. And they made up some BS story!
Thank you!!!!
Don‚Äôt worry. You said enough. You were perfect.
Booo don‚Äôt recommend that hack‚Äôs videos.
That‚Äôs a more accurate way to put it
HR said ‚Äúwhaaat that‚Äôs about the same salary adjust we give most of our employees, you should be proud you are getting this!!! It means you are highly valued!!!‚Äù

Then I brought up that wasn‚Äôt the point of this because I am very underpaid? How am I supposed to be proud of that? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

But I will give it to that HR person for have ammunition for every rebuttal I had.
15k is a nice dinner for a client - it‚Äôs insulting.
I think I meant to say 100 a week assuming tax rate is 50%
Fact. 

I mIgHt LoSe MuH cLiEnT
Sending good vibes your way!!!
Bingo! Well good on you, glad you stood your ground.
üòáüòá
Their job is to protect the company and do their dirty work, not help anyone. They are the masters of senseless rebuttals.
Someone should really introduce legislation against such low ball practices!
We were having our weekly management meeting this morning and we lost a bid where the competitor bid $400 per state tax return. 5 entities. Reasonably complex. That‚Äôs $800 less than we bid and probably $1100-1200 less than what it should be. $400 was lowball 10 years ago. 

In reality we really need a union. Choose not to work on low budget projects. But there are too many ‚Äúimma make partner in 8 years‚Äù people that won‚Äôt rock the boat.
Public accounts need to unionize! Thus has gone far enough! It's literal abuse! Emotional and mental abuse!
Bar tender here‚Äîjust saw a young man rejected for being an Accountant
Had second-hand embarrassment watching a nerdy young man rejected last night because he was an accountant. He was doing great until the topic of where he worked came up. 

The thing about it was, the girl didn‚Äôt just decline, she straight up made a beeline to the door and left. It was as though he said he was a serial killer or something.

Should I offer him a free drink and try to see if he‚Äôll do my taxes?
Definitely try and see if he‚Äôll do your taxes, that is the number one question  any aspiring/current accountant wants to hear!
Happens to us all the time, mate. Just offer him free pizza for a meal and he will be right as rain, works like a charm
Woah wait.... one of us went out?
That‚Äôs why I say I work in ‚ÄúFinance‚Äù.  The panties drop in record time now.
You‚Äôre telling me they have a stable job, are good with finances, and have healthy salary prospects? üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©
That accountant's name?  Albert Einstein
I promise you she had made up her mind BEfORE discovering his professional background.

I LOVE tax season. I don‚Äôt have to cook. The house remains clean.

Oh, wait. That was BEFORE we had a kid üòÇ
Accountant at a bar? Talking to a girl? This story is fake AF.
he messed up his game, why hook him up? The only time I tell girls I‚Äôm an accountant is if they are also accountants. Otherwise it‚Äôd prob just be I‚Äôm a CPA working in finance
When I first started dating, my now wife thought I was a food safety auditor (she‚Äôs in food science). So, I caught a lucky break
üòÇüòÇ last week was my last week bartending. Starting full time accounting tomorrow. Thank god I got my gf before starting work
The partner villain arc is about to start
[deleted]
There‚Äôs always scenarios where people get rejected for dumb reasons, like for example having an android. But the thing is and I hope people really realize this, is if you get rejected for a dumb reason like that, then it‚Äôs probably a good thing you didn‚Äôt date a person like that. That type of person isn‚Äôt someone you want in your life.
That's why I chose to be born a woman. Checkmate. My husband is even in marketing.
That's rude of her.
Wait but did he mention the passed the cpa exams in one sitting? That was always my go to pick up line üòé
Rookie mistake on him for not saying he was a chef that‚Äôs an expert at cooking the books.
This has to be fake.

Accounting is probably top 4 careers after Doctor, Lawyer and Engineer/CS in terms of salary and stability.
Poor guy. You should have hooked him up
Enough with the shit posts. Maybe a buzzed strumpet isn‚Äôt interested in an accountant, but most women are interested in stable men who make a lot of money. These posts are beyond straining credulity.
"Oh my God, disgusting, not only does he have a stable job, but he also makes good money?? What a loser"

In all seriousness, I feel like it was probably more to do with his personality üòÇ I've never had trouble dating due to my boring job
It‚Äôs so cringe how people judge others for their careers. It‚Äôs just a job, not their entire identity lol he dodged a bullet if you ask me.
She prefers serial killers, instability, and a dead beat future dad. Because he was an accountant, stable and potential dad of the year guy, she walked out and left.
I‚Äôll be honest here. I‚Äôm a nerd. I‚Äôm a know-it-all. I‚Äôve got a masters in accounting and finance from a big university in the UK. I compulsively share fun facts and seemingly relevant personal stories (I have ADHD). This happens even on dates and nights out. When girls ask me what I wanna do professionally, I say I want to work in finance or an accounting firm. And it has NEVER held me back. I‚Äôm always confident and passionate about my knowledge and skills. Plus most of the times, girls and people in general comment on how I‚Äôll be making lots of money in this field. So I guess I‚Äôm not worried about this, and neither should be anyone else.
Instead of offering him a drink or asking him to do your tax, you went to a washroom to post it on Reddit‚Ä¶.
Wonder what the girl did for work that made her so special
Just tell them you‚Äôre in finance. Finance is just accounting rebranded. üòÖ
I once said accounting and finance. She asked if I was a finance bro. I‚Äôm the last person to wear Patagonia vests lol
Accountants are blessed and cursed with jobs that most people do not find exciting.
Sounds like it was for the best for that young man.  Unless he just wanted to hit it and quit it.
I never had an issue with this‚Ä¶ it was probably him or the girl was crazy. Just say you work in finance if you feel that insecure.
Just get a passport, plenty of women overseas who respect a stable income. Don't indulge these clout chasers who will likely bring nothing to the relationship in the end.
Tbh he was likely better off dodging this shallow woman. He will find someone who respects his profession and as a person overall!
Fake post.
Closing Pussy Automatically = CPA
I am too stupid to be an accountant but not stupid enough to reject an accountant

Q: What does an accountant use for birth control?
A: His personality
Yep, she gonna be fat and broke in ten years, he gonna be on his second super-model wife and 911.
no you should offer him some pussy
This is why you find a hobby lads
He dodged a bullet. That woman had no idea accountants can make six digits and they‚Äôre really good with money.
I'm an engineer and accountant.

It's worked both ways for me.

In Canada engineers get a unique ring and some women have noticed it on me and used it as an opener. I've also had people who think accountants are dorky and same for engineering.

Meh.

But him a drink.
pffft her loss
All good, you dodged a bullet! üòÇ
That's ridiculous!! Once I worked with a very hot auditor ü§©  also some tax guys are very good too. I think it really depends on the person, not the career.
Didn‚Äôt ya‚Äôll hear about the social media code. Accountants are really porn stars
All of you are overthinking this

Lying about your career to get laid? Grow some balls
How do you you work as a controller? Once I say something like that the panties go dry
>It was as though he said he was a serial killer or something.

Might have had a better chance if he'd just said he was a serial killer. Women love true crime. Would be a very educational relationship, assuming she's not his next victim.
It‚Äôs ok not his first rodeo. Statistically speaking the 10th girl would probably be ok with it. And yes I pulled that stat from my ass
I don‚Äôt know why this sub was recommended to me, but I‚Äôm surprised by how many laughs I‚Äôm getting from an accounting sub. Didn‚Äôt realise accountants had a sense of humour! Going to subscribe and lurk üëÄ
Says more about her than about him. Guys should not feel bad about it but rather pitty those kind of women. There will be lots of antidepressents in her future if she is acting like that now.

How can you reject a potential partner for the fact that they have the knowledge and skills to maintain financial stability in life ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Watch that lady be a min pay wagie... Stay losing
Accounting is a break from all of my hobbies and family.  The money can be good but I hated most of my bosses.  So, I work on a contract basis now so I can say good bye to the assholes when I am done.
She did him a favor although it probably didn‚Äôt feel like that for him at the time. 
That‚Äôs kind of bizarre though I don‚Äôt see what would be so bad about dating an accountant. Maybe she is really high maintenance and concerned he would be disturbed by the amount she spends on beauty products and procedures.
He got rejected by gap due to his knowledge of GAAP. 

Call him Neo, because he just dodged that bullet.
he just said the line:

"I'm sorry I was so rude before... but... it's difficult for me... to... express myself... when I am on the verge of... exploding in my pants."

she made a beeline to the car to warm it up so they could go have the sex.
Nothing dries up a vagina quicker than CPA
Just stumbled on this subreddit, not only is that cunty of her but aren't accountants well payed and good with money?
Do you even need an accountant lol IRS can‚Äôt touch those cash tips :)
Wtf is a girl?
I feel bad for the guy. I don‚Äôt understand why accountants/CPAs are being rejected?
I had no idea this was a problem, but it‚Äôs come up a few times on the sub recently. Can someone explain why this is so bad for the dating scene? I‚Äôve been in a relationship for almost 17 years, married for almost 10, and I‚Äôm clearly just very out of the loop, lol
Is ‚Äúdo my taxes‚Äù the new ‚ÄúNetflix and chill‚Äù. I need to stop telling people I can present a mean pensions disclosure (because no-one can but everyone lies on tinder)
Makes sense. She's probably holding out for a CPA. Most women won't mess with an accountant who doesn't bother to pass the exams. Or he was beta enough to to downplay his CPA and call himself a boring "accountant" by accident. Kind of like how women would be turned off by "unlicensed drunken guy who gives drunken legal opinions on Reddit" verses a true lawyer licensed by the Bar Association.
Anybody if drinking age should figure out that all office jobs are the same BS grind. Nobody cares if you spend your time in excel or PowerPoint. 

Or maybe she is super aware of public hours and doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with a workaholic haha
Probably because she thinks he doesn‚Äôt make enough money
That girl is an idiot who probably doesn‚Äôt even know what an accountant does‚Ä¶ People often underestimate how much an accountant makes and even more don‚Äôt even know the first thing about the profession.
Well I like to give people the feeling that they are useful, thought it would help him‚Ä¶
How do you feel about the HR Block course that they offer online for like $150?
pizza is for an accountant what alcohol is for an alcoholic
I‚Äôd say 7/10 accountants I meet are just intelligent people who were pretty good at everything in school and had 0 idea what they wanted to do with their lives. They usually had other hobbies or family or friends they devote their time to and wanted a job that paid well and offered decent flexibility.

One guy I worked with was in a 2 bands and liked to tour during the summer and our company let him work from the road all summer. This other girl I worked with went back to school after having 3 kids and wanted a job she could do from home and that had good benefits. My old boss literally had a timeshare in Aruba she would be at all the time and just liked to be at the beach all day (she was sooo tan lol).

These were all really fun, personable, people that could have honestly gone into whatever they wanted but chose accounting for the stability, schedule, and paycheck.
What?? I‚Äôve legitimately never seen anybody rejected solely because they‚Äôre an accountant, it‚Äôs still seen as a good desirable career.
Then he‚Äôll do your taxes
That's a regular weekend for me
Their firm is failing because the didn‚Äôt chain him to a desk on 1/1

Imo this lasts just shortly out of college. People have  very short sighted view of what the world is like when in college and all you think about is ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your major‚Äù. 

In real life accounting is about as boring as any engineering, finance or whatever bullshit have you job requiring you to sit at a desk and stare at a screen. Make sure you have a personality outside of it and you‚Äôll do just fine

Apparently I am a dodged bullet for explaining basic manners to a 30 year old woman.

Oh man. When I was in school to be a glassblower, we had a professor come through with a prospective student while my classmate and I were working on a project. So I'm working with a literally 2000¬∞F material, trying to explain what I'm doing and why I'm doing it, and this kid looks at the professor and asks, loud enough for us all to hear, if they can move on to the sculpture room because this is boring. Like, I'm sorry, how about we watch someone practice YOUR major, I'm sure ART THERAPY is much more exciting!! She must have been super disappointed in the sculpture room because it's just a few big tables and a closet with a crockpot for melting wax. I'm not saying everyone has to love glassblowing as much as I do, but there is a polite way to excuse oneself and that was not it

It's been a few years since i left PA, but our pizza parties always included booze.
i'm an accountant and this speaks to my soul
I echo this. This is why I am accountant. I been I wanted to business and finally settled on accounting because it is one of the most well-rounded business degrees imo. 

I don‚Äôt necessarily love the work, but the problem solving is fun to me and it has allowed me to do other things with businesses outside of a traditional accounting/finance role.
>What?? I‚Äôve legitimately never seen anybody rejected solely because they‚Äôre an accountant, it‚Äôs still seen as a good desirable career.

I've been rejected by Asians because their parents didn't approve because I didn't work in STEM. Ironically, I'm about to marry an Asian who works in STEM. Accounting is the 2nd tier for many
Some people for whatever reason see accounting as a "blue-collar" office job. Not sure why honestly. When my mother found out I had switched my major from business management to accounting, she had a fit. My great aunt wrote me out of her will too, not that I really had much from it anyway since she never liked me.
Only company sponsored outings are permitted at month end!

Financial consulting.
Corporate management consulting sounds sexier than auditing which we all know is just ticking and tying. Throw in some words like mergers, quant, private equity, data science, QuickBooks, negotiation, and you'll be set
I'm a "financial forensics expert"
What if I'm in Forecasting & Budgeting?
Haha nice
I'll be married soon so I say the same thing!
Knowing your worth is one of the most positive traits of being an accountant, pun intendedü§£
Agree completely Noc! I proudly state "CPA" when introduced. It has brought in countless clients. Like you said, don't spin it. Great filter. üëç
When someone I meet for the first time tells me they "work in finance" I immediately assume bank teller or insurance account manager

I'm part of the "Deep State". No more questions about work, please.
"i make sure the government spends your tax money properly.  you work hard for it, so i make sure it does some good."
That‚Äôs weird. I think I‚Äôd spend more time trying to figure out how you‚Äôre ending up in the same social circles as these people, then changing that decision-making process. You don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúspin‚Äù a stable job with a  pension plan. You need to find less judgmental douchebags to spend time with.
>they get angry I work for the government 

What is wrong with people?

Even if I wanted your whole department disbanded, I‚Äôm not going to get pissed that you are tracking the spend. 

‚ÄúAUDIT THE FED!‚Äù

What do you do?  

I audit the federal budget.

DIE YOU DEEP STATE SCUM!

Or maybe they‚Äôre just afraid you‚Äôre going to put them on a list.
"It's classified"
I also work for the government in audit and I literally just tell people that I try to ensure that their tax dollars are being spent appropriately and try to keep companies from over charging the government which wastes tax dollars. We try to keep companies in check!
Lol I love auditing. Data analytics is fun for me!
I wish I could find a women with a more powerful job than me. Im tryna be a stay at home parent

Ryan told me to tell women I work in finance
Are you trying to say with zero experience? Because I hit 80K in tax 2 years after graduating. 100K+ before 30 too.
Almost every accountant I know makes that or more by the time they‚Äôre 30 lol.
Fp&a here: just over $100k @ 27
I got $80k in my first year in finance
88k as a first year public accountant rn. Looks like 200k by the end of the 20s if I don‚Äôt manage to get myself fired/ burn out lol.

The big finance guys are actually making close to 200k right out of school
What were the terms of the dating contract?

Half the posts on this sub are shitposts and the rest are shitposts about the shitposts.
That makes way more sense. Guys, women like an intelligent man with financial stability. Just be charming. It has nothing to do with your profession.
Accountants.
Idk about where you live but it‚Äôs still seen as taxes, and a guy with glasses sitting in the corner to the general public in the US. Even though most accountants don‚Äôt do taxes and a decent bit of them are women
Stereotype about them being weird and antisocial. And I mean, it‚Äôs not completely wrong at least in industry.
There is this stereotype that accountants are boring (because the work attacks 'boring people'), work very long hours (means less time spent on their partner), tight with their money (don't want to go out and 'enjoy life's), and don't earn much money.


When I worked in accounting I just said I was in "Finance." For whatever reason people don't have the same negative associations with this vs. Accounting.


Oddly, the accountants I knew were either party ANIMALS or the "work to live" type that did exciting things on weekends.
Very good question.
Now that‚Äôs what im talking about. Good thinking.

"They've sent me on an urgent mission to find the deeper state."
Damn this is the best answer. Thank you so much!
When I worked in government, my goal was to make sure that the big companies in our county paid their fair share, and that we didn't put undue financial burden/red tape on small businesses. So I usually put it that way to people. 

My boss and I were pretty adamant about it. Unfortunately, most of the rest of our department wasn't.  She eventually took a better offer in a different county, and I jumped ship to a different field altogether.

I'll be fitting the stereotype as a guy with glasses once I actually snag my first accounting role when I graduate. Ironically, I want to work in tax. I'm already married, though. The military uniform when I served is what snagged my wife. I still had a *nerd* role in the military though, too.
In the audit business they don't do taxes no, they are terrible at it anyway. But on the other side we do a lot of taxes (at least here in NL). Or at least have the assistants do it for us
[The Accountant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Accountant_(2016_film))
This exactly is why I made the jump to accounting. I have had an exciting enough life that I want work to be tame and predictable. I can go raise my blood pressure in my personal time.

In the context of string theory, a U(N) Chern‚ÄìSimons theory on an oriented Lagrangian 3-submanifold M of a 6-manifold X arises as the string field theory of open strings ending on a D-brane wrapping X in the A-model topological string theory on X. The B-model topological open string field theory on the spacefilling worldvolume of a stack of D5-branes is a 6-dimensional variant of Chern‚ÄìSimons theory known as holomorphic Chern‚ÄìSimons theory.

Lessons learned one year after going live
Launched my algo live exactly one year ago. In addition to a personal milestone, watching it run live has been a completely different experience than watching test results. Some valuable lessons are learned only from observing live behaviors.

My algo is 100% automated. It trades a group of major forex pairs. Long, short trades are symmetrical. 

The most important lesson is that live trading gave me clues on what to improve. Live trading slows everything down compared to testing. I was forced to observe the process instead of focusing on the results during testing. The wild swing of EURJPY in June caused a large drawdown. When I saw how it happened, it led me to an improvement idea. Another EURJPY swing happened in December again. My algo not only survived, but also profited from it this time.

I run my algo on different broker platforms. The results are tangibly different. I believe it has to do with spreads and fees and interest rates. It was hard to tell from testing.

Although the overall results conformed to the tested and expected behaviors, it is still eye opening to see how the market behaves thanks to live trading slows everything down. Something expected to be rare is actually not so rare. It was amazing to see how the market can go from dead quiet to neck-breaking speed without warning. 

In conclusion, without risking too much, it is worthwhile to run your algo live regardless profitable or not. It gives you improvement ideas, confidence and experience that you can't get otherwise.
Obviously don‚Äôt need to share the strategy but what helped you gain the confidence that your system is robust enough to go live?
I've been trading for many years discretionary, but have been live as an algo trader for a similar time to you.

It's hard reading the sub when pure algo traders keep banding about geometric brownian motion. I'd advise people to trade discretionary for at least a year, it will give you so many ideas for building out your own edges.

Once you have edges, you can start quantifying them with code and building on this using established risk management and trading techniques.
Thanks for sharing your thoughts after going live. 
Did you have to adjust any settings after you went live?
There is always a difference between simulation and live trading. This is why best practice is considered to incubate for at least 6 months and when live, monitor performance for 3 months to ensure your strategy is still within backtested statistics.
Would you share what your algos overall concept is?
is it pure algorithming without ML ?
Thanks for sharing -- never ended up profitable when working on trading algorithms ~2 years ago, but your experience was the same as mine:

1. Get an actual algo up and running trading small amounts of real money as soon as possible. I "paid attention" to measures like sharpe ratio and max drawdown, but never took them seriously until running with live money. The game is entirely different once one or two trades are taking away a month of good trades.
2. Analyze the actual trades the algo made and see if there's room for optimization, e.g. "can you write a rule that would have stopped 2 losing trades at the cost of losing 1 profitable trade. Is it reasonable to expect this rule to work in the future?"

Definitely left with a practical trial/error and "better not perfect" philosophy rather than "find the right complex algorithm" philosophy.
Could you share resources/books you found the most useful on your journey to building your system?
Can you talk about your setup? (Language, ide, etc)
Can you share from where you are getting the data stream ?

Is it real time or end of the day feed ?

Thanks for sharing your live experience. Is it really helpful.
Thanks for sharing 
What is the broker you use?
Appreciate you sharing your takeaways. Curious about your overall system, not just your actually reading algorithm. How do you manage portfolio risk or determine order sizing? How do you determine the exit? Is it modular and multithreaded or pretty simple and you just have a set size you generally trade when your algo spits out the signal.

Thanks!
Congrats! Do you mind sharing the delta between your model‚Äôs expected gain and the actual gain? And what caused the delta?
What was your total turnover in USD for the year?
Thanks for sharing your thoughts ! Can you talk about how did you choose the amount / percentage of wealth to alocate to your trading algo for this first year ?
How long did it take to build and lab before you went live?
What was your final return in one year?
I too man , My algo was doing well i got payouts from prop firm but suddenly the end of October losing streaks started caused by GJ and EurGbp , i discovered there was an error on a particular exit and filter code and also discovered flaws on GJ entry parameters and EurGbp filter sets , i made all the modifications and adds necessary from studying the losing streak , now my algo will never have problems going foward , 2024 and beyond will be super interesting üî•ü•π, cant wait for January
What are the costs for running your algo?
Thanks for sharing ur experience.. which data u backtest with??
How did you get the real time data?
What would a very basic algo look like for a beginner just to play around? Did you use some moving average logic or something more complex?
The benefices you describe seems to be those of forward testing, wich can be achieved thrue demo account, or maybe I missed something ?
Great job and thanks for sharing.  Did you figure all the tech aspects out yourself or did you have help?
Will you share it out / publicise it anywhere?
With everything you've learned, do you wish you did anything differently from the start?
It's great to here that you are making a good return from pure algo. Gives me hope as a complete beginner. I just have a few questions if you don't mind:

1. Can you tell me what are the factors one would see the difference in the back tests and the actual forward tests?

2. You mentioned that there is a slight difference in the results of different brokers. If I want to backtest a strategy, will I have to get the data of each broker to backtest or a single data source will do? 

3. Since I also plan on coding strategies in Python like you did, is it reasonable to do intraday strategies using Python or should we stick to swing? What is the lowest timeframe we can go to for trading using python according to your experience?
thank you, this is very good to know. How do you feel the fully automated algo though ? I still have another full time job, thus now I am more considering interlay trading ( manual ). If it's fully automated, then i can go for intraday signals, but I heard it's very difficult if you have fully automated strategy ( hard to control )
[deleted]
Did you do any sandbox testing against live data? Meaning let your algo see the live data, but only track trades internally to validate strategy?
Well said, no matter how perfect your tests go, the real scenario problems are like the grinders that polish your idea/product.   
Better to experience than sit and think down with your hypothesis.
My Algo is still at the point where I have to interfere with the Prime Directive and manually adjust it every now and then. I thought once the strategy itself was functional that everything would be easy (Boy was I wrong). What tips do you have for getting over that hurdle where you can confidently run a strategy for days on end?
Thanks for sharing. How much principal did you put into the algo for it to return 60%?
What backtest platform did you use?
Nice job, thanks for the insights
Any particular time frames your targeting 10 min, 60 min daily?
Questions from someone who has a curious itch to satisfy, what is your trading platform ? coding language etc ? I want to learn how to program an algo trader and maybe even take it live, who knows.
Thank you for your insight but roughly how long would you recommend training and testing an algo, and should I split my back test data 50/50?
This is goals, really can‚Äôt wait for my strategy one day to be 100% automated.
Back and forward testing. I used ohlc data from 2006 to 2022.
I did. But only after seeing the improvement opportunity and more testing. Since the improvement was big enough, I decided to change the settings.
There are only two types of algo in general: mean reversing or trend following. Mine is mean reversing with some special sauce in position entry, exiting and sizing.
Not ml in the standard constructs. But I do employ the concepts of parameterizing, training, optimization and validation.
After some early failures, I recognized the approach is more important than techniques, and learned not to dismiss any idea too fast. I  read anything I could find, books, papers, blogs, articles, on many subjects, markets, trading, finance, economics, math, statistics , ai, games, psychology, group behaviors, programming and across a wide period from the most recent back to books written in the 50s and 60s. I really can't pinpoint a few sources. Every bit helped.
During the Christmas holiday timeframe Udemy was running significant discounts on a lot of their ML/algo trading classes. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôve invested most of my time for now.
Just vanilla python on windows or Ubuntu server.
I got my historical data from oanda. It is freely available, but you need to clean it a little. My algo uses 1hr bar data.
So far 8cap is the best for me.
It is pretty simple. The trade size depends on the confidence of winning. Trade more when the odds are more in your favor. Existing is the seriously secret sauce.
I forward tested seven years. The returns ranged from 30% to 80%. This year is about 60%. It is within the expected range.
It triggered about 400 around-trip trades during the year. The return is about 60%.
The amount is something I can afford to lose while significant enough to keep me engaged. 

The first year risk is not only not knowing how my algo would perform in real life. The historical data I used is most likely not accurate. The broker may not be reliable. The infrastructure and my code need to be tested. There may be risks that I don't know yet.

I'd ramp up gradually from here. At least the winning can offset possible future losses.
About 2 years.
About 60%
Cloud servers are cheap these days. It costs less than $10 a month.
1 hour OHLC
This is the tricky part. No matter what I say, somebody will disagree. I am in no position to declare what works, what doesn't, what it is, what it isn't. An algo can be anything. (Somewhat like a horcrux in Harry Potter) 

You can certainly play with ma, indicators to begin with. It tends to be an individualistic adventure. There's no set path which is both fun and frustrating at times.
Of course you can do it with a demo account. But I have occasionally seen differences between demo and live accounts. I didn't spend time investigating. Can't quantify it.
Yes, I put everything together myself. There's a lot of back and forth between the algo and the tech. I can't see myself doing it otherwise.
It has been a personal journey. There has been no map or manual. One step led to another. None of the discoveries is wasted.  In hindsight, I could have skipped the many, many failed algos. But I am not sure if I could be where I am without the previous failures and lessons. My journey is far from finished. I will continue to explore and experiment. There really isn't anything to regret.
Forward testing can be and should be done with historical data. The more testing the better. It should be indicative of live results.

Regarding data source, it depends on the assets you trade. For a decentralized market like forex, it's better to use data from the broker. For centralized markets like stocks, it shouldn't matter. But you should verify for yourself.

Unless you intend your edge to be speed, python is plenty fast. You are most likely limited by the API latency or network latency.
It's quite easy as long as you do some basic error handling like retry or ignore. API or webhook are subject to failures from time to time.
The forex market is said to be huge. I am still trading relatively tiny and haven't felt any constraint. There should not be constraint in theory even as I ramp up. It is remain to be seen.

Your second question is actually interesting. It turned out different markets can behave quite differently. For example, the future market is a lot more volatile than forex, like at least a few times more volatile. Among the commodities, some are less volatile such as gold. But it is still more volatile than forex. Therefore, my algo doesn't work well with futures. By extension, it won't work well with cryto. In the case of stock index, my algo couldn't beat buy-n-hold. I don't see one size fits all.
The closest thing to a sandbox is a demo account which I did briefly just to test out the code. Further tweakings were all done on live accounts. Since my input is only hourly price data, I have plenty of time to update my code in between trades.
I coded my own. 100%. It's simple logic to me. If you created your own strategy, why wouldn't you create your own tests?
I trained my model with 10 years of data and forward tested for 7 years. I stopped only because I ran out of data. This much of testing likely invalidates most algos as it happened to me. But I think having a bruised ego is better than losing real money.
>metatrader5

tks, ohlc data of forex? isn't forex 24x5?
Only ohlc data? And then you build the different features such as SMA or VWAP from that data right?... I'm building an algo using time and sales data and neural networks. Any help with sourcing that data? I'm talking every single order that went through on a given day from beginning of pre-market to end of after-hours.
>bserve the pro

which broker do you use? Does it have API? If no, how do you put order (via metatrader?)?
Can you talk about data cleaning?
Your model inputs are just 1hr OHLCV or do you also use items like bid/ask etc?
Have to say I love "Existing is the seriously secret sauce."
Existing? Or exiting?
Awesome thanks for the response!
Thank you for sharing!
Noice
>oanda

insane, nice
How much effort? Were you full time on this?
What was your max drawdown in that same period?
Nice work!
Broker's data or an external data
To echo and add. Demo accounts don‚Äôt have latency. Your broker on demo accounts fills 100% of your orders, demo accounts manage giant swings (like the fed announcements) with no problems. I‚Äôm live testing as well and adding logic to handle all that stuff
Did you scale up the algo to match the volatility of futures, or stocks? In particular, trade more frequently?
Is it feasible to trade off of minute data in your set-up?
Thanks!
Well... the question kind of answers itself. Confirmation bias.
Thanks for your reply, ~~just to confirm you tested your bot live for 7 years?~~
Try checking NASDAQ data link they have a lot of stuff. Can be pricey tho
There is one broker where I use their API. The other ones all use metatrader5. They are very similar in practice.
Things like extra data after the market is closed, missing data if the price didn't change. Check against data from another source.
I don't need bid/ask for signal.
Exiting
Yes, full time.
It was about 15%. But my algo would allow up to 25% before intervening. It's a balance between drawdown and profitability.
Broker s
Ah that's interesting to me !

How much lag do you see at your broker ? And what broker is this ?

I'm working on demo and think I'll go live on january first, to work with announcement, so both your situations means to me :)
>metatrader5

oh, then I guess you running it on window os without docker? I try to config running metatrader on linux and connect to it using mt5linux, it worked but not stable (easy to getting freeze after running long enough). If you run in docker with linux, can I have your docker image or dockerfile build for reference?
i recently got trades data which has a lot of gaps, can you suggest the best way to do the clean up ?
Thank you!
I wish I could run mt5 on Linux. Didn't work for me either. Using windows server now.
Sometimes the gaps are there because the ohlc data didn't change during the gaps.

Send him to join Sam and Diddy
it's call scamming and/or grifting
how is this guy arguing that he doesn't have to refund people but still suing Coffeezilla for saying that he isn't going to refund people?


I know I know, it's lawfare to shut down public criticism, but it makes me absolutely sick.
You can't spell "piece of shit" without spelling "Logan Paul".
Weird, scumbag from 10 years ago, turns out to be a scumbag today.
Who would have thought?
Hasn't he been doing this for years ?
no prison for a known scammer ? nice world
When we see the next 200x gains early investor article, remember Logan Paul and his "puffed" promises.

edit: Headline sourse:
 https://www.dailydot.com/debug/cryptozoo-logan-paul-gamble/
The fact idiots like this are rich and famous is a sign of a collapsing society. We are truly living in Idiocracy.
First time he‚Äôs said the truth.
I have zero sympathy for anyone who 'invested' in any of this.
Lost all respect for ksi since he teamed up with this clown.
"Investing in me=gambling and I told you you lost when I took your money" Logan Paul
It was his project and he just abandoned it lmaooooooo üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Lol. Wasn‚Äôt he going to A. Finish the project B. Make amazing artwork‚Ä¶ after was gonna refund‚Ä¶ more after was gonna refund a little‚Ä¶ a little longer; no it‚Äôs your own fault. 

This dude has no soul, he just waits until the lawyer says it safes and returns to default scumbag from fake concerned guy. While on the side both brothers doing rug pulls every month lol
I want to fight logan paul! Please, people, help me make this happen! I will do anything! 

I am 6 foot, 380, 32. I will train, quit smoking, go on a diet. 

Or 

Uno Reverse card

Fuck that, I'll fight him now, out of shape, fat and angry. 

Just pure rage and the blessings of the most high on these fists to deliver justice to the wicked one and smite him back down to the pit of eternal damnation! 

Help me, reddit! You're my only hope!
Where is the SEC?

It‚Äôs mind-boggling that the SEC is busy going after legitimate projects while actual scamming sacks of shit, Logan Paul, get away scot-free. The double standard is obvious, and it's infuriating to see the ones trying to innovate being targeted instead of those blatantly scamming people. 

The focus should be on protecting investors from real threats, not just going after high-profile names for headlines.
The Paul‚Äôs are douche bags. Anyone who jumps on their crap deserves to lose.
Legend has it that black eye is a tattoo so he can keep it for longer and look tough
inb4: CryptoZoo bagholders "Logan Paul gambled on his lawsuit and lost"
Why is this guy even in crypto posts arround here?
I also heard rumors he (and a group of other "influencers") were behind the whole Shiba Inu pump and dump scam, and that he apparently put in million into Shiba just shortly after its creation and then dumped it all during the big pump.
Great way to piss people off enough for them to consider get gotting your ass.
I mean technically everything is a gamble. You gamble with your life every-time you get out of bed in the morning.
Any idiot taking financial advice from an online idiot that actually looks like an idiot thinking it's not a scam is an idiot
If there is anybody out there that needs karma to hurry up and bite him in the ass it's this fucking douche canoe.
In reality they did a classic 'Pump and Dump':

* fork a new cryptocurrency
* promote and hype it as unique (helps with millions of followers)
* when they all invest and the price of the coin skyrockets, LP sells as shares for maximum profit
* this causes price to tumble, others sell in panic bringing price down even more
* all the sucker investors left holding the bag (many lost tens of thousands)
* Logan Paul, already a multi-millionaire, gets a few extra million that he would probably piss away anyway
I‚Äôm really starting to think this Logan Paul guy isn‚Äôt a good dude.
Its true. Im not sad people who bet there house on a youtubers crypto coin lost there money.
His morals are decided by what his lawyers have figured he can get away with. He believes he's a good man I guarantee it.
I mean, one of the guys running for president is doing exactly this, and will do exactly this to all the maga boomers holding the bag on his turd coin when he cashes out
Coffeezilla team
Absolute scum of the earth. Both brothers. And the media companies that keep promoting them.

And dumb fux that keep following them.
Scammer promised all sorts of sheet that he didn't deliver. Then turns around to blame victims who believed him. ü§∑
Put your fiat into decentralized crypto like BTC, Cardano and few other. Not in this NFT and other nonsense, that is pumped and dumped by shitheads.
Yes he is a scumbag but anyone who ‚Äòinvested‚Äô is an idiot I‚Äôm not saying what he did was right but you can‚Äôt walk into Diddys house and be surprised when the baby oil gets pulled out.
In all seriousness thats literally what happened. Hes still a scumbag for promoting it. But its no different than any other shitcoin. This one just had a "celebrity's" face attached to it. - so there was someone to put blame on, as opposed to "I gambled on a shitter and lost, no one to blame so that $ is gone"
Well they did. Kinds. They trusted the pos knowing dsmn well who he is.
Now if only he'll gamble and lose at Russian roulette
Scammer
He is right though. Are we going to pretend a shitcoin pushed by a Paul brother is immune to a rug pull? If you bought into it the blame lies solely on you
He is right lol
I mean, he‚Äôs not wrong üòÇ
To be fair, it was a gamble and he‚Äôs not wrong. Guy is a clown but I don‚Äôt feel bad for anyone that lost money going in on anything this guy peddles
Which nft project wasn‚Äôt a loss, amirite?
He's not wrong. They gambled that he wouldn't screw them over and they lost. That is what happens when you gamble odds as terrible as those. Expecting those odds to come through is like expecting to win the lottery 33,000 times in a row.
Seriously, there's not many people in the world that deserve all the hate they get. But he does. 

He'll get what's coming to him, Karma is a bitch, just ask P. Diddy!
I agree. If you‚Äôre willing to invest in something so stupid, you shouldn‚Äôt be surprised at the repercussions.
Don‚Äôt feel a bit sorry for anyone who bought into his shit the dude is a lowlife scum
Undeniably accurate statement.
Anyway, let's all go buy his energy drinks and school lunches
Let‚Äôs be honest, people who invested would have lost their money somewhere else if it wasn‚Äôt him. If your intelligence is so low you believe in a clown like this , you deserve to lose your money !
Is he lying?
Took a while but he's finally telling the truth.
Guy looks like tpt!
This guy is a huge cock but its difficult to argue that a large majority of people would do this same thing in his position.  Unbelievable how stupid the "investors" were to this.
Lmao, this is what happens guys. Stay away from these fake coins. No one will make you rich
*How to get in jail FASTER* by Logan Paul
Dude looks like a honey badger. They should throw him into the same cell that SBF & Diddy are now sharing and they can be one big happy family
Scammer! More fool anyone who takes influencer advice on investing
I mean didn‚Äôt they gamble and lose? I ain‚Äôt defending this piece of shit, but how can we frame this any other way?
Major loser
Scorching hot take - if you Invested in this YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE and deserve to get rugged. If it wasn‚Äôt Logan it would have been Jason derulo or some other brain dead celebrity hawking a ‚Äúonce in a lifetime‚Äù opportunity
The SEC should go after this shit stain.
Mfer
I never understood rich people like him holding on to drama ? Does he enjoy the toxicity ? Like is the couple million dollar really worth that much to him? He makes that much in one organized fight ... 

He's going to get stopped and questioned about this for probably 10 to 15 years and it's going to tarnish his reputation... I mean he obviously doesn't have any but he actually has been growing positively in the view of the public and these things are the things that bring him back down. 

I have no idea why rich millionaires don't just pay a couple millions for these problems to go away... Even financially it makes sense to pay just so that he can gain better reputation in the next product he's going to sell (like lunchly)
pretty sweet hair system he‚Äôs got there
I‚Äôm sure he didn‚Äôt lose though
Still people buys his Drinks!!!
Man I have never seent this man do anything redeeming. But people pay him and praise him for it. Narcissist and a test‚Ä¶..but he ain‚Äôt dumb haha
Big if true
He lied. And he also revealed that he behaves exactly like rich people. They don't give a shit, they just want your money. And they'll cheat to have it. Most of them do. What else could you call lobbying the government to benefit your business and hurt others so they can't start up and compete?
I wonder how this POS can sleep at night, I bet with one eye closed and the other open.

Never liked his way of being in no way he should be a role model
Internet culture and celebrity fuckings sucks.
Logan Paul can suck a fat one
And suckers will still support his next endeavours making this fuckstick richer and them poorer.
So once again a shitbag proves that he has no remorse and will avoid accountability by any means necessary, shocking... Hope he gets sued into oblivion (cant remember he is he the Paul that is a "boxer" but if it is i hope he gets beaten to a pulp)
he is not wrong though, sure he mislead them, but so did 90 percent of the nft and crypto community as a whole.
I make a legit cross-chain MMO game with a player and creator economy first. 
These douches are the reason we are leaning into tradfi and account abstraction, and making the crypto part the plumbing.
Why would you even put money into this guy.
Translation : thanks for the liquidity
You‚Äôre seriously stupid if you bought anything Logan Paul endorsed lol
This shit man need the Jail !
the only loser is Logan and I can't wait for him to leave PR with his bro! :)
He is an a hole. But also he is still right. And Logan Paul fans really just jumped in their own knife.
Not a fan, don‚Äôt follow him or anything but they kid knows how to make money. Is stupid drink, wrestling, podcasts, YouTube etc‚Ä¶.
Cofffeezilla video incoming
He has nightmares about coffee Zilla wow that guy ruined him lol
People did lose their money; it was a pump and dump. Those Paul boy influencers are nothing but greedy douchebags! Neither one of them are boxers; they‚Äôre Fucking wannabes!
This is why he‚Äôs a Trump supporter. He‚Äôs hoping for a pardon if Trump wins.
Well he's not wrong
Why the hell would touch a project he is involved in. The only thing more stupid would be something Trump is involved with
Scammer clown POS
I mean, it‚Äôs Logan Paul, of course it was a scam. People get what they get when dealing with these cunts
Anyone buys anything related to either of the Paul brothers is fukin moron.
Imagine buying an NFT from Logan Paul and being surprised when its bullshit
Morons grifting morons. Love it!
Maybe so like lots of people did with other nfts but he straight up sold a product that wasnt anything like how it was advertised with features never even released
Don't hate him, hate the morons that made him rich.
Factually correct, deal with it.
He's dog shit. 

And he's right.

Grifter found his marks.
Boo this man
Crazy that he isn't in jail
like if they ever have a chance...
Kinda true ngl
Crypto and scamming are like peanut butter and jelly
Anyone care to share how crypto is not purely about one group scamming another?
He‚Äôs not wrong, he‚Äôs just an asshole.
How did this piece of shit ever get famous...

And how can this just go by and no judgement is being done
Still don‚Äôt get how this dude has a following
If a product fails alright but he never completed the product. How has no investor snapped and met him face to face?
My kid knows this dude is straight scum and so is the majority of these dimfluencers , say that as only children and the dim witted still financially support them.. we all need to educate our kids on the predator scum most of them are and when they have no following all that money dries up and we no longer have anyonw willing to post these articles because we all ignore them
Omg I care so much
‚ÄúSamn that sucks yo i swore this total fking pyramid scam would some how work out for eveyone‚Äù
Lawyers ears perking up at the word "gambling"
No article? just a picture?
How come he doesn‚Äôt get charged for market manipulation like Kim kardashian did?
If Gary Gensler wanted to instantly improve his reputation here 10x, he'd go after this guy publicly. Unfortunately I think Logan is so big at this point, he probably has backers in the republican party.
He is not a founder, He is a scammer.
I hope Mike stomps on his testicles
Fuck that guy
!balance
"look, you guys, me not having the money is not an option okay."
He kind of looks like Bradley Cooper in that pic.
And he is right.. crypto is gambling and a pyramid scheme all at one.. cant wait untill there will be a sales run (people who need the cash, cash they can actually use to pay their bills).. and the price goes down and down untill people cant even sell their air castle anymore and realize a very few became multi billionaires over their back! üòÉ
Is anything he does mot a scam ?
They thought marketing NFTs is same as Prime?
Seeing him and mister Beast in videos together puts them both in perspective.
Rug puller mindset
Logan Paul is one of the many evidence that mankind is doomed, dude still be this popular/wealthy/successful after what he did in Japan.
I dont know how anyone would support these assholes in any way. I just don't get it.
Gambled that he was actually going to make a working game?
Would love to see this scumbag behind bars.
Gambled that Logan Paul's word was worth a bubble of spit and lost, to be specific. The manufacturers of Prime made the same bad bet, but luckily for them they had the good sense to get a contract in writing.
Here he is, the biggest douche in the universe
Plonker
The Paul's epitomises everything wrong with culture today. Famous for nothing do not utilise it in any way to benefit anyone. 

In all honesty the historic crimes of millionaires they did x,yz at least philanthropy wad a real thing they built schools Parks etc etc. These fuckers only take 

One way down
I don't have much sympathy for the victims because they probably called the people who warned them about this project idiots. I hope they have learned their lesson
Crypto...the ultimate scheme.  It duped the entire world.
lol it always makes me angry seeing that people like this get rich and famous for doing literally nothing but filming themselves üôÉ like before it was just the kardashians who were rich and famous for not having a talent now it‚Äôs pretty much anyone on YouTube
Eh. The plan wasn't elaborate. Always is like that
The house always wins.  Right, Logan?  Even when the house is a condemned POS.
This little twerp will get his day‚Ä¶ just watch.
\*gasp\* he said the quiet part out loud
Pure scumbag
I really wish someone would kick him in the testicular region üòï
Cant wait for the coffee video.
Bagholders believed Logan's promises and lost.
Imagine being the dumb f3ok who invested in this POS crypto.
Taking zero responsibility. What's new.
Should be in jail for animal cruelty after he almost killed his dog on that boat.
As much as I don‚Äôt like him, at the end of the day it still is investors fault. Why would anyone mentally sane invest in anything Logan Paul is part of? It wasn‚Äôt an investment it was a gamble and they got burned as expected. Thats what you get for being greedy and supporting that clown.
Some serious low quality right here
how is this piece of shit still relevant, after everything his done
tbf.. both things can be true.   Logan Paul can be a piece of shit and people gambled.

If any of this was certain, everyone would be in the black.
The guy is worth hundreds of millions and won‚Äôt pay back the people he scammed. Unbelievable.
Nothing to see here, just another crypto scammer.
There was a guy who scammed mafia peeps with crypto, and got put in luggage. You saying, logan scammed what, 10k people+, and none are evil people?
He‚Äôs right. Even if it makes people upset, it‚Äôs the hard truth.

Over 90% of traders loose money.
One of these days he‚Äôll get what he deserves.
I hope Mike Tyson destroys him
Would rather spend money on lawyers to sue Coffeezilla for unfounded defamation just to hurt (and scare) Coffeezilla‚Ä¶instead of work to make those investors whole. Truly shows his true character and yet he still has millions of subscribers and followers (mostly 14 yr olds but are they going to get a rude awakening when they turn 18 and realize Logan Paul is a complete conman).
Aren‚Äôt all nft‚Äôs scams?
I mean... Any nft project is a gamble right!?
To be fair, he‚Äôs not to blame, NFT‚Äôs are. All NFT‚Äôs are trash now. And a lot of people bought the idea, him included.
Anyone who bought that garbage deserves to be rugged.
Yagami brother please write this cunt‚Äôs name in your book.

Truly the world will be a better place without this piece of shit.
The biggest piece of shit in the world.
Who should be jail
Still don't know how him and KSI still a popular celeb. Dude has been shitty from the very first day
Logan Scumbag
Shit stain on society.
Why does anyone even care what he says and does in the first place?!?
this is the era of PoS, and I don't mean proof of stake
Why do you feel the need to disrespect shit like that? Don't compare it to Logan Paul
He cashed out and made money
I thought he was a piece shit before. Now I think he's the fucking whole pile.
He ain't wrong it's laughably accurate. Doesn't make him any less of a shit and deserving of fraud charges
And Floyd Mayweather as well!
Cant help it i love him.. he just takes the opportunities stupid people give him.. young people just giving him their money..
Biggest bag of scum.
And his asshole brother as well. They can fornicate themselves with a cactus.
Let's not forget WWE still has him hired! They're keeping him off TV for a bit thinking his heat will cool off him Hana
You could live in the sewers and wouldn't meet anything as shitty as him
White Ferrari
and rich.
A greedy man and a clever lawyer. Name a worse project team to invest in.
‚ÄúGive it a week, give it a month, i dunno, youll forget all about this and we‚Äôll be even stevens.‚Äù
A part of me does think that it‚Äôs kind of your fault if you buy/invest into anything Logan Paul related. 

Even his energy drinks are pure poison. 

I‚Äôm somewhat Libertarian when it comes to this. Anyone should be allowed to invest in whatever they want. It‚Äôs their responsibility to do their due diligence. Don‚Äôt invest in Logan Paul and then come crying that you got screwed.
The sad thing is that ‚Äúmaking this right‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt even cost him that much of his net worth. Just pure greed. I hope this dude crashes hard.
Can't wait for a CoffeeZilla video saying "told you so" (you were never going to fix this like you "promised") (to Logan)
Him and Trump ü§£üòÇ
It is your fault, why do people believe in these low lives in the first place‚Ä¶ just look at his ficking face mate, it‚Äôs basically written
bagholder?
Name a better Scammer Trio.
Very deserving trio.
In other words a fraud. 

SEC should look now...
And works very well when your audience is very young
How much did he make from this?
[deleted]
Brb, calling my English teacher
Or "Con artist"
Jake Paul. There. Boom. Proved you wrong.
He‚Äôs right. I spelled it: ‚Äúpiece of Logan Paul shit‚Äù. It‚Äôs in there.
An even bigger scumbag now.
Always comes up with something new to scam people lol
Straight of lies were those promises. 

He always knew it would be a scam.
I mean... yes, while it was a gamble to bet on a upcoming project, Logan made some promises that he never intended to fulfil. That's called fraud.
I bet he doesn‚Äôt like it and wouldn‚Äôt do it again
I get your point, but this man's audience was teenagers and people who had absolutely no experience. If you were a whole adult and lost money on this, sure you play stupid games you win stupid prizes. But part of the moral outrage surrounding this lowlife is how he preys on people who can't be expected to know better.
absolutely. 

first of all, this guy looks like he'd sell you a baggie of coke and call the cops on you for possession. plot twist the coke was mixed with meth because he's a dickhead.
why would anyone invest in anything he does is beyond me.

second of all, the moment these "personalities" start shilling whatever they're shilling, I lose trust in the product.
I have zero sympathy for such arrogant, moneythursty people like him.
I mostly agree but he did misrepresent the project. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs illegal but I do know it‚Äôs unethical. At least, give the Lemmings an even playing field.
I have to feel a little bad because his following is mostly kids right? Or very young adults. I‚Äôm 44 and barely know who he is
Same here. Most people were saying this is a stupidest idea ever created to scam people out of their money but instead of listening to them, they would brag about how much smarter they were.
Like I hate this dude, but I don‚Äôt really understand how you can blame someone for creating a digital sticker. Then when people buy it for a crazy price and the price tanks then blaming the creator. He can‚Äôt stop them from buying it. He could plead with them not to buy it and they probably still would have. 

If there was fraud then that‚Äôs different. But if he just created something and was like ‚Äúlook what I made‚Äù and people bought it. No matter how much I dislike this guy. I can‚Äôt blame him for that. 

It would be like if Picasso painted a bunch of paintings and they sold for millions and then they tanked and everyone blamed Picasso. Just doesn‚Äôt make sense.
agreed
I don't understand this mentality. People aren't stupid and fall for scams on purpose. Having sympathy for others doesn't cost a thing.
Ive been noticing him in alot of mr beast videos to, its weird cause who in their right mind wants to be associated with that ~~piece of shit~~ fucker logan
he grabbed the money and walked out, just like any other robbery.
They focus on the bigger projects in the first place.
Coffee is working on that.
I'll never forget the article I wread from Spain. 

Logan was at a bar with a punch score machine. Lining up ready to punch the ball bag. The bartender told him to becarful with it. Dudes miss and punch the metal part instead often. 

Logan replied. 

" üòÜ I'm a professional boxer  I think I know what im doing bro" 

Then logan took a run up and punched the üí© out of the metal bar broke his hand. üòÜ ü§£ üòÇ
Still no idea what they were all about, that's why everyone thinks they were just money laundering
Irrelevant. This cunt didn‚Äôt deliver on what he was selling, took the money and walked away, then blamed the people who were stupid enough to get involved. The word con artist was created for this piece of shit.
Have ever heard the saying ‚Äúany publicity is good publicity‚Äù?

He for sure doesn‚Äôt care either way as long as he‚Äôs making a buck. Also, I don‚Äôt understand why people even let influencers be an actual thing. Such a dumb industry that the population has chosen to let thrive.
This. Plus the ‚Äòproject‚Äô looked like garbage from the beginning. It‚Äôs really no surprise it failed so miserably.
Yeah Justin Bieber and a ton of other celebrities did too lol you‚Äôd be suprised how many ‚Äúcelebrities‚Äù spent half a mill on a NFT that‚Äôs worth $100 now
The stinkiest piece of shit in the solar system
Whatever he does everyone forgets in a year then he comes back with a new "project" lol
Don‚Äôt worry, in a month you‚Äôll be licking his salty balls again when he releases a new A.I. Project promising he‚Äôs a changed man and much more mature now.
No, there are still bigger.

But he's clearly discernible in the global pile of shit. And that's bad enough.
There are people human trafficking babies and little kids. Relax lmao.
In the same cell with Diddy and SBF. They can take turns being the monkey in the middle.
Welcome to the world of social media influencers aka Scamfluencers
First time I realised KSI existed was some 10 years ago, when I came across one of his FIFA card pack unboxing videos, where he was always reacting hysterically to every good card he was getting. I remember thinking "This is some low effort content" and thought he would never be relevant...

I was obviously wrong, not because I misjudged his qualities but because the world learned to value that type of creators and content.
Hoping this scammer finds his place in jail one day
Hahaha fair.
These criminals dont deserve the fame they have - I knew straight up he was never gonna pay a dime back. What a scumbag - Also people shouldnt buy celebrity-related or endorsed crypto ever
Bitconeeeeeect
Squid coin, nothing coin, etc. ad nauseam
tbf fuck anyone over the age of 18 who gave this useless prick their money.

these idiot influencers exist because people feed them, they don't exist in a vacuum.
Maybe Trumps new crypto?
- Name a worse project team to invest in.

Team MAGA, the party of grifters
Fraud and misrepresentation are not protected activities in a libertarian society, any more than theft and robbery. The problem is not that he sucks are making a project, it's that he promised something he didn't deliver. (although, I'm sure investors would have been screwed even if it was a completed project, that is not the point)
People do have responsibility for their actions but the people creating these projects have a responsibility to act in good faith.  This POS does not
Do you think a Libertarian society should enforce contracts?
This is the best, most succinct, honest comment here.
Congress, SEC and FED?
Gary Vee seemed to be a fraud with his NFTs also - or am I thinking of something else
They should which is exactly why they won't
Logan Paul is 29 years old now. His followers have got to be in their 20s at the very least. I think we can settle with ‚Äústupid‚Äù instead of ‚Äúyoung‚Äù
Coffeezilla is crowdfunding the defense through merchandise. Something he said he didn't want to do, but his insurance broker screwed him.

I'm supporting coffeezilla. Got a few t shirts coming.
Live Polygraph test on every project founder instead of AMA
Yes it was fraud, but on some bullshit like this you know you‚Äôre gambling.
Question: how are teenagers buying cryptocurrency?
>I get your point, but this man's audience was teenagers and people who had absolutely no experience.

So, they gained experience? Will this now help them stop supporting cringe youtubers? Maybe stop making them rich?

Cause, you see, if you think Logan Paul is garbage, this is the fault of whoever thought he wasn't garbage. Some people in the world have this kind of fucked up taste and create people like Logan. Logan wouldn't exist without the idiots who got scammed. They're all part of the problem. It's an ecosystem. Dumb people who contribute to a much worse society got scammed.
Meh. When I was a kid I got scammed out of a Santa hat on RuneScape and learned a valuable fucking lesson. Kids these days can learn the same, or they can learn to shift blame to anyone but themselves.
There are people still supporting him. So yes the stupid is strong in them.
So little Billy has unsupervised access to Daddy's credit card and bought snake oil with it?

Still zero sympathy for negligent Daddy.

Edit:  
response to the deleted reply:

Exactly.  
I was not a perfect boy.  
My parents were responsible and did not let me buy whatever I wanted because, surprise, children don't know any better.

You don't let your kid buy whatever they want.  
How is this such a controversial take?
Let‚Äôs not pretend the teenagers who idol Logan Paul are sweet innocent little kids
Based on the interviews I've seen a lot of the big bagholders were just people hoping to use that audience as exit liquidity for the pump and dump. Which, tbh, isn't far off from gambling.
> the moment these "personalities" start shilling whatever they're shilling, I lose trust in the product.

Like that Prime drink
He told everyone who listened that this was going to be a passive way to make money. In this economy, where there is a lot of desperation to make ends meet, anybody who uses that desperation to get people to hand over their hard-earned money is a criminal. What separates Logan Paul from your average con man is he is famous and has clout. If he hadn't promised to make it right for those who put money into this and then didn't deliver on that promise, I wouldn't categorize him as a criminal con artist, just a crappy business person who was incompetent. All of the evidence points to the fact that he was employing other criminal-minded individuals to create this shitcoin.
Is it still falling for a scam when you know it's a scam but just think you are getting in early enough to scam everyone else?
Mr Beasts image isn‚Äôt so hot these days either. He must really want to reach their target audience.
Or like 99% of the projects on coinmarketcap... cryptobros will tell anyone who questions some projects promises to f off and how they "just don't get it", but then whine around when they are left with the bag.
He's big from a societal impact perspective and his personal wealth is enormous. By leaving him untouched, you're basically teaching kids it's ok to scam.
NFT projects giving celebrities NFTs along with money to promote said NFTs seems way more plausible.
There‚Äôs also Jake Paul tho
The biggest, stinkiest, scammiest piece of shit in the galaxy.
Gas in liquid form.
No one with their brains cares about him.

Just look at the backlash of his recent product, it's just always the few children who fall for it.
That is an image that will give everyone nightmares.
Ksi's videos from 10 years ago were anything but low effort though....I think you might be talking about a specific video instead of his content as a whole. He used to have the funniest editing on YouTube back then.
He is now even bigger celebrity. Will definitely be remembered. Vacuum cleaner bags should be named after him. Logans.
[deleted]
Except coinye.  That was the shit.
In crypto a celevrity endorsement is the biggest red flag right now because of scum like logan paul. He and others ruined it for everyone.
To be fair, I think Logan offered refunds of approximately twelve cents on the dollar.
At least Bitconnect gave meme for the ages, all Low Life Paul did was to give his victims nightmares while gaslighting them
\^ This guy gets it. This is the way.
I think Logan Paul is part of that team now, so it makes sense.
Libertarians literally want no regulation or control on how they run their business etc... it's exactly the wet dream to exploit and be "free" to do as you please at the expense of whoever without any authority stepping in.
the largest scammers on the planet

Well done
Did Low Life Paul have coffee sessions with Greasy Gensler SBF-style?
This is something that pisses me off about SEC, wasting time and money, while Celsius, FTX, and scumbags like logan destroy the space.
Just got my shirt in the mail a few days ago! He deserves the support!
Would be funny if coffee isn't getting sued and is just raking I'm dough from the shirts
Polygraphs are theater to trick people into confessing. A failed polygraph means nothing.

This is such a bad take. Victim blaming is common in crypto. She was asking for it‚Ä¶
Evil in the world is necessary so people learn and become good. That doesn't mean that evil doers should not be punished harshly, and victims deserve sympathy
The fez looks so close.
Selling 1/2 wine
Think of the long-term value of that lesson vs the nominal value of that Santa hat at the time.  


Pretty good deal when you think about it.
Aww you must have been a perfect little boy!
lets also not assume they're any worse then the average kid
holy hell yes I forgot about that. still no idea what all the fuss was about. even here, in Bulgaria, this thing was on top shelves in stores and gas stations with insane price.  even marketplaces like facebook and our local equivalent of craigslist had it there with 5x market price. 

events like this one really make me lose hope lol
I bought a 6pack of prime for the equivalent of $3 not too long ago. Didn't know it was affiliate to which ever Paul this is until recently.
And he somehow managed to look worse.

Mike needs to chew his ear off for us.
The queef of the universe.
Yep, which makes it even worse imo as we can state he is exploring a more vulnerable audience. We need law enforcement for this scumbag asap
I'd prefer him erased from history.
Low Life Paul should be what he is known as!
His audience isn't exactly made up of Google engineers.
Bruh
Yeah there are some dumb libertarians out there, but a real libertarian supports civil and criminal courts as there needs to be a mechanism to resolve disputes, which is not the same as regulation. You can't have a free market if there is no enforcement against bad actors. Anarchos may have a different resolution strategy, but most libertarians rely on courts.
Eh, a main principle in Libertarianism is to ‚Äúdo no harm.‚Äù Lying and misleading people into giving you money doesn‚Äôt exactly fit under that principle. I‚Äôm sure, there are some Libertarians are of that mindset though.
They‚Äôre not allowed to be used as evidence in court in most jurisdictions either because of their known unreliability.
I suppose so.
Just because you use the buzz term "victim blaming" doesn't mean you're automatically right. Yes, victims some time are part of the problem. If i decide that my house shouldn't have a door and leave it accessible to anyone to come in, and then get robbed, am i simply a victim and nothing else? Did i have nothing to do with what happened to me?

There is such a thing as being fucking stupid. And if you're fucking stupid you should be called fucking stupid and instructed to change your ways.

If a house has mold, is mold the only problem? Do you just need to remove the mold and that's it? Do things just happen in a vacuum? No, they don't. Every problem is part of an ecosystem of problems.
When I think of victims I think of people who‚Äôve survived rape, genocide, assault, natural disasters, and basically anything at all besides a shit coin bag holder. Take the L and move on. Literally everyone who‚Äôs still holding shitcoins has lost money and this one is no different
Ah jeez when you put it that way maybe we should all be thanking Mr. Paul for teaching the youngins about glittering and gold
Agreed! I haven‚Äôt fallen for a scam since then actually
You dint have to be perfect to not steal credit cards and invest in scams
No one‚Äôs perfect a little boy, but that‚Äôs where parents come into play. Kids can‚Äôt get credit cards on their own.
In fact, let‚Äôs not assume at all!
"Scumbag" is like a complement for them, they are much worse
A cosmic toot
you sure he isnt the dueef of the universe ?
Ah, so a society that depends on capitalists looking out for others instead of themselves. What could go wrong? ü§£
Got it. Victims of crime are fucking stupid.
did you just "Dear Muslima" Logan Paul victims?
99% sure at least one guy ended it after losing a lot of money because of this specific thing. Obviously, a 14 year old kid that lost 50 USD already forgot two days later, it all depends
This sub:  
Regulation bad. Government bad.   


Also this sub:  
Whhaaa why are people allowed to scam us?!
Did you just compare shitcoin bag holders to people suffering under actual oppression?
They're allowed to scam us collectively out of millions, but we're not allowed to slit their throats 

Government bad. Regulation bad.
no I think you did, lmao.
Client is mad about my watch.
So last week were at client for an audit and I met the CEO and CFO and were talking. The CEO made a comment saying, "That's a nice watch for just a staff." Today I come into the office with an email from the partner asking me to not wear my grandfathers watch at clients. Apparently I disrespected the clients employees by "flaunting my wealth" while we were there. I guess my negative net worth hit an integer overflow and now I am intimidatingly wealthy.

How would you all respond to this? I have to go back next for their single audit.

  
[The Watch in question](http://imgur.com/a/nzcX1p0)
Wear two watches next time
Is this real?  Like, you‚Äôre not joking?  Cause, DAMN.  What the fuck is wrong with these people if they are intimidated by your watch?
Was your dick wrapped around your wrist? They may have been offended at your length.
Dude, we're supposed to wear Timex's and Casios. Fossils too. *Maybe* entry level Seikos and Citizens.

None of this vintage stuff.
What kind of watch OP? Let's see it
Question is what is the watch? If it‚Äôs a vintage Rolex, I wouldn‚Äôt consider that such a statement piece to warrant that reaction. If it‚Äôs a Richard Mille worth $500k or whatever, then maybe warranted?

Edit: I saw the watch now. Nice Rolex. Obviously it‚Äôs inherited as it has seen its fair share of use. I‚Äôm sure it means a lot to you and it‚Äôs weird that it brought out a negative reaction. I would not wear returning to the client since the client appears to be a man child. Perhaps wear it on your next engagement and so on. It obviously hurt that persons ego that a mere staff has a nice watch and them, a CEO or CFO does not. Don‚Äôt see why anyone really cares. If it were me, I‚Äôd say nice watch, move on, and not think about it again.
Sounds like your partner needs to grow a spine.
Rent a lambo, write it off as a business expense, pop a few bottles while at the client‚Ä¶

However if you‚Äôre American, I can‚Äôt help since your laws are weird. Canadians can‚Äôt be fired for that.
I would probably start by sending an email to the partner explaining that it was your grandfather's watch, that you take great pride in wearing something that was passed down and entrusted to you, and you feel the complaints from the client's staff are needlessly reactionary and without merit. However, in the spirit of maintaining a good relationship, you are prepared to show up with a Casio F-91W. I think it is important to clearly state that you think the client's staff are being dicks and that you did absolutely nothing to disrespect them. Have it on record in case it becomes a problem later.

Personally, I stopped giving a shit what clients thought when one of them simultaneously complained about my car (2001 Suzuki Esteem at the time) being an eyesore, and also saying that my watch (Tissot Visodate) was too flashy and that he must be paying us too much. The guy was just an asshole who wanted to complain about anything, and your clients are assholes too. But if you're young and starting out in your career, you may just have to acquiesce to some of their demands. You don't exactly have the power to tell people to suck a dick and deal with it.
Insane levels of insecurity from the client site.
Get a gold chain to match the watch
I would laugh all my way to the bank. 

No, seriously, I would consider if they have a fair point. If not, then wear your watch.
I have a few nice watches (and suits) myself and get compliments from clients all the time. The one time someone made a snarky comment about my appearance, I said ‚Äúyou should be glad you have an accountant that can afford the lifestyle. That tells you you‚Äôre in good hands.‚Äù No further comments from that client.  
  
Edit: that being said, always read the room. If your client is a trades company, construction, non-profit etc. it helps to build rapport by mirroring their dress code so you‚Äôre not out of place and makes them feel more comfortable while working with you.
I am pretty sure the CEO has a similar watch and he is offended that and auditor wears an expensive watch. This is an ego thing.

I would add also to talk / email  your partner like other person suggested here and said that the watch was your grandfather's and wearing it makes you feel close to him.

And do what you think is right for you 

Best Luck.
> "That's a nice watch for just a staff."

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, I should be running this place‚Äù
How much fun do you want to have with this?

Also Is your grandfather alive?
[deleted]
You're a consultant right? Your one job as a consultant is making the client happy. Unfortunately, as you've found out most clients are desperately stupid.
Fragile egos
100% you need to write an email to your boss and let him know it‚Äôs inherited. I would also have stated when the comment was made that it was inherited. You cannot let people walk over you like that. 

And for ‚Äújust a staff‚Äù? What kind of bullshit is that? He has hired YOUR company to help make sure his people aren‚Äôt doing shady shit. No need for him to act shady himself.
‚ÄúJust a staff.‚Äù

What a dick
If I was a partner I would be worried about the client‚Äôs ability to pay for the audit.
This is so fucked up it sounds like its satire üò≠. Bruh if the CEO and the CFO are so concerned about their employees getting "disrespected" about an auditor having an expensive watch, maybe they should wear their big boy pants and pay their employees better. I mean which employee would actually feel small dicked for looking at a watch. Literal brain rot moment. I feel sorry for you mate. This is.. Just wow.
I just want to throw out that this is a fucking batshit crazy interaction. I'm sorry that happened.
Tell them it‚Äôs a replica
When I was a manager in B4 I needed a new car. I had driven mine until it was regularly failing. One of my primary clients was an auto manufacturer. I felt immense pressure to buy one of their cars. Would have been a really bad look to drive up to their offices in a competitor‚Äôs vehicle with new tags. Thing is, I didn‚Äôt like their cars and didn‚Äôt want one. I stressed over this for months. I finally decided to buy the car I wanted (used), and just parked as far away from the building as possible. Within 6 months that client fired our firm in order to consolidate all international audits with 1 firm. I was so happy I didn‚Äôt spend money on their shitty car.
I‚Äôd keep wearing it. Imagine being fired and then bringing up during your next interview that you were ‚Äúlet go because your watch was too nice‚Äù.
‚ÄúJust a staff‚Äù what a job shaming elitist little baby dick prick.
Wear your grandmother's hat and your dad's underwear next time you go. That'll keep them on their toes.
I understand everyone‚Äôs ire. 

However, since OP is doing single audits, I‚Äôm guessing this is a non profit. Nonprofits typically pay for shit. While OP may have some older Rolex, Rolex is the most well known luxury watch brand. I could easily see the CFO not wanting their staff to think some freshman out of college is making way more money than them. 

I‚Äôm not saying they are right or defending anything. I‚Äôm stating the facts of the situation. 

OP your choice is to do what your boss and your bosses boss says (the client) or make a stand and guarantee you‚Äôre going to get a shitty review and be on that partners shit list.

Wearing a watch is not a hill I‚Äôd die on if it came down to wearing a watch vs career advancement/money. However, that is a decision up to you.
lol clients are so weird. i've had clients complain about the audit team showing up in business casual because the employees are wearing tshirts and jeans and they are scared of seeing business casual walking around for some reason
I think your client also shared their side of the story also on r/accounting: https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/s/tQeLoNVAkw

Is this related?
CEO:

Likely has 2 houses

safe six figure salary

a modern BMW/Tesla

\*sees others with 1% of his net worth\*

"We pay these people so much"
‚ÄúJust a staff‚Äù

Sounds like a great guy
Every one knows you have a fun time watch and a client watch. 

For context, I work in PE and my boss who‚Äôs close to being a billionaire always takes off his super expensive Rolex and puts on an Apple Watch for client meetings. 

It‚Äôs not about you personally it‚Äôs about the message you are sending - you are charging the client fees so if they see you (especially as a junior staff) wearing an expensive watch they start feeling like maybe they‚Äôre paying your firm too much. 

Totally fine to wear your expensive watches in most situations but just read the room
This isn't about flaunting wealth, it's about classism. They felt you were not in a class to wear something like that to work. They want you in "your place." Ask them how it violates the dress code, and be clear it's your grandfather's watch and you wear it for sentimental reasons.
Shrodinger's auditing staff. The partner wants their team to look paid well enough, but not too much which implies the firm is charging clients more than competitors. Really stupid perception stuff. 

Go the opposite direction for fun. Drive a beater to the client, wear some patched up clothes and scuffed kicks.
Can you get hold of a super tacky dirt cheap plastic watch that looks like its worth a dollar and just wear that next time - bonus points if it doesn't actually have any moving parts like it's for a 3 year old to pretend with. Wear it proudly and on display, and if anyone asks, mention it's befitting to your financial position.
Your client's CEO is a bitch.
It‚Äôs a fucking Rolex, how tf are they supposed to know it‚Äôs real? There are more fakes than real ones.
I‚Äôm confused about how this is an issue? Don‚Äôt wear the watch to that client. Next time someone comments say ‚Äúthank you, it was my grandfathers‚Äù. Immediate transition from flaunting a fancy watch to heart warming story.

It‚Äôs not even clear from your post that the client complained and that it isn‚Äôt just the partner reading into it too much.
Wish someone would say that about my Casio.
Go buy a Richard Mille
Depends where you want to fall on the professional to petty scale.  Personally I think it would be hilarious to find the cheapest, most plastic POS Neon Green watch and wear that the next time you go out there.

The Neon Green might be a little over the top, but you could get some very obviously cheap watch that's not so obnoxious.
Why didn't you tell the CEO the origin of the watch. It could have been a moment to build up client relationship.
Look them straight in the eyes with the calmest expression in your face and say, "this was my grandfather's watch. He passed away suddenly last year. I loved him very much and I wear this in his memory -- everyday."

Just look at them. Don't blink. Don't smile. Hold...hold...hold

And watch them fold.
CEO definitely has penis envy.
wear the watch. fuck that client and fuck the partner if they wont back you up
Only the NFP sectorüíÄ
See this is why I struggle with corporate. Cos if a mf tells me this shit I just wanna slap him across the face and tell him he‚Äôs a fucking weirdo stfu you‚Äôre not my dad. But instead I gotta say some corporate shit to not risk losing my job over the watch I wear. 

Fkin power hungry weirdos who got bullied in school. They think they‚Äôre too cool cos they sucked ass and gave their life for years to be a corporate slave. Sado‚Äôs. In any other setting I would verbally dismantle them and their overinflated sense of self importance.
Every day I am reminded life is just a series of never ending Curb your Enthusiasm plots. Please escalate this like Larry would.
Please go back with no watch but ask everyone what time it is over and over.¬†
you need to wear the flava flav watch to woo your clients next time. and your boss!
I'd take the incident to HR and suggest a significant raise to bring your salary in line with client expectations.
I work for a big corporate company & if I got an email from my manager for something like that, I‚Äôd go to HR for the first time ever & say ‚ÄúSorry that my grandpa died & I wear this in his memory.‚Äù
"No" is a complete sentence. Spineless cowards who cater to the lowest denominator are not worth two words.
A friend of mine was asked to not wear his Submariner during investment banking recruiting because it could come off as flexing. I guess some people don‚Äôt like thinking someone else might have more money than them.
I would say you should see what I drive HAHA
I used to have a 25 year old C class Mercedes with 200k miles. I got it for $1500. People I worked with and friends always would comment how I ‚Äúmust be doing well at work‚Äù due to having a Mercedes. People are obsessed with brands.
Some people just get upset when they see someone else with nice things regardless of how they got them. 

If your partner is telling you it's an issue to wear your watch that is within corporate dress policy, ask them for the reason why it's not acceptable. Your client being a little bitch and thinking that you need to look more poor than them is not a good enough reason.
Trying to see the other side here...the client may be balking at their total aduit fees. I know on paper an audit should go up or down depending on business complexity and how clean organized the client is.  However, in reality partners are not in the business of reducing costs and fees.  They will feed clients a line about not having this or that, so next year when the client has this or that and the work and fees magically increase...clients get pissed.  I think most of you miss this dynamic.  Clients are paying for a service and auditors often just focus on their own workload given to them by the audit manager.  Clients will tolerate a certain amount because of high switching costs, but there are limits.  You aren't privvy to those conversations that are taking place offline.

So you may have walked into a client getting frustrated with your firm, and he picked out a landmark to exaggerate his point to the partner whom he feels is exploiting the situation.  That landmark was your watch.  Partner either doesn't get it, or wants to take that excuse away.  The client isn't mad at you, he's mad at your partner.
Are you guys foreclosing on businesses? I could see it being triggering if your client just lost everything.
At the next meeting turn up late and say sorry but you no longer have a watch to keep track of the time.
if you still want to wear it a good middle ground would be putting it on a nato strap. The main reason people notice it is the gold center links on the bracelet.
This is actually an amazing watch, if I had it I would wear it everywhere. And the fact that it's from your grandfather makes it priceless.
Tell the partner you can‚Äôt afford to buy a cheaper watch and need to wear the hand me down
That‚Äôs a beautiful watch. But one can tell that it‚Äôs an older one and well loved. It‚Äôs not extravagant at all. Fk that client and the partner. The partner should‚Äôve stood up for you and let them know it‚Äôs a family heirloom and you‚Äôll continue to wear it.
I advise a vintage suit with a top hat and a monocle.
get one of those watches that you can change the TV with and keep turning the tv in the ceo's office on and off all day.
I would just simply say to the guy who made the comment that it‚Äôs my grandfathers watch that has been handed down through the family and I wear it to honor him. Would make him feel like a real dick.
Tell the client to kick rocks and start paying his employees better.
Wear a monocle and top hat next time too and refer to your client as my good fellow
Walk in wheeling a grandfather clock on a hand truck. Make sure it rings loudly every hour on the hour to ensure you don‚Äôt lose track of the hours being billed.
What an incredibly condescending comment to make to someone lol. So do you need to be a CEO to have a nice watch (Nice watch BTW)? Sir, how did you even notice my watch with your nose so high in the air? Peasants need to know they can't wear elitist brands.
Idk why this sub got recommended to me, but being an amateur watch guy I can say its a nice watch. Wear it again next time you are there, its obviously seen its time on the wrist and if that upsets your client thats on them. No one gets to say how you spend your income.
Shitty client bitching about the audit fees and using your watch as leverage.
Should have told them it was a fake one you bought from AliExpress
Next time you see them they will have a nice watch they probably paid an arm and leg for. You wear a plastic hello kitty watch. Make sure to compliment their watch. If they have the audacity to wear a nicer watch and then comment on your flamboyantly childish watch, let them know you heard someone had a tantrum so this time you wore a child‚Äôs watch, take a close look at their watch, and say ‚ÄòI think it‚Äôs a fake‚Äô. ü§£ü§£ü§£
Istg they grew up physically but still mentally stuck at the age of 12 to feel disrespected by an expensive watch
/r/watchescirclejerk
Wear it the next time you go, walk up to the CEO and say ‚Äúhey my boss told me you complimented my watch, it was passed down from my grandfather who got it when he stormed Normandy on D-Day and took it off a dead Nazi, what did your family pass down to you?‚Äù Then walk away immediately.
Thats why I got a $10 casio watch.
Your client finding a mistake to not extend the contract with your firm
Get less insecure clients first
If you grew a pair and just said "Yeah, I inherited the watch from my grandfather". I can assure you things would have gone entirely differently. Not to say that the CEO was not being a major wanker.
Women deal with this too with fancy purses. It's best not to instigate jealousy because sometimes, envious bosses won't think you need raises, etc. It's stupid, but best not to wear at work.
Always dress "client appropriate".

Your boss is unaware of the sentimental value of your watch so don't hold a grudge.  Learn from his/her experience and focus on the client.
two people wear rolexes as staff

1) one who is wearing a family heirloom as a gesture to their family

2) one who is wearing a family heirloom to show a force of wealth and to generally be a materialistic douchebag who doesn‚Äôt realize buying/wearing a rolex with their first bonus is a childish way to win respect and is generally clown behavior. 

client is assuming you are #2. and tbh there are many more people like #2 vs. #1, obviously. 

i don‚Äôt really have any advice, but as someone with relative decency you should be aware if you wear a rolex out as a fresh graduate, some people will assume you are number person 2. unfortunate, but reality.
Buy Casio calculator watch

Use whole duration with next interaction with this client
That watch is too nice to be wearing for stupid work shit anyways. Its beautiful, so wear in good health and hope it brings you many great memories.
Wear an alarm clock on a chain around your neck like Flava Flav.
Don‚Äôt let people tell you what you can or can‚Äôt wear. That‚Äôs nuts.
This is literally why we can‚Äôt have nice things
Yes, you never wear a flashy watch to a business meeting. Douchebags wear gold watches to meetings. My Dad was in the construction industry and always took off his Rolex and strapped on a Casio when meeting with a client.
If asked just tell them this is the reason you wear the watch:

This watch was on your Daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi. He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp. He knew if the ENEMIES ever saw the watch it'd be confiscated, taken away. The way your Dad looked at it, that watch was your birthright. He'd be damned if any slopes were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide something. His ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you.
In addition to the aforementioned watches on each wrist, have a pocket watch too. Synchronize the watches every now and then with the time on your phone and if someone asks about it, tell them you're being watched. Obviously.
It‚Äôs really hard to gauge how people are going to act and what they will care about or notice. I dated a girl years ago that worked in a very high end real estate office. These realtors were doing multi million dollar deals regularly, so they had money. One of them wore a Rolex to a meeting with a potential client, and the reaction was something to the effect of ‚Äòyou are taking too much money from clients if you are wearing Rolex to meetings, I don‚Äôt want you representing me.‚Äô 

On the other end of the spectrum, I sold cars for years, and salespeople used to always hate getting customers in that looked dirty or disheveled, even though they were usually the ones that (if they bought) would bring the highest commissions. 

If you were to call a contractor to build you a million dollar house, would you feel more comfortable if he showed up in a ‚Äò99 ford ranger that seemed to defy physics with every start, or a ‚Äò24 F650 with shiny rims that looks like it he never touched anything but pavement? 

It all comes down to the work environment and the image that you and your workplace would like to project. It could be ‚Äòwe are so good at our jobs that we can afford nice things.‚Äô It could also be ‚Äòwe project a humble image to show that we are so good with money that we don‚Äôt waste it on superficial things like jewelry.‚Äô

Honestly though, fuck em. Nobody tells me what I can and can‚Äôt wear. ‚ÄòHey boss, the watch was a gift and holds sentimental value. Thank you for noticing it, it means a lot to me, which is why I will continue to wear it.‚Äô
My sister is a financial advisor for Edward Jones and she lost a client because of the type of car she drove. She drives a black Mercedes GLC SUV and the client felt like for where my sisters‚Äô at in her career, that she shouldn‚Äôt be driving that type of vehicle. Even though she got that car before becoming a financial advisor and manages a client portfolio of around 10mil‚Ä¶..I swear be hating
I worked as a designer and we hired an accounting firm who did a lot of work for celebrities. Their partners would try their best to hide their wealth and not flaunt it.

The reason being was you DONT want to give off the message of ‚Äúhey, this is where your overpriced fees are going‚Äù.

Take the watch off and use more tact.
Wear a plastic toy watch.
My Dad was a CPA, he had a nice watch, but Mom gifted him a diamond ring.  He said he quit wearing it because all of his client‚Äôs eyes were glued to it.
Wear a big ass goofy kids watch. One that lights up or plays music
Just ignore the client and don‚Äôt wear it again, this isn‚Äôt the hill to die on.

Search for new jobs if it will make you feel better.

For my wedding, my father in law got me a 50k watch, and luckily no one has ever said anything negative about it. Only watch aficionados recognize what it is, and they quietly tell me it‚Äôs awesome. But if someone made a stink about it, I would never wear it again to a work event.
Let's see Paul Allen's watch.
Obviously the audit fee is too damn high if staff have a Rolex!!
In 2009, I was waiting tables after the 08 collapse and had a new $2,500 watch on my wrist. Tell those guys to fly a kite.
Wear one with a face that says FU
"DON'T TOUCH THE WATCH." üêî
Same thing happened to my husband when  he bought his first new used car‚Ä¶
Park your MBZ in the CEO's spot.
Rolexes attract negative attention in certain business contexts. You found one.
You learned something today. CEO and CFO will judge you (incorrectly) based on what they perceive you to be. In this case predicated on a wrist watch.   I bet they judge people on all sorts of criteria: education, shoes, automobile, accessories, hairstyle, manner of speaking, accent.  Keep learning how they play the game, all while you figure out  how you can charge them up the wazoo for services when you are partner.
The big four consulting firms actively coach their team to dress one to two steps higher and more affluent than their clients it seems like it would be reasonable for you to do this in your condition
Dear Client,

No.

Yours Truly.
Very nice watch OP, next time buy a cheap watch and get it all blinged out with fake diamonds, match with a fake gold grill. Get a couple of ‚Äúbodyguards‚Äù off of airtasker for extra flair.
Wear it and wear it with pride!!! Tell em to bite me... jealous bastards.  Nowhere is it written that as a staff member you you can not have nice things. You inherited it. Still none of their God damn business. People like this irk me.  I'm an Executive Director. Continue to take pride in your appearance. They dont respect you, respect yourself üëç you got my respect!
Just don‚Äôt wear the watch and say that it was a gift from your grandfather. Big 4 audit culture is weird asf and partners and the firm will bend over for the client for any reason at all (especially if your client is a little prick which it sounds like it). I have a Milgaus and was never really comfortable wearing it but I wear it anyway
You could have said "thanks, it was my grandfather's"
Everyone knows employees can't have nice things, asshole. You're lucky they let you buy groceries and pay rent. Get back to work!
Fuck them.
Your granddad was facing death.  He knew it.  None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive.  Three days before the Japanese took the island your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport, name of Wynocki, a man he'd never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he'd never seen in the flesh, his gold watch.  Three days later your granddad was dead, but Wynocki kept his word.  After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch.

Tell the client that your grandfather stored that Watch up his ass in Vietnam for 3 long months.
Please go to your nearest Wal-Mart and find a $12 Mickey Mouse watch, the one where the arms move to tell the time. Prominently display it and see what they say.
The fact that your boss actually passed this message and instruction on to you instead of telling them politely yet firmly to mind their own business is an enormous red flag. Your boss is a money grubber too dumbly ignorant to even realize any of the actual costs of doing business with trash tier clients.
I guess they want to work with businesses that are too poor to pay their employees, which is a reflection of how bad the business is‚Ä¶ 

This is literally like the opposite of how business works 

Ask your boss if he prefers you wear cheap jeans with holes in them next time
In my culture the parents of the bride - or the bride will buy a watch for the groom. Usually about $400-2000 depending upon the wealth of the brides  parents. This is just a thing they do because the groom spends so much on the bride's ring and it's a welcome gift to the family. 
To feel intimidated by the watch is ridiculous. Money is not the measure of a person, it's how they treat others. They should have asked about the watch.

My son (29), wears my father's gold watch that doesn't work. He just likes wearing it to feel close to his grandfather. I've offered to fix it but he declines by saying it's a conversation piece when people ask for the time.
>"That's a nice watch for just a staff."

So in other words, they don't even like the IDEA of someone being able to obtain something they can. Fuck them.
"Thanks, I put a lot of effort into looking presentable for my clients, also this is the watch my grandfather left to me in his will after his undue death while literally saving the world with the avengers, so it also has sentimental value to me."
I mean it's a nice watch but I could not imagine having such a fragile ego as to take you wearing it as some sort of affront ü§£. If you only have to see them one more time I'd say buy the absolute cheapest watch you can find and wear it instead and try to subtly show it off haha
Ask them what kind of watch their preacher has?
Don‚Äôt wear watch and proceeded to ask them what time it is every 5 minutes. Lmao.
Just show up 30 minutes late to the next meeting with no watch on and say ‚ÄòSorry, I didn‚Äôt realise what time it was‚Äô.
Next time you‚Äôre there, in front of a large audience apologize loudly that your watch was cause for concern and that you will be sure not to wear it to their site again.  That way everyone within earshot can hear what a petty douche he is.
So your client doesn't want accountants that are good with money? Or he doesn't want to work with a company that pays its employees well? Makes no sense.

Did you respond at all to his comment? Something like "thank you, it's a family heirloom" would have shut this down.
I suggest storming into the partner's office (with righteous & justified anger, of course), and prepare to let loose like the IRS on a single mother with four children. Stick it to him, don't hold back, and let him know that you will not take it. At this point, you have already thrown your watch at his feet to let him know that you aren't taking it--not on your watch.
Cool, gets out my father‚Äôs Rolex that he doesn‚Äôt wear anymore.  Glad to know this intimidates the upper echelon that calls us peons.
This would probably bother me, and I would want to discuss it with my supervisor, or possibly HR if you have one.  Idk if "wrong" and "right" applies because clients get to be annoying assholes, but if it bothers you, it wouldn't be wrong to politely push back or express your concern over such a request within your firm.

Honestly, if my client told me that, I would explain I do not micromanage my employees' dress codes like that.  So if your boss allows them to be pushed around by the clients after you discuss it, I would take a scrutinizing look at my workplace situation.  I've worked in firms that cower to the clients and firms that are confident enough in their own values to stand up to excessive unreasonability.  (Some unreasonability is expected, these are human beings, but this feels excessive to me.). I won't refuse to work in the former culture, and it is a big part of the reason I left that place.    


You may have your own opinion, but I feel this kind of desperation for client approval reflects poorly on your management.
>That's a nice watch for just a staff.

Damn that's such a backhanded compliment
Easy: don't wear the watch. But do stand up for yourself and explain the situation.
Surely the CEO has something more important to worry about than other people's family heirloom
I know multiple partners at all of the big four and several midsized national firms. I‚Äôve worked with CFO‚Äôs and COO‚Äôs across the asset management industry. That partner is an asshole, and everyone who‚Äôs been at the firm for any period of time will know it. I would tell HR that watches are well within the firms dress code and you don‚Äôt appreciate having your attire criticized like that. If he makes another comment about it you can calmly tell him he‚Äôs making you uncomfortable and you‚Äôd like him to stop.
What am I missing? That looks like an old ass rolex. I mean, I get how wearing a gold daytona would be a bit much, but this is not a flashy watch by any means. 

Definitely not over the top for a working professional. The guy who emailed you, telling you not to wear this, is a dipshit.
Some people just need to be bitter and unhappy.
That‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that your watch would get under their skin like that. I work in finance and routinely wear my Rolex Daytona to onsites with only compliments from the clients and peers. Dumb.
Tell the client to be less poor?
Thats so fucking weird cause at my office there‚Äôs staff with Chanel, LV, and other designer stuffüò≠üò≠üò≠ I also live in California soüòÇ
This is absolutely ridiculous if true. I agree with another poster that your partner needs to grow a spine if he can't stand up to the client about you just wearing an old watch.
both on the same arm please
Completely unrelated to this post, but one time while working retail I saw a guy come in with two watches, one on each wrist. We worked in a so-so part of town and it was near closing time, so I jokingly leaned over to my coworker and said "Never trust a man with two watches..."

About 2 minutes later he ran out the emergency exit with like $50 worth of light bulbs.
Ha ha can you imagine
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=urevOsClLww
We get the most insane clients, my coworkers have lots of weird stories.
This is a pretty common thing that happens in audit to be honest. It‚Äôs not about intimidation, it‚Äôs that clients hate paying for audits so they use any excuse to try to lower the fee, even for petty/non sensical things like thinking the auditors make too much because they have something expensive.
Many people can‚Äôt see their own wealth unless they surround themselves with poorer people. 

Same goes for happiness. This person probably can‚Äôt be happy until everyone around them is upset. 

Super common human characteristics.
Not OP but my spouse worked as an analyst at a major Aerospace Company, Been in the news a bit.

Anyway she had a used late model AMG Mercedes SUV that was cheap to buy, horrid to maintain and she took it to a lunch with her director level boss and a few VPs. All of those old men decided "we pay our people too much" based on them seeing this car.

This coming from management that regularly gets an annual bonus far exceeding the purchase price of that car on top of their bloated nearly half-mil salaries.
Sounds real to me.
i could spend hours with someone and not know later if they were even WEARING a watch.
People become really screwed up when they have power and don't really have much work to occupy their time.
Very fragile egos
Rich people are often collectors. I'm guessing the guy literally wanted the watch on his wrist and just had a childish meltdown.
I once had a subordinate at work wear his Rolex, and he was entry level but just into watches.  It was actually his and he did but it for himself.  I simply wore my Rolex (RIP, dad) the next day so we could have something in common.
Never underestimate the fragile ego of people.
Nothing is wrong with these people.

It's looks terrible to tell your client who's strapped for cash that you can't offer them a discount when your wearing a god damn Rolex.

Buyers will get this.
Yeah, it‚Äôs a thing. Clients hate when they think you‚Äôre richer than they are.  When I was in sales, my sales manager bought everyone $5 digital watches and asked us to where those instead of our nice watches when going to a client meeting so they don‚Äôt feel intimidated.  People(most, not all) act arrogantly when they think that they are the higher value person and they skim deals/contracts instead of taking the time to read them.
[deleted]
My husband used to work in finance and rich ducks are psycho. If the people they employ (which is how they look at their financial advisors) makes enough to be wealthy, they immediately assume they‚Äôre stealing from them. Because why should you have as much as them when you‚Äôre JUST staff? They worked hard and you didn‚Äôt right? 

Let‚Äôs just say my husband no longer works in finance.
Hahaha, literal dick envy by the client
$25k watch, it might as well have been

If you don't wear a data bank are you *really* an accountant?¬†¬†


[This is one of my go to's](https://www.amazon.com/Casio-CA-53WF-8B-Calculator-Digital-Original/dp/B08HRW9DXG/ref=mp_s_a_1_19?crid=1K9EL8I0756ED&keywords=casio+data+bank&qid=1707751325&sprefix=casio+data+bank%2Caps%2C239&sr=8-19)
Should definitely go with a nice Casio F-91W, no class, just culture.
Big ass invicta
Me, poor and an employee, with my entry level Seiko and F-91W.
Get the Fisher Price watch that you have to move the hands yourself.
It‚Äôs an old two-tone Rolex submariner. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre flaunting 18k day-date. I think he‚Äôs just trying to compensate for his horrible corporate life by exerting some sort of control.
Check his post again, he's now linking to a picture of it.
Its in the desc, GMT Master II with a steel / gold bracelet

Beat up watch, anyone with a brain should realise its inherited
Im willing to bet its a Daytona from the 80s, and the CEO has wanted a Daytona for years, but his AD thinks he is a douche, so has kept him wait listed. Seeing it on some staff wrist sent him tailspinning and he ran his mouth bitching about it to everyone with ears.
OP posted it, vintage Rolex.. lol his client is just a jealous douche.
If a staff shows up wearing a $500k Mille who gives a fuck lmao. Why gives a shit about any of this bro, fuck them insecure dickheads
It's just an old calculator watch. But OPs client only pays their staff in beans so anything is a flex.
Learned early on about the jealousy of people at the top. It‚Äôs so strange. Like they are jealous you have even just one thing on par with them.

One of my coworkers got a nice truck he‚Äôd been saving a decade for. It was on par with the Limited and Platinum trucks the President and VP drove. 

You could tell they were all fake congratulating him when they first saw it then I heard nonstop shit talk around the office for the next few weeks. The voices from the office kitchen easily carry to my office so I hear more than I should when the President and VP are shit talking people. 

Long story short about a year later we were all bullshitting, it‚Äôs a small company so more things are talked about than they should be, and our controller basically spilled the beans that the guys new truck cost him a raise that year. President and VP were like ‚Äúguess we are paying him too much if he can afford that truck, let‚Äôs knock him down a peg.‚Äù
This was my thought. Of all the things to complain about they think the staff is overdressed? If they were getting charged double what other firms charge I could understand questioning the fees, but as long as employees look somewhat professional who cares what they wear? 

OP could live at home rent free and have an obsession with watches, and spend $20K on a single watch if they want. None of that is the client's business, and the partner should have addressed it as such.
One hundred percent.
yes partner is a pussy ass bitch

I was expecting to see something ridiculous but it's an old, used GMT. beautiful watch but nothing crazy special.
Canadians also can‚Äôt afford that.
I agree. As a Canadian we either can‚Äôt afford that or don‚Äôt have the real balls to do it. We act tough but we‚Äôre really not lol
Weirdest canadian flex I have seen on Reddit hahah.

Hey bro sick anti corruption laws bro!
Yeah Enron ruined everything fun.
Alcoholism is a disease. 

You must compensate me for my bad decisions boss. /s
Yeah I think the partner just doesn't want to deal with a headache and just told me not to wear it, Gonna draw a watch on some printer paper and tape it to my arm next week I guess.
Can guarantee this will backfire. 

Partner is being a dick for caring more about the client than their staff. They don't want to hear staff giving a reasonable explanation.
2001 Suzuki Esteem, is that you Saul?
Expense the Casio too
Best answer so far
Asking for a friend is the F-91 illuminator to much or is that acceptable?
I mean a Casio F-91W is cool and all, but I think you break the bank (and expense it) and should go for a Casio CA53W  https://www.amazon.com/Casio-Mens-CA53W-1-Calculator-Watch/dp/B000GB1R7S/ref=asc\_df\_B000GB1R7S/
Sounds like you had a case of the Goldilocks
And the firm‚Äôs leadership. Tell the client to pound sand.
I'd wear the largest most obnoxious watch I could find on wish.
OP should get a grill.
There's no fair point to be had, as far as I can tell. What watch you wear is simply no one's business so long as there's nothing pornographic or gore themed, and it isn't actually a weapon. It's literally just his grandfather's old watch. Being "just staff" shouldn't mean that you can't wear your own watch just because it looks nice. It's like dictating to someone "I think your social status is too low to wear clothes that nice, you better wear cheaper clothes next time I see you"
This specific scenario is bizarre. But your edit is also an important point. Please don‚Äôt show up to a steel mill in rural Mississippi wearing a full suit and your sports car rental.
My comment was similar to your 1st paragraph 

But you‚Äôre correct with your edit as well
[deleted]
Surprised to not see more people saying this, as it seems super likely this is the real story and the petty boss couldn‚Äôt tell the truth.
Pulp fiction immediately came to mind
Yeah no clue why OP didn't just say "thanks it was passed down through my family".  Would've made this entire thread null.
Literally the first thing that came to mind! 

I don't want my auditors looking shabby.

As a CFO, I would only bring up the watch like "How good are our independent auditors? Even the associates wear Rolexs."
OP should show up in a chimney sweep outfit next time, make sure he looks ragged and desheviled. Can't have them thinking he's making anything at all.
Your client's HQ is in Detroit?
On the outside of his pants
THIS IS REDDIT!! 

How dare you express a reasonable measured response, we need to be outraged to feel something! /jk
Finally, someone with some sense here
Can confirm, have done single audits as auditee and auditor.

These are smaller organizations receiving 750k in federal funds and need to be audited accordingly every year. OP probably assists with preparing the SEFA (schedule of expenditures of federal awards) work papers, tracing the dollar value to each award.

Anyway, the people who work at these organizations are pretty comfortable but not necessarily cushy. Pay is generally transparent and the mood is typically "overwork, underpaid" ad nauseam.

So when OP walks in with grandpa's 15K Rolex and his $8 chai latte, and $12 avocado toast to boot, of course he's going to get shit. Easy target. Although the comments you received were rude and crass, it's just reactionary and a hint of jealousy.

But were OP to wear it to a less friendly neighborhood client site, where say, you get a table only large enough for your laptop and perhaps a subway 6" you might be getting more than just jeers and hostile banter.

A little restraint goes a long way but if you feel the need to blow it up to make a point, more power to you. Just don't be surprised when it comes interview time and all you can say is you had a disagreement with the team culture.
At least that makes sense‚Ä¶
All stories on r/accounting get both sides, its just that one side is completely made up.
$20 says that‚Äôs someone shit posting the CFO/CEO side of the story cause it‚Äôs ridiculous
Personally, when I need them I want expert contractors, and that means people who look like they are paid commensurate with their skill level and quality of their work. I do not want some guy who looks underpaid.
Ironically jeans with holes are more expensive than regular jeans lol
With cuff links‚Ä¶
Good idea.  Four watches.
Multiple watches on one strap.
Oh this? This was my grandfather's!

*rolls up sleeve a little more*

And this one's mine.

***gold and gemstones blinds client***
But why light bulbs?
That story was dying to be told and was waiting for this perfect opportunity. üòÇ
that's so dumb. i have this 20-year old apprentice (i'm 29) and he wore a Cartier Tank to work one day gifted by his mum, and kind of reignited the watch enthusiasm among me and another colleague so we started looking at Seiko's again to buy and wear to work instead of the usual Apple Watch 'cause it's fun to geek around in our little watch club at work.

I don't really see it as intimidating but I don't work in corporate, just video production. If I was your client I'd probably compliment your piece and ask about its history. Sorry you had to deal with that.

To be fair, I worked with this British senior guy once, probably late 40's, he was a cinematographer on a tv show basically, and i was one of the lighting crew, I wore this tool called a lightmeter on my toolbelt, but typically only people of senior position would use that tool to measure the light because they are the one calling the shots basically, but we use it in film school of course to learn the lighting process too.

I wore one as a learning tool for me as a fresh grad, but motherfucker saw my lightmeter and said it's disrespectful to carry one as just a regular member of the crew. Told me he didn't want to see me wearing it on my belt after lunchtime

I lost all enthusiasm with working with "masters" of the craft after that, what a prick, and even after lunch he was teasing me like i'm one of those kids buying a camera and calling myself a cinematographer shooting youtube videos. To be fair he was the only one I ever came across that was bothered by it, but your whole ordeal reminds me of that guy. Damn.
So why not just say "this client is crazy, avoid wearing expensive things around him"?
My coworker who was wealthy before even starting working for our firm he bought a jaguar. He would park far away and told me not to tell the partners and he was told not to drive it to see clients once they found out.
Damn. Talk about insecurities. If you feel like going low‚Ä¶ lol, tell them someone you loved deeply made you promise to wear it everyday while you stood at their bedside as they were breathing their final breaths. Then say something like ‚ÄòI‚Äôd give anything to have them back.. but now all I have is this stupid watch!‚Äô - let‚Äôs see if they ever mention you wearing it ever again
sounds to me like this is part of your job, and you probably know you need to keep the watch at home to show deference.  You took the job, man.  This is your problem.
So true, we got bitched at for using the clients microwave to warm our food, no one was anywhere near it, still not sure how anyone even saw us using it let alone cried over it. multibillion dollar company too.
Great.

Clarity of communication and expectations, then.

"That watch is "too nice" for *just* *staff*".

Fine. I will jump ship and find someone who will pay me enough that it's not outlandish.
Now that I can see, makes sense!
Most sane reply for the most insane comment by a ceo.
Yup. We‚Äôve had clients go ‚Äúthere are too many new cars in your parking lot for us to just accept the fees you proposed‚Äù

Ok, well there‚Äôs the door you fuckwad. Go to some cut rate company. Our price is our price.¬†
This is the real shit right here.
Woof. Ok. Wow. New concept to unpack in therapy.
Haha. This proves my neighbor/mechanics favorite saying. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing more expensive than a cheap German car‚Äù
Sounds like something typical Boeing management would say.
>major Aerospace Company, Been in the news a bit.

You can just say Boeing lol
Haha, right?
Nah don‚Äôt project your lack of funds and personal shame onto auditors 

You pay them to audit , let them audit 

Their watch/ net worth is none of your concern 

It‚Äôs called minding your business - successful business owners will understand
This is gold. Wear a kids watch and then he will really question which is better. The adult that shows up with respectable attire to get things done or the kid that shows up and has to do the big boy thinking for them.
Just make sure the time is always set to 4:20.
Actually buy and wear it, and maybe even gift your boss one as well lmao
Nah!! Gotta be the pokemon one so they know ur trying to catch all their bullshit
Wear it on the other hand, and whenever someone comments on the nice watch act like they are talking about the toy one. Don't acknowledge the nice watch at all
That is the perfect response.

Make sure you expense it to the client.
Needs to be a pink hello kitty watch.
Tape a band of paper around your wrist and draw a watch face on it, be sure to put the brand as Rolex
Honestly this would be a great power move to wear to your next meeting with the partner.

I‚Äôm not saying it won‚Äôt have negative consequences, but it would definitely get some chuckles.
I‚Äôm the level of petty that I would wear this in front of the client who complained and then say, ‚Äúthey docked my pay because someone complained about my watch so I had to pawn my grandfather‚Äôs watch to pay rent.‚Äù
Do they hand these out to every accounting major upon graduation?
Fuckin' 54mm dial.
You can at least wear the World Timer.
It's a gmt not a submariner
Thanks, it's a nice watch but clearly it's well loved. Can't believe anyone made a big deal of it tbh.
Thanks, I‚Äôm blind. I don‚Äôt see why anyone would be offended. Obviously an ego thing
It's not even that expensive tbh, as far as watches are concerned. The client staff clearly only knows it's a Rolex, like most people's extent of watch knowledge, and is jealous about it, They probably wouldn't even recognize the watch if OP had been wearing an IWC, Panerai, Patek, etc. of far higher value.
The neat part is that nobody really gives a shit what kind of watch you wear except for other watch nerds
I have no idea what any of these things are but admire the enthusiasm.
r/Rolex is leaking. (And maybe also r/WatchesCirclejerk lol.)
Lol seems the real reason client was mad was because he doesn't want OP "flaunting his wealth" to his employees.¬†


Aka he's probably a cheap prick who underpays his employees.
True story, whether you believe it or not is up to you, a senior once told me that a partner in their office will randomly talk in whispers because he is scared of clients hearing him. 

Some partners have licked so much boot they can‚Äôt taste the difference between shit and French fries
What's even more strange is that it should be obvious that a STAFF's earning isn't gonna change based on the audit fee charged. Their salary is fixed, it's only partners that benefit directly from higher fees lol.
As a Canadian CEO I do agree, I can't afford either a Lamborghini or bottles
No doubt aboot it!
Please show up late to your meetings for the foreseeable future. When people start complaining, blame your poor timeliness on the lack of a watch.
If you really want to annoy the clients with something realistic, go buy a cheap Walmart watch and wear it, but upside down. Let the clients get enraged with you having it on the wrong way. And if they mention anything about it being upside down, be confident and look at the watch and read it normally like there‚Äôs nothing wrong.
Go find you the most gaudy Mickey Mouse watch available at the local Walmart. Make sure it has an alarm you can set to go off every hour that is Mickey‚Äôs laugh.

Edit: another idea I just had, go get you the most massive Invicta brand watch you can find. Those things are absolutely fucking insane. It would be absolutely impossible for anyone to ignore lmfao
PLEASE DO THAT!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
You better follow up!!!!
If standing up for yourself on something like this "backfires", then honestly it's only a matter of time until they find something else to fuck you with. 

I used to get walked on, and I would try to be apologetic even when I knew I was clearly in the right, and all it did was encourage more and more outrageous hyper-criticism. Sometimes you just need to stand your ground and say "no, I don't accept that explanation".
This client must be a royal PITA in order for a higher up to not stand up to a client over something as petty as a watch. 

I would have simply stated ‚Äúper our company‚Äôs dress code we do not currently restrict the type of watch worn by employees and will not be reviewing this policy at this time‚Äù
lmao I get that a lot. Unfortunately no, it was a blue station wagon, and all the doors were the same colour. There was a LOT of rust, though.

It makes me sad that Better Call Saul only became popular *after* I sold that car for scrap.
MBACPA across the top 6 teeth says "I got this"
And roll up in a Bentley

Edit: or go the complete opposite route. Show up in jorts, flip flops, an old stained T-shirt (no watch), and buy an old POS car with the muffler rusted off.
I did exactly that when my old boss made a comment about me wearing 2 gold chains every day lol. I already had the grill. I just showed up wearing it the next day
If you ever get into consulting you'll realize there's some unspoken things you have to consider that aren't obvious
I remember when I started my public accounting career in the early 90's in Silicon Valley, we would go to meetings at high tech firms wearing suit and tie, and the client could be dressed anywhere from a dress shirt and khakis (no tie) down to shorts, t-shirt, and Birkenstocks.  By the mid 90's, the dress code changed to business casual.
Reminds me when I had a meeting at Chanel's head office downtown, Manhattan to meet with a guy who's in charge of contruction/retail refits. You bet I'm going to wear my best suit to Chanel. Was amazing to see people in Chanel's main lobby dressed to the nines, thin men in their late 20s with the tighest suit  pants, ankles exposed, no socks, flashiest "peacocking" pocket squares.

The man I'm meeting walks out late 50s, early 60s, jeans, new balance running shoes with a golf shirt tucked in, glasses with that holder strap attached, giving off grandpa vibes. Was an amazing site to see.
I know someone who was hired for as CEO for a steel mill in rural Mississippi. He was sensitize to what he wore and even *which* truck he drove. Not his 20 year old daily beater, and not his new loaded super duty. Something more in the middle.
*This watch..*
Who cares how OP got it? It‚Äôs wild that the C-Suite people were offended - either that or they were busting the partners chops and he‚Äôs a weirdo. 

OP could just like watches.
The only correct answer to shut those "C" (ock) suite execs up.
Or maybe Austin.
Diamond grills
With an emotional support clown making balloon animals.
The cuff links should also be tiny watches
On a short sleeve shirt‚Ä¶
On a shirt without French cuffs
Also top hat
And a ring on your pinky finger. Old school power type ring
Big clock necklace, yeah boiiiii
Three Stooges episodes
He was looking for some bright ideas
Because they are light to carry?
He was at a dark place at the time.
Drugs.
He saw the light!
It doesn't look like anybody replied to you seriously. Crackheads use light bulbs to smoke out of. You break out the centerpiece on the bottom then you use a torch to blow out the bulb portion for your intake hole. If you get the older style white bulbs you put salt in and Shake It to scratch off the white cover so you have just straight glass.

I live in Arkansas and there wasn't much else to do for a while there. Luckily I never did it myself, my roommate did. It took me far too long to get myself out of that situation.
The brits have hereditary hierarchy baked into their psyche from a young age and it warps their outlook
Ask him if he would like it better if the light meter were crammed up his arse so far that he could take a reading by opening his mouth.
You were an electric? Not a grip? And this piece of shit DP was breaking your balls? Fuck him, I‚Äôm a gaffer and if anyone told my electrics or my best boy to remove a meter from his belt I‚Äôd be fucking pissed. You were doing the right thing, you were taking an interest and trying to do the best job you could. Your gaffer should have be ashamed he didn‚Äôt stand up for you.
Edited: even if you‚Äôre a grip but interested in lighting I‚Äôd think it was dope if you came in with a meter.
Lightmeter as a status and rank symbol. Im going to wear one everywhere now.
What a fuck.  Reminds me of my grade school art teacher telling me how bad of an artist I am for drawing aliens in my free time instead of landscapes.  

She crushed my hopes and dreams of being anything related to art.  Effectively stopped me drawing after that.  I used to draw all the time at home and she ruined it.
He recognized someone who would be a threat to him in 12 to 20 years time. He knocked you down. A true cinematographer would have complimented you. And then took you under his wing. If the craft is not taught then it will disappear.
I actually sort of get this (about the lightmeter anyway). While I think it's a bit messed up that a piece of equipment would trigger someone, I understand the whole 'keep the status quo'. My dad is a physician and he told me a story once about a young receptionist who was a little full of herself in the clinic he worked at. Most physicians will call each other by their last names out of convenience/respect/equality, whatever you want to call it, they just do. But to everyone else it's Dr. Lastname. So anyway, she kept trying to get this other doc's attention and called him by his last name only to summon him over to confirm something. My dad told her after the fact, in no uncertain terms, that physicians are to be addressed as Dr. Lastname and only once she's a physician is she able to address other doctors by their last name only. 

Anyway, he wasn't mean about it, he's one of the most humble people I know and is a genuinely caring person and normally doesn't give a hoot about status or any of that BS. As he says, he can never advance into administration (not that he wants to) because he won't waste his day playing golf and kissing ass.

So I get it. There are plenty of people out there who like to lord their fancy doctorate over everyone else (obvs not my dad) and be a prick but I do understand wanting to uphold the status quo in business. If everyone starts walking around with a lightmeter, maybe it's not so important anymore! ...jk, I have no idea wtf a lightmeter is and what its significance is but I think I made my point haha.
I've been getting a bit of a chub over the seiko SRPE99.
Fuck the CEO, and Fuck the fancy light tool man
tell me you wore it until ~noon every day thenceforth
People who pick on the apprentice are not masters. I guess he wasn't respected, because he wasn't that good, and felt a need to assert himself over someone it was safe to do so over.

Like why would he feel threatened by you wearing it?
He was afraid you'd replace him if you ever learned how to properly use the tool, and it happens in all skilled trades. Masters are very protective of their jobs
Wow.  When I was in film school, I remember using the light meter too.  It's important to understand what's going on AND it's an actual tool of the trade.  *Most* cinematographers would see that and go "this kid is motivated and truly wants to learn", I would imagine.

The only reason I could guess that they wouldn't is that they felt threatened.  As long as you weren't trying to be a know-it-all which I'm guessing you weren't.

I would take it as a compliment.
I'm a camera operator, and I keep a Sekonic 758C in my op bag with weather gear and knickknacks. I keep it around just in case the DP forgets his, or I'm asked to shoot 2nd unit or whatever and DP asks for specific ratios.
If you're not the gaffer or BBE or DP, wearing a light meter on your belt is a bad look. I don't pull my meter out for any reason unless there's an understanding with the DP. I'm kinda in agreement with this old guy, and I likely have more reason to carry one.

This watch is a family heirloom, and it's a goddamn watch, not a tool.
Man, Seikos are so sexy. I recently grabbed a 1989 Seiko Tank Quartz. Best watch I've ever owned.
I had a manager who was like this back when I was a staff. He had a beater civic and a Mercedes GLE.  He always drove the Civic to work, and only the very few of us he trusted new about the Mercedes.

Now he's a partner and lets his hair down a little.
"After your employees committed theft of electricity by plugging in their laptops...let alone the flagrant violation of the 'Employees Only' sign in the break room...I have to assume that you will waive your fee for the services provided."
We asked our auditors to stop using the microwave because they kept leaving it messy.
as long as it wasn‚Äôt fish i don‚Äôt see a problem
That‚Äôs exactly the type of thinking that gets folks audited
Coming from a career in management consulting, it‚Äôs a fine line with client services work. You want to look professional/impressive enough that you inspire confidence, but don‚Äôt want to look like you‚Äôre making so much money that the client thinks ‚Äúare they taking me over the coals?‚Äù.

It‚Äôs common for people who do government contracting to have ‚Äúgovernment suits‚Äù - to not evoke resentment when they meet with decision makers in government.¬†

OP is probably young and didn‚Äôt think about the optics. The client is an ass for making that comment and I assume following up with OP‚Äôs senior/manager. Someone should have pulled OP aside at some point a let him know it‚Äôs fine to wear a Rolex in the office, but tone it down when going on site.¬†
Yes yes, we want to hire auditors who are poor. That's right, poor as dirt. We want them to not have any money because they are so bad at what they do they can't turn a decent profit. No way do we want successful wealthy auditors that people are willing to pay a premium for. We want terrible broke auditors.
This is the way
"Just *a* staff" which tells me there's some cultural nonsense going on there too.
The words ‚Äújust staff‚Äù suggest so many comedic lines, I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. How about, ‚Äúthat belonged to my grandfather, who fought in the Great War. And yours?‚Äù üòè
Sounds like he should ask for a promotion to match the watch.
That's the truth! I once owned Volkswagen Passat that had parts that were similar with Audi and Porsche and cost the same amount as Audi and Porsche parts. I called it my "Poorsche"
I work for a German manufacturer (not cars) and I can‚Äôt wait to say this joke at work
You misunderstand. It's not about my funds, it's about the funds of my clients. 

If I were selling to people wearing rolexs, I'd wear a rolex. If I'm selling to hospitals, non-profits and government clients, a rolex is a stupid idea. 

This is a pretty simple business concept to understand... üôÑ
Great answer. Gotta get a Snoopy swatch.
I like watches and one of the watches in my collection that I think is pretty cool is a LEGO watch.
I fucking love that the ad time is set to 4:20. Marketing guy was definitely like Ayyyyy.
But provide no assurance that you will, in fact, catch it all!
That's a future partner level play
For that month's expense report, just eat all the expenses EXCEPT the watch. File the expense report for ONE item with a truncated description: "Accutime Spider-Man Digital Quartz Plasti..." for $12.83, GL-47556, Billable? Y, 2/13/2024.
Expense: None feefees hurting watch¬†
yeah, bill it as "dress code / uniform"
I hope they do
Engineers got rings, we have calculator watch.
I work in tech the F91 is expected. World Timer is for the directors.
Yes. It even clearly states GMT Master II right on the dial.
You can't believe a wealthy person jumped at an opportunity to condescend and swing their dick around at a subordinate? That's their entire fucking M.O.¬†That'sall they ever contribute anywhere.¬†
The people he's dealing with are either crazy or as\*\*\*les\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H\^H jerks.
Indeed. 90 times out of 100, no one will give a shit. 9 times out of 100, people will say "i like your watch" cause it looks nice. 1 time out of 100, at best, someone will recognize it, inwardly seethe at recognizimg an object of their desire on someone else and force out a compliment, or inwardly swell as they recognize it and have something better, and dish out a complibrag.
I'll tell you who you can impress. Some of the 5th graders I teach. They keep calling my Seiko 5s and San Martin diver (Chinese homage/clone brand) Rolexes. Kids couldn't tell a Casio from a Rolex but they'll be really impressed by anything that doesn't look cheap.
Especially when he could have been wearing a similar [Invicta Pro Diver](https://www.invictawatch.com/watches/detail/8934ob-pro-diver-men) and non-watch people would barely notice the difference.

A watch guy, Teddy Baldasarre, has a series of videos where he shows non-watch people different watches and asks them if they like them and how much they think each watch costs.

Some of the responses were pretty amusing to me as a watch collector.  One woman was shown an incredibly expensive, super-high end Swiss piece that was 6 figures and was like "Oh, this is very nice.  I'll bet it's expensive....like $500."

Most of them couldn't tell the difference between a $500 watch and a $5000 watch.

Most people wouldn't recognize the names Glashutte, Blancpain, Vacheron Constantin, or Jaeger-LeCoultre......but *everyone* knows Rolex.  And the funny thing is that Rolex is considered *entry level* in the high-end watch world.
ü§£ü§£ü§£
ü§£ü§£ü§£
That also makes sense, doesn't want his employees applying to work in auditing lmao
It's clear who here has never worked in consulting.¬†


The client will see a flashy watch as evidence they're overpaying.¬†
Another great point. The client's line of thinking is essentially "how dare you potentially pay your employees a good wage."
The question is not if you or the company can afford it, only if the company has a good enough credit rating to actually get the loan for it.
Holy fuck this is funny.
r/MaliciousCompliance
Dear god please do this at least once
And have it beep a lot during meetings
Just say it‚Äôs so you can show your clients the time.
I love this idea. Every hour, on the hour, instead of a Rolex ticking quietly at 8 bps, you get "HO-HOO! All you need is a little bit of magic!"
For sure. This Partner is just repeating the cycle of abuse.

There's no reason to be apologetic, just do the thing and make a note of it. It could be the partner, it could be the culture. It's a thing to remember for later on in life. 

The problem is the staff member going up against a partner who says something like this in the first place isn't going to end well.

If this were a senior or a manager, I think there would be more room for a successful pushback.
"FIFO" on the top


"LIFO" on the bottom
If you really look, you can find a (shitty) Bentley for less than $30k. It‚Äôll damn near bankrupt you, because it‚Äôs still a six-figure car made by half-drunk Brits on a Friday afternoon, but you‚Äôll be rolling in a Bentley about two days out of five, on average. 

Source: a friend of mine bought a $20k Bentley back in 2008. He had sold it on by 2009, because it had already needed over $10k in maintenance.
Yeah but techies don‚Äôt care what anyone wears.  They don‚Äôt bother to dress up but suit and tie won‚Äôt bother them, and they certainly won‚Äôt know or care about someone wearing an expensive watch.

The client being offended means they themselves are exactly the suit wear, watching wearing type who thinks wearing expensive things = status.
a concept foreign to the US west coast.
Yeah.. fuck justifying any sign of wealth to a fucking stranger.
Then ask them the time

Flavor Flav as Public Accountant # 1
And answer every client question with: DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIIIIIMMMMEEE IT IS?
God damn you
Ayyy lmao that was good bro
I guarantee he did not get a glowing recommendation.
I knew he was a Brit when he said lightmeter and not lightfoot.
Sorry about the lack of pixels but this is still entirely the case in 2024

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta5iYwhZUo0
Wait, Brits?  Working with Brits is a terrible experience if they are management.
This is true. Whenever I tell my father about someone who was rude to me at work he says 'well they're just stupid, they wouldn't talk to you like that if they knew who you are and what kind of family you come from.'

 Which is ridiculous for many reasons, but mostly because we aren't landed gentry or anythiing, we're safely middle class and so are most of my customers. And I'm hardly a princeess in disguise, I drive a skoda and cut my own hair and I need this job to pay my tuition. 

But this idea of class is baked into people of a certain age and they form a lot of their worldview around the idea that anyone of 'lesser birth' is inferior and that you deserve respect on the basis of your family. That's something I do like about American culture, they don't have this 'respect your betters' nonsense or any kind of idea that the serfs and peasants should be grateful you even gave them the time of day.
Lol that made me chuckle, thanks
I appreciate the kind sentiment. Yea I was mainly a set electric and the meter was a mainstay on my tool belt, I didn‚Äôt think to take it off even if I was just gripping that day‚Ä¶ nor did I ever take it out to meter anything that day, on big shows like that back then if I was ever curious I would sneak some readings out of curiosity only during breaks.

Tbh that day I came in as a dailies grip, and it was a 3 month show, so I was a new face to him and probably drew attention when this new guy was screwing down his o Connor head. This was back in 2017, same year I graduated film school. I now am an owner op gaffer with a 3 tonne truck package (just some aputure shit). 

It‚Äôs funny, after lunch his words when he teased me were ‚Äúaw mummy bought me RED camera for my birthday so I‚Äôm a DP now). We were in Malaysia so this kind of issue of super young owner op DP‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt a thing yet but actually it is now even here. I can understand his insecurity from the UK market lol but he didn‚Äôt have to take it out on an aspiring third world kid.

My local mentor gaffer who encouraged me to bring a lightmeter to set to learn even if I wasn‚Äôt gaffing/DP wasn‚Äôt on this show unfortunately. Anyway the DP spoke to me quite softly but sternly, you know, in a British way, lol so it wasn‚Äôt a public reprimand but his tone was serious compared to his usual banter with his mates.

To this day I always try to be kind to newcomers and have a somewhat informal shadowing program where guys and gals can join my department if the production is ok with it to learn the ropes in lighting/grip.
I‚Äôm on Amazon looking for one right now and I‚Äôm an immigration lawyer.
You didn't really explain why the status quo was important to keep though.

Normally on set you'll be strict on who does what, so you don't risk having someone from one department fucking up the work of anothers. It keeps the set organized and efficient.

The lightmeter is just an instrument to measure brightness it's not going present a risk to any department, the DP was just insecure and close minded.

Now what you said about your father would indicate he does in fact care about status, which isn't necessarily wrong though.
Yeah he‚Äôs now a partner and has 2 jaguars and that one dodge with 700+ horsepower that he drives 1.5 miles to work in.
Thank you for this I‚Äôm new in a management position in construction with very high end clients and that makes a lot of sense thank you for the advice
That‚Äôs a ton of fucking bullshit just to do some goddamn business lmao. Such bitch behavior lol, imagine caring that much about what someone else wears.
Also in consultancy, often working with very large clients.  We'd often work with everybody in a company: factory workers, technologists, CEO etc. We normally took several outfits so we didn't stick out in the boardroom (best suits) or the labs (jeans) -- the women on the team told the men to *use* our outfits to send the messages we wanted to send.  And not accidentally send the wrong message.

Professionals in any sector need to look like their worth it, but not overpaid.  It's a fine line.
I was always taught to wear "one level" above the client (ie they wear jeans and a t shirt, you wear jeans and a polo. They wear polo shirts, you wear a button up with no tie, etc). That way you aren't outshining them or making them uncomfortable, but still have an aura of knowledge and professionalism.
Can confirm, have government suits, socks, shoes, tie, car, and watch.  Also useful when meeting with blue collar management.
You have the most reasonable comment in this entire thread. Covers all the bases. Just take the watch off next time, is that really a hill you‚Äôd die on?
I agree. On its head, its really:

"This accountant has managed his money so well he can afford that watch? Get him the fuck out of here. I don't want him managing mine."

What a fucking stupid take. This is why businesses fail.
We just want to hire auditors that produce the ‚Äúright‚Äù results cheaply.
To be honest, an independent audit is typically seen as a hoop up jump through. Management sees very little benefit and want it done for as little as possible. Many companies would gladly take a dirt poor auditor that was desperate and cheap to bribe.
If you guys don‚Äôt get optics then idk.

Yes, it is shitty as fuck. And gross. And exploitive. But have you met capitalism?

It‚Äôs why pretty receptionists are a thing. Studies literally show that they affect business deals. ‚ÄúOptimally‚Äù they need to be attractive enough to put people at ease, but not so pretty that they‚Äôre intimidating.

I *so* wish I was joking.
I feel called out. I wear a Snoopy watch to work.
Like this one?
https://www.omegawatches.com/watches/speedmaster/heritage-models/anniversary-series/silver-snoopy-award-50th-anniversary/product
Let me set the scene for you: it's 1993 and I'm upgrading my pager. I walk into the pager store and there's a poster on the wall for Motorola pagers. On the poster is a business man with a briefcase in a hurry. The tag line at the bottom says "it's 4:20, don't you want to know that your wife just had the baby?". That marketing guy must also have been a gardener because he sure WEEDS üòÇ


I asked the guy if I could have the poster and he said when the next one comes in. But I never went back to the pager store
Confirm I got this and an ice cream cone at graduation
I was supposed to get a ring?
Dang managers and their golden parachutes.
Which puts it selling brand new for about $16K USD right now. It's expensive for sure. But it's a reasonable heirloom watch or something a watch dude could save up for without being super wealthy. Customer and Boss are both Assholes.
> orjerks.

Whats an orjerk?
Sounds like a scene from American psycho
Yup, I‚Äôve complimented watches from a range of $30 - $250k. I cannot tell the difference between them other than whether I like the look of them or not.
Let‚Äôs see Paul Allen‚Äôs AD
yeah I thought about splurging on a watch when I came across some money but realized 1) this would be the reaction most people had 2) I still don't like stuff on my arm pinching my arm hair
I used to work with a guy who was a *serious* watch collector. He had 50+ watches, including a Patek Phillipe that was worth at least $50k, a half dozen Rolexes of various kinds, several Omegas, etc. 

He made about $80k/year, in 2015. But he didn‚Äôt drive a fancy car, or go on expensive vacations, he saved every penny he could scrounge for more watches. It also helped that he had inherited a fully paid off house, but still, watches were his ‚Äúthing,‚Äù so that‚Äôs what he did.
Come for the Rolies stay for the pizza parties
As a CEO making 16$ an hour, I won't get approved for a loan personally. My company would have to pony up it's stake in renting the land that it's on
Can't say the name of the company, but we actually had a client request that we do not wear suits when we go onsite, saying that the formal wear would intimidate their employees.
"My time is expensive, you should know"
And respond with "Do you want the local time or Tokyo?"

Hey I wanted to say I am so thankful for your approach, it‚Äôs people like you that made it possible for me to keep going and showing up, I have a mentor too and the ability to not feel afraid or stupid when asking him a question was so important. I‚Äôve made it a mission to break the old stereotypes of the GnE department. Also Aputure lights are changing the game with their approach and are on almost every set I step onto, apart from union, although I‚Äôve seen some here and there. Good luck man out there and congratulations on building out your package!

The big question is how the doctors referred to the staff. Did they use titles or just go with people's first names.


If it's different rules then it is all about enforcing status and making yourself feel good.


E.g. an officer in the military might go back rank and last name or sit/maam. But if they are a good officer they are doing the same for their ncos and soldiers. Give respect to get respect. Otherwise you are just an asshole.
As a car guy, I say burn it if you got it(as long as your other financial goals are on track).
Congrats on the new position!
I just prefer to have a small collection of different watches for different settings and wear the appropriate one after reading the situation. I feel naked without a watch, but I also know (as mentioned above) that optics are important.
My husband has the animated Snoopy face on his Apple Watch. When it senses water, snoopy wears a snorkel.
That's amazing! I know nothing about watches and thought,  "I'd love a watch like that. "

Did a Google search...I did not expect that kind of price tag.
This is an amazing watch!!
Now I have the wildest urge to find older marketing stuff like that where it's so obvious. :D
I make $55k a year and my wife makes $48k. The watch would be a wasteful spend for us but it‚Äôs affordable with some saving if it were what we liked. Definitely not an insanely expensive watch and is easily something family could gift or inherit. I wouldn‚Äôt think OP was trying to flex with that, however if he came in with a Rolex Sapphire Daytona (gorgeous watch) he‚Äôd be big flexing
That's me forgetting how improperly-configured vt100 terminals worked back in the '90s.............
*Exactly* like that.

Do you own a street food stand or something?
Ask em what color their Bugatti is
"My watch too"
Right say "time is money" and then conspicuously tap on the face of the watch with your middle finger. üòÇ
Best answer....my opinion is F them unless you were misbehaving.  Also watch needs a cleaning and new crystal.
Then pop both your collars and walk away.
One of those Ps definitely stands for Phiduciary.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr ImpossibleMacaron will be here all week.

I've got an old weston master, am I cool now?


I also have a seiko alpinist, am I also wealthy?
I love that! Worth the purchase price for that feature alone.
As a watch person, that‚Äôs what we in the watch community consider a grail-tier watch. Basically, the only way to get allocated a Snoopy at MSRP (10.6k) is if you already have a massive purchase history with the Omega boutique. And even then it could take you years to acquire one as they are very rare. Otherwise you will have to pay a ~$6k reseller premium on top of retail to acquire one sadly
Exactly. I have a buddy who's got a fairly wealthy grandpa. Grandpa gave him a Breitling for Bentley Flying B Chronograph in rose gold with a diamond bezel. That's not a watch he wears often because... shit's pricey and it shows. Honestly with a rolex like the OPs you have to know watches to know what it is and isn't. Which makes me think the most likely thing is the customer doesn't know watches and just thinks of Rolex as unreachable.
But would you wear $16k on your wrist?

I'd be too paranoid about damaging it.
Plus most watch nerds tend to only wear their holy grails on special occasions, and rather wear much less valuable "beaters" to work and other activities. I doubt OP considered this client meeting to be in the former category, lol.
Let's see Paul Allen's watch
"Boo-got-tiii"
And ask, "where does one get ones helicopter detailed around here?"
"Oh, this old thing? Yeah, it came with the Bugatti..."
Also, in your most pretentious voice - "So.... where do YOU summer?"
What colors their Bugatti are?
For the record I may act like a dick sometimes but I don‚Äôt have one‚Ä¶ Miss ImpossibleMacaron üòè
Please don't forget to tip your waitress...
True, but that didn't scan as well. üòÅ  Plus I'm still in denial.  Love me some Gordo!
It‚Äôs better to have an old one so you can flex on ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing this since you were knee-high to a grasshopper‚Äù
Exactly. You can get a Rolex for $5k. You can get a Rolex for $500k. You have to know Rolex to know the differences. I have been slowly learning them

The fuck
I got a patek as a wedding gift and I've worn it three times in ten years. It's so expensive... I am terrified to wear it ü•≤
Oh personally not with my current income. My $250 Apple Watch is almost too much. If it wasn‚Äôt so handy I wouldn‚Äôt wear it. I‚Äôm also conservative with spending money on clothes
Yeah that's my issue with crazy watches lol. I could see up to like a few thousand maybe and only for wearing out for events or work. But 5k+ fuck that what if I break it lol. 

I have a $80 g shock and a $350 smart watch looool.
Doesn't Bill Gates wear a Timex?
‚ÄúThis is art‚Äù
As much as I love all of these, you're all forgetting the most important thing a wealthy man needs. A personal ball washer. A woman, early to mid 20's, scrubbing and rinsing every 15 minutes. Because a wealthy man deserves to have his balls clean.

For those that don't understand the reference look up Lewis Black ball scrubber.

Aside from that OP, tell them you want a fancier watch to wear to clients. Possibly shit a gold brick for giggles.
Ooh, my apologies. From Miss SneakWhisper.
So you don't have one some times?
I hear ya. His music is still great and lives on.
hahaha. Yep. As I said, he doesn't wear it often.
Watches are meant to be worn bro. Take out insurance and rock it. Depending on the model most people wouldnt even recognize it

What other useful threads have you found?


PS: it's not about the post - it's the discussion that often contains the gold
I was just going to ask for nominations for a refreshed posting hall of fame list.... I'll review these but if you could give any reason why a given post stood out besides just being in the top post sort view of the sub...  I will consider said post.
I really liked this one:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/18r17fk/lessons\_learned\_one\_year\_after\_going\_live/](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/18r17fk/lessons_learned_one_year_after_going_live/) 

One of the key points in trading if algo or not is that you have to just go for it and go-live. The learning curve is much steeper if actual money (does not even need to be much) is involved from my point of view. Also you learn what spreads really do to your performance. A few years ago I tested minutely strategies on crypto. I found huge alpha (if our friend the market was perfect) but once including the tiniest spreads, the portfolio value went to zero in no time.
You are simply great ! I was lurking long time, of late stopped looking this sub (even reddit). You showed me how much I miss reading this blog. Started reading again.

Kudos to you.

Thanks for this one, found something so good wondering why its not on the top post
Thanks for putting this together
Great work
Not sure if this is the place to ask this question, but is the 10 karma for posting requirement 10 karma overall or for this subreddit? I want to post a package that parses SEC textual filings for NLP on r/algotrading.
hi, I'm new to this stuff, may I ask what is spreads ? thanks a lot
5 Months Update of Live Automated Tarding
5 Months update of Live Automated Trading

Hi everyone, following my initial post 5 months ago, ( https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/s/lYx1fVWLDI )  that a lot of you have commented, here is my 5 months update.



I‚Äôve been running my strategies live, and I‚Äôm pretty happy with the results so far. 
The only errors are due to human interaction (had to decide if I keep positions overnight or no, over weekends, etc‚Ä¶) and created a rule, so it should not happen anymore. 

5 past months:
+27.26%
Max drawdown: 4.71%
Sharpe Ratio: 2.54

I should be able to get even better results with a smarter capital splitting (currently my capital is split 1/3 per algo, 3 algos) 

I‚Äôll also start to work on Future contracts that could offer much bigger returns, but currently my setup only allows me to automatically trade ETFs.

Let me know what you think and if you have ideas to increase performance :) 

Nice! Looks like you are using IBKR, right? Sandbox or real thing? I've got an algo going with the Sandbox account, would be interested to see if you learned anything when moving from Sandbox to real - like with regards to unexpected fees, etc.
What's your beta vs SPY or QQQ? Seems like both QQQ and SPY have similar/higher sharpe in that time period.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ "Tarding"
Automated Tarding made me think I was in WSB for a minute.
Nice. That‚Äôs really good. How do you think that will hold up when we hit a bear market? Also, what platform is that?
I dont know. Your strategy returned almost 0% till the market began to FOMO and caused one of the best 4 months in historical term. If you just buy and hold you will get around the same return. It would be interesting to check the strategy in a whole different market condition.
Ahh, I remember my 1st 5 months live trading. Tbh man, squeeze the juice out of it while it's going well. Things can turn quickly and you can just as easily have 5mo of bad results. But if it continues like this then you might as well start raising capital. Keep it up and keep us posted when the market flips too.
Are you using a hard-coded strategy, or did you use some sort of machine learning algo? Congrats!
We prefer the term "regarding"
How do you automate? What platform and how do you code your strategies? 

Super cool and congrats
Impressive! Any literature you would suggest for the algo trading?
Wow!
Nice work! Thanks for sharing, always encouraging to reminder that other traders are profitable
Nice job, mate! What's your tech stacK?
I'm confused. I thought you were making tens of thousands per month. These live results are not consistent with your previous posts.
how many trades?
Where can I download DateTime data for:

- economic statistical releases
- FED Speeches
- Testimonys
- FOMC Meetings
- Board Meetings
- Beige Book
- Conferences

etc.

This data is extremely important and I can't seem to find a way to download it anywhere. I will pay a high price.
That‚Äôs amazing!
[deleted]
Yo thats awesome. Congrats. Hard work does pay off.
Nice, thanks for sharing
Not bad at all
Congrats! Looks pretty steady and drawdown isnt bad. You should be proud. How did your backtest do in 2018 and 2022? Besides 2008, they would be good years to test against. Personally I think 1/1/2018 until now are great for backtesting.
LFG Jerry! Been following you since first post. I was wondering if live trading has affected your winrate??

Keep it up!
I made a note to myself to check with you in 5 more months.
Nice
nice bro!
Nice drawdown. You can easily get a leverage of 5 and still be very safe. In that case, your return would be 130%.
La
what platform do you use?
Did you write the script?
Really nice. I‚Äôm in a very similar position. Currently walking forward a TV script on live account of very similar balance. 

My performance started well but hit a drawdown so decided to simplify and use a new exit method that greatly removes the chance of overfitting. Currently in the process of forward testing. 

Will DM as would love to share progress and get some feedback
what strategy do you use brother?
Trying to get into automated trading myself im a strong  coder but got no clue about trading strategies any suggestions?
What's your performance after taxes?

How do (or would you) calculate that as you go along aside from end of year statements from IBKR?
Nice
Long/short? Long only? Equities/options/futures? What's the market beta of this strategy? When I start a new strategy I like to take monthly returns and compare their standard deviations to the ones in the backtest
I might be missing something but the math doesn‚Äôt seem to work out. Starting at $25.6, a return of 27% should put you at a NAV of $32.5k
I break even with my tarding, I guess thats not a win, but not a loss either.
looks great!
Would you mind sharing your tech stack?
No compounding of capital right?
Impressive result man! Curious to say how it would perform with futures
Very nice!
This is awesome. I'm a complete noob here, any suggestions or tips on how to get started?
Great job you outperformed my discretionary Shape by .2 üòÑ
What strategy do you use?
Is this subreddit and thread just to post about automated trading in a show but not tell fashion? Or is it actually to provide insightful value on strategies and algo setups to include things like what the strat is, how it works, preferences and parameters? Otherwise who does it benefit other than a brag of sorts, in which case may be better for Twitter imo
Tarding can make you retarded. Dont tard folks. Sounds like a wsb word. Should go viral.
thats called lazy traders :( doing automated . ü§°ü§°, work the tf hard bro.
Bump!
same
At that time yes, but I backtested it on bear markets too, and very similar results
Lol
lol, I love it! I now have a new name for roughly 99% of my strategies!
Autotard regard
I was wondering if that was intentional, lol.
Lol no
I backtested it on bear markets too, similar results. Platform is IBKR
[my performance vs TQQQ](https://imgur.com/a/i26sPQD) Correlation of the past few weeks:
TQQQ: +0.91%
My portfolio: +17.32%

Here is why I don‚Äôt buy and hold
I‚Äôve been trading for more than 15 years :) I raise my capital, currently selling assets and relocating to a more tax-friendly place
I‚Äôm not American, sorry for language issues
Tradingview, Capitalise, and IBKR
Don't wanna be a party pooper or anything, but the markets been on a tear since last October. QQQ is up 27% since October too with a super small max drawdown like 4% too. It's been a smooth number go always up kind of environment lately. Since OP mentions trading ETFs as the strategy I wonder if there is anything substantially different here compared to just buy and hold.
Ten thousands by months? Why? Last posts were all backtests of $100k
Have to check the total, usually 0-3 trades per day
Have you checked tiingo's calendar API?
FRED API
this
Thank you for the support. Not much, I'm still between 75 to 85% win rate depending on algos, pretty happy with it
Past 5 months a leverage of 5 would have been very safe on QQQ too. In fact TQQQ is up +100% since last October with only small drawdowns, but it's not like it's going to be forever like this.
Ibkr
Yes
Mine, I created it 2 years ago and optimized it
Google ¬´¬†Quantified strategies¬†¬ª you‚Äôll find a lot of ideas of strategies ideas it‚Äôs awesome.

However to start I suggest you to code a classic investment strategy like Buy and hold on ETF. The strategy performance will be your benchmark for all your next strategies you will develop. üôÇ
I‚Äôm currently moving to a low tax country‚Ä¶
I did withdraws
That‚Äôs a very good thing, keep it up!
No compounding, I trade with the same amount and withdraw profits once in a while
Thank you, I‚Äôm currently working on this because profits would be much higher, but I have currently no way to automate my trades with futures. 
Backtests and paper trading on NQ are great
I use mine, I created it 2 years ago and worked to optimize it
Edges in automated trading disappear when they become widely known. This sub discusses general strategy ideas but no one is going to go into detail. Strategies in manual trading are much more subjective and not as systematic so people in this area don't mind sharing.
Yeah...
you're so misguided

I hope you wake up from that 'grind' mindset and realize you're being used like a tool
When you run your back test against the period you have been live, do you get the same results as the live portfolio?
Nice.
Sweet. I've been trading for about 10yr. What's your retirement strategy?
How do I get started and learning about it?
It's ok ... I was joking about your misspelled word "tarding"
My apologies
Could you elaborate a bit more? I currently trade with TV and IBRK, and I'm also a software developer, so I've been thinking of trying some algo trading.
Either way, hitting a button to take advantage of whatever tear the market is currently on is something I‚Äôd entertain
You‚Äôre right, but the strategy is not much correlated to the performance of the index
Yea I guess I misinterpreted your results. I thought you had profited 100k over 78 trades. I spent a few days reading all of your comments and trying to replicate your strategy on TQQQ thinking you had found a grail, haha. 

Still, this is impressive. Great job. Let's see how it does when the market turns.
that's some pretty robust performance. good stuff
I used the TradingView strategy optimiser as you recommended for my TQQQ, results have improve a lot! Only risking 2% per trade. Profit is great but sharpe low (0.6) and winrate also low (41%). Would you help me review it??

2 year backtest on 5min charts:

[https://imgur.com/a/fHbN7ZK](https://imgur.com/a/fHbN7ZK)
Yes, but it does not always go up. Many times, it goes down. That's why we design algos.
Is it still trend + stochastic?
What models did you use bro?
Nice one. Whats your win rate % and profit factor at?
Yes 95% similar results. The thing is I never put 100% of capital into one strategy so of course final result is a little bit lower with mixed strategies
I‚Äôm currently selling my assets and moving a a tax friendly country
I also apologise, I at times words wrong too
I send TV webhooks to Capitalise app that send orders to IBKR. 
My next goal is to directly connect to the IBKR API to have a better control and being able to trade futures too
That button is called NVDA calls üòÇ
Index up 27%. Your strategy up 27%. Yeah, sure, absolutely no correlation there...
Backtest with 100k are profitable by 100k in a year, (between 90 and 110%) depending on strategies, that‚Äôs why you were thinking this :) I‚Äôll be able to trade with more than 100k in one or 2 months so we‚Äôll see..
Thank you
Looks good! You can also try on different time frames, or add some filters to avoid false signals
Yes, still the same strategy
Winrate 79-85% depending on algos (I run 3) and profit factor between 4-4.6
If you're a US citizen, that will only work if you renounce your US citizenship
Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick
Oof dangerous depending on those webhooks.

They've costed me a lot in the past
Haha fr !! It‚Äôs like using Oddjob with the golden gun in 007
2 different things, I wouldn‚Äôt be confident to put all my money on a ETF and wait‚Ä¶ 
I can sleep in peace
[Perf vs TQQQ](https://imgur.com/a/i26sPQD) Correlation of the past few weeks:
TQQQ: +0.91%
My portfolio: +17.32%
how is it going now?
I‚Äôm sold! How can I do this?
Have you shared any more details or won‚Äôt be?
That's super impressive. You mainly sticking to regular Indicators or do you run your own custom indicators/I corporate some ML/AI?

I have some similar results (from back tests) using a few indicators
Absolutely not US citizen
That's not true. You can move to us virgin islands and be virtually tax free, like 4%.
Really? What kind of issue did you get?
Wow!  that's a Good Reference from the Past
How's that two different things. Let's wait until there's more choppy waters and QQQ is down 10%+ in a month. Your strategy will probably be down a similar amount too.
Pretty strong
It‚Äôs a custom indicator I made, combining few regular indicators, no ML yet
Late hooks, sometimes no hooks.

Maybe they've fixed it up but I would get some hooks an hour late
Not at all, you can check my previous posts from 6 months ago with years of backtests
Backtest is a fancy word for overfitting, let's wait and see until it actually trades a choppy market with real money. Please report back once VIX spikes for more than a month. Not trying to be condescending here, I'm genuinely interested in your results. It's just that the past 5 months are probably not a reliable estimate of future performance, it's been almost too easy lately.

Have you back tested on the last few months and compared it to your live results? Getting backtests to not overfit and be an accurate estimate of live trading is challenging.
I've been working in this quant industry for 10 years and billions of dollars. Not a single person that knows what they are doing uses backtests as a core component in their process.
Sure, I‚Äôm not bragging or anything, just sharing my work :)
Your the type of person that will see a person walk on water and say it‚Äôs because he can‚Äôt swim
I 100% believe you, but as long as it works‚Ä¶
> Not a single person that knows what they are doing uses backtests as a core component in their process.

What do they use?
have sound methodology for your signals with structural and theoretical justification with an excellent pre-existing risk framework; evaluate quality live with walk forward.

day to day work is always in improving parts of the stack ie. infra, methodology, new data/information sources. if your system doesn't work you have a methodology issue.

what it doesn't look like is trying a bunch of different shit in backtests. it doesn't look like binary rules-based strategies, forming a portfolio by allocating 33% to three random signals, it doesn't look like ranked lists of stocks or screeners, it doesn't look like fixed sizings, it doesn't look like some perfect combination of TA chart stuff.

you design the full end-to-end stack from first principles with zero backtesting involved and then you test in live walkforward. if its not working you keep working on the stack (still from first principles). you might backtest batches at the very end once your already running live to see what kind of DDs/profile you could expect in certain regimes (for your full system) and determine if your future work should go towards supplementing with a high skew strategy etc.
